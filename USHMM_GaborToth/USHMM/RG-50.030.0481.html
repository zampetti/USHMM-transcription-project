id="s11">Q: Good morning, Diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: It’s nice to see you finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I’m happy to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s16">Wh-What is your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, if you want to know how they baptized me, it was Berendina Roelofina Hendrika Eman.</span> <span id="s18">And I was only five pounds, I think that’s a crime to a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Five pounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s21">I think that’s a crime to a baby.</span> <span id="s22">But my mom lost her mother when she was 11, and then she got a stepmother who brought them up, they had five kids, and they got still from the second marriage.</span> <span id="s23">So she thought when I was born, and she didn’t think she would get -- I was seven years after the other kids.</span> <span id="s24">Sh -- I thought I would be the last one, so she named me after her stepmother, Berendina.</span> <span id="s25">And then she thought, “I should honor my real mother, too, Roelofina.”</span> <span id="s26">And out of that second marriage she had a baby sister that she adored, Hendrika, so I’m stuck with thro -- three names.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: So how did Diet come?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Now, then -- in the Netherlands, little kids always the name ends in an E, that means you’re little, that -- they chop that off i -- if you’re big.</span> <span id="s29">But they called me Dinie, Berendina, Dinie, chopped off.</span> <span id="s30">And then, to their big surprise, 13 months later there came a little brother, and we were always together, and one day an aunt picked me up, and I was away the whole day, and he was crying the whole day, and he just started talking, Dietdee, Dietdee, Dietdee, and they didn’t know what -- what he wanted.</span> <span id="s31">But when I was brought back, Dietdee, and then they knew he called me Dietdee, so then I was Dietdee, and then it was they co -- chopped off -- you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: They chopped off the E.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: -- and -- Diet, and when you write it our way, here they call me Diet, so -- because that’s how you write it.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: But it’s really Diet, is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Now -- in the -- in the Netherlands --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: In the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: -- it’s an E, that’s how you say the E, Diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Now you’ve had a number, although I don’t want the stories associated with it, but you’ve had a number of -- of false names.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Oh yeah, a whole bunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Yes, ho-how many did you have, three, four?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yeah, I think -- it depends with which group, if I thought that my name was getting -- but all of us in the Resistance had false names.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: False names.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: And with some I was Toos, and with some I was Dinako, that is another abbreviation.</span> <span id="s44">And then I left there, and I was -- I was nearly arrested on the name of ar -- I had to find another name again, that they knew my false name.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: That’s when you became --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: And then I thought -- the guy who made the false papers, he said, “What do you want to be your name?”</span> <span id="s47">I said, “Well, I’ll take the name of the queen, Wilhemina.”</span> <span id="s48">And that’s the name I was arrested on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s50">I want to know something about your family.</span> <span id="s51">You had three siblings, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s53">Two much older, that were the big ones, and we were the little ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And Albert?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Albert is the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Is the youngest.</span> <span id="s57">So he was the one who was calling you Dietdee, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Dietdee, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And Stephana?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: He is 13 months younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: He was how much, thir -- thir --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: He was 13 months younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: 13 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: We are very close, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Really close.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: And Stephana, Fanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Stephanie, yeah, Fanny, they say Stephanie.</span> <span id="s69">No, in the Netherlands you say Stephana, but here it would be Stephanie, and then I had a brother after that, and he had an old Dutch name, Arjen, A-r-j-e-n, Arjen, it’s a beautiful old Dutch name.</span> <span id="s70">So they had both of one name, and then Albert came, and he only has one, and I am stuck with those three.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And what was the difference in age between you and Fanny, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: My oldest sister was eight years older, and then -- so seven years with my other brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s74">And what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Gerrit, G-e-r-r-i-t, Gerrit.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Herrit with a G.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: That’s difficult to say here, because I think it’s the translation of Gerald, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Johanna Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Johanna Maria, that’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And what did you father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: He had an interior decorating business, he was wallpapering, and floor covering, and he had a man who did all the upholstery, and he did everything in interior decorating, and he had people working for him, and he loved it, because I remember in -- when he was in his 80’s -- you know, loads of people say that you die -- if I would come back, I would be something different.</span> <span id="s84">And I said -- Father was in his 80’s, I said, “Dad, if you would come back?”</span> <span id="s85">He said, “I would go exactly the same.”</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: He loved his work.</span> <span id="s88">And he was recommended by a very well known architect, and that architect worked for the lower nobility, you know, we still had dukes, and earls, and whatever.</span> <span id="s89">And he always recommended my dad, so he had [indecipherable] royal library, my father always had.</span> <span id="s90">In the summer they closed it, they had to check the curtains and everything, so -- he had a good business.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So he o -- he owned the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Y -- he started it as a young guy, and just --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: -- because he loved his work, so he gave quality --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: -- work, and they recommended.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And did your mother work as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Mom took the phone calls, but Mom -- she had four kids, and at the time you ha -- didn’t have laundry machines, or you didn’t have all the stuff we have, so it was a full time job.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Were you comfortable financially during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: We had -- we were not wealthy, but we were comfortable, we never had -- except for the war, hunger, or whatever.</span> <span id="s101">No, it was -- we had a good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did you want --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: They sent us -- we had music lessons, and you know, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: You played piano, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yeah, I -- I was not very talented, but Mom insisted all four of us had to take -- my brother is really good, he can play any instrument he sees.</span> <span id="s106">He could be a professional cellist.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: He plays beautiful, oh.</span> <span id="s109">And that was his life, but you know, then he wanted to go professional, but people said to him -- now, he studied for fun six hours a day, forget it.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, I thought an hour study every day at piano was already long enough, after all the schoolwork.</span> <span id="s111">But he just loved it.</span> <span id="s112">And -- but they said, “Now it is your love, and then it becomes your work.”</span> <span id="s113">So then he went for awhile in Father’s business, but he didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s114">And he is now -- he studied psychology, and then he married a girl that got a job in Sweden, in a -- in -- she was dietician, and Anthroposophy, that is the study of Rudolph Steiner, they believe in reincarnation, and that is what they are.</span> <span id="s115">And then he went to work there, and it’s all what he knew.</span> <span id="s116">He made -- now he -- he got higher up, and higher up, and then a father of a kid -- they -- they had lots of kids from other countries, in Scandinavia Anthroposophy is very big, and there was a Danish girl there, and at one point there was trouble in Sweden, he was in Sweden, and they -- th -- they were [indecipherable] to him, and he said, you know, you start something like this in Denmark, and he did.</span> <span id="s117">And he started with six kids, and now it’s one of the biggest things, and the government asks, take our kids, take our kids, and it has grown.</span> <span id="s118">But he has only the very severest mentally handicapped children, who miss a part of their brain.</span> <span id="s119">And they have taught them everything.</span> <span id="s120">I mean, it’s as in the Bible, everybody has a gift, and those kids just as well.</span> <span id="s121">And one is musical, and another one can paint, and another one have[ indecipherable] things, silversmithing, they do everything.</span> <span id="s122">And they have an artist staff, and my brother directs, and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s123">There’s -- the -- the television theme, and the radio themes [indecipherable] were playing for us.</span> <span id="s124">They do not Mary had a little lamb, but they do the children’s symphony of Haydn, and none of those kids can read a note of music, I said, “How do you do it?”</span> <span id="s125">He says, “Come along.”</span> <span id="s126">And then he has a teacher who plays flute, and the kids who want to play flute, look, and they play and they make a few mistakes when the teacher is playing, and the second time they do much better, and the fourth time they playing without any mistake, and so all the instruments, and then they do it together.</span> <span id="s127">No, it’s terrific, what he does.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Te -- tell me about your parents, what were they like as people, and being your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: My father had a terrific sense of humor.</span> <span id="s130">And he was such an honest businessman.</span> <span id="s131">I only had very good examples, because you know, when the war broke out, the Germans took everything to Germany, but my father had a big supply of drapes, and whatever, he had a big supply.</span> <span id="s132">And then all the others, you know, they raised their prices, they could just double it, or what.</span> <span id="s133">My father said, “I’ve worked 30 years for those people,” and he just put his normal thing.</span> <span id="s134">So I saw that he was not out for money, he was for honesty, and he loved his customers.</span> <span id="s135">And Mom, Mom was his sweetheart, and the -- I mean, it was a real -- they were 64 years married when they finally died, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: 64 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah, 64 years.</span> <span id="s138">And I can only say she was always, you know, benda -- baker came at the door, and the milkman came at the door, and the man for the benzena -- you had those little things, or whatever, it’s not gasoline, kerosene, came at the door, and then in the war, there were no cars, I mean it was with a horse and a -- and a cart, and when it was ice cold, Mom always said, do you want a cup of hot coffee, or hot chocolate, or something.</span> <span id="s139">So I had good examples.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So did you spend a lot of time with your parents, were they with you a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Father was very busy, because in the spring especially, everybody wanted Eman, sometimes that he left the house at six, and came home at 10.</span> <span id="s142">So we always had our hot meal in the evening, if Father would be home.</span> <span id="s143">But he tried every time -- it’s his own business, it’s difficult to break out, but I remembered it for a long time when we were early teeners, that he tried always to be home Friday or Saturday night, and then we did games and things, and we could invite our friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: And the other -- our house was always the center of young people, and we had an organ, and the piano, and the cello, so there was a lot of classical music.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: You had an organ and a piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Piano, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: An upright piano, or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: An upright piano, it was a very [indecipherable] Steinbach.</span> <span id="s150">And the organ, that were those Dutch, little -- that you still had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: That worked with the foot, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: So -- but we had that, and we all had to learn music, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So you -- you would say your childhood was a very joyous one?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And you were close with your --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Parents.</span> <span id="s157">Now, when you are early teen, you know, you get rebellious --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: -- and you -- you -- and I remember that if we had a mood, you know, if you came down, and you are in a bad mood, and Mom would just kindly say, “Oh, we don’t loo -- want to look at that face.</span> <span id="s160">Go back to your room, and come back when you can have a [indecipherable] face.”</span> <span id="s161">And then you got back and you say, “What am I doing [indecipherable] thing?</span> <span id="s162">It was very -- you know, but when you a teenager, you sometimes become difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s164">And school, did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I was a straight A student, it came all easy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s169">It came easy to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: And mostly this in languages or what we call [indecipherable], what is it?</span> <span id="s171">Sciences.</span> <span id="s172">But I could -- I -- I think that God gave me a good speller.</span> <span id="s173">Brains [indecipherable] brains, it was all very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did you have favorite subjects?</span> <span id="s175">Was language it -- were --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: The languages were my favorite, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Was your favorite.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: And we had -- it was like I told you, every day an hour in each language, French, German, English and Dutch, and for the finals you had to -- to read 10 books in each original language, so 10 in French, and -- and you had to memorize three poems, and not Mary had a little lamb, but of Longfellow, or something, in each language.</span> <span id="s179">[indecipherable] from the Germans.</span> <span id="s180">And our exams were not [indecipherable] the school, they had -- you had the parochial schools, the Christian schools, and the public schools.</span> <span id="s181">And I lived in The Hague, and when it was exam time, it was June, then -- or July, then, this section of The Hague, whatever school you were, had to come to a big gimnasium, and there were all tables, and the papers were face down, and government guys from the Department of Education, they were walking -- you were not to talk, you were not allowed to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s182">The bell rang, and then you could turn your paper, and then you had so much time for that subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And you enter the next subject.</span> <span id="s185">And you have two days in writing, and then one day oral, and the oral was three weeks later, mostly, after the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s186">And it was also for government guys, [indecipherable] and then you came in the gym, and there were all little round tables, three guys sitting, French, English, German, math, geometry, geography, and history, and then each half an hour.</span> <span id="s187">And you came to the French table, and then they said, “Which books have you read?”</span> <span id="s188">So you have to sh -- in French, and then you have to show it.</span> <span id="s189">And they said in French, tell that and that episode out of that and that book.</span> <span id="s190">And you had to do it in French, which is very hard, you know?</span> <span id="s191">And so we’re -- and then this poem, and then you have to recite the poem.</span> <span id="s192">So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: I realize I forgot to ask you two questions.</span> <span id="s194">One, what’s the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: April 30th, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: 1920.</span> <span id="s197">And you were born in The Hague?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: In The Hague.</span> <span id="s199">And that was also the birthday of our crown princess, Juliana.</span> <span id="s200">So -- and then all the flags were out, and the schools were closed, and every morning there were parades, and my Mom always told me, “That’s for you.”</span> <span id="s201">You know, it was the big disappointment when I found out it was for Juliana.</span> <span id="s202">But I was still happy that I was born on her birthday, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s204">Tell me from -- I read your autobiography, and the place of religion in your life is really extremely significant, or maybe it’s just God, I don -- I don’t quite know how to --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: So if you can tell me about your - the way in which you were raised in terms of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Now, we went to church, and our denomination, Christian Reformed has two services, but my parents said one time we want you to go, the second time, you may.</span> <span id="s208">So there was no to force like some parents do.</span> <span id="s209">And they always, you know, you went to catechism, and you learned the Bible, and it was really a life thing, you know, and you had to -- and I still think, I mean words are cheap, but then you have to do, and that’s why I went -- we all went in Rothenberg, and I’m really proud because after the war, years later, I had to go -- in the Netherlands after the war, the queen made a new department, like you have here, agriculture, and to -- now whatever, all the departments.</span> <span id="s210">And our queen said we have a department of war documentation.</span> <span id="s211">And usually th-they still were looking for witnesses, and by chance they found me in America, and I could help a little bit, so I was asked to come to the Netherlands, and I spoke to the big shot from this war documentation, and he told me that our denomination, Christian Reformed, and it’s really small, were the highest in resistance, and also had given most of their lives.</span> <span id="s212">And I think we are very principled.</span> <span id="s213">And sometimes it goes to the -- too stiff, you know, that -- but that you have to want.</span> <span id="s214">But it was really [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Is -- is Christian Reformed a part of a -- the Protestant religion, or is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: It is?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: The Reformed -- the state church in the Netherlands is Reformed, and then automatically, like in England, the queen and the king are the head of the church.</span> <span id="s219">And at one point, I think in the 1800’s, there were people who said yeah, but if you are born a king or a queen, doesn’t make you a Christian.</span> <span id="s220">So they said, well, that’s not right.</span> <span id="s221">And then there were other things, a few more, I don’t know exactly what, so they separated from -- but it’s very close, it’s only that -- you know, the [indecipherable] and we have been very lucky, because our fe -- our royal family are Christians and they are always members of the Reformed church.</span> <span id="s222">But it’s very close to the Reformed church, but it’s smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: But Christian Reform is not the Reformed church, it’s a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: It is a branch --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: A branch --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: -- that broke off from the Reformed church.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: And how would you characterize Christian Reform, and ho-how does one differentiate that from --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Now, they are very biblical.</span> <span id="s229">See, because I know here in America the Baptists honor the New Testament, because they say that’s the time that Jesus was born.</span> <span id="s230">But the Christian Reformed see it, it was a fulfillment of the Old Testament, or the Torah, as the Jewish people say.</span> <span id="s231">So we had really to study the whole Bible, and at our meals, I mean every day, and Father always started each meal with prayer, because if you read the Bible, when Jesus ate, it always said, “And Jesus, looking up, thanked God for the meal,” and then he started eating.</span> <span id="s232">So, I mean, it’s practically putting up, and I remember that our breakfast could be that we had to go out in -- in -- you know, my brother, maybe to leave earlier for school, and Father sometimes left at six, but the [indecipherable] meal was always that we sat at the table.</span> <span id="s233">And then my brother, who is the cellist, is studying, and we -- we had a l-large house, and he was on the third floor, in the music room.</span> <span id="s234">And then we all sat at table and Father wanted to say a prayer, and Albert wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s235">So they go out, “Albert, you have to come, Father is sitting.”</span> <span id="s236">You know, I felt like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s237">And then he did the few, and he forgot it, and we had to call him again, so -- but then, we had had our hot meal, and then Father always pulled the Bible out and read a small part of the Bible.</span> <span id="s238">He skipped what I call the dull part, you know, this one begat that, begat that, begat that --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: But -- so we knew the Bible, and every [indecipherable] it was a sacrifice that they sent us to the Christian school, they said, “If we don’t support it, they don’t.”</span> <span id="s241">So every Monday morning, had to learn the psalm that you had Sunday.</span> <span id="s242">The parents were [indecipherable] if the kids [indecipherable] for Monday morning, you had to say your -- what you had to memorize.</span> <span id="s243">And looking back, you know, then you hated it, but in the camp, and in the prison --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: It helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: You -- it -- I knew so many things by heart, and it came, and it was such a strength, and a hope for me.</span> <span id="s246">I’m really grateful for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: But when you were growing up, you were not always so --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, sometimes you thought, oh, you know -- but -- and -- and you had pastors who could keep your attention, and some your -- I remember that I -- we had a church that had a roof, an all wooden, beautiful wood, and then they [indecipherable] just to decorate it, and I was counting.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: You were counting.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yeah, that was -- if it was not an interesting sermon, but I think orchids do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: You mentioned that you had a big house.</span> <span id="s252">How -- how big, because the -- the houses that I saw, at least in Amsterdam --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No, no, th-they -- it was when we lived in The Hague, my Mom -- my Mom’s father was a pilot in -- a pilot at sea, you know, to bring the ships in.</span> <span id="s254">And he was always at sea, and a lot of our family were seafarers.</span> <span id="s255">So I think Mom brought a bit, and she always wanted to meet, but that’s not good for a business.</span> <span id="s256">So then I think we moved west from a house to a bigger house, and that was very interesting, it was all -- it had steps, and then a platform, and then there were two doors, and the right one was ours.</span> <span id="s257">But on the other side, where the street was, it had steps down, and there was souterrain, and -- it’s called.</span> <span id="s258">And then you had -- came in the -- the lower floor, and there was Father’s work store, and there was a big family kitchen like the farmers have, and the -- behind it was a -- a yard.</span> <span id="s259">And we had -- they made a little pond in it, and we had little goldfishes.</span> <span id="s260">And then the first floor had in front, the room where the organ and the piano were, and in the back, the living room.</span> <span id="s261">The second floor was Father’s and Mother’s bedroom, and the room where my Father received his customers, and then the floor up there, there were the girl’s bedroom, and the boy’s bedroom, and there was an attic.</span> <span id="s262">So it was more height, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And then, at the end of the yard, there was a ya -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s265">It was not a river, it was much smaller, but it was a little stream, and behind that there was a big -- how you call it here, now?</span> <span id="s266">[indecipherable], a big -- I think this is called a kaserne.</span> <span id="s267">All -- the cavalry, the horses were there, and that was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: A barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Armory, armory.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Oh, ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: And that was where we loved it, because it was, you know, open, and space, and trees.</span> <span id="s272">But in the morning, he [indecipherable] from the [indecipherable] and then -- and sometimes you heard the horses, I loved it, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did you have pets?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: We had two -- we had two cats, and a dog.</span> <span id="s277">And later I got two turtles, one was called Ole Tuft, that’s a Norwegian name, and the other one, was [indecipherable] the time of Ethiopia was Haile Salas.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And so you called it Haile Salas?</span> <span id="s279">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: And I think I was nine, and I was always brushing the dog, and also push -- polishing his teeth, and anyway -- and I felt so neglectful that I never did anything for those turtles, and when I called them, they stuck their neck out, and they had -- so I took furniture polish, and I polished them, and they were so beautiful shiny, and three days later they were dead, and my father said that I had clogged up all their pores.</span> <span id="s281">But I think they were beautiful in their deaths.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Better in death, that’s -- were most of your friends of the same religious denomination that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: We lived in that street, and we were all teeners, and we had such a fun [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s284">A little bit further lived a family with three boys, and we were all -- so you had -- yeah, in Germany, the stuff was getting -- is Hitler, so one of the boys then turned out to be a Nazi, and the oldest was a Communist, and the in-between was in-between.</span> <span id="s285">And so they were different, and of course, was another couple, a young girl, and her brother, her older brother, Paul and Jopie and they -- they were nothing, and now they were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: In -- in The Hague, were there -- were there many Jews living in The Hague?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: There were.</span> <span id="s289">Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: We had a large Jewish quarter, with synagogues, and very beautiful old synagogue there was, there were a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s291">But you know, that is the beautiful thing of the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s292">In [indecipherable] they were persecuted in Portugal and Spain, and they were killed and burned by the Inquisition.</span> <span id="s293">And in England you can read the books, that they look down upon the Jews.</span> <span id="s294">Germany definitely, Austria definitely, France also a little bit.</span> <span id="s295">And [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s296">So they came, and in those years, loads of them came to the Netherlands, and they said -- you know.</span> <span id="s297">And so we had loads of German Jews, and -- no, of Dutch Jews who had been there for centuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s299">So they were -- they were very integrated in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Very integrated -- because I was working at a bank later, when I had my first job next to Herman and [indecipherable] -- he was Jewish, but later he told me he didn’t even know it, his parents didn’t do anything on their religion.</span> <span id="s301">But we had so many Jewish people, and y -- that didn’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And did you grow up, and have friends who were -- who were Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Who were not Christians, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And there was not -- there was not a problem between --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: You didn’t even think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: They were your friends, or they were not your friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Right, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: -- you liked them, or you did not like them, but it was the only [indecipherable], you know, it was no difference, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: So, when you were 13 years old, and Hitler comes to power in Germany, are you -- are you very conscious politically at that age, or is --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, at 13, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: No.</span> <span id="s313">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: And then Hitler was in the beginning, you know, he started in Bavaria, and so on, and we heard about it, and we really thought well, a big screamer.</span> <span id="s315">We already knew he had a big mouth, and he was always screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: But then h-he grew in power, and then when Hindenburg gave over, I mean then he was the boss, and then we realized.</span> <span id="s318">But I -- then we started to realize, but still not to the extent that it really --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: -- we really were made aware by the danger -- we heard that the Hitler youth was, and I was [indecipherable] vacation, I think was 15 or 16, at the eastern part of the Netherlands, we were somewhere at the farm, and that we learned -- we had lots of friend -- with my two girlfriends, and we were biking, and the border was not controlled, it was close to the border, and we met a couple of German kids, germ -- and they were in the Hitler youth, and they were fanatic, and fanatic.</span> <span id="s321">And I was surprised, I thought aw, you know.</span> <span id="s322">But my girlfriends were open for it, they listened, and they were very impressed.</span> <span id="s323">And then later, in ’38, so it was maybe two years later, you know it, that Kristallnacht, that those -- and in the he -- at that time, I remember in the papers, they pretended that it was a spontaneous uprising of the young people against those Jews who are doing all this criminal whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: But it wasn’t, it was very organized, but [indecipherable] later -- that turned out later that they found that.</span> <span id="s326">So, and then yeah, they killed so many Jews, and they took prisoners, and they burned the synagogues, and that is when really we were aware of the danger of the Nazi [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So it was 1938 when you became --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: ’38.</span> <span id="s329">November nine was the Kristall --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Right, right, but a year before that, somebody comes and lives with your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: -- a person who becomes very significant to you.</span> <span id="s333">Can you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: That was funny, because my parents always tried to help everybody, and what do you call it in the church, the guy that takes care that the ha -- is clean, and whatever, the janitor --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Janitor?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s337">He didn’t clean himself, but that was a couple without kids, and they once in awhile came to visit us.</span> <span id="s338">They had no children, and my parents invited them now and then.</span> <span id="s339">So one day they ask if he wanted to come, and he talks to my parents, and he said, “I have a friend, a Friesian,” they were often [indecipherable] and they’re very proud, and he says, “And he lost his wife, and he has 10 kids, and now the oldest has gotten a job in The Hague,” with -- they start with paying so little.</span> <span id="s340">See, now the kids go either in the dorms, or in an apartment or something.</span> <span id="s341">But there was no way at that time.</span> <span id="s342">So he asked if that guy could come in our house, and my mother said, “I can’t have a boarder.”</span> <span id="s343">She had [indecipherable], the phone was always ringing, and people came that they wanted to talk to my dad, and she was very busy, and you had no laundry machines, no nothing.</span> <span id="s344">So she said, “No, I can’t.”</span> <span id="s345">And then he said oh, but -- well, you know.</span> <span id="s346">So in the end, my father says, “I need to talk to Wilmer, that’s her decision.</span> <span id="s347">She has a,” -- and then in the end my mom said, “I can’t have a boarder, but I can have another child.”</span> <span id="s348">So he ca -- and I was so furious because The Hague is very old city, and you know, the -- the houses at that time didn’t have a shower and a bathroom.</span> <span id="s349">I mean, you had a toilet, but that -- you had everywhere those -- what do you call it, those basins when -- where you washed yourself, and Saturday night you could either go to a public bathhouse, that you had to pay, or you could wash yourself from top to toe, but that was -- at that time, it was 1938 and so.</span> <span id="s350">And then, with my brothers, my -- at that time, in ’38, my oldest brother had already left for Indonesia, he -- he was in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s351">Anyway, you ran in your house in your underwear, and in your slip, and whatever, and that were your brothers, but if you have a strange guy, you have to put your gown on, and it’s totally different.</span> <span id="s352">So I just hated it, to have -- and he had a nice -- I didn’t want an intruder in the house.</span> <span id="s353">And then I was so angry, I think, that I didn’t speak to my mom for days.</span> <span id="s354">And then she said I am so angry about it [indecipherable], I hate it.</span> <span id="s355">And I thought, well, I’m going to dislike this guy, I mean, he’s an intruder in our house, and I thought -- his name was Hein, now that is a farmer’s name, I hated it.</span> <span id="s356">And I thought in -- in the Netherlands -- in here it is beautiful, but in the Netherlands it was horrible if you had red hair.</span> <span id="s357">Then they called you carrot top, or all the lighthouses had red -- or a lighthouse.</span> <span id="s358">So the kids really unmercifully [indecipherable], and mostly they had freckles, of course.</span> <span id="s359">And then you’ll see he has a red hair, and freckles, and boo -- and I was so -- I thought, well, I don’t like him.</span> <span id="s360">And then, he would --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Wait a minute, I’m -- I’m afraid we’re going to have to continue this after we stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s363">That he broke your heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So we were talking about Hein coming to your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: What -- what -- his name is Hein, and his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: H-e-i-n, Hein.</span> <span id="s371">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: It’s Hein.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: -- in -- in Dutch we say Hein.</span> <span id="s374">And I think like in German, you have Heinrich, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: That’s a German name, so this is -- and it’s a name in Friesland, that’s in the northern part, and he was from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Sietsma, S-i-e-t-s-m-a, Sietsma.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Sietsma.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: All the Friesian names end of ma or sta.</span> <span id="s381">That’s so funny -- in that province there.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s383">Huh.</span> <span id="s384">So, did you adjust after a few days to his being there, or did it take you a while to?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I remember that I said I’d -- he would come on a Saturday afternoon, I said, “I won’t be home.”</span> <span id="s386">And Mom said, “I have to do a few -- a little bit of shopping, but I’ll see he would come late in the afternoon.”</span> <span id="s387">And I’m home alone, and the doorbell rings, and there stands this handsome guy.</span> <span id="s388">But then it was Hein, I had to open him, and I was alone home, and I hated him.</span> <span id="s389">And I’d made up my he -- my mind that I would hate him.</span> <span id="s390">So, even if he looked very nice, I hated him, because that is what I had decided.</span> <span id="s391">And I wasn’t nice to him at all, and he fell in love with me, and he told my mom.</span> <span id="s392">And then later he made friends at the office, and he went to a study group from my church, young men, so then three of them rented an apartment, so he was -- I don’t know, maybe half a year in our house.</span> <span id="s393">But my parents got to love him like a son, and I tolerated him, because I’d made up my mind.</span> <span id="s394">You know how stubborn you can be.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: And then when the war -- when he -- they were all mobilized, you know, when the threat in ’39 came, and the end of ’38, so -- and he had to be at the river, the IJssel, that goes parallel with the German border.</span> <span id="s397">And there were bunkers near the water, so -- oh, and [indecipherable] and they were often there.</span> <span id="s398">And because he had been so long in our house, our family wrote him that was the only thing they had.</span> <span id="s399">See, now they have those nice military homes where they can go for reading a paper, and play piano, and do card games, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s400">They slept in [indecipherable] and everybody was mobilized, people with businesses, and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s401">So I remember that in the pulpit, and in the papers, it said open your house for the military, and invite them.</span> <span id="s402">So with that -- that armory right behind our house, Momma wrote a note, Christian family with organ and piano, somebody wants to come is welcome, for in the evening, reading the papers, or -- and then the two Friesians came, and they later told that they quick had taken the paper off.</span> <span id="s403">So they became like brothers, and Hein was there alone on that -- so we wrote him all the time.</span> <span id="s404">And then I had also to write my little note.</span> <span id="s405">Father wrote, Mother wrote, Albert wrote, my sister wrote.</span> <span id="s406">So I -- and then you have here only one word, dear.</span> <span id="s407">I-If you write a business letter you start dear, but also if you love somebody, but we have different words.</span> <span id="s408">So the first letters that I wrote was Beste, that is distance, you know, Beste.</span> <span id="s409">And then I remember when it really got dangerous, I all of a sudden thought, “Oh my God, if he gets hurt or killed,” and then I realized I loved him, but it -- it was really -- and I thought -- but in the Netherlands, you know, I think the girls right now, they go after the boys, but you didn’t do that back then.</span> <span id="s410">And I loved this -- stupid, idiot, I was -- and all my girlfriends were in love with him, and I thought oh, this is terrible, I -- and I told my mom, she said, “Well, he was in love with you, he told me.”</span> <span id="s411">But then she had told him, she’s not yet ready for it, because -- this is crazy, I -- I really don’t dare to tell this, but I must have been 17, and he came in our house, and I had those two girlfriends, and my brother and his friends, and I was a tomboy.</span> <span id="s412">And then Saturday afternoons when we had off from school, we often had school Saturday mornings still, we went on our bikes outside The Hague, and we have so many canals, and ditches, and trees everywhere, and we had the greatest fun that we took a run, and then tried to jump a ditch.</span> <span id="s413">And every time a rider went in the [indecipherable] always one of us would fall in.</span> <span id="s414">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: You mean, with the bicycle?</span> <span id="s416">You would try to run a ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, no</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Oh, you would run --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: We put the bicycles on the meadow, and then we took a run --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And then you -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: -- and jump.</span> <span id="s422">And we climbed trees, and we had so much fun, we play -- I don’t know, I think I was very late that I was mature.</span> <span id="s423">But anyway, then Hein ask me all the time, Hein [indecipherable] let’s go for a bike ride, let’s go for -- to the dunes, or something.</span> <span id="s424">And, no I -- I didn’t like him, you know, that was my -- so one Saturday afternoon, my friends all had to go to their grandmother in the city, that they could go on a bike, but it was maybe two hours.</span> <span id="s425">So they weren’t there, and Hein asked again, and oh well -- well, I’ve nothing better to do.</span> <span id="s426">So I went, and I told the girls, he asked me again to bike -- go [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s427">So then they asked me when I came back, how was it.</span> <span id="s428">I said, “So boring, we never climbed a tree.”</span> <span id="s429">But he was I think 18, close to 19 and was much more mature.</span> <span id="s430">So that was the only thing, and then when I realized this, then he -- he wrote us back, and then one day I got a letter, and it was directed to me, and then he wrote, “My next leave, I want come to The Hague.”</span> <span id="s431">And he had been before, but it was always for the family, you know.</span> <span id="s432">He said, “And this time it’s not for the family, it’s just for you.”</span> <span id="s433">And I was happy as possible.</span> <span id="s434">So then he came, and then it clicked.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: With [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s437">He was a wonderful person, always living for others, and thinking that he was so selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Were you working in -- in the bank in 1937?</span> <span id="s439">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: It was a big, beautiful old bank in the center of the city, and I was -- I had there, with the informational section.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: And was that the same time that you met Hein?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: That I met --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Or was that afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, I was -- I stayed there shur -- they paid very little.</span> <span id="s445">And then I got an offer to work somewhere else, and they paid better, so -- and I took those Spanish lessons, because see, that degree was four years, and I can -- languages come fast, and you just sit in your class, and you have a couple [indecipherable] you back.</span> <span id="s446">So I found a profess -- professor who said, “I’ll prepare you for that exam,” -- I asked him.</span> <span id="s447">I said, “Then load me up with homework, and I come once a week, an hour that you can check, and whatever.”</span> <span id="s448">And I had to pay him, I think three quarter of my salary, but I did it with -- just within two years.</span> <span id="s449">So -- and that was worth it.</span> <span id="s450">And then I still took another exam, but I needed -- with money for my -- because I had hardly any left for myself with pocket money, so when they offered this -- it was -- with the other one, was a government job, and it was for the father of a youth friend of mine, who lived three years across from me.</span> <span id="s451">So she said, “My father needs a secretary,” so then I went, and they paid better.</span> <span id="s452">But the war days, I was in the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Right, days of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: During the first five days of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: We had -- well, see we fought.</span> <span id="s457">Denmark didn’t get one bullet.</span> <span id="s458">And Sweden let them go through and attack Norway.</span> <span id="s459">Norway fought.</span> <span id="s460">And Belgium didn’t have an army.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: And I -- we later learned that Hitler had like all travel agents [indecipherable] you know, [indecipherable], from us go 10 days to Europe, Wednesday morning for the Netherlands, Wednesday afternoon for France, Tuesday for Switzerland, and so.</span> <span id="s463">And Hitler made a schedule for the war, and he had given Monday for the Netherlands, but he forgot that we are very stubborn, and we fought five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: In the afternoon of the fife -- fir -- fifth day, they bombarded the open city of Rotterdam in the center, where there was nothing military.</span> <span id="s466">Hospitals, museums, churches, cathedrals.</span> <span id="s467">And thousands died , and it was -- and then their general said to our general, “If you don’t surrender [indecipherable] to The Hague, I’m [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s468">And he surrendered after five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: So -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: But those five days of the war, I was in that bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: In the bank.</span> <span id="s472">So you’ve known Hein now for three years, when the war comes in 1940 to the Netherlands [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Two and a half years, it came at the end of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So -- right.</span> <span id="s475">So you essentially, within six or eight months, you realize you’re in love with this guy.</span> <span id="s476">And this is the first time you’ve had a boyfriend, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Now, you had -- you know, when we went -- playing robbery so-called, you had friends, but that was nothing, you know, you didn’t kiss or anything, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: This was serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: -- but that was just special friend.</span> <span id="s480">I remember that there was a guy that I was at that Christian high school that was quite far away, and it was 45 minutes on the bike to go home, and then all of us [indecipherable] and I saw Tim from our street, and biking next to me.</span> <span id="s481">“Oh, how nice to see you here.</span> <span id="s482">I had to go here,” and so -- like it was casual, but he came then, maybe they are 15 or 16, that was -- you know, the -- Tim was my friend, but nothing else.</span> <span id="s483">But if he -- you know, we had -- we did funny -- fun games, and if there was a fair, like a country fair, or so, you went with the whole group, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s485">But this was quite different?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah, that was different.</span> <span id="s487">This was [indecipherable] just --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Were the girlfriend jealous because it was clear that he was in love with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s492">But then they found their own boyfriends, so -- but I know that a lot had a crush on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So he was whe -- he was in your house for about six months, and then he was in an apartment in The Hague?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: An apartment with his two friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And did you end up seeing each other a great deal at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: It was so funny, because one was from another city, Zwollen, and if his girlfriend came over, and he was engaged, but it was no proper -- so they always -- the girlfriend from -- they [indecipherable] slept in our house, my mom was always -- it was really like the holiday, and we never knew.</span> <span id="s497">And the other one had a girlfriend who lived in The Hague.</span> <span id="s498">And we three girls are dear, dear friends.</span> <span id="s499">We hit it off so right.</span> <span id="s500">So we were mostly with the whole group, and I’m still now -- the two other guys died, later, from old age.</span> <span id="s501">But for all those years I was their friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You’re still friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: With all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: And they all loved Hein.</span> <span id="s508">And I remember when I just came out of the concentration camp, the first couple was going to get married.</span> <span id="s509">So I stepped in in the church, and I -- but then I disappeared again, because they were still looking for me.</span> <span id="s510">Yeah, it was -- you know, I had wonderful friends from that time, because it’s a friendship that goes real deep.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I can honestly say I loved my s -- underground friends more than my own sister, who was not really --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: More than Fanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: She was not [indecipherable], not that it matters, but she was a total different -- she even scolded, and her husband, too, you stupid, why do you do that, it’ll cost your life, and this and that.</span> <span id="s517">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: She said that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: They both --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: They both said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: -- her and her husband, who she married later, and they said, “You are stupid,” and whatever.</span> <span id="s522">But she lived in another part of the country, and there was curfew, and if any of our group was in that area close to 11, that you had to be off the street, they could always sleep on their couch, but they called you stupid [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Now was she very different when you were growing up, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s525">She -- see, I was this tomboy --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: -- and she was 15 - 16, and she liked high heels, and underwear with lots of lace, and -- and then she -- they said to Mom, “Forbid her to climb those trees, she is,” -- this and that.</span> <span id="s528">So -- and then, when Mother went a weekend to go to her mother, then she was the boss because she was eight years older, and I was maybe 14 or 15, and she was 22 or 23, and I had to obey her.</span> <span id="s529">And I always said, “You -- you are a much worse mother,” you know, from you I may not do [indecipherable], you know, and she thought that I was wild, and well, in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: -- my tomboy -- yeah.</span> <span id="s532">You know, so we di -- were totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: But her fiancé was -- was killed in the beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: She was engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: -- right?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: And -- and she would have gotten married the year of the war, in September.</span> <span id="s537">And they all were drafted, and her fiancé had -- had signed a contract that if he went so many years in the -- like here they do sometimes, and then you get free university study, so he had signed up.</span> <span id="s538">And he was just ready to get out, and then the war broke out, a-and -- so he was -- had to stay in that service, and he was assigned to a small airport, Ypenburg, just outside The Hague.</span> <span id="s539">And then the morning of the war, Hitler had the evening before given a big speech, and I had heard it as ma -- and I knew German.</span> <span id="s540">And he said -- because by that time, they had taken -- France was already occupied, because they had been able to hold it in ’39.</span> <span id="s541">And then he had taken Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, that was beginning of the second World War, they had marched through Sweden, Norway.</span> <span id="s542">So only that sliver of the Netherlands, and Belgium were not occupied by [indecipherable] Franco was Nazi, whole Europe was Nazi.</span> <span id="s543">So we were very, very nervous, and -- and Hitler said, “I know that the Dutch are scared, they don’t have to be.</span> <span id="s544">They are very unimportant, and I don’t need that piece of land.”</span> <span id="s545">And then he said, “And they were not in the first World War, and I will respect their neutrality.”</span> <span id="s546">That were his literal words.</span> <span id="s547">And while he was saying that, at nine PM, his troops were already marching to our borders, and to our bridges, so he was a big, fat liar.</span> <span id="s548">And I think that that made me so furious that I thought, “How did he have the guts to say this on the radio while he knew this,” -- from -- that made me so mad.</span> <span id="s549">And then, five days later, when they came in, with their goosestep, and their helmets, and their tanks, and their proud faces -- I remember that they marched in [indecipherable] out standing the bank, and the tears were streaming down our cheeks.</span> <span id="s550">And that’s when I made my vow, I’ll never, never speak one word of German.</span> <span id="s551">We have not invited them.</span> <span id="s552">And then -- and we saw what they were doing to our Jewish people.</span> <span id="s553">I got really to -- to hate the Nazi system.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did you not expect the Germans to come into the Netherlands, in spite of the fact that they had attacked Poland, and they had gone into the other European --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I think that our government -- I, as a girl of 19 didn’t think so, because we hadn’t been in the first World War.</span> <span id="s556">But I later had, and it was nearly hilarious, that our government was bringing itself in [indecipherable] to stay neutral.</span> <span id="s557">So they had built bunkers towards Germany.</span> <span id="s558">So they built a few bunkers along the coast against [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s559">You know, it’s really laughable when you think about it, that they were trying to be -- to be neutral, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Neutral.</span> <span id="s561">So it must have been a big shock to you after you heard Hitler’s speech, when you saw the troops come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah, I remember that night.</span> <span id="s563">See, in the Netherlands at that time it was so funny, because you know, the -- the one -- like I say, it was really, the housewife was missing, because everything was made from scratch, now we go to the store.</span> <span id="s564">You had a store to go for your meat, a store for your veggies, a store for this, for your tha -- dairy.</span> <span id="s565">So it took you time, an household was a whole day of work.</span> <span id="s566">And Monday was always laundry day, and all the women in the Netherlands, and Tuesday, I think they do -- did the ironing, and Wednesday, in most houses, they did the living room, and on Thursday -- but Thursday was always the day that -- well, there were no vacuum cleaners, but everybody had rug beaters, and everywhere you heard bing, bang, bung.</span> <span id="s567">They hung it over things in the yard, and then they beat the rugs.</span> <span id="s568">And I remember that I woke up that night, and it was pitch dark, and I heard a noise like beating, but very fast.</span> <span id="s569">And half asleep, I thought, which idiot is beating the rugs in the middle of the night?</span> <span id="s570">And [indecipherable] it’s much fast -- and then I heard my parents stir in their bedroom, they must have heard it, too.</span> <span id="s571">And we got up, and we went outside, and over our head was a battle between planes, and shooting.</span> <span id="s572">So then we went back in the house, and turned the radio on, and we heard that they had invaded our country.</span> <span id="s573">And then the next morning, yeah, we are so faithful in all we do, and I remember, here we were at war, and then Adriaan was killed -- I mean, Adriaan was the fiancé of my sister, because [indecipherable], and we didn’t know that, so he was one of the first ones who was shot, and killed, the early morning of May 10th.</span> <span id="s574">And I step on my bike and I went to my office.</span> <span id="s575">And I’m in a big street, what then was a big street, I was now in The Hague, and that wasn’t so big, but it was still a light street.</span> <span id="s576">And I was stopped by Dutch police.</span> <span id="s577">And I thought, “What’s this?”</span> <span id="s578">And they said, “Say Scheveningen.”</span> <span id="s579">And I said it, that was the city where -- where Milosevic is now in the prison.</span> <span id="s580">And then I had to say Schapenscheerder.</span> <span id="s581">I don’t know if you can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: But that is the guy who shears the sheep.</span> <span id="s584">And the Germans couldn’t say those words.</span> <span id="s585">And then I could say it, and then they let me go, and they said, “They are everywhere as spies among us.”</span> <span id="s586">Because about a year and a half before the war, two years, you could get -- the families could get a German maid so cheap, and they lived in your house.</span> <span id="s587">But all those German maids, a lot of them were spies.</span> <span id="s588">And for a long time, every time from an air base, or an army base, or whatever, uniforms had disappeared.</span> <span id="s589">And they -- it was still -- now you don’t see it any more.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, in Vietnam, and in Korea, you don’t see the enemy, they just measure, and I -- shoot a bit farther, or lower, they [indecipherable], but at that time they still saw each other, and our guys didn’t shoot at the whole groups if they came in our country our own uniforms, so it was, oh, I remember, I was so mad, and I still -- I think I have that, that if I see injustice, my hair goes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you have a fi -- a -- a fairly large army, or a very small army?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, small.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Small, was small.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And when was Hein drafted into the army, in ’39, or f -- or -- or ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I think the very end of ’38, or the beginning of ’39, I’m not sure, but it was around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s598">So he was in the army about a year before the --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s600">And then he was pulled back, and he was in place called Ede, and I remember that Ascension day, that’s the day [indecipherable] really was at that church, you know, it’s [indecipherable] any more, but he said come here, and that was in the middle, and there is a little -- we are so flat, we have only -- but there is what we call the grebbeberg, that’s another word you can’t say, but that was a little hill, and that was in the middle.</span> <span id="s601">And I was so happy that he wasn’t at the border any more, I thought that’s the first thing.</span> <span id="s602">And so that day we spent, and he got from a friend a motorbike, and I was scared stiff, and he had a good day, and then I went back to The Hague.</span> <span id="s603">And then a few days later, the war was --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: War’s on.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: So then I found -- and I was worried stiff because the most were killed at the grebbeberg, and I didn’t know what had happened to him.</span> <span id="s606">And I have it with me, then I got a smudged card, a post card, I think dated May 13th, or was in the middle of the war days, and it came from Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s607">And he had moved [indecipherable], I didn’t know that, from Ede to Rotterdam, and he was in that bombardment.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: He was.</span> <span id="s610">He was in that bombardment [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s611">I didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So I guess it was a good thing that you didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: No, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: You were worried enough as it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Oh, it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s617">I’ve just been touched, so we’re going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Diet, your brother Arjan, your older brother had joined the army and was in Indonesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: He was a reserve officer in the Netherlands, where they all, after their training they wer -- had jobs.</span> <span id="s622">And he had -- it was a time of unemployment -- that was also to promote -- that Hitler had so much success, there was such an unemployment everywhere, and he had a job, but very dull, and then at one point he got a letter that reserve officers were asked, volunteers if they wanted to go to Indonesia.</span> <span id="s623">And he had such a boring job, so he went, and he was in the air force.</span> <span id="s624">And he was shot down when the Japs came in, and he had a big piece of shell in his hip, and they took it out, and stitch it up, and they thought he never walks again.</span> <span id="s625">So they put him in the hospital, and they really didn’t watch him, because he couldn’t walk, he was heavily wounded.</span> <span id="s626">But then it healed, and he had his -- I don’t know, I guess his [indecipherable] or whatever, and he practiced at night, because he wasn’t watched.</span> <span id="s627">And then at one time he escaped.</span> <span id="s628">And later I heard he had told other people, “I know that my little sister in the Netherlands [indecipherable] in the resistance.”</span> <span id="s629">He knew me, and he was a lot like I was.</span> <span id="s630">And I always thought, if he can do anything, he’ll do it.</span> <span id="s631">And it’s true, he found a lot of his guys again, and then around the city of Brondong, they did whatever they could, resistance.</span> <span id="s632">But then he was hiding in Kampong, that’s where the Indonesians live, their villages, and the settlement.</span> <span id="s633">But somebody knew that, and they betrayed him, and he was arrested again, and then he was tortured to death, we later heard.</span> <span id="s634">But he was really tortured to death by -- in a terrible, terrible prison, the Sukamiskin.</span> <span id="s635">And nobody who went in there ever came out alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So he was captured twice, he escaped the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: He was shot down first.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: And then he was captured after he --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: So do you know about when that happened [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I don’t know really the date.</span> <span id="s644">We don’t know the date --</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: -- but we heard it from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s647">And we had an uncle there, with his whole family, he was a professor at the museum in Brondong.</span> <span id="s648">And that was his home.</span> <span id="s649">And this uncle had a daughter who was studying in the Netherlands for teacher, and at that time the [indecipherable] was six years, because you had to go by boat, there were no planes, you had to go by boat through the Suez Canal, that took six weeks.</span> <span id="s650">So that daughter in the Netherlands didn’t have a home, so every vacation, Easter, Christmas, New Year, she was in our house, she was like another sister.</span> <span id="s651">But when my brother went there, he had reversed it, it was his home there, his -- and they -- there were two other girls, and they were there.</span> <span id="s652">They went later in those horrible camps, but they told us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: And when did you find out about this, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s655">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: After the war, so you di -- you had no idea whether he was okay, or he wasn’t okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: We didn’t know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: The only thing that you could once in awhile do was via the Red Cross, send a letter to non-occupied, or allied countries, but it was heavily censored.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: We’d never got to Indonesia, no it was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: So that was very tough on your family, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, first my older sister, then my brother, then me.</span> <span id="s664">[indecipherable] mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Having the [indecipherable] couldn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s668">What did you think when the queen and the government left the country, and went to England, at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: We were so disappointed, and so sad, and so furious.</span> <span id="s670">I have Hein’s diary, he was furious.</span> <span id="s671">And we all felt -- you say the father of the fatherland we call the kings.</span> <span id="s672">She was the mother of -- and we said, which mother leaves her children alone when they’re in trouble?</span> <span id="s673">That’s when you have to be there.</span> <span id="s674">And we loved th-the Belgian king, he stayed, and he stayed with his people.</span> <span id="s675">And you know what?</span> <span id="s676">The queen left with the whole government, and they left us, and they fled, and they were [indecipherable] no, because those ministers left their wives, and children in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s677">It was really our government that went to England.</span> <span id="s678">So that was our official government.</span> <span id="s679">And then the very serious Christians, you have obey what God says in the Bible.</span> <span id="s680">And in the time of Jesus, they were occupied by the Romans.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: And it’s -- so a lot of denominations decided this is what God gives us, we have to obey Hitler.</span> <span id="s683">But we thought further, and we thought, well, our official government, and our queen -- all the hoyal -- royal families always crowned by the grace of God.</span> <span id="s684">It’s a very serious ceremony when they are crowned.</span> <span id="s685">And our government was in England, so we felt that we had total freedom, and yet obey what they told us.</span> <span id="s686">And later they told several underground to blow up that munition, blow up that bridge, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: So did you wait?</span> <span id="s688">I mean, how long did it take you to decide that when the --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Maybe a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Because see, we also heard that we were a very wealthy country.</span> <span id="s692">They paid very low taxes because we had Indonesia, with rich, rich, it’s got everything, copper, tin, pewter, you call that.</span> <span id="s693">And rubber, and oil.</span> <span id="s694">So that we had -- the royal family of the Netherlands was considered one of the wealthiest in the Netherlands, too.</span> <span id="s695">They had [indecipherable] that they could take our national treasury, but they took all the gold bars to England, so [indecipherable] found nothing, and then -- no, we -- and then the Belgian king, he had several palaces, they always had several, and then, okay, you stayed here, you go to Larpen, I think it was called, and it was a big, big garden, giant garden, with a wall around it, and you could never speak to these people.</span> <span id="s696">So did he serve them?</span> <span id="s697">No.</span> <span id="s698">I mean, our queen did really the wisest what she could do.</span> <span id="s699">So then that took some all months before they realized it.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And how were they communicating back?</span> <span id="s701">Did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: The government?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Yes, well from England.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: There were secret sendlers with the Netherlands, and so on.</span> <span id="s705">And our ministers were all there.</span> <span id="s706">But then later -- see, in the beginning, the resistance, you don’t know where to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I mean, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s709">And that were all really little groups decided something has to be done, and when they did, sometimes they [indecipherable] and very much later, years later, they got together, and they formed the L.O., the Landelijke Organisatie, the [indecipherable] and they asked us also to be a member, but we thought was danger in being in a large group, and we had -- we were self-sufficient, we had stolen all the stuff.</span> <span id="s710">So we said no.</span> <span id="s711">We knew all the people we worked with, and we trusted them, and we didn’t take part.</span> <span id="s712">But that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: So tell me how --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: -- that secret sendler.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Did -- when -- when you saw the Germans come in, did you very quickly think in your head, we have to do something, or did it take -- did it take time for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, I remember when they marched in, I thought we have to do anything to get them out.</span> <span id="s717">But you didn’t know what yet.</span> <span id="s718">But you hated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s720">And did you talk with friends immediately, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Now, then it happened that they started slowly, and I later read that Hitler had told Zize Ingort, who we got as governor, and that was his reward, that he had betrayed Austria, and that Hitler had told him, the Dutch are Aryers, blue-eyes, blonde hair, that was his ideal, and treat them with gloves, because they might want to be a province of Germany.</span> <span id="s722">Now, when I read that, I laughed so hard, I thought he has forgotten one national trait here, very stubborn.</span> <span id="s723">And that was -- in a marriage it can be a problem, but here it was good, so what Hitler told us to do, we didn’t want to do, simply.</span> <span id="s724">So now -- and then s -- be -- as punishment, because we didn’t obey, we got curfew.</span> <span id="s725">Now, we don’t like to be told to be home from 11 to six, so that was the first thing that [indecipherable] us all.</span> <span id="s726">Then all the transp -- nobody had a car, and that was not poverty, only businesses like Sears, or whatever, had cu -- big trucks, but for the rest, nobody had a car.</span> <span id="s727">So we had trams, terrific connections in -- in the city, and in all those buses.</span> <span id="s728">And it was a few pennies, they went every three, four minutes, or you hopped on the tram, stepped over on the bus, and there you were.</span> <span id="s729">That was the whole -- and then the [indecipherable], of course [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s730">But all of a sudden the Jewish people weren’t allowed to use those any more.</span> <span id="s731">And then they started -- the Jewish people weren’t allowed to visit the non-Jews, so Herman couldn’t come any more.</span> <span id="s732">And we couldn’t visit Jewish people.</span> <span id="s733">And they were telling us then -- because they were telling all lies over the papers, and over the radio, we di-didn’t even bother any more, we turned BBC, that was the only -- that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s734">And if you still listened, you won’t be -- I always tell the kids here, you [indecipherable] half the year to jail if you caught you listening to the BBC.</span> <span id="s735">Now, it’s ridiculous to go half a year -- and then we still listened, so we had to hand the radios in, and it went.</span> <span id="s736">So I mean, we got more and more irritated in the [indecipherable] so and so, so have to get out of this country.</span> <span id="s737">But then, you’d still didn’t know what to do, till Herman called me one day, and he said, “Diet, I want to see you.”</span> <span id="s738">I said, “To heck with Hitler, you come to our house.”</span> <span id="s739">He said, “I don’t dare.”</span> <span id="s740">Anyway [indecipherable] to my house, either.</span> <span id="s741">And then we met somewhere, and that was when the Jewish people started to get those papers, you have to leave your house, leave everything behind, and it was always in the curfew, hours that we Dutch couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s742">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So the Jews would have to be out during curfew to go to Westerbork?</span> <span id="s744">They would be sent to Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Dee -- that was always during the curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: So that no one else would be around?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: We couldn’t be in the street --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: -- and we couldn’t make a big riot.</span> <span id="s750">And they were allowed -- and you know that from all your interviews, they were only allowed to take a little suitcase for each member, with a change of clothing, a fork, knife, spoon, cup, and a blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Now, I mean, if you think -- and that still makes me now furious, you know, but you think, they have a right to be there.</span> <span id="s753">Some of them were there since 1500.</span> <span id="s754">They had worked, they had done, they had earned their house, they have worked hard, and you have not only in money value, but you have things that are handed down from family tradition, and kids who have pets.</span> <span id="s755">I mean, they had to leave everything behind, and I was saying, what was their crime?</span> <span id="s756">Their crime was that they were born Jewish.</span> <span id="s757">And is that a crime?</span> <span id="s758">I mean, I would say, that’s what God decides, the color of your skin.</span> <span id="s759">I could have been born in Nigeria and be pitch black.</span> <span id="s760">I mean, you have nothing to say in that.</span> <span id="s761">So it was such a terrible injustice, we had never seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s762">And I think now the people was really -- are getting kind of -- you know, it’s just the fact that I’ve seen -- it’s so horrible.</span> <span id="s763">And that night I saw Hein, and I told him, and Hein had read the book that Hitler wrote, Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s764">And then he said, oh he [indecipherable] because remember -- and I forgot to tell him that you know that, the night that they invaded our country, that -- there was no place in Europe any more, there was no place.</span> <span id="s765">Many of those German Jews committed suicide.</span> <span id="s766">And the next day, I wished I had kept those papers, your heart broke, obituaries of father, mother, children, all the ages, they had all the German Jewish [indecipherable] and they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s767">And that was so horrible.</span> <span id="s768">And then -- then Hein and I talked, we said, oh, and [indecipherable] Hitler hates them, he’s going to do something terrible, but we still didn’t know that they would be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So you’re not hearing anything from Europe, because by then they’d attacked Russia, and they start killing Jews.</span> <span id="s770">But you haven’t heard anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Was that in ’40? ’</span> <span id="s772">41?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: No.</span> <span id="s774">No, no, ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No, this is later.</span> <span id="s776">But this was -- I think that the Jewish people got their notice the very end of ’41, beginning of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: And we had not heard anything about that, that came later, that’s I think June.</span> <span id="s779">The -- this was that Herman had to leave, and then we said that can’t happen, but what could you do?</span> <span id="s780">I mean, I was twen --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So let -- let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s782">There’s a big strike in 1941, the worker’s strike in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: In Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: In Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s785">Did -- di -- you had heard about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: We heard that later, but it was, of course not in the papers, although they shot a lot of people, because like here you have now Rumsfeld, and Cheney, and so -- that when they march in our country and they weren’t obeying the right way to do things, and we heard -- I later heard we were the only country where they did it -- all our own mayors and government people are kicked out and all replaced by Nazis.</span> <span id="s787">And so [indecipherable] by Germans.</span> <span id="s788">So that was already unusual.</span> <span id="s789">And also they took right away, 70 of our top guys, and they were put in a prison, but it was a big monastery in Bravong.</span> <span id="s790">And that’s -- it had -- it was from the middle age, had meter thick walls.</span> <span id="s791">And that’s -- and they were hostages, and they told us, if you do anything, those guys will be shot.</span> <span id="s792">And they were.</span> <span id="s793">Some of them -- so they did, because several of them were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s795">So you -- you have this -- the Germans come in, so talk between 1940 and ’42.</span> <span id="s796">So on the one hand, you’re saying that the -- the Dutch hate the fact that they’re there, want them out, and at the same time, it’s very difficult to know what you do when you have such a force as the Germans were.</span> <span id="s797">So you’re caught in this dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: You -- we didn’t know first what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: But, you know, when this happen, that Herman told me he had to leave, and that’s where my religion and Hein’s religion came out in the first place.</span> <span id="s801">They were the con -- the people that God had chosen to bring forth Jesus, the Messiah, it was for us.</span> <span id="s802">In the second place, it says in the Bible, who touches them, and even if they believe that Jesus is the Messiah [indecipherable] they are the apple of God’s eye, and who touches them, touch -- touches God’s eye.</span> <span id="s803">And then also, we thought it was such an injustice, and Jesus said, do unto others what you want others to do unto you.</span> <span id="s804">So we felt we had to help, but we didn’t know what to.</span> <span id="s805">And Hein had read that book, and then we got talking, he said, “Oh, it’s terrible,” he said, “he’ll go and do something terrible.”</span> <span id="s806">And then all of a sudden Hein says, “I have an idea.”</span> <span id="s807">His father was principal, out in the country, in farming community, and they were all Christians, and all Christian area there.</span> <span id="s808">And all those kids had -- from the farms, came to his school, and Hein was the oldest of 10 kids [indecipherable] I don’t know, [indecipherable] that he was born, probably.</span> <span id="s809">He was born in the other place, but he lived there his whole life.</span> <span id="s810">And those farmers gave him all those years, the eggs, and they bought the eggs, butter, everything.</span> <span id="s811">So Hein knew all those farmers, and also from the kids who came to school.</span> <span id="s812">And Hein says to me, “You know what?</span> <span id="s813">If I hop on the train, and ask any of those farmers if they will take Herman till the war is over, I’m sure they do it.”</span> <span id="s814">And we thought, at that time, that was [indecipherable] times, the war would last a year, maybe a year and a half.</span> <span id="s815">So -- and then I called Herman, and I said, “Herman, we have an idea.”</span> <span id="s816">And I met him again.</span> <span id="s817">And he said, “Yes, please.”</span> <span id="s818">He said, “And can you do my sister, too, Rosa, she is so scared.”</span> <span id="s819">And I said, “What about your parents?”</span> <span id="s820">Because I knew -- he said no, my parents say -- and this is really ironic, “Germany is an -- an civilized country, and it won’t be so bad, we probably have to work hard, and how long will the war will last,” -- we all thought it would be short -- and then come back.</span> <span id="s821">And they did not want to go in hiding, and not be a bother to others.</span> <span id="s822">But Herman said he was dating a Jewish girl, and the father had already died, thanks to the Germans, and the mo -- she was an only child, and he says, “Ada is scared, and her mother is scared.”</span> <span id="s823">So that was four.</span> <span id="s824">And then all of a sudden, they spread the news, and I think within two or three weeks we have a list of over 60.</span> <span id="s825">And we -- Hein went to the farms, and they didn’t know me then, but he went, and they all said, “Sure, sure, send them, send them.”</span> <span id="s826">And that’s how it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: So how come people were so willing, di -- were the -- the Nazis not in the north?</span> <span id="s828">Were they not occupying Friesland?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: They were there.</span> <span id="s831">And then but --</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: But that was in hiding.</span> <span id="s833">And we didn’t bring them to Friesland, we bought them to the middle of the country Nijkerk, that is -- I don’t know if you have a map --</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: -- but I have a map of the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: It’s a bit east of Amersfoort.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: And there, see our country, the south [indecipherable] is mostly Catholics, and they did it, too, and north of [indecipherable] are mostly the Protestant.</span> <span id="s840">And -- so -- and Hein knew all those people, and they were all from -- I didn’t know they sent their children to the Christian schools, and so -- and they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And they didn’t hesitate?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span> <span id="s843">They thought it was just normal, nobody -- I really -- I can still not understand why here in America, I feel sometimes very uncomfortable because I tell here my story, and you all think it’s terrific.</span> <span id="s844">And I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t dare to tell my story in the Netherlands, they would shrug their shoulders and say so what, you did it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s845">No, honest, I thought everybody I met at that time was in the resistance, so I thought the whole Netherlands was in the resistance.</span> <span id="s846">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: But that’s not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: No, because this high government guy later told me, he says that in the first place, that our denomination was the most.</span> <span id="s849">And then he asked me, “Who do you think is the second group?”</span> <span id="s850">And I thought, well we have the same [indecipherable] maybe you know the Communists.</span> <span id="s851">And that’s true, you have to be on fire for what you believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: -- and they were.</span> <span id="s854">So that is really interesting.</span> <span id="s855">You know, we didn’t think it was so special, you know?</span> <span id="s856">It was just what you had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: But you knew it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s858">And certainly the farmers had to know it was dangerous, be --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Now, they -- you know, in the beginning, we didn’t know how far -- who the Gestapo was.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: No, you did not realize how -- but then you found out also, that they had officially black uniforms, and they were men and women, and all ages, and most of them didn’t wear the black uniform, they were dressed like you and I.</span> <span id="s862">So you had to really watch out what you say, to whom, because I could say to -- well, for instance, the -- for the first time executed 18 guys.</span> <span id="s863">Now we were shocked, shocked.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t know if you’ve read that poem of -- oh, that is so beautiful, the 18 -- that was a -- a -- a poet who was shot the next morning.</span> <span id="s865">I can never read it without starting to cry.</span> <span id="s866">But when that happened, you know, we were so shocked, and then we realized you had to watch out if you said to another girl, isn’t that horrible from the 18 guys, and she was a Nazi [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: -- you didn’t know the person real good [indecipherable] terrible things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Did you have to worry about some of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Well, me?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Or people you thought you were f -- who -- who you thought were friends?</span> <span id="s872">That must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I found that out because this -- there were two girls that we always went jumping over the ditches, they were from my church, and they were -- one was my age, one was a year younger, and their brother was a year younger again, Daniel, and we were all -- and then my brother was friends with Daniel, and we were as a whole group together.</span> <span id="s874">And we went together to catechism, went to church, and to everything.</span> <span id="s875">And it was the habit after church that the parents -- my parents had friends, and they came one Sunday to our house for coffee, and then the other Sunday there.</span> <span id="s876">But those friends and I we s -- we played piano quartre main, four hands, and so one Sunday it was in their house, and we had fun, and until dinnertime, and the next Sunday in our house.</span> <span id="s877">And when I -- I think I told you that there -- there was nothing for the soldiers, that they had invited the pulpits and so come to our house, so we had Dutch soldiers.</span> <span id="s878">And they were like brother and sister, and I said, “Are you going to do it?”</span> <span id="s879">And they said no, we have five kids, it’s too busy, we don’t do it.</span> <span id="s880">And the first Sunday after the war it was in our house, and the second Sunday I went to their house, and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s881">You had to go up the stairs, and then over the piano was a big portrait of Hitler.</span> <span id="s882">And you had those doors that were gliders, that opened -- they had double doors, and I heard in the other room German speaking, and I look, and I see German soldiers.</span> <span id="s883">So then I knew that they were all Nazi.</span> <span id="s884">And I had right away, after the war, I’m always a fanatic, I bought a little flag, and like now you see over [indecipherable] after 11/7, that I put it on my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s885">And I was so shattered when I saw that, and I said to them, “As long as this hangs in this house, I can’t set a foot here.”</span> <span id="s886">And I turned around and I went downstairs to get my bag.</span> <span id="s887">And I think Daniel had told me, the flag of my reich, so he didn’t even feel Dutch any more.</span> <span id="s888">And I heard later that Daniel fought at the [indecipherable], so he was not just in name, and both the girls went to Germany and served there with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: [indecipherable] m-mice, very [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Now, were they in the Malakka Club?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: They were also in that group, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: In -- in that club, at first [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: We had such a fun -- I couldn’t be -- I wrote a letter to them, I’ve never mailed it, I wrote it in my diary, but I was shattered, absolutely shattered.</span> <span id="s895">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s896">But see, then later I realized when we met those Nazis [indecipherable] at the border, they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s897">And my brother later said, “Diet, you guys never s -- talked politics, but I was in dan -- Daniel’s room, and he had a lot of stuff from Germany [indecipherable]”.</span> <span id="s898">So my brother was not surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: But I never knew, never talked about it.</span> <span id="s901">And we had [indecipherable], and many pastors who spoke out on the pulpit, and priests, too, were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s903">Now, the Dutch government opened Westerbork as a refugee camp because there were so many refugees coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: The Nazi Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: The Nazi Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s908">And this was when?</span> <span id="s909">In 1939, in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, it was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: It was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Because before it was really a camp for -- see, there was such an unemployment, and people got their money, but they wanted them to do something.</span> <span id="s913">And so they had several work camps, that the guy who got money from the government could do something useful, let’s say in a very watery place, they were really filling with earth that it could be used for growing stuff or something, you have so many more -- more s -- more [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s914">And so the -- it was originally a work camp for the -- for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: For refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: -- people who were getting welfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: And then they had leave, and they could go home.</span> <span id="s919">Then they are rebuilding [indecipherable], and only that [indecipherable] or many more of those worked, and [indecipherable] and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And so when does it become a place where they send Jews, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Where they sent the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I think that might have been the end of ’40, when then they started telling them to go to Germany, and they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s924">And that was also th -- because the Jews from The Hague had to report to a big station in The Hague, and they went in [indecipherable] but then, like me with Herman, and so there were a bunch who didn’t go, and others in the area where that camp was, I think they were told to go there.</span> <span id="s925">And then twice a week [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: And what -- did Herman say what he was afraid of?</span> <span id="s927">Why wouldn’t he go to Westerbork?</span> <span id="s928">Did he have a sense that something terrible was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah, th-that the German Jews committed suicide [indecipherable] that told us a lot.</span> <span id="s930">And we had over the years heard about the Kristallnacht, so we knew that Hitler -- it was not just any more words, before we thought it’s a big mouth, and words, but now they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: But you still don’t know that they’re killing Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: No idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I really think I found that out after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s936">So no rumors even coming through?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: We heard that there were -- no, that it was very bad, and that many people died, but we thought of hunger, and of dysentery, and of sicknesses.</span> <span id="s938">But that they were systematically killed --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: You had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: But I read a lot of books, and I think this is [indecipherable] Mila 18, that they think that people escaped [indecipherable], and I just got a few weeks ago, and I was shattered, and that was from a man, a real man, maybe you -- oh, what was his name, Kurt something, and he was [indecipherable] Christian in Germany, and he hated it, and he had to be a mi -- of the party, a member of the party to get a job, and he spoke out, and he was kicked of the party.</span> <span id="s941">And he got more and more [indecipherable] of the evil of the Nazi system.</span> <span id="s942">And yet, how can I actually do something?</span> <span id="s943">And he signed up with the SS, but every job that he had done -- I [indecipherable] to give you the name, because it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: It’s Gerstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Yeah, Kurt Gerstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Yeah, it’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s950">And you ne -- he even got to the Pope, and the Pope didn’t do a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And I think they got messages to England, to America, and nobody believed them.</span> <span id="s953">I can’t be -- oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Do you remember before Herman gets his letter that Jews had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s955">Do you remember seeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah, that’s what -- at the same time that they weren’t allowed to use the -- the trams, and the trains and everything any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s958">So it’s -- I think it’s difficult for people to understand how restricted life not only became for you, but even more so for the Jews, they couldn’t go to parks, they couldn’t go to -- be on the tram, except -- they couldn’t even go on the tram at all, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s962">And they weren’t allowed to go in parks, to concerts, they weren’t allowed anywhere, except they weren’t allowed t-to shop in the big stores, only their own Jewish stores, which of course got hardly any in supply.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No, it was really -- it was terrible.</span> <span id="s965">But later [indecipherable] I c -- I could identify with when they were looking for me, you know, that you couldn’t go here and there, and whatever, so -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s966">Oh, it was a terrible thing, and that really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: What are you seeing in your eyes, right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Well, I can’t understand really, that one human being can do [indecipherable] to another human being I mean, how hard would you have gotten inside?</span> <span id="s969">And then I heard that those [indecipherable] Germans who -- because here you are in a country where there is justice, it mightn’t always be carried out like we want to, and we’ve made mistakes, but the idea is a judge has to give a sentence that’s according to [indecipherable], and here -- and we can’t understand it, you were totally dependent on the guy who did your hearing, on his mood.</span> <span id="s970">If he had -- that morning had burned toast, he might sentence everybody to death that day.</span> <span id="s971">I mean, you were totally in their hands, and you had no -- there were no right, there was no right.</span> <span id="s972">It’s so terrible.</span> <span id="s973">And that you always have to watch out what you say, to whom you say it.</span> <span id="s974">It’s against anything that’s freedom.</span> <span id="s975">It’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Okay, you got a [indecipherable] again.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: When Herman came to you, and you and Hein talked about what to do, you had already started a group of some kind, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Or the -- actually the HEIN group --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: -- although it’s not have anything to do with --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: No, we were the -- I -- in the office where I worked, there was ma -- one man who was really fanatic patriot, and you know, I know what he did is -- we listened to the BBC news, and we took shorthand, and we typed it out and spread it, that’s what we felt we could do for the people who were scared and handed in their radios.</span> <span id="s986">And also, I know that this guy always took part of the Bible, and say, read that, and it was always from the Old Testament, you know, punishment, people who attacked Israel.</span> <span id="s987">So it was kind of a -- a stimulants, you know, y -- we do God’s will, because in the Old Testament was -- anyway it was the -- we were with a group, and there was an other man, and he was married to a Jewish lady, and he never -- that was the uncle of Herman, and he was also starting to be interested in helping those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Is that Ben?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: His name was Uncle Frits.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Uncle Frits.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: He’s probably -- Ohm Frits, he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s993">That’s F-r-i-t-s, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yeah, and he was -- we -- we were discussing what can we do, but till that time, really, the only thing we felt is spread the ne -- noi -- news of the BBC.</span> <span id="s995">But then, when they started on our Jews, n -- we knew was more important stuff to do.</span> <span id="s996">We still did that, but when we hid the Jews -- but then, it became difficult because an -- at the same time, because the Germans were occupying all Europe, and they had also drafted the women, they might be the first.</span> <span id="s997">But in Germany itself were only very old people, and very young people.</span> <span id="s998">And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and there were no of that age group.</span> <span id="s999">So then, in all the occupied countries, you might have heard that in Norway, and in France probably too, but was always a handsome young man, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair, big, blue eyes, come to Germany, terrific pay.</span> <span id="s1000">And that was on the walls, and in the papers everywhere.</span> <span id="s1001">And there was a lot of unemployment, but we didn’t want to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1002">And then, at the same time, that was when they started on the Jewish people, and because the people didn’t go to Germany, because we didn’t want to go to the country where -- a few will always go, for money, you know, but that’s a small percentage.</span> <span id="s1003">And then they got mad, and they said okay, you didn’t come when we invited you, now it’s forced labor.</span> <span id="s1004">And every male between 16 and 45 had to go, except from the Catholic church, a priest, and from the Protestant church, the pastors, and some teachers didn’t have to go, but a bunch had to go, because what they did, the people didn’t go, and then they surrounded, for instance, a high school.</span> <span id="s1005">Now, there are always boys of 16 - 17.</span> <span id="s1006">So they went in the morning happily to school and never came home, they were sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s1007">And the universities were all in that age group, so they were surrounded, and we had many Jewish professors, they have brains, and they were very beloved, and they were kicked out of their jobs, they weren’t allowed to have their jobs any more, so their students went on strike, and all -- they were -- so all the students, if they were -- they surrounded the university, and they were -- so then everything closed.</span> <span id="s1008">And so only girls went to school, and the university were closed, also out of protest, strike.</span> <span id="s1009">So some of the teachers had to go to -- and then they still didn’t want to go, so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16 and 45 has to go in hiding, and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1010">And they went in hiding, but a small group didn’t know where to go, mostly somewhere in your circle of family or friends, there is somebody where you can go and hide.</span> <span id="s1011">But those guys couldn’t come in the street any more, because you didn’t know if you saw a young man or a woman that they were Gestapo, so they were -- they really had to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s1012">But the thing was, because nobody went to Germany to work there, in the fields -- there was hunger in Germany, and they loaded in all the countries the trains full, and the food went all to Germany, and we had very little.</span> <span id="s1013">So they started a ration system with coupons, I have some in my -- you probably have seen them.</span> <span id="s1014">But anyway -- but the only way you got the coupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about a card this size, and it was so little, a German guy with an appetite wouldn’t even have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1015">And it was very little, but you only got it when you went to those offices.</span> <span id="s1016">And there were Dutch people working but the supervision all was kicked out, and all replaced by Germans.</span> <span id="s1017">And you only got your new card -- your new sou -- coupons if you showed your I.D.</span> <span id="s1018">So those young men between 16 and 45 never could get coupons again.</span> <span id="s1019">And the farmers, because you know in [indecipherable] they helped their own group, they did not help others, really, only the dental family -- the dentist family.</span> <span id="s1020">But many, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish people, and many groups were hiding, many.</span> <span id="s1021">Catholics, and Protestants, and Communists, everybody.</span> <span id="s1022">So, but those guys -- the farmers had already -- who dared to, had taken Jews, but then we had to go to villages and cities and say, will you take a Dutch guy.</span> <span id="s1023">And that was considered less dangerous than taking a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1024">But they told us we can’t, because we know they don’t get ration cards, and my own kid is asking for another slice of bread we can’t give him, and a potato.</span> <span id="s1025">We can’t feed an extra mouth.</span> <span id="s1026">If you don’t have ration cards, then they don’t get it.</span> <span id="s1027">And then from some other group, you know, at that time -- now people travel, but at that time, if a farmer and his wife lived here, and they had two sons, then they got farms close by.</span> <span id="s1028">They all stayed close by.</span> <span id="s1029">And nobody traveled, and all the mail they got might have been a bank statement, and a per -- something of their church, but they didn’t get any other mail.</span> <span id="s1030">And here we also made a big mistake, we put a father and mother here, and a son there, and a daughter there, and they started writing each other.</span> <span id="s1031">And that was for the mailman who delivered it, and the second letter, or the third letter, you have somebody here?</span> <span id="s1032">And that was suspicious.</span> <span id="s1033">And then, this was big news, there was no television at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer so and so gets all the time mail, so then they maybe think, do you have somebody, you get all the time mail, I hear from the mailman.</span> <span id="s1034">So they got scared, and some were arrested, farmers, and they have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Some of the farmers were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yeah, because they had also a side -- see they -- we had such a well registered country, every family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town hall.</span> <span id="s1037">And if a baby was born, the father had to go to the town hall, and say there’s a new baby, this name and that and that, and that went in a card system.</span> <span id="s1038">And if somebody died, you had to go, a card was taken out.</span> <span id="s1039">If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you had to report it, and the whole -- but that card system, at that time -- now they can’t do it any more, but everything was on it.</span> <span id="s1040">Your faith, your religion, your job, your whatever you were, your age.</span> <span id="s1041">So they had all the Jewish fing -- on their fingertips, that they knew exactly how many Jews we had.</span> <span id="s1042">And of course, then they saw that they were not showing up in the amount they had to show up, so they got mad.</span> <span id="s1043">And everywhere, like -- with -- for the labor, there were signs, if you help a Jew, you -- you will be treated as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1044">So then the farmers -- and some were betrayed because of the mail, and they got scared, because the I.D.s, the identification cards that we all had to have the end of ’44, the beginning of ’41, that had a big, fat, black J printed on it, too.</span> <span id="s1045">And they had gone to the farms with this thing, and then the farmers came to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal -- the false name then, “Diet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if there ever is a raid on our farm, that we can say, we didn’t know they were Jewish, we thought they were city people who were hungry, came here for being -- for better food.”</span> <span id="s1046">And then the people in the city said, “We will take the Dutch guys if you had ration cards.”</span> <span id="s1047">And then we were in a bind, because you know, by that time, I think we had hidden about 80 Jewish people all over.</span> <span id="s1048">And this -- the farmers were scared.</span> <span id="s1049">We got together, we were a real small group, and we knew all each other from long ago, and we were a Christian group, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can’t just now say good luck and find your own way.</span> <span id="s1050">We have to go on, but now we don’t know what to do any more.</span> <span id="s1051">And I remember I always was jealous of Moses, he got a manna from he -- and he got water from the rock, but the heavens did not open, and we did not get a whole bunch of cards.</span> <span id="s1052">And then the only way to get it was to take it, because, you know, there was no other way out, and it was really life and death for those people.</span> <span id="s1053">So then, after praying, it became clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the German offices.</span> <span id="s1054">Until that time, if you treated -- helped a Jew, you were treated as a Jew, but if you did a robbery on the German office, that was the death penalty.</span> <span id="s1055">And when I speak for high schools, or universities, I always say when I say this, “This is not advice kids,” I said, “but if you do an ar -- a robbery, you better have arms, and revolvers.”</span> <span id="s1056">And th-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at night, you know, big containers full of -- we had weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon was the death penalty.</span> <span id="s1057">So then it really became dangerous, and there were a few brave guys that were called the knockploegs, k-n-o-c-k ploeg.</span> <span id="s1058">And they volunteered to do that, every month again.</span> <span id="s1059">And we found always a village, or a somewhere, where we knew somebody was working, sa -- a Dutch person was good, and that we can make a dra -- a drawing, where are the guards [indecipherable] a guard, how many, is -- how is it locked, you know, that they had to shoot it open.</span> <span id="s1060">But that -- before they went in, that they knew the whole situation.</span> <span id="s1061">And then before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: This wa --was this your group, or this is another group that’s stealing for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: That -- were three guys who did it for all groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: For all groups?</span> <span id="s1065">Only three guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Well, later -- I knew three --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: But I -- there were more, and one later was arrested, and he was terrible tortured.</span> <span id="s1069">And I think then somebody else, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: -- there were many guys who were willing to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Well, let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1073">When Hein says I can go -- where are you -- you know, and find farmers, did he go to people he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Hein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: For the farmers, yeah, all people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: In that area.</span> <span id="s1078">So everyone at -- so he would just knock on the door --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: He went to those farmers, and then he had his best friend Ab, they were our two leaders, and Ab was eight years older.</span> <span id="s1080">And he had a job, he was a representative for a grain company, and Ab knew a whole other bunch of people.</span> <span id="s1081">See, Hein knew the parents of the children, but Ab knew all his customers, and he had a big territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: So he knew many places, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: And Ab’s name, his full name is Ab --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Albert van Meerveld.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: And was a street in his village in Barneveld named after him, he was also killed.</span> <span id="s1088">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: So these two, Hein and Ab were the two leaders of the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Ab -- were the two leaders of our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: And how many of you were in the group, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Now later, see, they were -- some were arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: -- and later we were around 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: And we had two places, Nijkerk and Barneveld, it was the ones that -- was Zwijndrecht, near Dorduf that was the other group.</span> <span id="s1097">And we met each other, and then we kind of merged.</span> <span id="s1098">They were decimated, we were decimated, and then together, but we always kept contact, but -- from the Zwijndrecht group, they did a lot in spying, and they got really order from England to blow up munitions stuff and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1100">Now, when you brought people to the farms, did you expect somehow everything would be okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: You didn’t?</span> <span id="s1103">Because you had an enormous amount of work to do in terms of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh, I remember I had once to bring a very Orthodox Jews from The Hague to Duchorn, that is a village outside Apeldoorn.</span> <span id="s1105">I had -- the man could have been, you know, in children’s Bibles, you see Father Abraham, real Jewish looking, oh he looked like that.</span> <span id="s1106">Was written all over him Jew.</span> <span id="s1107">And of -- in the first place, the stem had to -- star had to go out.</span> <span id="s1108">And this man was Orthodox, and later I learned he had his Tallit, you know, his prayer thing in his pocket and he lost it, and he wanted to go back for it, oh.</span> <span id="s1109">I had to twice change trains.</span> <span id="s1110">Miracles happened, because I had to bring him, his wife, and his 16 year old son first to Utrecht, there we had to switch to a train to Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s1111">In Amersfoort we had to switch to a train to Apeldoorn, and then we had to walk I don’t know how many miles to a -- a hotel that was in the woods, and the people had -- nobody had money any more, so they were totally broke, they had nothing.</span> <span id="s1112">So Hein and Ab went there, and they said -- they first sends them out if they were good, and they were good, you know, that they were por the Netherlands, and not Nazi.</span> <span id="s1113">And they said, well we can give you customers, and we will pay for that, and they have the ration cards and everything.</span> <span id="s1114">And it was so isolated, so we could bring a whole lot of Jewish people there, but on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1115">I was still working in my office, I had to bring this guy.</span> <span id="s1116">And he had a suitcase so heavy, that I don’t know -- have you ever read that an accident happens, and that it was in the -- in the paper some time ago, and it has happened several times, and that one woman is under the car, and the other woman passed, and it was life or death and she lifted the car, have you ever heard of such thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Now, I said a prayer.</span> <span id="s1119">I couldn’t get that suitcase, I said, “God, this is all they have in this right world,” and I could lift that suitcase, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s1120">And then in -- then we si -- went from one train to the other, the guy loses his Tallit, and he wanted to go back, I said -- I told him beforehand, I said, “Listen, you sit here.”</span> <span id="s1121">Martin, his son had to sit there, and his wife there, and I am there.</span> <span id="s1122">I said, and if you are -- I gave him a newspaper, I said, “The whole trip, keep that in front of your face, because that is,” -- and I said, “if you are arrested there is no point that [indecipherable] and I go on with your wife and son.”</span> <span id="s1123">But these were horrible things.</span> <span id="s1124">And we got there, oh, and then I went to my sister, and we had to walk, and we walked into the woods, oh, no, and another night they had told that if I came at 11 PM at the certain station, again Amersfoort, there would be a cab, or a car, and two elderly people, and there was nobody.</span> <span id="s1125">Oh, no, no, it was -- it was more a miracle if it went all right.</span> <span id="s1126">It was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: I would imagine it was, because you have people’s lives in your hands all the time.</span> <span id="s1128">How did you bring -- let’s just talk about Herman for a moment.</span> <span id="s1129">Herman gets a card to go to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s1130">How many days does he have?</span> <span id="s1131">A few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: He had quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: He did have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Because then he was really not ready, and he told Rosa, and I still see Rosa all the time, she is a sweetheart, she’s now -- she’s a few years older than I am.</span> <span id="s1135">And she says I -- just when I heard it I said, I will go.</span> <span id="s1136">And so she was really the first one, although we had offered it to Herman, and she went alone to Amersfoort, and there they picked her up and brought her to the farm.</span> <span id="s1137">And she was there a long time, but then became the -- she sor -- she was wandering a lot, and then here, and then there, and she was really half dating a non-Jewish guy, and later she was in the part in Zwijndrecht.</span> <span id="s1138">But she said, “When I closed the door behind me, I really had no idea that I never s -- would see my parents again, and how dangerous it would be.”</span> <span id="s1139">You know we -- we -- we all underestimated the danger, I think, and maybe it was a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Maybe, because maybe you wouldn’t have done it if you really knew the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: That’s what I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1142">I think later we were willing to [indecipherable] so that we will be [indecipherable] they were looking for me under two names.</span> <span id="s1143">And then I was arrested on my third name, and I knew if they found out who I really was, was the end.</span> <span id="s1144">And you know, I can honestly say, and this sound crazy, I have three times I -- that I thought it’s the end of my life, and I was so young, and at home my wedding dress was hanging.</span> <span id="s1145">And I think you get a special grace from God, you can say it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1146">And that’s a way when it’s over, because sometimes I thing now I’m not as close to God as I was then, but I think when it’s my time, I’ll get it again.</span> <span id="s1147">You know, it’s -- but I think when you really feel you have to, you want to live like God wants you to live, that’s -- and you just do it and trust.</span> <span id="s1148">Well, it’s not always easy to do the right things, that’s what I tell the young kids when I go to schools and universities, that whole life’s making choices.</span> <span id="s1149">You every day will do a fork in the road, and I say pick the right road.</span> <span id="s1150">And that might ask sacrifices.</span> <span id="s1151">And I had to speak for the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, about two and a half years ago, or three years ago, and I said to those guys, I said, “In the profession you have chosen, it might easily be that you have to make the highest sacrifice, your life.”</span> <span id="s1152">And I think, who knows now [indecipherable] how many of those guys have already given that sacrifice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: But your belief in God during that wartime period when you started --</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: -- was absolutely essential to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: I can tell you, if I had [indecipherable] Psalms, oh, David went through everything in this life.</span> <span id="s1157">And when I read those Psalms you know, I thought oh, I don’t know, there is a Psalm 27, the lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear, and I thought, yeah, that’s scary.</span> <span id="s1158">I was fee -- and then it said, when an army comes against me -- because David was fleeing for Saul, and then he wrote it, and he said, when an army comes up against me, he will put me on a rock, and he will hide me [indecipherable] and I also, I always knew that’s what God is doing with me, I mean really I shouldn’t be sitting here, so many of my friends were killed, so I feel that I was spared for a purpose, and you have to find a purpose, and have the time all to see the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: I have to try.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Did you read the Bible during this period, or did you know so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: No, you did -- not allowed to have anything, so it’s good that in our church we had -- we went to the Christian school, and every Monday morning we had to learn a little part of the Psalms, so Monday -- Su-Sunday night, I could easily learn, so my parents didn’t have to bother, but later I was -- you know, we hated all that we had to do that.</span> <span id="s1163">And [indecipherable], oh, what a lucky thing because it came all back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: It came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: You know, I -- I -- I would have gone absolutely -- I think I would have been in [indecipherable] in an institution if I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: If you didn’t have the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Because later, in that concentration camp [indecipherable] it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So Diet, tell me -- I don’t know, th-there wasn’t a normal day, but once the people, th -- these Jewish families are put, either singly or together, on a farm, then what is your responsibility, and the responsibility of your group?</span> <span id="s1169">What did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Now, we brought the mail along, because that was what they were living on, the mail from their children, we -- so, because the po --</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: So they didn’t go through the normal mail system because it was too dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No, because that was so suspicious for the mailman, and then also, the Gestapo opened if they thought that somebody is suspicious, they opened the mail, so that was double.</span> <span id="s1173">And I had to see that every month, even if it was at the farm, the food was scarce, and bad, so they still wanted raf -- the ration cards, so after the robberies, we had to see every month, with every Jewish, and if it was very poor people, we gave them two cards or so.</span> <span id="s1174">And we had to, if an address became unsafe, you had to find another place and transport them.</span> <span id="s1175">And that one Jewish guy, who was our falsifier, in normal life he had been a draftsman, and he was terrific, he falsified everything, so he had a room with his wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Is this Ben?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: [indecipherable] where I later was a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Wha -- what was his name?</span> <span id="s1179">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: His name was Uncle Ben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Ben, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Uncle Ben, yeah.</span> <span id="s1183">Kanis was their last name.</span> <span id="s1184">And he was very good, and I was often there, because this one had to have a new paper, and that one had to new paper, so we were constantly busy.</span> <span id="s1185">And at the farms, you know, that was very smart because they had little kids.</span> <span id="s1186">And the neighbors, the doors were always open, you walk in and out.</span> <span id="s1187">So the little kids were told to say, neighbor, we have buurman, that’s the man, and buurvrouw, that’s the woman, you say here neighbor.</span> <span id="s1188">But it was just so if the little kids talked about the neighbors, the -- the real neighbors didn’t really -- were not surprised because they thought, oh, they’re talking about that -- you know, you had to think of everything when you had little kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: How often would you go to these farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: At least once a month, but mostly more.</span> <span id="s1191">And because you know, for the cards, but at some -- and also, I was allowed to sleep there, so even if I had nothing to do there, but I was in that area, then I could always sleep in, on the bed somewhere [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Was it easier for a woman to be traveling around doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah, the men could always be stopped for the forced labor.</span> <span id="s1194">And so after the first robbery, because all our men were in that age group --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: -- Hein was, I think, 22 probably, his brother was a year younger, 23, and Ab was in his 30’s.</span> <span id="s1197">So they would right away have been -- so, but after the first robbery, we could give -- all the Jews went without a J, and Uncle Ben was working like crazy.</span> <span id="s1198">And all our guys took also new, and they were all pastors, so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: They were all pastors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Because they didn’t have to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1201">So then, when they were stopped in the train, and it happened regularly, they were pastors, so then they could go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: So if there were 15 people in your group, did all 15 go around giving out these -- the ration cards, and the I.D. papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Well, I worked mainly in -- in Felmaloond, around Amersfoort and Utrecht.</span> <span id="s1204">But in the south they had other things too, because they were really -- yeah, I know that there they got orders from England, that was a secret sender that they had to blow up a munition depot, or a bridge, or something.</span> <span id="s1205">So they did also Jewish people, but they -- they spread it.</span> <span id="s1206">Some they [indecipherable] and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: But that -- this was a totally different group, that wasn’t your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No, we merged --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Your group was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: We merged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: That was the group you merged with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: But you didn’t want to do anything that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I didn’t want to do any killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Any killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Or sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: And when we were in the beginning, they asked us -- they asked us tha -- Hein had to go right away in hiding in 1940 already.</span> <span id="s1219">And he was put in a house, and the girl was engaged, they said, to an Italian.</span> <span id="s1220">And then all of a sudden another guy said that Italian is pro-Nazi, that’s dangerous.</span> <span id="s1221">So then they brought Hein to another house, and that guy -- anyway, they said that Italian was dangerous, and they asked us -- that was a Communist group, and they asked us to stab him on a dark night in the back, and kill him, and throw him in a canal.</span> <span id="s1222">And we were not convinced that you have to be -- I could do -- I couldn’t do it, but I could let a guy from the -- who had the guns, I could ask him, and then they will do it.</span> <span id="s1223">But I wasn’t convinced that he was such a traitor.</span> <span id="s1224">But later they asked me in the German interview, if you absolutely had known that’s a traitor, and he asked, “Could you then have?”</span> <span id="s1225">I said, not myself, but then I -- if I [indecipherable] you, he would betray a lot of people, and had betrayed, then I could say yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So you could get someone else to kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Because ho-how many lives would be saved then, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: So.</span> <span id="s1230">No, I -- I just wanted to -- but it had to be done now and then.</span> <span id="s1231">It’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Were you working at the same time you were in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: No, in ’43, H-Hein asked me, I think the end of ’42, he says -- in The Hague, he says, “I have met a guy, and he is also with a group.”</span> <span id="s1234">He said, “and he has an address ra -- that is desperate,” and he says to me, “don’t you go there.”</span> <span id="s1235">He says, “but it’s very dangerous,” it was in the heart of The Hague, he says, “and they won’t even let you in that house, you have to have a password.”</span> <span id="s1236">So he give me the password.</span> <span id="s1237">So I went there with it -- the password, and if you think that we had two you -- Jews on this farm, and one there, and one there, all spread out, and I remember I had to go up the stairs, and I say the password, and they let me in, and that was a house, a little apartment in the middle of a big apartment house, and it was built for one person, one living room, one bedroom, a shower and a bath, a kitchen -- small kitchen, and a hall, that is all.</span> <span id="s1238">And this woman, that was in her 40’s -- in her 50’s, Mies, Mies was her name.</span> <span id="s1239">And she had 27 Jews in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: This is on Reinkenstraat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: On the Reinkenstraat 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s1243">Ri -- rik -- Reinkenstraat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Oh, and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1245">And I said, “You will be arrested.”</span> <span id="s1246">I said, “Do you know your neighbors, are they Nazis?”</span> <span id="s1247">She said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1248">And then when I talked to her, I saw she had a warm heart, she had to help, but she did not use her gray matter.</span> <span id="s1249">And she didn’t see the danger, and she -- her father was a Dutch guy, and her mother was from Indonesia.</span> <span id="s1250">And I don’t know if you spoke with the people that -- Indonesians speak staccato, and she’s, “I feel so sorry for those people, and on Saturday night I put records on, and then they may dance.”</span> <span id="s1251">Oh dear lord, I said, “And you lived here all those years alone?”</span> <span id="s1252">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1253">“How long?”</span> <span id="s1254">“Eight years.”</span> <span id="s1255">I said, “Did you dance when you were alone on Saturday night?”</span> <span id="s1256">Because I could hear in the apartment next door, it was not insulated very well, and at one I heard that they flushed the toilet, so I heard the water go through the pipes, I said, “Do you hear that?”</span> <span id="s1257">She said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1258">She didn’t think -- I said, “Now, when you lived alone, how many times did you flush the toilet, that the neighbors can hear it?”</span> <span id="s1259">I said, “Now you’re 28 people, that thing must be going the whole day.”</span> <span id="s1260">I said, “You have to,” -- and she didn’t see at all.</span> <span id="s1261">And I promised her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: I -- we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: So, we’re going to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Mies, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: -- right back to this the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Diet, I’m sorry for the interruption.</span> <span id="s1270">So you’re -- you’re at Mies’s apartment, and you’re noticing that she’s taking no precautions.</span> <span id="s1271">So the toilet can flush, God only knows how many times during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: She’s playing music, and people are dancing.</span> <span id="s1274">Now how did -- how -- why were you sent to her house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Because Hein asked me, and Hein had met the guy who brought all the Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: His name was Bram, I think an a -- abbreviation for Abraham.</span> <span id="s1278">And later that -- that guy -- but he did not have the help we had, the ka -- the ration cards, and he didn’t know what to do, he brought them there, but there they were stuck.</span> <span id="s1279">So Ab promised Mies to find places, and I said, “Listen, I’ll bring you in the first place 27 cards without a J, and I’ll bring you ration cards, and then I’ll find places, and keep two, at the most three, and that’s how maybe you will see it.”</span> <span id="s1280">Because she didn’t see the danger.</span> <span id="s1281">And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Was she just naïve, or stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yeah -- she couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s1284">She --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: She just couldn’t say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: She couldn’t say no, and she had a golden heart, but she did not see the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: How did she feed 27 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Well, that was -- that we brought the cards, and this Bram brought there bags of potatoes, and brought stuff what he could get on the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: But -- but the ration cards for the food, she can’t go out with 27 cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: No, but she had a maid, a young girl from Strafenhaagen -- Strafenhaagen, that’s a difficult word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: And before that was her cleaning lady, but now her whole thing was that four cards she could take, and buy there, and she was in on it, and four there, and five there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: So that girl was daily doing the shopping, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: And going to different places, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: -- I think that the Jewish people cleaned a bit.</span> <span id="s1297">But this girl was only sent out to do shopping in all different places, for four, five or six, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: And that was her -- and she only worked there till one o’clock, and I always came after five, and her name was Jaantje.</span> <span id="s1300">And I have never met Jaantje, and I heard so much about her, and Jaantje heard so much about me.</span> <span id="s1301">And now for the German fer -- film, we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: For the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Imagi -- yeah [indecipherable] was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1305">So, did you find places for these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Yeah, I found -- that was that guy that lost his Tallit, and loads of them, and I brought them away, and I had her down to seven, and I started a big sigh, I thought, now we get somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: And I got back the next time, and she had eight new ones, 15.</span> <span id="s1309">And a few weeks later she had again in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s1310">And I thought, this is desperate, and I said to her, “Mies, I’m scared to come here, because if there,” -- I said, “you will be arrested, there’s no doubt in my mind.”</span> <span id="s1311">I said, “And you know,” -- when you were arrested, what the Gestapo did is they didn’t just take you away.</span> <span id="s1312">They let you sit there, and of course you were part of a group, and with a revolver near your head, if the phone rang you had to take it, and just pretend that there was nothing, and the next one would come, and the next one.</span> <span id="s1313">So I knew about it.</span> <span id="s1314">I said, “Listen, I’ll give you one word, potato,” or something, or sugar, something easy, I said, “and I call you a few minutes before I come here, every time.</span> <span id="s1315">I’m scared.”</span> <span id="s1316">I said, “One day the Gestapo sits here, and I walk in their open arms.”</span> <span id="s1317">I said, “And I won’t -- that if you answer me that you use this word,” -- I can’t remember what I gave her, but something very simple.</span> <span id="s1318">I says, “And if you don’t say that word, I’m not coming.</span> <span id="s1319">That means for me the Gestapo is here.”</span> <span id="s1320">But I wasn’t there, but Bram was there, and Bram was that guy who had brought all the Jews there, and he was just bringing a big bag with potatoes and food, and he had asked Hein, he said, “I know that Diet doesn’t want to give her name to,” -- Mies didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1321">I said, “Mies, I don’t tell you what,” -- she wanted to know who I was, said call me Toos.</span> <span id="s1322">Where do you live?</span> <span id="s1323">I said, “I’m not telling you.”</span> <span id="s1324">I said but -- she said, “But if I need you, what can -- how can,” -- I said, “I’ll call you the moment I get up in the morning.</span> <span id="s1325">I’ll call you an hour before my lunch break, and I could come here on my bike in my lunch break,” I said.</span> <span id="s1326">“And I’ll call you two or three hours before curfew, and if you need me, I’ll be here.”</span> <span id="s1327">I was there for weeks on end, I don’t know, months maybe, four or five times a week.</span> <span id="s1328">The old Jew of -- in her eight -- in -- in his 80’s, died.</span> <span id="s1329">Can you imagine, how you have to bury that guy, I think it’s in the book.</span> <span id="s1330">But I tol -- Hein was fortunately in The Hague, because he was often not there.</span> <span id="s1331">He said, “Oh, I’ll take care of it.”</span> <span id="s1332">So they wrapped him in a rug, and everybody was changing, your beautiful crystal -- what do you do with crystal, you need to eat, so they went to the farmers and exchanged it for grain, or whatever, and so when Hein and his friend carried that rug out, the neighbors must have thought, oh he’s exchan -- getting a rug for potatoes, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: And they had a hand car, and they pushed it.</span> <span id="s1335">And I didn’t want to know anything that I didn’t have to know, because I was so afraid that one day I would be arrested, that they will do -- one of their tortures was pulling your nails one by one, and then your feet, and anything, I thought I -- only what I have to know, I don’t want to know anything else.</span> <span id="s1336">And I said to Hein -- Hein said we should bury him in a big [indecipherable] close to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1337">That man was good and he had a big -- a walled garden, and we were -- they were allowed to bury him in the back of that garden [indecipherable] and after the war you can bury him in a Jewish cemetery, because the Jewish people like that.</span> <span id="s1338">And I never asked him, and I had such a conscience trouble when Hein never came back, I thought, oh, I should have asked him.</span> <span id="s1339">And when I spoke to that Dutch guy from the resistance, he says, “Do you have questions,” because he had questions about a traitor, and I knew something about it.</span> <span id="s1340">And I said, “Yeah,” I said, “that Jewish guy,” -- and he said, “Don’t worry, he was buried in the Jewish cemetery,” so that was good that I know that.</span> <span id="s1341">But then -- then she had so many, and one day Bram was there, and they were all arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: They were all arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: They were all arrested, and I made my phone call, and I had told Mies, she had -- she let them use the phone, I said, “No, you shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1344">You -- you’re living as a lady alone in your 50’s, and you answer the phone.”</span> <span id="s1345">I said, “You can’t -- you’re too -- too dangerous.”</span> <span id="s1346">So she had obeyed that, and I dialed and a man answered, and it was 11, so I thought an hour before my lunch time, I thought there she goes again.</span> <span id="s1347">So I hung up, I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s1348">And then around two o’clock I phoned, and a man answered.</span> <span id="s1349">At three o’clock I phoned, a man answered.</span> <span id="s1350">I thought, this is not good.</span> <span id="s1351">So I took one of my coupons, and I went to a store across, a food store, and I thought, if that has happened, I knew how they did it, big trucks with guys with machine guns, and helmets, and the house surrounded, and so on.</span> <span id="s1352">And I thought that will be the topic of conversation there.</span> <span id="s1353">So I took my bread coupon, and I went there with money, and sure enough they were all talking about that there are -- they were all arrested, and Bram, too.</span> <span id="s1354">And then Hein and I -- I didn’t dare to sleep at home, because I had never given Mies where I was, but I did not know that Bram had been there, see?</span> <span id="s1355">I’d never met Bram.</span> <span id="s1356">I didn’t know</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: But he knew you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: He never met me, but he had my father’s phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Because Hein had asked, if there is an emergency, how can I reach you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: And Hein had given Bram only my phone number --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: -- but he had never met, and he didn’t know where I lived, he only had my phone number.</span> <span id="s1365">But he was the only one, so it must have been him.</span> <span id="s1366">But anyway, that night I thought well, I don’t know where I slipped up with Mi-Mies that she still found out where I was, so I didn’t sleep home, and I let Hein know, and he slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1367">And this went on for maybe 10 days, and nothing happened, so I moved back home.</span> <span id="s1368">And then co --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Was that the first time that you left the house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: That I slept --</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: -- I went regularly to the office, but I didn’t sleep at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: And -- because I thought, you know, I can’t take the risk.</span> <span id="s1375">And when weeks later, Hein and I had decided we would get married, and we took out our wedding license, and then you have to go again to the town hall, so on my card was written took out a wedding license with Hein Sietsma, on his card, Diet Eman.</span> <span id="s1376">And also, it was very strange, that was May ’43, May fourth, and I had a real feeling -- our love had grown so much, but something in my heart said, “And you’ll never marry him.”</span> <span id="s1377">Strange, huh?</span> <span id="s1378">Very strange.</span> <span id="s1379">And I thought -- I can’t see that we ever would break off, but -- and I didn’t dare to tell him.</span> <span id="s1380">And then, a few weeks later, we had just taken out our wedding license, and that -- the town hall in The Hague was a big, very [indecipherable] with marble steps, and I think that by that time, I had told him.</span> <span id="s1381">I said, “Well, it must be true, but,” I said, “I always had the feeling we would never get married.”</span> <span id="s1382">And [indecipherable] there is only one thing, either you die, or I die.</span> <span id="s1383">He said, “Do you have that feeling?”</span> <span id="s1384">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1385">I didn’t dare to say -- I didn’t know what, but it was somewhere -- subconscious.</span> <span id="s1386">And when we walked down those marble step, and he had bought me a big bunch of red roses, and I had them in this arm, and he had my arm, and in his left hand he had the papers that we will get married in September, because then you got coupons for [indecipherable] and for some [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1387">And I remember that he take my [indecipherable] and he said, “Don’t you still now believe it?”</span> <span id="s1388">And I said, “Now I believe it.”</span> <span id="s1389">And inside a voice was screaming no, no [indecipherable] it was so strange, it -- it’s scary.</span> <span id="s1390">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Was this before or after the bicycle trip where you heard this voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: It was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: It was before the bicycle trip.</span> <span id="s1394">So this happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: In ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: It started slowly to -- inside.</span> <span id="s1398">Strange, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: That -- that it wouldn’t -- it wouldn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: I -- I -- I’m really scared when I have those feelings.</span> <span id="s1401">Some time ago, I had a terrible feeling -- that same feeling, so had me like a stone, and it concerned my kids.</span> <span id="s1402">And then -- my daughter doesn’t ever want to upset me, and a week later I found out that she had to have a biopsy, she had done a pap test, and it was not good, and she had to biopsy.</span> <span id="s1403">And that was -- that I -- it turned out that they don’t really know, so she has to have another test, and these doctors [indecipherable] she goes to another one.</span> <span id="s1404">But it’s very strange, and you know from the book that the night that Hein died --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: It’s horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: It’s horrible.</span> <span id="s1408">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: And only with big things in my life, I have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Not small?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: No, not little things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And then on a bicycle trip you heard a voice, and what did the voice say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Twice.</span> <span id="s1414">The voice said, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem.</span> <span id="s1415">Have a -- have a good look at him.</span> <span id="s1416">Strange, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: It’s scary.</span> <span id="s1419">It’s scary.</span> <span id="s1420">On the other hand, I think that God may be preparing me [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: It was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: That God maybe prepares me for something that’s coming, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1423">But anyway, then we went home, and then a few weeks later, that’s when Mies was arrested, and that I didn’t sleep home.</span> <span id="s1424">But then, after that, when they -- my father wrote of my brother -- he had false papers that he was in the food supply.</span> <span id="s1425">He opened the door, and there were two Gestapo guys, but he didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1426">First they pretended that they needed me for somebody who needed to go in hiding, but my brother didn’t fall for that, because they didn’t come to your door and ask for a place.</span> <span id="s1427">So then -- and one didn’t even speak good Dutch, he was German.</span> <span id="s1428">And then, in the end they said, “Well, where does she work, we need to speak to her, and it’s very urgent.”</span> <span id="s1429">And he had to [indecipherable] where I worked.</span> <span id="s1430">So the moment they had left, they called me and they said that two guys, they can’t speak good Dutch, and they were needing to speak to me, and it must be Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1431">So I picked up my purse, and you know, I always think before you ask your boss, may I go to the dentist, I’ll be back in an hour.</span> <span id="s1432">And I worked for the father of my pi -- young girlfriend, who -- when we were young, and I knocked at his door, and I said, “I have to leave, and I’ll see you after the war.”</span> <span id="s1433">So I picked up, and I never went home again.</span> <span id="s1434">And that was May, ’43.</span> <span id="s1435">So for two years, till the end of the war, because the Gestapo came all the time to my parent’s house, I couldn’t go home any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: So then what do you do?</span> <span id="s1437">You leave your -- you -- you leave your office, where do you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: I went straight to Hein’s office, because then they knew about him, too, we had taken out a wedding license.</span> <span id="s1439">So then he went, and he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: He’s working at Shell, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: He was working at Shell.</span> <span id="s1442">And he went to Ab, the other leader, and I went first to some friends, and then later -- my sister had just had a baby, she was married, and they never -- they were so busy, so she says to -- I -- I went there on my bike, and she says, “Oh, can’t you stay here four or five days, and take care of the kids?”</span> <span id="s1443">The young kids.</span> <span id="s1444">And then my husband and I can go out and have some time for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1445">So I stayed there I think a week.</span> <span id="s1446">And then the guy where we always had the meetings, the patriot from our country -- from our office.</span> <span id="s1447">I was in The Hague with another address and I saw him, and his wife said, “My sister in Eindhoven needs a maid, and she’s very difficult, and she goes through maids like nothing.</span> <span id="s1448">I can ask her if you can be there.”</span> <span id="s1449">And I’d never been in that setting, so I thought, hey that’s totally no connection.</span> <span id="s1450">They might still connect my sister.</span> <span id="s1451">So anyway, then she said oh yeah, she needed a maid.</span> <span id="s1452">And she had three kids, and the youngest had a -- I’ve forgotten the name, here, or tosis or something.</span> <span id="s1453">He had that he had to measure od -- my friend [indecipherable] from the office had a son who was mentally retarded.</span> <span id="s1454">And they found out as a little kid he should have had loads and loads of fat, and butter.</span> <span id="s1455">But it was a d -- a disease that they had just discovered, and the kid of this sister had that same disease.</span> <span id="s1456">So every day on how you weigh the mail, the -- the envelopes, so much grams of grease and fat and butter he had to eat.</span> <span id="s1457">And very little other things, so much bread.</span> <span id="s1458">But it was all measured.</span> <span id="s1459">So she had her hands full, and she was -- she had a good sense of humor, but she was a difficult woman, and that’s why she went through so many maid.</span> <span id="s1460">But that little boy’s name was Rudy, and he was three years old, and he was a sweetheart.</span> <span id="s1461">And I had to take care of him, and it was terrible because it was so important that he got all that fat, and he never got mentally retarded if he had -- if he vomited, I had to scoop it up and feed it again to him.</span> <span id="s1462">And his mother couldn’t get it in, but I did all crazy things with him, and then he started laughing, and he ate it.</span> <span id="s1463">So -- but I was there a long time, and she was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1464">And I was not a maid, you know, I had never -- when I left my home I didn’t even know how to boil a potato.</span> <span id="s1465">So the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: So were you -- were you required to cook, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Well, she did the cooking, but I had to clean and do the whole thing, so -- but I learned there a lot, and later on the farms I learned so much, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: But just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: I started out there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: You didn’t have your real name then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: No, then I was Dineke de Jong, that was -- but I didn’t go because I knew one family there whose son was also in the resistance, but I didn’t -- for them, that they were in risk that they had somebody in hiding, so I never went to that church or anything.</span> <span id="s1472">But I remember it was a very close by, it was on the [indecipherable] in Eindhoven, and there was -- at the other end of that plane is a plaza, and a park with trees, and there was a Catholic church.</span> <span id="s1473">And sometimes I was so deep down in the dumps that I just -- and the Catholic church are always open.</span> <span id="s1474">Oh [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1475">But anyway, I was there a long time, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Were you also working as -- in the resistance, or were you just being a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: No, this was just -- I was there several months.</span> <span id="s1478">No, I was just a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: But here you -- you don’t know anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No, I was totally alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1482">You can’t communicate with your parents.</span> <span id="s1483">Are you able to communicate with Hein or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Hein and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Hein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: -- wrote each other on false names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1489">So I got mail from him.</span> <span id="s1490">And I also send him mail that he gave to other guys from our group, and some of them were in The Hague, and not being looked for, so my parents got always, every 10 or 12 days, a note in my handwriting, that they knew I was alive, but I did not let them know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: It was much better.</span> <span id="s1493">And I did also not write neither father and mother, of course you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Just -- but they saw in my -- and one of the guys always dropped that off [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: And none of this is done through the regular mail system --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: -- you’re doing this always through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: [indecipherable] handling, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: But the letters to Hein I sent to an address and mailed by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Regular post?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: -- you know, my friends, where I knew that he was often in that area.</span> <span id="s1504">And he send me at this address, because I was there, the maid under the name Dineke de Jong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: But -- but he -- neither -- you’re not sending anything through the regular post, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: The dangerous stuff, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: But the normal letter you could send?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Well, we did at this time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: But we did not do it at -- if I was at an address where there are Jews hidden, I wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: But here there was no really danger, he was very high in the council, city council, he was right under the mayor.</span> <span id="s1513">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1514">And I loved the Rudy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Rudy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: It was Eindhoven, yeah, and that was so often bombarded because that’s where Phillips is, you know, and that was the war industry then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: -- so and I had my order, I slept on the same floor as Rudy, so if Rudy -- if there was a bombardment, we all had to go down, then I took care of Rudy, and they had the two other kids.</span> <span id="s1519">But then one time I got a letter from Hein, and it said, “Diet, we haven’t seen each other in such a long time, let’s go to Amsterdam, to friends of ours, and let’s meet.”</span> <span id="s1520">And it was a city just outside Duga, so he would come from Friesland, I would -- and the train would be four or five minutes that we will change trains and go to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1521">And it was a s -- it was -- I had to meet him on Saturday, and on Sunday we would be together.</span> <span id="s1522">And that lady, I was really the maid to her, and she says, “You can’t go, because Sunday after church I’ve invited this lady, and you have to serve coffee.”</span> <span id="s1523">So I couldn’t go for serving coffee, that stupid hour that I couldn’t see Hein.</span> <span id="s1524">So I said, “He won’t take that,” because I know -- I knew him, I says, “He will be furious.”</span> <span id="s1525">“Oh, how childish.”</span> <span id="s1526">I said, “No, he counts on me, and there’s no time to reach him.”</span> <span id="s1527">I couldn’t reach him anyway, he’s traveling.</span> <span id="s1528">She said, “Well, then you can go to the city,” it was called Sonnhooven, “and you can tell him that you can’t come in, you have to come back.”</span> <span id="s1529">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1530">And I was so grateful that those people were hiding me while I was being searched for, because my parents had all the time the Gestapo over the [indecipherable], so it was dangerous, but I was so grateful that I felt I had to do what she said.</span> <span id="s1531">So I take the train -- I never forget it, I came in Sonnhooven, and Hein came out of his train, and there was the train to Amsterdam, and he had three or four minutes, and he grabs my hand, he says dos -- I said, “No I can’t go.”</span> <span id="s1532">He said, “Come on, you can tell me later.”</span> <span id="s1533">I said, “No, I can’t go.”</span> <span id="s1534">And I pulled back, and oh, he was furious, furious.</span> <span id="s1535">And he said, “For that stupid coffee,” he said, “you’re going away there,” he said, “I’ll find another address, you’re going away.”</span> <span id="s1536">And I felt so bad because after all, they had taken me when I was in big trouble, and I had gotten to love Rudy, and then Hein says to me, “Diet, we need you really full time, it’s getting more and more busy.”</span> <span id="s1537">So I went back to Eindhoven, and she said, “And what?”</span> <span id="s1538">I said, “Well, like I told you, he was furious, and I have to leave here.”</span> <span id="s1539">“What?”</span> <span id="s1540">And they couldn’t believe it, and then they were trying to -- I said, “No, they say that they need me.”</span> <span id="s1541">And that was very hard, and I left, and I’ve never seen Rudy again, none of them.</span> <span id="s1542">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: What was their name, what was the family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Wait a moment, what was it again?</span> <span id="s1545">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Was it Bakker, Backer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Baker, yeah, Baker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: B-a-k-k-e-r?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Yeah, yeah, Bakker, Bakker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: So you never saw any of them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: And you were there for a few months, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: I was there I think a month, two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: So in the summertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: I was in -- made attempt to find me, and then I was first of all [indecipherable] and I was at my sister.</span> <span id="s1556">I think I went there in June or July, at that time.</span> <span id="s1557">And I left in the beginning of December, so I was there several months.</span> <span id="s1558">And it’s almost nice because they -- it was in an outside area, and there were apple trees, and there was nothing any more, so sometimes I had a job that I had to on my bike go to an apple thing and buy apples.</span> <span id="s1559">It was nice, and beautiful country, and outside on your bike and alone, that you could think, and -- but then I went for a time in the underground, and there was a family with five kids -- seven kids, and that guy was also deep in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: And this was Klooster?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: That was Klooster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Dries?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Dries Klooster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: It’s Klooster?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Klooster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Klooster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: K-l-o-o-s-t-e-r, Dries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: And he worked in the post office, and he was a great guy, but h -- the youngest was two, then they had one of five, seven, nine and then two kids from her first marriage that were my age, and a bit younger.</span> <span id="s1570">So there were a lot of kids, and then I could, during the day do my underground work, but I slept there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: And they knew that you were working for the underground --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: They knew, because he was also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: He was also -- and they took pilots in, and shot down allies.</span> <span id="s1575">And that was the most dangerous because you know, for armed robbery you got still prison and a trial, but you were shot.</span> <span id="s1576">But if they were found -- if they found you with allies, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: On the spot, you were killed</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: On the spot, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: I know from several cases that it happened.</span> <span id="s1581">Sometimes they still arrested you, but they had a right to shoot you at the spot.</span> <span id="s1582">But we had pilots, and it was a terrible danger, and there was your word, but now everybody knows that we had never heard it okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1583">And those pilots, three or four from a shot down plane, they were talking to each other, and okay, and I knew English, so I could speak with them, but those kids went outside in the street at five, seven and nine, and they said okay, okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1584">That was a give-away that there were allies, so I thought, I can’t stay here, and I told them.</span> <span id="s1585">And then Hein found another place on this farm, with co -- with Lozeman.</span> <span id="s1586">And that was where the Jewish couple, the falsifier was hiding.</span> <span id="s1587">So that became really my base, but wherever I was, I had friends by that time I could use everywhere, but that was -- became my base.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Lozeman, which is L-o-z-e-m-a-n?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Lozeman, L-o-z-e-m-a-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: And his name was Aalt, A-a-l-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: And her name was Alie, A-l-i-e.</span> <span id="s1594">And they became like a brother and sister to me.</span> <span id="s1595">Oh, they were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1596">And that’s where the Jewish couple was hiding, and they had always -- whoever passed by and was in the underground could sleep there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: And this was Uncle Ben and Tante Marie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: And Tante Marie, yeah, they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: And he was a dairy farmer, and they work hard.</span> <span id="s1601">And it was, for a city girl, very interesting, too.</span> <span id="s1602">And Alie said, “You are for the world my maid,” because she was pregnant again, and she had two little kids.</span> <span id="s1603">So I se -- but I could go for my work, but I said, “You tell me, I can arrange it myself, which date you really need me.”</span> <span id="s1604">And you got so little soap, so every three weeks you did a laundry, and at that time the people changed only once a week their underwear.</span> <span id="s1605">Their socks were [indecipherable], you could put them on the floor, and they would stand.</span> <span id="s1606">But there was -- you got -- and the soap was like putty, brown and stone hard, so you first had to grate it.</span> <span id="s1607">And there was so little that it was better to do the [indecipherable] three weeks.</span> <span id="s1608">So then I always was there on Monday.</span> <span id="s1609">And then the farmer woke me up at quarter to five.</span> <span id="s1610">And they had a well and a pump on that deel.</span> <span id="s1611">The deel is the connection to the farm where in winter all the stables are and the cows are, and the horse has a stable.</span> <span id="s1612">But it’s connected to the farm, and that was also where the bathroom was, you know.</span> <span id="s1613">What the cows dropped, that went in a pit, and what we dropped, it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: And -- and there was the water pump.</span> <span id="s1616">So then I remember that I had to pump two pails, and then I had a yoke on, and I had to carry that outside, because that was ice cold.</span> <span id="s1617">And then the farmer had gotten up a bit earlier, and there was a big cement thing with a deep hole, and then you had to put the water in it, underneath, they had [indecipherable] all the little twigs, and that was warm.</span> <span id="s1618">So then we had to warm, and nearly boil that water, and then get it back, and then I had to carry it back to the deel, and fill it in big wooden tubs, and then stamp 200 times.</span> <span id="s1619">And then it had to go in the rinse, and then in the Chlorox, later you do it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1620">And then in the [indecipherable] it’s blue, that the white stuff was nice and -- and then rinse again.</span> <span id="s1621">And afterward you did all the white stuff, then the colored stuff, and at last the dark stuff.</span> <span id="s1622">And by that time it was mud.</span> <span id="s1623">But I learned how to do a laundry there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: And I can see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: And in Mar -- March and April, then I had to spread all the white stuff on the meadows, because then there was ozone in the sky, and it maked it even whiter.</span> <span id="s1626">And you had to get -- keep it wet, so I started in those months, I started always quarter to five, and then when they had breakfast at 7:30, they called me for breakfast, and they called me at 10, or quarter after for a cup of coffee, and they called me for lunch.</span> <span id="s1627">And then in the evening I was maybe -- especially in the months that I had to keep that stuff white, maybe at 5:30.</span> <span id="s1628">It was all by hand, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Wow</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: So I learned it, and that saved my life later in the camp, that I -- all my false paper was in there, and that they let me do the laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: If that happened right after that they came [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1634">We’re gonna stop the tape now, and take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1636">That i -- End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Okay Diet, I wanted to stop the flow of the interview for a moment because you brought some artifacts.</span> <span id="s1639">Can you hold this and explain what this is and show us what this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Now, there was curfew, and every city in the Netherlands was what they called verduisderd, everywhere curtains.</span> <span id="s1641">And every street had a su -- supervisor who lived there, and by the Germans he was told, every night you have to walk around -- they were allowed even after curfew, to see if any light would shine out.</span> <span id="s1642">So everybody had dark curtains.</span> <span id="s1643">But if you had to go somewhere in winter, and on nights that was no moon or snow, you would bump in people, you didn’t see them, you didn’t hear them.</span> <span id="s1644">So everybody had this, and it was a dynamo, and that they called it knijpkat.</span> <span id="s1645">Your -- ca -- this is knijp, you press.</span> <span id="s1646">And then you saw everywhere a little -- this was very little, so then you had light where you stepped, if you would step in a hole, you could break your ankle.</span> <span id="s1647">But it was funny when you walked, or funny -- it was not so funny, but your -- you didn’t see people, but you heard everywhere in the dark the -- this noise, and then you know it.</span> <span id="s1648">So I always kept it, it was kind of funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: So almost everyone --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Everybody had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: -- in the nether -- had one, because you couldn’t go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: -- one, yeah, because if you went out -- in winter it was dark at five, so even at seven or eight if you went out.</span> <span id="s1653">11 o’clo -- 11 was curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: But you had to have this, because that was the only way -- you know, and now the streets are so even, but then you could easily fall, and there were holes, and nothing was repaired, so you could easily break an ankle, or fall terribly.</span> <span id="s1656">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: How does that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: How does that work?</span> <span id="s1660">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Well, it is a dynamo, because the bikes had that, too.</span> <span id="s1662">They had that on their front thing, and the line -- so you produce your own, it -- it’s a dynamo, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1663">Dynamo you say, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Dynamo.</span> <span id="s1665">It’s fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1667">But the bulb might be gone, or that there’s still some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: No, it comes out just a tiny bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Some light comes out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: If you do it -- if you do it hard enough, you can see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Well, the bulb might be out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: And then there’s something else that you stole.</span> <span id="s1673">Explain -- explain [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: And I feel good about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: They entered, in the beginning of the war, our houses.</span> <span id="s1677">They just -- the doorbell ring, they pushed you to the side, marched in, took everything of copper, brass, metal, and they just melt it for their bullets.</span> <span id="s1678">So in our house [indecipherable] we were warned, so we had everything -- we had beautiful brass stuff from Indonesia, engraved, so you put it -- there was no plastic yet, that you put it in now.</span> <span id="s1679">Now, rubber sheeting, what the hospitals had to cover the bed, and that went all in the gardens under the ground.</span> <span id="s1680">So there it was, so they didn’t catch much.</span> <span id="s1681">But I was in the train, and I was seeing this were the ashtrays that were welded in the trains, here you see that.</span> <span id="s1682">So I figured that are about six bullets, and they’ll probably one of these days take that off, so I thought I’ll be ahead of you.</span> <span id="s1683">I had to make a very long train trip, and they crammed us in a few wagons, and then they had loads of wagons where one German soldier was sitting and a big sign, forbidden for others, only for the German army.</span> <span id="s1684">But when I was standing there so long, and I got more and more mad.</span> <span id="s1685">So I was standing pushed against one of those, and I don’t know how I did that, probably my fury, but in the end I pulled it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: So you pulled this off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: I pulled it off, I wrung it off, I don’t -- so I saved six bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: And where did you keep this, so that you could get it after the war?</span> <span id="s1689">Do you rememb -- you -- do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: No.</span> <span id="s1691">I mean, this was -- they wouldn’t search your house for this, even if they had come and they found [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So do you think you brought it back to your parents house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: If it happened when I was still home, yes, and otherwise where I was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Otherwise it was someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: But this was not dangerous stuff, if you had stolen documents or some, but this -- I think that they never have put two and two together, that somebody in their fury had bothered six bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: But you must have felt good just to do that, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Oh, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Very good.</span> <span id="s1699">Do you know other people who were doing similar kinds of things?</span> <span id="s1700">These little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: No, I know that if a Gestapo guy, or a German soldier came, you watched in the s -- walked in the street, and he was coming that, then you crossed the street, like that they were poison or something.</span> <span id="s1702">And I know people who spit on this -- on the thing.</span> <span id="s1703">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Spit on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: When they saw a German soldier.</span> <span id="s1706">And I know that one time a soldier came and asked me to go to Scheveningen, and there was a big battalion, and I knew it was there, but I didn’t want to help them, so I said, oh yeah, there, and I sent him 90 to 180 degrees the other way.</span> <span id="s1707">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1708">Anything that you could do against them, we did.</span> <span id="s1709">Terrible, hey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: No, it’s great.</span> <span id="s1711">It’s a great story.</span> <span id="s1712">Now, things start to get very rough, personally, in 1944.</span> <span id="s1713">You’re in a bike trip with Hein with -- when you hear this voice, after you’ve had this premonition that’s he’s going to be arrested.</span> <span id="s1714">And it’s o-only a few days later, after the bike trip, that he does get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: It was April 23, ’44.</span> <span id="s1716">And they were a whole year looking for us.</span> <span id="s1717">And Hein wrote me a letter, and he said, be Saturday night at that and that farm, and I then I think I told you this morning that went to church together, and then we had dinner at that leader -- the other leader, there were two, and he was a farmer, so they got up in the morning and they wanted to take a nap.</span> <span id="s1718">And then Hein said, We -- we going on a bike ride, and it was beautiful spring weather, and all the fruit trees had their pink blossoms.</span> <span id="s1719">And we were alone on that, and Hein pulled his Bible out, and he read from John 14, and that is in my Father’s house, I have many mansions, and I don’t know, I still remember that.</span> <span id="s1720">And then he told me everything about the work, because I knew only my little part, and I didn’t want to know more, because I thought, if you are arrested, and they start torturing you, you can’t say I’ll keep my mouth shut, you can’t say that.</span> <span id="s1721">And I -- but he said -- I said, “Hein, don’t tell me, I don’t want to know what the others do.”</span> <span id="s1722">He said, “Somebody has to know the whole thing,” he said, “for in case that Ab or I,” -- and I listened to him, and then he brought me that evening to the farm of Alie, and we were alone on that country road, and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees that are in the distance.</span> <span id="s1723">And I heard clearly a voice, and I s -- can’t explain it.</span> <span id="s1724">And that voice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem.</span> <span id="s1725">That’s in English, have a good look at him.</span> <span id="s1726">And I thought this is ridiculous, that is a thought that comes in my head, but I heard it again, twice.</span> <span id="s1727">And then I started looking at him, and he was far over six feet, so I [indecipherable] and I looked up, and he started laughing.</span> <span id="s1728">He said, “What are you staring at me?”</span> <span id="s1729">And I didn’t dare to tell him, and I said, “Nothing.”</span> <span id="s1730">And he brought me to the farm, and that was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s1731">And three days later he was in Friesland, and he was inspected in the train like many people, but men especially.</span> <span id="s1732">And they saw that he was a pastor, so he was safe.</span> <span id="s1733">But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff what he had there.</span> <span id="s1734">So he was put in a prison.</span> <span id="s1735">But we felt -- and I -- you saw those coupons, and those I.D.s, those identification cards.</span> <span id="s1736">And when we stole them, if that was found in a large quantity, you got shot.</span> <span id="s1737">I mean, that was the end of your life.</span> <span id="s1738">So we felt, all the farmers, and the people who gave us a bed, were already ru-running a risk.</span> <span id="s1739">It could be that three in the night there’s the doorbell, and they look for us.</span> <span id="s1740">So we always had to find a way out, in the back door or through a window, but you know where we would go.</span> <span id="s1741">But we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those homes, because it could be that I could get out, but that the papers stayed there, and that the people would be shot.</span> <span id="s1742">So we had rented a P.O. box somewhere, and Hein smuggled a note out, because we wrote each other, and then we gave the letters to others, and keep them till after the war.</span> <span id="s1743">But the last letter we always kept, it was kind of, you know, close to our heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: You mean, you -- you -- you kept the last one before you got the next one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yeah, before the next.</span> <span id="s1746">And so he had my fath -- last letter, with my false name.</span> <span id="s1747">And they found that, and they started looking for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: And which false name was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: That was Dineke de Jong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a miracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn’t send it straight, and he had to trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy.</span> <span id="s1752">And the underground hated the Dutch people, especially the police who stayed and worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1753">And sometimes by the -- by the Communists they were killed.</span> <span id="s1754">Those adulterators, they helped the Germans.</span> <span id="s1755">But this guy had stayed to help.</span> <span id="s1756">And for some reason or another, that Hein smuggled that note out via this guy, and i -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground did that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader.</span> <span id="s1757">And then it said, “Empty the P.O. box, and don’t use it any more,” because he had a key, and he would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be heavy for him, with his hearing.</span> <span id="s1758">And he said, “And let Diet take another name, they know now her false name.”</span> <span id="s1759">So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this name.</span> <span id="s1760">So it was getting -- the net was getting closer.</span> <span id="s1761">And then he said, And let her warn all the guys, and then bring the documents from the -- from the thing to The Hague, and he mentioned a nickname that we called this guy.</span> <span id="s1762">And so I knew what he meant.</span> <span id="s1763">So I got my other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you want to have now, because he had made so many.</span> <span id="s1764">So I says, “Well, the name of our queen, Wilhemina,” and then I just heard the name Laarman -- Laarman.</span> <span id="s1765">And then he said, “Where do you want to be born?”</span> <span id="s1766">And there was no time to put one in that town hall anywhere, and then you had to smudge it.</span> <span id="s1767">I says well, make it Surinam, Paramibo is the capital, and that’s Dutch territory, and they can’t check that, there was no mail there, they were free.</span> <span id="s1768">So -- and then he said, “What job?”</span> <span id="s1769">And that was a problem, because I couldn’t say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie Laarman, I couldn’t say nurse, I couldn’t say teacher.</span> <span id="s1770">So I said maid.</span> <span id="s1771">And there was an elderly couple in there, had said, “We would love to help, but we don’t know how, we are so old.”</span> <span id="s1772">So I went to them, I said, “Now you can help.</span> <span id="s1773">If I am arrested, you vouch that I am your maid.”</span> <span id="s1774">And they said okay.</span> <span id="s1775">So I was the maid Willie Laarman.</span> <span id="s1776">And then I had all that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had warned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in Zwijndrecht, and then I had to go to The Hague, and that was a short trip, only one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this was in May ’44, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo still coming to our house, so they had never given up.</span> <span id="s1777">And then it turned out -- and that was so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five times, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never gave up.</span> <span id="s1778">And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked for us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they had found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards.</span> <span id="s1779">Toos brought 27 I.D.s. Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other parts.</span> <span id="s1780">And he had given the name Dick.</span> <span id="s1781">Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies.</span> <span id="s1782">And that Jewish deal wasn’t even important for them, they wanted that, that’s why they never gave up for two years.</span> <span id="s1783">So we knew that they knew everything about us.</span> <span id="s1784">But they didn’t know who Toos was.</span> <span id="s1785">And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not too long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out.</span> <span id="s1786">And later I heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders.</span> <span id="s1787">And they told him, you go to Germany, and your bride is crying at home.</span> <span id="s1788">And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who knew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he was freed soon after that.</span> <span id="s1789">But I’ve never seen him, and I -- I don’t know, the guy started out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn’t want to make a big fuss out of that.</span> <span id="s1790">And I don’t know if it’s in the book, he’s now -- I heard that he died.</span> <span id="s1791">I checked later out, and I didn’t want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that phone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I’ve never made any.</span> <span id="s1792">But he was the only one who knew my phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Diet, let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1794">If the Gestapo went to your parent’s house, did they say, give us pi -- a photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1797">They never asked for it.</span> <span id="s1798">So they had no idea what you actually looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: I don’t think so, unless that there was anything in the town hall.</span> <span id="s1800">But they had no idea, so that is a lucky.</span> <span id="s1801">But I had changed my hairdo, and I did different color glasses, you know, frames, so when they were after me, I always, for the new I.D. --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Looked different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: I looked a bit different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Cause that just struck me, that if they came to your house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: No, no, I was thinking, now, in this time, from DNA, and from every -- I wouldn’t have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: I wouldn’t have a chance, not a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Well, only if they found you, and could check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: No, but I think they would much easier find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Find you.</span> <span id="s1811">Maybe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: And with the TV, and with all the -- you know, that they ask for in this guy, and the 10 most wanted, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1813">No, I think it’s -- it’s a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1815">So, you’re under the name Willie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Willie Laarman.</span> <span id="s1817">And then I said in the train -- and there was so little fuel, before they went every how -- hour, and now they went a few times a day.</span> <span id="s1818">And the train was nearly empty, so I knew I would have to wait a long time, so I had a book, and I had a window seat, and I start reading.</span> <span id="s1819">And I still remember the title of the book, Toen De Herten Riepen, “When the deer called out.”</span> <span id="s1820">And anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: When the deer called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: When -- yeah, th-that -- in the woods, you know.</span> <span id="s1823">Anyway, I was reading that, and then slowly the train filled, and after maybe an hour and a quarter, it start slowly going, and I look out of the window, and I felt my heart stop.</span> <span id="s1824">Six gest -- the trains had those steps then, you know, and six guys stepped on that, opened the doors, Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1825">Four in uniform, and two in civil, but they had the insignia that I knew that was German Nazi.</span> <span id="s1826">And then -- several of my group had been arrested, and one got out by pretending he was a black marketeer.</span> <span id="s1827">Then they gave you a sentence, but everybody wants to make a buck, and that was not so serious resistance, and he had gotten out.</span> <span id="s1828">And he had told us, if you ever are arrested, don’t show how scared you are, don’t show it, they get their kicks out of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1829">So how -- don’t -- he gave us that advice.</span> <span id="s1830">So I thought, I’ll stay quiet, stay quiet, and then I thought the headquarters of the Gestapo is in The Hague, and this train is going there, maybe they just have to report, I don’t get nervous.</span> <span id="s1831">And then they split out, six wagons, six guys, and they started inspecting everybody’s I.D. And I had a real one from the last robbery, but still, you know, and all this stuff here, and they were a year long coming to my parent’s house.</span> <span id="s1832">I was scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1833">Oh, I was so scared.</span> <span id="s1834">And -- but I wasn’t allowed to show it.</span> <span id="s1835">So -- but the interesting thing was he started, and he takes an I.D., and he looks and gives it back.</span> <span id="s1836">And it went so fast, and then he came to me.</span> <span id="s1837">And my heart was pounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Yeah, I was wondering, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Oh, it was -- I thought he must hear it.</span> <span id="s1840">It was pounding, and I didn’t dare to look at him, because you know, I didn’t know if I was blushing, or that I was very pale.</span> <span id="s1841">I -- it was so terrible, so I looked like in my book that it was very interesting, but I couldn’t see a word, everything was dancing.</span> <span id="s1842">And I gave him my I.D., and everybody got it back right away, and I didn’t got it back.</span> <span id="s1843">And then he said in German to me, “Wann haben sie das bekommen?”</span> <span id="s1844">When did you get it?</span> <span id="s1845">And I wasn’t going to speak German, but I knew what he said.</span> <span id="s1846">I said -- and I said, “I don’t know what you’re saying,” I said, “I don’t speak der -- ger -- German, can you speak Dutch?”</span> <span id="s1847">And he went on and on, and he was screaming, and I heard what he was saying, and he want to know when I had gotten this.</span> <span id="s1848">And then an other traveler [indecipherable] speak, he says, “He wants to know the date you got it.”</span> <span id="s1849">I said, “Oh, that’s on it.”</span> <span id="s1850">And -- but you know, and the other five hadn’t found anything, and they all came in this compartment, and they gave one look at my I.D., and they burst out laughing.</span> <span id="s1851">And after the war -- I never knew till after I got out what had gone.</span> <span id="s1852">They had printed -- and you saw the copy, in deep purple, and it had all the data, and a background like money that you can’t falsify, but one of the little things was nationality Dutch.</span> <span id="s1853">And that was printed in deep purple.</span> <span id="s1854">But everybody 14 and over had to go and get that I.D., so in the beginning we had I think about nine million inhabitants, and a lot -- millions over 14, so they had handed out millions.</span> <span id="s1855">And after that -- that was in the end ’40 -- beginning of ’41, they handed out to everybody who turned 14, then you had to go.</span> <span id="s1856">And in ’43, they ran -- ran out, they had no more.</span> <span id="s1857">And they printed exactly the same, everything, except those to -- two little words nationality Dutch, instead of deep purple, in black.</span> <span id="s1858">And if you don’t know it, you could barely see it.</span> <span id="s1859">And I had one of the last robbery, and it was a black one, so that was printed in ’43, but the guy who made the false papers, wrote automatically I think ’42 or something.</span> <span id="s1860">If he had done a duplicate that I’d lost it ’43, I would have been okay.</span> <span id="s1861">But on that I was arrested, and later that man from the government, he said, “Oh, you had a black -- you had a black nationality.”</span> <span id="s1862">He said so many were arrested.</span> <span id="s1863">So then the underground started to check and found that.</span> <span id="s1864">So after that they did those all duplicate, and later date, but I was one of the victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Did -- did the underground figure it out, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yeah, after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Yeah, they figured it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: The -- there were so many arrested, relatively, you know.</span> <span id="s1869">So they knew there was something, and then they went over that.</span> <span id="s1870">It was really -- I always think it was nearly like a chess game.</span> <span id="s1871">You do this, we do that, you do this.</span> <span id="s1872">And here they had a smart [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1873">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: So they look at this, they’re laughing, and now what do they do, do they search you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: And then the train stops in Rotterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: And it’s a big station, one of the biggest in the Netherlands, and they said out, and they had a little office there, and they looked through my little [indecipherable] and I had some data, but I had made my own shorthand that nobody else could read, and this -- oh, this is spy material.</span> <span id="s1878">I said no, and then they wanted to know -- they said, “Well, if you don’t talk,” and I s -- I said, “I don’t know what you’re saying, I d -- I don’t understand German.”</span> <span id="s1879">They said, “Okay, you go to the headquarters.”</span> <span id="s1880">And that is where they did this stuff, so I was really scared.</span> <span id="s1881">Back to the station, and it was a chilly day, it was May eighth, ’44, and it was drizzle -- like now, drizzle and rain.</span> <span id="s1882">And we have many benches on this -- on the station and everywhere, but nobody was sitting, because it was so chilly, so they were all walking.</span> <span id="s1883">And it was crowded, because there were so many -- so few trains, and many people.</span> <span id="s1884">And they said to me, “Sit here.”</span> <span id="s1885">And then the leader of the group, he had a higher rank, he was standing here, kind of facing the other five, and the other five were in a horseshoe, five facing me.</span> <span id="s1886">And I thought this is the end of my life, because now I go to prison, and I knew you had to undress, and then when my blouse, I had buttons, you know, I thought, when they find that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: You had all the papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: I had all the papers from the robbery there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: In your bra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: I had it in my bra, and it was stolen I.D.s, and there were two pilots who wanted to get to England, and they were in that age group, so we had to give them also the papers.</span> <span id="s1891">And there was a way to get back to England via Belgium, France, over the Pyrenees to Portugal, and then a submarine would pick them up.</span> <span id="s1892">And we have helped sa -- several, and when they were in England they gave secret code that we knew they were there.</span> <span id="s1893">But -- and for those guys, if they were stopped, they couldn’t speak Dutch.</span> <span id="s1894">And so they had the Dutch papers, and if you had like the -- where the Jew was the J, if you had a big scar, or at that time you still had people with what they call that -- those red -- now they can with ice get that off when you’re a new baby, but at that time it was called a veinflak.</span> <span id="s1895">It’s a big thing that -- a scar of thing, and everything special.</span> <span id="s1896">So on that -- for those guys we always wrote deaf and dumb.</span> <span id="s1897">And we said, “If you are arrested, don’t say a word, and you don’t hear.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: So -- but we got many back to England.</span> <span id="s1900">And then -- but you know, I was brought in, I was sitting there, and I was praying there was [indecipherable] for those, and there were 500 guilders because by -- it was towards the end, and many Jewish people didn’t have money any more.</span> <span id="s1901">And in the cities we had to pay the people something that they could buy the food, you know, and the Jewish people were so eager also, collecting money from people who didn’t dare to do dangerous things, but were willing to contribute, so it was a busy time.</span> <span id="s1902">And then they --I -- I was praying to God, I thought, oh, this is the end of my life, when I go to prison I have to undress, and they find that, and I’ll be shot [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1903">And I thought of my wedding dress hanging at home, and the -- all the expectations we had.</span> <span id="s1904">And I was praying to God, and pleading.</span> <span id="s1905">I said, “We are helping your people, and then,” -- and I says, “You are Almighty,” and I was really pleading with God, I said, “You are Almighty, can you give a moment that all people don’t look at me, and that I can get rid of that envelope.”</span> <span id="s1906">Then I’m still in a bind, they are looking [indecipherable] then I had a chance, but here I have no chance.</span> <span id="s1907">And then I always say, humanly speaking, when five people are watching you, what are your chance that all five don’t look?</span> <span id="s1908">You can say zero.</span> <span id="s1909">If it was one he could be looking another way, if there are two, they could be looking.</span> <span id="s1910">But five?</span> <span id="s1911">And I always say it says in the Bible with God, and with God all things are possible.</span> <span id="s1912">And the guy who was standing here, he had a raincoat of stuff we had never seen.</span> <span id="s1913">And at that time the fashion was that all the raincoats were made of gabardine, and only pockets here in the side.</span> <span id="s1914">Nobody ever had -- and inside pockets had never -- in no coat, you had not have it happen.</span> <span id="s1915">And he had a shiny coat, it was a military coat, battleship gray.</span> <span id="s1916">And one of the Germans, I heard him say, “Is that that new material?</span> <span id="s1917">Is it really waterproof?”</span> <span id="s1918">It was the first plastic, plastic had just been found out.</span> <span id="s1919">And then another, I heard all what they said, said, oh, and how nice, it had two big stitched on pockets.</span> <span id="s1920">Those pockets, that is handy, that had never -- and this tall guy said, he said, “You think that is handy?”</span> <span id="s1921">He said, “This coat has pockets on the inside.”</span> <span id="s1922">Now, they had never -- and they all said, “On the inside?”</span> <span id="s1923">He said yeah, and he opens his coat, right, and he was over six feet, and all the five heads went in the raincoat to admire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: So how did you get out the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: I had opened my blouse --</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: I -- I needed -- yeah, when I started praying, I’d opened the blouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: So you were ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: And I had only to grab it and throw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: And where did you throw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Well, there were loads of people walking, hundreds were walking up and down, this could be anybody’s.</span> <span id="s1932">So then they would have had to arrest the whole station.</span> <span id="s1933">And whoever found this was lucky, he had the ration cards, he had 500 guilders --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: -- and the rest he can have thrown away, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: But these guys didn’t find this?</span> <span id="s1937">They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: No, because they didn’t know I had it on me, of course, so they didn’t even look.</span> <span id="s1939">And then I wanted to get away from it, so I said -- and one guy could speak a bit Dutch, I said, “I am so chilly.”</span> <span id="s1940">And I was.</span> <span id="s1941">I said, “Can we stand in that tunnel?”</span> <span id="s1942">Because there were tunnels that go to the next platform, and I heard him say to the other, “Let me alone with her, I’ll get it out.”</span> <span id="s1943">I thought, “Yeah, that’s what you think.”</span> <span id="s1944">But I didn’t know any of what he said.</span> <span id="s1945">So we stand in the tunnel, and you -- when you are so long in that work, you get really a look at people, that you -- and I saw he was very vain, and so I started the conversation, and he could speak some Dutch.</span> <span id="s1946">I said, “Now, when you go through those trains, what are you looking for?”</span> <span id="s1947">Like I was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1948">He said, “Oh, for spies.”</span> <span id="s1949">I said, “For spies?”</span> <span id="s1950">I said, “And -- and who -- how do you find them?”</span> <span id="s1951">And he start -- he said, “Yeah, two days ago we had a guy, and he had all secret films, and,” -- I said, “What did you do?</span> <span id="s1952">Shoot him?”</span> <span id="s1953">He said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1954">He said, “He tried to run away.”</span> <span id="s1955">I said, “And what did you [indecipherable] shoot him?”</span> <span id="s1956">He said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1957">I said, “I can run hard.</span> <span id="s1958">May I run away?”</span> <span id="s1959">I said to him, “Do I get a head start?”</span> <span id="s1960">So I was joking, like I wasn’t nervous at all.</span> <span id="s1961">And I talked the whole time, and then the train pulled up, and he had this big head, and he had [indecipherable] didn’t have a word [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1962">And then I heard him again say to the others, “Leave me alone with her in the apartment, I -- in the compartment, I get it out.”</span> <span id="s1963">And I went on in the train.</span> <span id="s1964">But then -- oh, I ran from one fear and another, I -- later when I looked back, I thought, oh God, I should have cracked up.</span> <span id="s1965">Because the train ended, and there -- then we had to take a tram to Scheveningen, and that was line eight, and it was around five o’clock, and that tram went exactly past the bank where I had worked, and the people left at five.</span> <span id="s1966">And I thought, oh God, if any of them -- and it’s raining, hops on, say hi Diet, I’m sunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: I -- from one fear and another.</span> <span id="s1969">And I wanted also to know the people, and because they had -- the uniformed people left, and the two in civil, with the insignias on -- and I was such [indecipherable], and they left me.</span> <span id="s1970">So we sit in the tram, and then you had a conduct -- conductor who collected the money.</span> <span id="s1971">So he came to me, and I said, “I’m not paying.”</span> <span id="s1972">He said, “You have to.”</span> <span id="s1973">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1974">He said, “Then I throw you off the tram.”</span> <span id="s1975">I said, “Please,” because I sit he -- I said, “I’m sitting here very much against my will.”</span> <span id="s1976">And he said, “What?”</span> <span id="s1977">I said, “Yeah, those two guys,” “they have put me here.”</span> <span id="s1978">And he said, “What?”</span> <span id="s1979">I said, “Yeah, those two guys,” and they had -- said, “they have put me here.”</span> <span id="s1980">He said, “Oh, la -- you’re fur [indecipherable] you got -- you’re arrested?”</span> <span id="s1981">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1982">So the whole tram knew that they were two Germans, and that they were arresting me, and I thought, if the tram gets in a jam, they probably help me that I can shoot out of it [indecipherable] to -- to the prison -- off to the headquarters of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1983">And there I had to sit for hours, because you had those special cars that they arrest people, and they have a special name, betsies, or something, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1984">But anyway, there was not one, they were out to collect Jews, and whatever, they had to sit there for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: We’re gonna -- we’re gonna have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1991">Diet, so you’re waiting in the prison, and how come they’re making you wait, do you think?</span> <span id="s1992">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: In that -- they -- in that building of the Gestapo, the headquarters, I had to wait because they were -- they had big, black yar -- cars that they brought you to prison and arrested you apart from if they had the whole group, they did it on trucks with machine guns.</span> <span id="s1994">But they were wal -- waiting for [indecipherable] because they were doing raids in The Hague, and arresting people, probably Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1995">So I had to wait a couple of hours, and then they brought me to the prison.</span> <span id="s1996">And it was the same arrogant guy who was in the train.</span> <span id="s1997">And he could speak Dutch, and I remember that in that car he says to me, “Yeah, now I can’t help you, you’re a young girl, and I feel so sorry that you go to prison now, but you didn’t tell any, now you have to go to prison,” he said.</span> <span id="s1998">“But if you still tell me how you got this paper,” he says, “then you get very special pr -- treatment in -- in the prison.</span> <span id="s1999">You get -- may choose every day what you want to eat, and you get every time with your meal a glass of wine.”</span> <span id="s2000">And I thought, how stupid does he think I am?</span> <span id="s2001">I -- I knew definitely that wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s2002">I mean, how stupid?</span> <span id="s2003">So I just played along, and I said, “Yeah, real -- really?”</span> <span id="s2004">And you know, in Dutch?</span> <span id="s2005">And he says yes.</span> <span id="s2006">I said, “May I even choose appelmoes?”</span> <span id="s2007">Was applesauce, and that’s -- it’s such a stupid word, appelmoes, and I thought that he would then realize.</span> <span id="s2008">He said, “Oh yeah, you may choose appelmoes.”</span> <span id="s2009">Well, I said, “I -- I can’t -- I don’t -- I have this paper, and I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2010">So anyway, then we came to the -- the prison, where Milosevic is now, that’s a big prison for criminals.</span> <span id="s2011">But it had a big, high wall, and it had a small side door, and it’s round, and it’s still there.</span> <span id="s2012">And -- and there was a bell that you can press, and they stood there, and they had told me, don’t show that you’re ascared, you know, and we were standing there, and he said, “You can still tell me, I haven’t yet pressed, you can still tell me.”</span> <span id="s2013">And then I took his thumb, and I pressed it.</span> <span id="s2014">And he gave me a whack.</span> <span id="s2015">But then I was brought in, and he disappeared, and I had to stand for a long time in a corridor, and on one side are all cells.</span> <span id="s2016">And I had to face the wall, and stood there for a long time, and out of the cells I heard all voices, and they said, “What is the news from the outside world, what is the news from the outside world?”</span> <span id="s2017">But I didn’t know if these were Gestapo guys who wanted to check, so I -- I feel always guilty, because if they were real prisoners, I thought I should have told, but I didn’t want to take the chance.</span> <span id="s2018">And then they brought me, it had many corridors, A, B, C, D, and I was in corridor A, in cell six, some that -- the handkerchief, I think it was six or eight.</span> <span id="s2019">And they put me in, and it was three meter, now that’s a little bit longer than three yards, and two meter, right?</span> <span id="s2020">And it had -- I didn’t know that -- a drum in the corner, and only one cot, and it was meant for one person, so small.</span> <span id="s2021">And very high window with bars.</span> <span id="s2022">And I was number five, there were four others.</span> <span id="s2023">And there was an old Jewish lady, Mrs. Spire, and she had the cot, and we slept on stone, on the floor.</span> <span id="s2024">It -- it was a prison for criminals, so I didn’t know what are the other women, you know, they could be criminals, they could be [indecipherable] they could be anything, but the Jewish lady I knew was okay.</span> <span id="s2025">And I had been the whole day in the he train, telling all the guys, and I had been sitting at that station, and then in the headquarters of the Gestapo, and then I had to go so urgent bathroom, so I said to those ladies, how -- “What do you do?</span> <span id="s2026">I have to go bathroom?”</span> <span id="s2027">And I thought that they say, well you have to go -- knock at the door and then they bring you to a toilet.</span> <span id="s2028">And they turned around, and they pointed at this little drum.</span> <span id="s2029">And I -- you know -- that this was the time now you go camping, and women shower together, and there is no -- but this was 1944, and everything was so proper.</span> <span id="s2030">And I thought, I’m not going on a thing with those women that I’ve never seen.</span> <span id="s2031">But you know, I couldn’t hold it until after the war, so at one point my pride went out of the window, and I had to go on the tippultum, and that’s what it was called.</span> <span id="s2032">Oh goody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: So, had they questioned you at the Gestapo headquarters or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: They asked me all questions, but I couldn’t speak German, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: They didn’t ge --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: So are -- are you beginning to play someone very dumb?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: I started then, because first you know, I was kind of that I didn’t answer, I was -- and that I pushed, I thought it was kind of -- when you’re going to -- but then I thought, hey, I have to do dumb.</span> <span id="s2039">And then I never spoke German already, but then I really pretended, and when they ask me I shrug my shoulders.</span> <span id="s2040">And I think later that saved me.</span> <span id="s2041">I think that they let me out that they had -- they didn’t have trains any more because the queen has spoken from England, and said that all the people who worked for the railroad had to go in hiding, too.</span> <span id="s2042">So all the Jews were in hiding orway, all the men between 16 and 45, and now all the railroad, and the queen said, and their families have to go in hiding, too, because in ’44, the end -- they were so mean, if they came to arrest a man and he wasn’t home, they took his wife, the children, the baby.</span> <span id="s2043">If you were pregnant they took you.</span> <span id="s2044">And then the man came back and was shot, so it was a crazy world, and there were not enough trains any more.</span> <span id="s2045">So -- but we were brought there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: So you’re in a cell with four other women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: I’m in a cell with those other four women.</span> <span id="s2048">And then I was so lucky, because the Jewish lady was brought out, and every Tuesday, and every Thursday night my heart broke because then they had rounded up the Jews, put them in the prison, and then they separated the men and the women, and the children.</span> <span id="s2049">Oh.</span> <span id="s2050">And then you heard them, [indecipherable] mama -- mama.</span> <span id="s2051">It was terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s2052">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: What were they doing every Tuesday and Thursday, were -- they were sending the Jews out to Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Then they -- all the people that they had arrested were brought to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: And then they were deported from Westerbork, right?</span> <span id="s2056">So who were these other three women with you, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Now, the Jewish lady was taken out</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: And then an other young woman came in.</span> <span id="s2060">But see, this was in the dunes, in The Hague.</span> <span id="s2061">That prison is right on the edge of the dunes, and in the dunes, that was sperrgebiet, it was forbidden territory.</span> <span id="s2062">And they have made many bunkers [indecipherable] to England, and there was also the place of execution, and that was known Waalsdorp.</span> <span id="s2063">And I’ll spell that later with Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s2064">But that was the place of execution, and they had already executed so many people, but you couldn’t get there.</span> <span id="s2065">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Did you hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: No, it was farther in the dunes, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: You couldn’t hear it, so -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: -- it was farther in the dunes, but we knew it, that was the place of execution.</span> <span id="s2070">But it was right on the border of the koshda dunes, and then the osh -- the North Sea.</span> <span id="s2071">And at the -- in the morning we got that rusty cup, we had to stick that out, and they poured in a -- in the door was a little thing that they could open, and then you had to come, and the -- often it was bohoi -- boiling hot brown water, it wasn’t coffee, they poured over your hands, that you burned, but it was all you get, and at lunchtime -- anyway, there was nothing except that -- but that young girl came in, she was I think 22 or 23, about my age.</span> <span id="s2072">And when the allies flew over, because they dropped bombs sometimes, if they knew that they were building something [indecipherable] and that has to be, I mean, but it is scary if you’re sitting in the cell and you hear bombs falling close by.</span> <span id="s2073">But we knew that we would never get in -- gotten free without sacrifices, and if it was us, so be it.</span> <span id="s2074">But we always, when we heard our friends in the sky, that were our hope, you know, and then everybody went, because there was a cell left, and right, and in the back.</span> <span id="s2075">And then you went to the hole, and you started knocking, and knocking, and knocking.</span> <span id="s2076">And they did it, and with a whole bunch, but the whole prison was nearly trembling like it was our friends are in the sky, one day we will all be free.</span> <span id="s2077">And this happened when she was there, but this girl comes in, I can’t remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Is it Sonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: No, that was not Sonia, no that was another one.</span> <span id="s2080">She wanted to, with her beauty to -- to [indecipherable] she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2081">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s2082">Anyway, this girl comes in, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Barzilai is her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Barzilai, yeah, Sonia Barzilai, I felt so sorry for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2086">But -- so this is another woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Yeah, this was a young girl, and she comes in, and here we are -- she was the fifth one, and she comes up to me when we had introduced ourself, and she says to me, “You know, I know that I’ll be out very soon.</span> <span id="s2088">Do you have a message for the outside world?”</span> <span id="s2089">And I thought, “That is crazy, why doesn’t she ask the others also?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: And so that was already fishy.</span> <span id="s2092">And all the time she came to me, and I thought -- and I said, “Listen,” I said, “you both -- you all know, when you are here, you never know that you’re out in a few days, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s2093">You don’t know how long.”</span> <span id="s2094">And then in the end she said, “Well, I’m engaged to a German, but he is a good German.”</span> <span id="s2095">I thought that for me there are no good Germans at the moment.</span> <span id="s2096">I thought -- and she said, “No, but he -- I know he gets me out.”</span> <span id="s2097">And I said, “No, I have no family here, and I’m just a maid and the people where I am, they don’t really care for me, they only care now that the laundry isn’t being done.”</span> <span id="s2098">I said, “And I -- now I have no -- nobody who is interested in me.”</span> <span id="s2099">So I didn’t bite.</span> <span id="s2100">But then the next night, the allies flew over and dropped a bomb real close by, so we run to our walls.</span> <span id="s2101">And she ran to the front door where the guards were, and she [indecipherable], “let me out, let me out [indecipherable] allies, and let me out, you know I don’t belong here.”</span> <span id="s2102">So she was planted.</span> <span id="s2103">And I see everywhere God’s hand, because this was at the very beginning of my -- of my prison time, so I knew don’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s2104">It’s the lesson I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: But you don’t remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s2109">And then I -- she was there so short, just two or three days.</span> <span id="s2110">And then we were brought -- the invasion came, and then they got very nervous, and we were all loaded in -- in trains, and in -- in -- really in trucks.</span> <span id="s2111">And see, Corrie and Betsie ten Boom, you’ve heard that name, of course, too.</span> <span id="s2112">But they came from another city, Haarlem, and I never heard of them, we didn’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2113">But we were from The Hague, a lot of us --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: -- and we were driven in the dunes.</span> <span id="s2116">And when you came out of the prison, you came on the long lane that was called the van Alke madelaan, and the city, and the railroad stations were to the right.</span> <span id="s2117">And to the left was only the dunes and the place of execution.</span> <span id="s2118">And they drove us to the left, so the Dutch -- the Hague people thought we are going to be executed, and I thought so, too.</span> <span id="s2119">So you had to prepare yourself for being shot.</span> <span id="s2120">And I know that several -- there were so many, there were 1800 I heard later.</span> <span id="s2121">So we were in loads of trucks.</span> <span id="s2122">And some of The Hague people were so scared they jumped out, and there were soldiers sitting with machine gun -- with mi -- mitarios machine guns, I think you called it.</span> <span id="s2123">There was no point, a-and I don’t know, we have dunes in Michigan the Great Bear dunes, you can’t run in dunes, it’s sand, and it goes up, there was no way, it wasn’t practical, so we went there.</span> <span id="s2124">But then later my father told me -- he was born in 1883, that when there were no cars yet, and there were a couple of very expensive hotels, one was the Oranje Hotel, the Orange Hotel, and development people came to the big station, and for those people, there were no cars yet, and they -- they didn’t have any suitcases, especially not this [indecipherable], they had big trunks for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2125">So they had made a side branch with a little train that came to flu -- near the hotels.</span> <span id="s2126">But over the decades, that was totally covered with sand, and some of the Nazi Dutch people must have known that, so ha -- they had unearthed that station, and they were afraid to ship us from in The Hague itself, they thought -- and -- they did it in Amsterdam, and there was a big riot, and a fight, that the underground wanted to liberate the people from there.</span> <span id="s2127">So they avoided that, and they brought us there in the dunes, so we were not shot, we were loaded in trains.</span> <span id="s2128">Crammed in trains, and I was in the same compartment with Corrie and Betsie ten Boom, so that was the first time, and you know that story, of course, maybe you’ve read, “The Hiding Place,” and some other --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: I did, but summarize it a little bit.</span> <span id="s2130">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: -- of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2132">And they were in their 50’s, so I thought at that time they were old ladies.</span> <span id="s2133">And they were each in a cell because they thought that Corrie had tee -- tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2134">And their old father, he was a very wonderful Christian, and he was a very distinguished gentleman, very well known in Haarlem, they had an exclusive watch story -- s-s-store, and when all the Jews had to wear a star, he went too.</span> <span id="s2135">He said, “They are my people, and I am a Christian,” and he wore the star.</span> <span id="s2136">But they were arrested [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2137">So -- and their old father had just died in that prison, so they met each other, and Corrie and Betsie met each other then, on that trip.</span> <span id="s2138">They were sitting hand in hand and crying, and then I heard their story from the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s2139">And then the train was also black, when -- you know, curtains, that not a light shown, and we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s2140">But the noise changed, we went -- so I knew, I thought if we got in Germany, the chances for survival would pfft.</span> <span id="s2141">And if we stay in the Netherlands, and in the south you had a -- a Vught, and in the middle you had Amersfoort, Camp Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s2142">So we didn’t know where we were going, it was dark and all the curtains were down, it was night.</span> <span id="s2143">And then all of a sudden, the whole noise changed, and it was so -- and then I knew we were going south, that we were going -- because -- you saw on the map the cities of Zwijndrecht and Doordrect, but there is a big, big river, and that’s called at Hollands Diep, and that is so big, and there is a large bridge over it, and we were going over that bridge, and I had done that many times on my bike.</span> <span id="s2144">And then I knew that we were going to Vught.</span> <span id="s2145">And at one point there was a toilet, and everybody stood in line to go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s2146">And when it was quiet, that there was nobody, I see a girl go in, and I see that she -- there was a window, and that was also -- but I saw that she took the black curtain up, and there was glass, and you could open that, and I thought that she had opened it, but there were soldiers with machine guns on the roof of the train, and I thought she knows this area, and I thought she’s trying to escape.</span> <span id="s2147">But if somebody goes in -- so I stood at the door like I would be the next one.</span> <span id="s2148">I thought I’ll give her a chance.</span> <span id="s2149">And then at one point, we went through a wooded area, very curvy so the train had to go slow.</span> <span id="s2150">And I saw her jump.</span> <span id="s2151">So then she jumped out of that window, and she rolled -- I don’t know, we went further, but the train went slow, so I said a prayer that she would make it safe.</span> <span id="s2152">And then I went to the bathroom, I didn’t have to go, but I had given her the chance.</span> <span id="s2153">So I went back, and we came in the camp, and then they counted, all -- eight prisoners had escaped on that trip, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Eight.</span> <span id="s2156">So I knew one of them, I hope that she survived.</span> <span id="s2157">But I felt really great.</span> <span id="s2158">And then we were brought in that -- was in the night, I think we arrived at two o’clock in the woods.</span> <span id="s2159">We had to get out.</span> <span id="s2160">There were all soldiers with helmets, and bayonets and screaming --</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Did they do something because they knew that there were eight escapees?</span> <span id="s2162">Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: Well, this was when we -- they count us inside, we weren’t yet in the camp.</span> <span id="s2164">But you know, the train with prisoners came, so then there are soldiers, and we were 80 [indecipherable] prisoners, so they were [indecipherable] warned that we would be punished.</span> <span id="s2165">They didn’t have [indecipherable] for us.</span> <span id="s2166">What was unexpected was the day of the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Did they care that there were eight people who escaped?</span> <span id="s2170">They didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: I don’t know, they were furious, they -- all the time we had role call, or something, and counting --</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: And I don’t know if they ever found out who, because it was a chaos with the invasion, you know, the -- and then we were -- and there were big Dobermans, and we were pushed into the camp, and then we were in di --</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: There were Dobermans?</span> <span id="s2175">Dogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Doberman dogs, and soldiers, so they -- I mean, you didn’t get a chance to escape, they were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: -- and guys had bayonets and guns, and whatever.</span> <span id="s2179">And later we went in a barrack number four, and that was really a camp within a camp, because see now, if you had three or four of one case, they kept you in different cells that you couldn’t agree you’ll say this or that.</span> <span id="s2180">But now we were just mashed together, and they [indecipherable] guards, and we weren’t allowed to say one word to each other.</span> <span id="s2181">And then we were all brought to a separate barrack, the women number 75, and the men were brought somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2182">And for days we couldn’t speak to each other.</span> <span id="s2183">Day and night that we were not allowed to say a word to each other, till they had quick interrogated the keepall -- the people from the same cases.</span> <span id="s2184">And then after a couple of weeks, I think, then they stayed the whole day with us, the female guards, and on the four corners were four S.S.’s, and the S.S.’s were the volunteer Hitler elitengrup, and they -- they had their awesome -- you know, the swastika is from the Nazis, but the S.S. had the wolfs angel, they had that sign like that.</span> <span id="s2185">And they -- on each corner were always S.S.’s in every barrack, four.</span> <span id="s2186">And this was May, June, July, August.</span> <span id="s2187">And I remember it was very hot, and we have nothing there.</span> <span id="s2188">We got cots, and very thin mattresses, and three high in long rows, of course, like in all the barracks.</span> <span id="s2189">And then the only thing we had -- there was a washroom -- washroom, and that had drofs and a pipe, and faucets.</span> <span id="s2190">But that was all, we had no soap, no shampoo, no towels, no toilet paper, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2191">And I was arrested in my clothes, so if I wanted to wash any of my underwear, then I must [indecipherable] it out till it had dried [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: So there was -- there was no uniform, you could just wear clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Not yet, later --</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Later there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: -- later I got a prison dress, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: -- I had no clean underwear, or anything, I was arrested with what I had worn.</span> <span id="s2198">So that was very hard.</span> <span id="s2199">And then, because they checked us, and the other girl had to make the twine, and I was picked out there, “Oh, you’re a maid, you have to do the laundry,” of those guards, and from a whole bunch of guards, and I got two other girls to help me, but I was the maid, so I have to be the leader.</span> <span id="s2200">And on the -- on their shirts they had that wolfs angel embroidered, and I hated that more than the swastika.</span> <span id="s2201">And this women -- the guards, they had to take turns, and there we stood, three, and it was all [indecipherable] stuff, because there were no laundry machines.</span> <span id="s2202">So then -- sometimes they got so bored, you know, to sit there and see those three girls the whole day, and they locked us up and they went away for a beer, or a coffee, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2203">And when they were gone -- and don’t forget, I was in my early 20’s then, and then we took that sh-shirt and undershirt, with that hated swastika on -- no, the -- the wolfs angel, and we got a nice big gob of saliva, bull’s-eye.</span> <span id="s2204">And this -- but every day when we were alone, and every day we went a little bit back, and we got so good in aiming.</span> <span id="s2205">It was really -- and later, you know, Corrie ten Boom asked me later to be with her, and help her to arrange a home for the Jewish people who now had nobody, she had a home for.</span> <span id="s2206">Cases that didn’t go to sanitorium [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2207">So she had that, and I helped her those six weeks.</span> <span id="s2208">And she had a friend who was a psychiatrist, and he wanted to talk to her.</span> <span id="s2209">At that time, if you went to a psychiatrist, they thought you were nuts, you know, that was -- so no, we didn’t want it, didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s2210">But he was so interested, so in the end we said okay, and then I asked him, I said, “You must think that we were crazy, that we got such a kick out of spitting on that -- on that horrible thing that we hated while our lives were at stake.”</span> <span id="s2211">And he said, “No,” he said, “they tried to break your spirit, and they couldn’t, so that was a good thing.”</span> <span id="s2212">Because if we had been naughty, we had to stand there, appel had -- now that is horrible -- it -- it doesn’t sound horrible, but you had to stand, marble, you know, with your thing here at the side, and you weren’t allowed to move.</span> <span id="s2213">And you know, after seven minutes you start swaying, and they fainted left and the right, and then all those guards were sitting there and laughing.</span> <span id="s2214">And we put a smile on our face when they made us do that.</span> <span id="s2215">Like we got those delicious cookies, like they had given us something nice and we stood there, and we fainted left and right, and they got mad at us.</span> <span id="s2216">And I remember that they said, “Die Hollandische weiber sind schlimmer wie die Polakken.”</span> <span id="s2217">The Dutch -- and then weiber is a degrading word, here weif is a normal word, but it’s a degrading word, you ha -- the Dutch women were worse than the Polakken, than the Polish.</span> <span id="s2218">That was [indecipherable] and then they yelled at [indecipherable] like they had given us a great compliment, you know, like [indecipherable] you are perfect, and we stood there, and they were furious, but that were all our little fun thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Why -- why was that insignia of the S.S. wor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: The wolfs angel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: The wolfs ang -- wolfs angel, why was that worse to you than the swastika, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Because the swastika was the general Nazi thing, but this was volunteers, and they were trained in cruelty.</span> <span id="s2223">They could blindly obey, and they were trained -- I read that when they started -- they are volunteers, so they signed up for this, then they got an -- a new puppy, a -- a German Shepherd puppy, and I don’t know if the training was two or three years, but at the final exam, now dog is your friend, and they had just [indecipherable] to kill their dog.</span> <span id="s2224">That -- they could do anything.</span> <span id="s2225">And I heard [indecipherable] from another friend of mine, who went through so many camps, and he was later the head editor of a very high standing Dutch magazine that came, The Alsafeer, that’s one of [indecipherable] and he went through so many camps, and if he saw a scrap of paper, he wrote something down, and he put it in cracks from in the wall, or whatever, and after the war, he picked it all up, and he wrote a book, “Nacht und Nebel,” [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2226">I don’t know if you’ve heard about it.</span> <span id="s2227">And they volunteered.</span> <span id="s2228">I mean, what they did fi -- they said, kill this prisoner, and they were free to do it.</span> <span id="s2229">They hung them, and then they were nearly dead, they got them down that they could breathe again, they did that sometimes three times with the same -- now is that cruelty?</span> <span id="s2230">I mean -- no, I hated that sign more because that was volunteers who did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Now, when you’re in Vught, you can’t tell any of these women who you really are, so you not only have to be hiding from the Germans who are going to question you, but you have no -- you’re totally alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: I was totally alone, and you know, I scraped in the wall of the prison, because they took everything away, but that was the time of the bobby pins, and they had not taken my bobby pin, and all the other women did -- to keep the date [indecipherable] so all the others did one, two, three, four, five, that -- from the days that they were -- so I didn’t have to do that.</span> <span id="s2233">But the very last word our Jesus said before he went back to heaven was, lo, I am with you always.</span> <span id="s2234">And I scared that in the wall, and I thought I’m never alone.</span> <span id="s2235">So -- and that’s what I had to cling to.</span> <span id="s2236">And I never felt alone, I knew He was always there.</span> <span id="s2237">I trusted.</span> <span id="s2238">Yeah, that was -- but it was a very rough time and in the end, I’ve got two people that I’ve trusted.</span> <span id="s2239">And that was -- one was a Catholic girl, she was in about the same situation, I don’t know how I got to trust her.</span> <span id="s2240">And the other was a lady, and her name was Mrs. Verschoor.</span> <span id="s2241">And she was in her 40’s, and the suffering was engraved on her face.</span> <span id="s2242">It’s so intense sad, and it really struck me.</span> <span id="s2243">And I asked others, “What is the matter?</span> <span id="s2244">What is this hurt?”</span> <span id="s2245">And they told me she had only one daughter, Yoka, and the girl was 18, studying at the university, and she had helped pilots all the time escape, and she was arrested, you heard her name [indecipherable] Yoka Verschoor.</span> <span id="s2246">And she was arrested, and she was nacht und nebel and it was that you disappear, nobody knew any more.</span> <span id="s2247">So Mrs. Verschoor did not.</span> <span id="s2248">And then somebody said yeah, and they lived in Paramibo, and that struck a chord because on my false papers I was born in Paramibo.</span> <span id="s2249">And one day -- we were 175 women in the camp, and there was a very famous film star.</span> <span id="s2250">Like here, everybody knew Judy Garland, something similar, Ennie Meunier.</span> <span id="s2251">And she was -- and Ennie was there, now, why the heck is Ennie Meunier in this camp?</span> <span id="s2252">And I asked others, and they said she is engaged to a German.</span> <span id="s2253">So right away [indecipherable] I don’t know what’s the matter.</span> <span id="s2254">So one day Ennie Meunier hears that I was born in Paramibo, and I didn’t know a thing about Paramibo.</span> <span id="s2255">I knew much about Indonesia because so much of my family and my brother, so many had been there.</span> <span id="s2256">But I didn’t know a thing about Paramibo.</span> <span id="s2257">And she come, “Hi Willie, I hear you were born in Paramibo.”</span> <span id="s2258">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s2259">And she said, “Where did you live?”</span> <span id="s2260">A street -- I had no idea about a street name, but we all had diarrhea, and then you could run away.</span> <span id="s2261">I said, “Oh, I’ll talk to you later.”</span> <span id="s2262">And I ran away to the bathroom, and then afterward I avoided her like the plague, because I knew -- oh no, she says to me, “We were on [indecipherable], I mean, we were there, did you see me,” in a big play.</span> <span id="s2263">I said, “No, my father was just on leave, he hated it so much to miss that.”</span> <span id="s2264">Because in a small Dutch community, that’s a big thing.</span> <span id="s2265">And she said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s2266">And then she asked me where I lived, and I thought oh no, so I ran away and pretended I had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2267">And then oh, she comes back, and what do I say, and if she’s engaged to a German -- who is engaged to a German during this time?</span> <span id="s2268">So I was really scared.</span> <span id="s2269">And then I had heard that Mrs. Verschoor had lived there, and we all had diarrhea bouts, and then you were allowed -- they were allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I had to go.</span> <span id="s2270">So I saw that Mrs. Verschoor ran to the bathroom, and there were 10 on a row, and we had to go in groups, and were watched by a female guard.</span> <span id="s2271">Anyway, Mrs. Verschoor runs, so I run, and I sat next to her, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Hold that.</span> <span id="s2273">We’re going to stop the tape, and we’ll start --</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: [indecipherable] back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Yes, we’re going to stop, and start at the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Diet, we left off when you went into the latrine to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: Oh yeah, and then I asked this lady, I said, “Don’t ask me any questions, but tell me anything about Paramibo.”</span> <span id="s2280">And I said, “A street, where do people live, regular people.”</span> <span id="s2281">She says, “Heerenstraat,” and she told me all about it.</span> <span id="s2282">So that was -- and then after the war I went to her house.</span> <span id="s2283">She got out and her daughter got out.</span> <span id="s2284">And, well -- so I know that.</span> <span id="s2285">But that helped me, and when Ennie Meunier then came, I knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: So you weren’t afraid when she came any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: Well, I didn’t like it, but at least I had answers, you know.</span> <span id="s2288">But I -- anybody who had anything to do with Germans, I stayed really away, and the -- like you say, I was very lonely there, because I couldn’t trust anybody I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2289">But there was one girl, and she was go -- when we were called out for hearings, we were scared stiff because that was life or death again, you know.</span> <span id="s2290">And it all depended on the mood of the guy who interrogated you.</span> <span id="s2291">And we knew it was in a little building, and there was one girl, and she was called out twice a week at least, and mostly around two o’clock in the afternoon, and I told you -- this May, June, July, August, beautiful day, summer, and she was never nervous when she went.</span> <span id="s2292">And she stayed awake for hours, she came mostly back around five.</span> <span id="s2293">And she had a couple of tan shades darker.</span> <span id="s2294">So I thought, you are not in that little building of the hearings.</span> <span id="s2295">I thought, you are a spy, you are planted here.</span> <span id="s2296">Because I knew they had done that in prison, but from her I knew it.</span> <span id="s2297">So I was afraid for the spies, [indecipherable] but her, I had already pinned down.</span> <span id="s2298">And another thing happened, and that was kind of funny.</span> <span id="s2299">One time a big filling fell out of my tooth.</span> <span id="s2300">And you stick all your tongue in that when there is a hole.</span> <span id="s2301">And what do you do?</span> <span id="s2302">So one night one of the girls wakes up screaming, screaming.</span> <span id="s2303">And so we went to the guys at the corners, because we didn’t know they had -- by that time we were there so long they locked us in, and there was four guys, and the windows were all open because we -- I think we stunk, because we had -- never had soap or shampoo.</span> <span id="s2304">But anyway, those guys, we were warned, and then they [indecipherable] there came an ambulance, and they took her away.</span> <span id="s2305">And I thought, “What happens now to her when she is,” -- I thought [indecipherable] kill her, or what And they said, “No, there is a hospital here.”</span> <span id="s2306">And that’s all prisoners, the doctors, the nurses, [indecipherable] everybody is a prisoner except the leaders are Germans.</span> <span id="s2307">And I said, “Is there also a dentist?”</span> <span id="s2308">They said, “Yeah, there’s also a dentist.”</span> <span id="s2309">And by that time we had all had our prison dresses, and if you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray, navy blue, gray, and it had pockets.</span> <span id="s2310">And if you had had your hearing, then you were classified, and you got a triangle, and you probably know about that, but when you were a political prisoner you got a red triangle.</span> <span id="s2311">If you were a murderer you had a green triangle, if you were gay you had a pink triangle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had silver, gray, or something.</span> <span id="s2312">But that was after your hearing.</span> <span id="s2313">And Corrie and Betsie had already been called out.</span> <span id="s2314">And so I heard that there was a dentist, and I asked permission -- a boring life, you know, every day the same, and we were hardly ever marching, because we weren’t allowed to go outside.</span> <span id="s2315">And so then I said, “Could I go to the dentist?”</span> <span id="s2316">And with eight other prisoners, we were brought by a soldier with a machine gun to the dentist.</span> <span id="s2317">So we walked through that camp, and it was in a little building that was -- I think next to the hospital, but I didn’t know, we came through a door.</span> <span id="s2318">And we had eight of us to sit on a bench, and I saw that the dentist had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but he spoke fluent English.</span> <span id="s2319">And he -- and he had a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but I thought, well, maybe he has killed a German, and then you know, for me he is a good mur-murderer, yeah.</span> <span id="s2320">It’s terrible that I say that, but you know, you didn’t know what -- so anyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this city where this Camp Vught was so close to the Philips factories, and all the young men had been sent to Germany, and the top guys, who were necessary, they had been exemptioned to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s2321">But they said to the Germans, we need Dutch people -- we need people to work here, we need laborers to do the work, why don’t you send some busloads of those prisoners every day?</span> <span id="s2322">And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so the Germans couldn’t constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved it, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC on, so they heard all the latest news.</span> <span id="s2323">And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew all the latest news.</span> <span id="s2324">So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, “Would you like to know the latest news?”</span> <span id="s2325">I said, “Yes, please.”</span> <span id="s2326">So he told me they were marching up at Italy, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know.</span> <span id="s2327">And then when my turn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and the next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he was slowly walking up and down, and up and down.</span> <span id="s2328">And I was sitting at the corner, and here was a door.</span> <span id="s2329">And the door started slamming.</span> <span id="s2330">And that’s such an irritating noise, so I closed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was with his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled with bread, much nicer bread than we had outside.</span> <span id="s2331">And was margarine on it.</span> <span id="s2332">So I grabbed it, but the German could come back, so what do you do?</span> <span id="s2333">I gave all the girls one, and was no time to eat, so it goes here, that’s where you stuff everything.</span> <span id="s2334">And then the German walked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went back to the barrack [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny.</span> <span id="s2335">And we knew the news.</span> <span id="s2336">So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said, “Now I have to put a real one in.”</span> <span id="s2337">And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, because we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: And I was so sad, and he says to me, “But I can drill a hole in a good one,” and he said, “I won’t touch a nerve.”</span> <span id="s2340">I said, “Yes, please.”</span> <span id="s2341">And he did several of my good ones, and I was there for weeks.</span> <span id="s2342">And you won’t believe this -- so then in the end, I think that he was -- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn’t know it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators.</span> <span id="s2343">And the Nazis got terrible nervous, and these were our friends, and they didn’t want anybody of this camp ever to be liberated.</span> <span id="s2344">And then they started, every sunset my barrack was right on the edge of the camp, and there was water, and they said there was electricity so you can’t escape, and they said there is a mine field.</span> <span id="s2345">And then you had that fence with the towers and machine guns, and then there were the woods.</span> <span id="s2346">And the machine guns were every time at sunset, and it was in the woods close by that we could hear it.</span> <span id="s2347">And one day I’m doing the laundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and it was covered with blood.</span> <span id="s2348">And one woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be alone for a moment, and think and pray.</span> <span id="s2349">And I had to clean the little room where the guards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly humming a -- a hymn that was really consoling to me, and this woman came in.</span> <span id="s2350">And she could have yelled at me, because you weren’t allowed to sing.</span> <span id="s2351">And she said to me, and that’s German again, I have to spell it, “Sie singen wie ein Heidelarche.”</span> <span id="s2352">You sing like a heather lark.</span> <span id="s2353">And I was really sad, and I didn’t have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she was not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft.</span> <span id="s2354">And she was just on duty, so -- and she could speak a little bit Dutch, they all could.</span> <span id="s2355">So I said to her, “What is this, all this blood?”</span> <span id="s2356">And you know, I had to soak it, and blood has to go in cold water, in troughs where we had to wash ourself.</span> <span id="s2357">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s2358">And she said, “[indecipherable] two guys who have been on a motorbike, they had an accident, in the hospital, and they come out and need their clothes,” so I washed them.</span> <span id="s2359">Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody underwear and clothes.</span> <span id="s2360">And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I thought this is not just something.</span> <span id="s2361">So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to me, they thought you’re a border case, you’re not all [indecipherable], and they said -- Hanny Janssen was her name.</span> <span id="s2362">I said, “Hanny, I have to wash all clothes, you know, that -- that’s hard to do every day, but now it’s all bloody.</span> <span id="s2363">What would that be?”</span> <span id="s2364">I did real stupid.</span> <span id="s2365">She said, “Oh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine guys, are executed.</span> <span id="s2366">They are traitors.”</span> <span id="s2367">And it were our Dutch guys.</span> <span id="s2368">And you know, they dragged you from one camp to another.</span> <span id="s2369">And the next day I got 36 of those bloody clothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood.</span> <span id="s2370">It was so horrible.</span> <span id="s2371">And I didn’t know if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I had to wash those clothes, for names.</span> <span id="s2372">And I was shattered, and I don’t know, I -- I cracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my parents house, under the roses, under the bushes, and I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2373">I thought, if they all the time come and search, and they dig up the yard, and they find the weapons, they’ve shot my parents.</span> <span id="s2374">I really -- I thought my -- I thought I was absolutely going crazy, I didn’t know any more.</span> <span id="s2375">And if I didn’t have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up.</span> <span id="s2376">I was -- the next morning I couldn’t get up, I was paralyzed for three days.</span> <span id="s2377">And they sent the camp doctor, and he kicked the bed, he said, “There’s nothing wrong with you.”</span> <span id="s2378">But I was so weak that then they don’t me -- me -- they didn’t make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a broomstick, and I had to sweep.</span> <span id="s2379">And then I started hating them so much, you know.</span> <span id="s2380">We say I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli.</span> <span id="s2381">And I think you don’t know what hated is.</span> <span id="s2382">With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2383">And I was so angry with God.</span> <span id="s2384">I thought, you are there in heaven, these are your people that they’re killing.</span> <span id="s2385">They’re killing my people, and you can stop this, and you don’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s2386">And I was praying God’s damnation on the whole bunch.</span> <span id="s2387">I was still praying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God’s damnation.</span> <span id="s2388">God [indecipherable] this or that.</span> <span id="s2389">And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs. Verschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s2390">And just in all this stuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by -- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- all those months I had trouble with you may not give false witness, it was one of the things what was in the Bible, a story of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was blessed [indecipherable] Jesus.</span> <span id="s2391">So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from that -- I thought, oh that’s God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I have your permission to lie, and now give me a good story.</span> <span id="s2392">And for months I was praying if they had interrogated me then, I wouldn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s2393">But every day I’d work on that story when I went to bed.</span> <span id="s2394">And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can have.</span> <span id="s2395">So you have a father, no he has died.</span> <span id="s2396">You have a mother?</span> <span id="s2397">She has died.</span> <span id="s2398">No brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s2399">Because if you -- three months later, I didn’t know how long I would have to say it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates.</span> <span id="s2400">So it was really a matter of life and death.</span> <span id="s2401">And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was repeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the night, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s2402">And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or death for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo came for the hearing, had to sign me out.</span> <span id="s2403">And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and she stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she whispered in my ear.</span> <span id="s2404">I’m going to storm the gates of heaven for you.</span> <span id="s2405">And you know, me -- I say to friends, I’ll pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don’t know if you know that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram going.</span> <span id="s2406">And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain coat.</span> <span id="s2407">I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes to the main building of the hearings.</span> <span id="s2408">And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded with God’s promises.</span> <span id="s2409">And one of them is, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed without the will of your heavenly father.</span> <span id="s2410">So they couldn’t even touch a hair of my head without Him.</span> <span id="s2411">And the second one is something that you don’t need every time, but it said also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you the words.</span> <span id="s2412">God promised me.</span> <span id="s2413">And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this “Fiddler on the Roof,” you know, he was always talking to God, I said, “I have broken many promises, but this is a promise, and I hold you to your word.</span> <span id="s2414">But you just have to give me the words.”</span> <span id="s2415">And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S.’s.</span> <span id="s2416">I knew their ranks, and I saw their medals.</span> <span id="s2417">I think about seven at a green table.</span> <span id="s2418">And I told you about the bad food we had, one slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then the line leaves.</span> <span id="s2419">But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a sandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and it had a square inch of pure lard.</span> <span id="s2420">And they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that.</span> <span id="s2421">But because of that bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don’t know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it.</span> <span id="s2422">It started as an itch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you always had them in your face.</span> <span id="s2423">And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your skin couldn’t hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down.</span> <span id="s2424">And we all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2425">And then it was the fifth month, I’ve never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no towels.</span> <span id="s2426">And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so there I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before, I’d wished them all death.</span> <span id="s2427">And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven, and you think that you can decide about my life.</span> <span id="s2428">You can’t even touch a hair of my head if God doesn’t let you.</span> <span id="s2429">And I thought you totally on the wrong side, the -- and actually, the most strange thing, I could feel pity for them.</span> <span id="s2430">They thought they had it all, and they had nothing.</span> <span id="s2431">And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stupid really had done so stupid in those months, and I’d never said one gerd of German, one word.</span> <span id="s2432">So I said, “I don’t know what you’re saying.”</span> <span id="s2433">So they called the translator, and he had to sit there, then they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice the time to think.</span> <span id="s2434">And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in his 50’s, and he said, “I have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed a sixth sense,” he says, “and I can’t,” -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up somewhere, you know, because it was very important.</span> <span id="s2435">But he said, “I can’t put a pin in your story, [indecipherable],” -- he said, “but my sixth sense tells me it’s all baloney.”</span> <span id="s2436">And I told him, because they said I was early 20, so my father must have been in his 40’s.</span> <span id="s2437">And they said, “What did your father there?”</span> <span id="s2438">I thought everywhere before I thought a -- taxes.</span> <span id="s2439">I said, “He worked for the taxes,” because that’s everywhere, in every country, you know.</span> <span id="s2440">And then he said, “Where is he?”</span> <span id="s2441">I said he died, but of course he must have been young.</span> <span id="s2442">He said, “What did he die of?”</span> <span id="s2443">I said he was bitten by a snake.</span> <span id="s2444">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2445">And then they asked me the date, and they have the big Sinter Klass on December five, so my father had died on December five.</span> <span id="s2446">And then, and your mother?</span> <span id="s2447">She has died, too.</span> <span id="s2448">I -- I felt like I was killing my own parents.</span> <span id="s2449">And they said, “What did she die of?”</span> <span id="s2450">I said, “She had a very weak heart, and when Father was brought home there, she died.”</span> <span id="s2451">“When?”</span> <span id="s2452">“10 days later, 15th,” so I thought I could remember that.</span> <span id="s2453">So they asked all questions, but then in the end they started -- and I heard every word, they started discussing my case in front of them.</span> <span id="s2454">And they said, “But she doesn’t look like a maid, she looks more like a secretary, or a teacher.”</span> <span id="s2455">And then I heard another one say, “Well, we can check that.”</span> <span id="s2456">And I thought, how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was.</span> <span id="s2457">And then they brought me -- see, that was the good thing, that I -- that they thought I didn’t know German.</span> <span id="s2458">And then they brought me a magazine and a pad, and a pencil, and said, “Copy that.”</span> <span id="s2459">And I thought -- I think your brains work 200 percent when you’re -- it was life or death again.</span> <span id="s2460">And I thought, why are they with this?</span> <span id="s2461">And then it dawned on me, when you were a maid, by law you had to go through sixth grade, and then you could go, and mostly you were from poor families, and you were farmed out to a wealthy lady where -- or couple, that you had to have the etic -- but you don’t write, you write -- and we had one hour, and some schools two hours of penmanship.</span> <span id="s2462">And if you see those classrooms, the capital A, the small a, the ca -- so that is what your handwriting was when you leave.</span> <span id="s2463">But if you’re a secretary, and you take dictation, you start -- so I thought, that is the trap they put up for me.</span> <span id="s2464">So I sat there, and I hold [indecipherable] with my tongue sticking out like it was really unusual work.</span> <span id="s2465">And then they brought me back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s2466">And then the noise of the a-allies came sh -- all the time closer, and they got more and more nervous.</span> <span id="s2467">And then I remembered one of the women one time says to me -- I was called Willie.</span> <span id="s2468">“Willie, if you can choose what day you go out of prison, what would you choose?”</span> <span id="s2469">And I says, “If I would choose, I want to go in the radiant sunshine, when the world looks so happy.”</span> <span id="s2470">I said, “On a Saturday morning, and take a soak bath, and shampoo, and take care of all that stuff on my face, clean underwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to church and thank God for freedom,” I said, “with capital letters.</span> <span id="s2471">We always take it for granted, but it’s a gift.”</span> <span id="s2472">I said, “But if it pours, and it’s Monday morning, I’ll go too.”</span> <span id="s2473">And you know, this is so miraculous, two weeks later, on a radiant Saturday morning, I was called out by the Hauptmachtmeisterin, she was the highest, and she was a real mean woman.</span> <span id="s2474">And she’s, “Willie, you’ll go to Germany.”</span> <span id="s2475">And the little voice here said, “You’re going home.”</span> <span id="s2476">And that’s when I put the belt on, and I left sweaters I had with the eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was going out.</span> <span id="s2477">And I was let out with another girl, Ansje.</span> <span id="s2478">And Ansje didn’t know it, but her husband had been executed.</span> <span id="s2479">And Ansje, when we had to stand at attention, you know, had always fainted the first.</span> <span id="s2480">And she was married for eight or nine years, and they wanted so much to have a baby, and in the camp she found out she was pregnant, so she fainted all the time.</span> <span id="s2481">And her husband didn’t know it, but he had been executed.</span> <span id="s2482">But when she was let out she didn’t know she was a widow.</span> <span id="s2483">And they let us out at the total different gate than where they had brought us in.</span> <span id="s2484">And there we stood.</span> <span id="s2485">And they had been so cruel with many things.</span> <span id="s2486">They once said to me that I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and then I was there, and I hadn’t had any water -- I mean, that little pail with cold water, and when I stood there, and I’d undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I’d never [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2487">So they did all cruel things to make you happy for something, and they’d -- so we were afraid that the gates would open again and say, “Okay, all a big mistake, back in.”</span> <span id="s2488">And we wanted to get away, but we were so [indecipherable] nervous.</span> <span id="s2489">And there was nothing.</span> <span id="s2490">It was a lot of sand, it was very arid, and in the distance were trees but you saw two wheels from a cart, and you saw some horse manure.</span> <span id="s2491">And this was the end of ’44, and [indecipherable] our whole country does nothing any more.</span> <span id="s2492">If you saw a store, there wouldn’t be a rubber band, there wouldn’t be a paper clip, there wouldn’t be anything.</span> <span id="s2493">And the farmers didn’t get fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so they collected all the manure from their pigs, their chickens, their cows, from everything, and it went in a pit, and then they pumped it up, and they put it in the moving cart, and spread it over the field, and they did that regularly.</span> <span id="s2494">So they never scrubbed that cart wi -- for a few days later they filled it again.</span> <span id="s2495">But this was the end of ’44, so you can -- and we saw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to get away from here, but we didn’t want to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we -- and then we saw a little dot.</span> <span id="s2496">We said, “Let’s see what that is.”</span> <span id="s2497">So we started walking, and it was a farmer who was going to spread all that manure, and that cart was filled to the brim with you know what, and stinking, and he was walking next to it because there was a shelf or something, that -- where you could sit on behind the horse, but it was caked on everywhere.</span> <span id="s2498">And he was walking next to his horse.</span> <span id="s2499">And he’s, “Hi girls, you just came out of the camp?”</span> <span id="s2500">And we said yes.</span> <span id="s2501">And he didn’t know if he should offer us a ride because then we had to sit on that dried stuff.</span> <span id="s2502">And he said, would you -- would you -- but [indecipherable] it was a Cadillac, and we said, “Yes, please.”</span> <span id="s2503">He said, “Hop on.”</span> <span id="s2504">And I think that was such a glorious exit out of that prison, and the concentration camp, on the top of a manure cart.</span> <span id="s2505">And I think like [indecipherable] God in heaven was having a little fun, that he had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Now, now, let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s2507">What was it about this Catholic woman saying that she would storm the gates of heaven for you that brought you out of your anger against God?</span> <span id="s2508">What do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: I -- I really don’t know it, but I think she made me think that she was praying for me, and that I then thought hatred is not really good.</span> <span id="s2510">It -- you know, I -- to be honest, I hated now the German again, and I had the same problem, it took me months and months.</span> <span id="s2511">But if you start hating somebody, it eats you.</span> <span id="s2512">Then you have to, but you need very much strength and prayer to overcome that because you know, and I think that she really shocked me in that I thought she is praying for me, and that I then thought of all God’s promises.</span> <span id="s2513">I mean -- and He keeps His promises, I break them often, by not even th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: But you were sure, in spite of the fact that you were accusing God of not doing anything, because all these horrible things were happening, and that was true, and on the other hand you believed God would protect you.</span> <span id="s2515">Did you -- do you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Well, protect -- I -- I knew -- see, after the war, there were things that -- I had a long time a lot of trouble, because more than half of our friends were killed.</span> <span id="s2517">And then I heard that there was a session of grief, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: And that were so many steps, and that man who led it, he was a psychologist or whatever, and he said, if you miss one of those steps, you cannot be whole.</span> <span id="s2520">And as a matter of fact, then I he -- what he said, I missed the anger against God for -- for my life, because I thought, God didn’t force us, we did it out of our own free will.</span> <span id="s2521">So that part I can’t be angry with God, because, you know, if we hadn’t done it, this mightn’t have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2524">I mean, I think God works in your heart, and that he showed that to me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Were you ever beaten at Vught?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Ever what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: Beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: No, not beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: Uh-huh, you were not.</span> <span id="s2530">Do any of the women that you were with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: There were a couple of Jewish sisters, they were taken out and they were beaten, and one they told me was put in a very hot bath, and then a very cold bath, and the other one came back totally deaf, they had beaten her with the leg of a table, and her drums were broken, and so -- but then, the Jewish people went right away to Westerbork, and then no one saw -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: So these Jewish women were with you, or they were in another part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: No, they were in my barrack for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: In your barrack, I see.</span> <span id="s2535">And was the majority of people in Vught Jewish, and then the rest of you were political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: We were nearly all po -- political.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: The Jewish people were right away sent to -- the majority in our -- were resistance, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: So that -- you’re talking about the majority who stayed there for longer periods of time.</span> <span id="s2542">But the Jews who came in when they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: They were regularly --</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: -- shipped --</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: -- to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: They didn’t stay there long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: Oh, okay, we’ll change the tape right now, because I have another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Diet, y-you and the -- some of the other women embroidered handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s2554">Could you show this and explain what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">A: Now, when your -- when you left your house in the time, there were no tissues.</span> <span id="s2556">The last thing your Mom always yelled when you were at the door, do you have your handkerchief, because it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s2557">And when I was arrested I had my handkerchief.</span> <span id="s2558">And then when I was in Vught, somebody had the needle, and they got the idea, and I did it too then, and we could borrow and from each other clothes we took threads, so we -- you just pulled it out.</span> <span id="s2559">And so here I embroidered -- and every night you could have the needle for about seven minutes, and then [indecipherable] your blanket, so that you did.</span> <span id="s2560">And here I did the date that I was arrested, and then here it must have been from somebody stuck in Scheveningen, that was the prison.</span> <span id="s2561">And then this was -- if you looked up -- high up, there was this window, and I was there in the A corridor, cell 306.</span> <span id="s2562">And this was the cribbiltong, where you had to go in your bathroom.</span> <span id="s2563">And this was quarter to six every morning.</span> <span id="s2564">And then they wanted to call Dutch, but they said, allemaal upschtaan, everybody gets up.</span> <span id="s2565">And then I was brought -- the night of the invasion, June six, we were brought to that concentration camp fer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: And there was -- I was in barrack four, and that was here, where you walked, you saw this big wall, and here the four.</span> <span id="s2568">And there we were in rows of cots, metal cots, with, you -- long rows, three high, and I was in ba -- cot thr -- 125 in the middle.</span> <span id="s2569">And then here, we got once a month the package of the Red Cross, so I did long live the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2570">And here we made our own camp song, Wijlaten demoedniet zakken.</span> <span id="s2571">And at this -- we don’t let our courage go, we keep our heads up, even if they have us now, keep courage, Dutch women, keep courage, Dutch women.</span> <span id="s2572">And we made our own melody, so we sang that all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: Can you sing that song?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: I have a terrible voice [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: It doesn’t matter [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2576">Do you have any recol -- you have a rec -- you remember what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: Yeah, I remember the melody, I still -- when I saw Corrie ten Boom, or if I see anybody who has been, we sometimes sing it.</span> <span id="s2578">[Ms. Eman sings some lines in Dutch].</span> <span id="s2579">Keep courage, even if you feel [indecipherable] and here’s [speaks Dutch] that’s to God, and here I have a big question mark, will I get out, and if so when.</span> <span id="s2580">And here I embroidered the two initials of my false name, Willie Laarman.</span> <span id="s2581">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: Well, would you just hold it up for a moment like that?</span> <span id="s2583">Yes.</span> <span id="s2584">It’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s2585">And you took that with you when you left Vught?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Yeah, I mean, it was to blow your nose in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: -- so they wouldn’t have taken it, I might have [indecipherable] a big blow.</span> <span id="s2589">No, they -- they didn’t take that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: Did you wash this after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: And then I didn’t use it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: But it’s now -- see, here was the needle, and it was there for months, because it took every day a few letters, so -- and I think that rusted, it might have been a rusty needle.</span> <span id="s2596">And here it’s going a little bit [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s2598">And then I have something else that you should explain to everybody, because before you left -- explain what this is, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Now, I had to do the laundry, because that’s in -- but all the other women had to do something, and like I say, there was nothing any more in the Netherlands, so all those other women had to sit on long tables, that was also the tables where we had to eat, and on benches, and they had a rusty cup for themself, and it was water in it, and they got long strips of brown paper, and you know, when you go shopping, for food shopping, then you get those big brown bags, that type of paper.</span> <span id="s2600">And they got long strips, and they have to dump that in the water in strips, and then wind it.</span> <span id="s2601">And they had every day to do 60 meters [indecipherable] little bit, I think 70 yards or so.</span> <span id="s2602">And that was then dried, and when it was dry it was rolled in rolls, and they sold it as twine.</span> <span id="s2603">And then I was arrested in the train, and I had only the one panty on, I had no other clothes, so one time the elastic off my panty broke, and at that time it was -- the elastic was like through a loop, you know -- now they stitch it on, but that wasn’t then.</span> <span id="s2604">So there I was, and I had no panty.</span> <span id="s2605">So I said to the girls who were making that twine, “Can you bring me some of that?”</span> <span id="s2606">And I wind it, and that’s stiff and hard and I can get it through and tie it.</span> <span id="s2607">So they did, but they brought me so much.</span> <span id="s2608">But -- and there was nothing, so that was very precious, and then I had done that with my panty, and I thought what can I do with the rest?</span> <span id="s2609">And there were eight girls that I thought they won’t get out, they won’t survive.</span> <span id="s2610">They were so sick, and TB, and everything.</span> <span id="s2611">That were also the eight that we gave that bread to.</span> <span id="s2612">And I thought, you know what, I’m going to their parents.</span> <span id="s2613">I had deep down the feeling one day I will -- I have those crazy fore-feelings, you know?</span> <span id="s2614">And I had the feeling, you will get out, you will get out.</span> <span id="s2615">So I asked them where do you live?</span> <span id="s2616">And I wrote all the eight addresses down, and their names.</span> <span id="s2617">And then I made it slightly wet, and I wound it, but I had so much, so I didn’t want to have it just as one -- so then, I think without knowing it, I might have done the first macramé.</span> <span id="s2618">And I made this belt, it was in August ’44, I would say.</span> <span id="s2619">But how do you close it?</span> <span id="s2620">So then I did those loops, and one a bit smaller than the other one.</span> <span id="s2621">And out of somebody’s socks, we -- I pulled wool, and then -- so when I was let out, I had this around my waist, and I was planning to go to all those eight parents, they lived in different cities.</span> <span id="s2622">But I had all the addresses in my head, so I never had to open it.</span> <span id="s2623">So this is the real thing.</span> <span id="s2624">But you know, it’s paper, and now it’s getting too dry.</span> <span id="s2625">The other day I wet it just a little bit, but it’s breaking here, and I feel so bad.</span> <span id="s2626">But really, I think 60 years later, it must have bleached up, but the names should still be in here.</span> <span id="s2627">But I still know several.</span> <span id="s2628">Randy Polner was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: Nora Domart, ’32 Amsterdam, and I went there.</span> <span id="s2631">And a few years ago, I went back to see if her family still lived there, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2632">But there was another guy who did TV like you do, and they were kind of interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: So did you go to all of these eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: I went to all those parents, and I told where they were, and that we hoped that they make it out.</span> <span id="s2635">But at least you know something then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: -- because see, Corrie ten Boom, Corrie and Betsie were -- had the hearing, and then you went to the other camp, and that was much easier.</span> <span id="s2638">We were not allowed anything.</span> <span id="s2639">And there Corrie and Betsie [indecipherable] some months you were allowed to write, it was censored, and then some mon-months you were allowed to receive mail.</span> <span id="s2640">You could receive one package a month.</span> <span id="s2641">And you had a working day, but when it was over, you were allowed outside in the camps, free to visit others, in other barracks.</span> <span id="s2642">Now, we were never -- we were now and then marched through a little street, up down, up down, that was all -- and then back, because we were really the ones who hadn’t had a hearing.</span> <span id="s2643">And I did another terrible thing, that Hanny Janssen, the traitor, I heard from somebody -- yeah, I have to tell this too, because it’s really hilarious.</span> <span id="s2644">I heard that she was really a prostitute, and she had started an affair with one of those SS’s on the corner, a young, handsome guy, Hans.</span> <span id="s2645">And somebody told me, “Hanny climbs out of the barrack late, out of window, and then she’s the whole night with this Hans, [indecipherable] and then towards the morning she climbs back.”</span> <span id="s2646">And then -- and she was a prisoner, and we had to stand appel.</span> <span id="s2647">And then they came back, and the man in charge of the appel -- you had the week that you were the stubealteste, that’s the outchder from the -- in time then.</span> <span id="s2648">So one time it was my turn to be stubealteste, and [indecipherable] I have a real mean streak in me, and I’m not sorry for it.</span> <span id="s2649">And anyway, when I heard that, I said to the girl who told me, I said, I know something.</span> <span id="s2650">So then when it was my turn in the morning to tell the guards who locked us up and went away then by that time, they weren’t day and night with us any more, but the guards were there.</span> <span id="s2651">And I locked all the windows from the barrack.</span> <span id="s2652">And Hanny wanted to climb in in the morning, and she couldn’t, there was no window open.</span> <span id="s2653">And then she had to disappear in the woods, because, you know, she [indecipherable] missing, but she was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s2654">So then -- and they all thought that I was so stupid, so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185 prisoners, eight in bed, and so many.</span> <span id="s2655">And then you had to say who were sick or new sick ones.</span> <span id="s2656">And I said -- and I did real stupid, I said, “I know there should be 175 women, but I can only count 174, but I’m probably wrong.”</span> <span id="s2657">But they started counting, and she was missing.</span> <span id="s2658">And then it was daylight, so she couldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s2659">And then oh, there was -- and she was missing.</span> <span id="s2660">And then later, the rumor went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape, but that wasn’t true, and she had to go a month to the bunker, so we were a month without her, and she never knew who -- but then after the war, two guys from the -- from the ger -- from our police came when I was studying nursing, and they came to the hospital where I worked, and they were from the -- the political police, you know, who were checking on all traitors.</span> <span id="s2661">And they said, “You were in Vught, did you know a girl by the name of Hanny Janssen?”</span> <span id="s2662">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2663">“What did you think of her?”</span> <span id="s2664">I said, “I think she was a spy.”</span> <span id="s2665">“Why do you think that?”</span> <span id="s2666">I said, “Because with -- she was called out all the time, she was never nervous, she had a tan when she came back.</span> <span id="s2667">She was very talkative, so she had had wine or beer.”</span> <span id="s2668">And I said, “I had just drawn my own conclusion.”</span> <span id="s2669">And I told what I had done.</span> <span id="s2670">And then they told me it was true.</span> <span id="s2671">But they told me that she was in Rotterdam a prostitute for the very high Germans, and they had uniforms, and the top officers went to her.</span> <span id="s2672">And England found that out, and then they asked -- and there were a lot of volunteers, and like a son of a consul, or an ambassador who grew up in Germany, was fluent in German, and went to school, they probably spoke the dialect.</span> <span id="s2673">And they found one guy who was willing to take a very high imitated German uniform, and they dropped him off over the Netherlands in the night, out of the plane, he had to jump.</span> <span id="s2674">And he had to worm his way into her circle of friends, and he did.</span> <span id="s2675">And in the end he became engaged to her.</span> <span id="s2676">But he was very broadminded, she could see her other friends, and in bed she got so many secrets from -- and he asked questions, general, you know.</span> <span id="s2677">And she found it out, and that went all back to England, till one day -- it was such a secret that they had to narrow it down and it pointed to her.</span> <span id="s2678">But England had more on this guy, so he disappeared, her fiancé disappeared.</span> <span id="s2679">But then the Germans were with a terrible problem, was she really pro-German and a victim, what she was, or was she planted by England?</span> <span id="s2680">So they didn’t know what to do with her, so they put -- I don’t know if they asked me to, so I think that she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: They imprisoned her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">Q: Did they put her in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">A: They arrested her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: They did arrest her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: -- and I think that she had a long prison term.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Where did you -- when you left --</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: The camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: Yes, in this manure truck, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: I went -- first of all to The Hague, and I went to close friends of my parents, we played bridge or something once a week.</span> <span id="s2691">And I wanted to know if they were still alive.</span> <span id="s2692">But they lived far away from where my parents, quite a distance.</span> <span id="s2693">And I thought, you know, that my parents -- they were so wise, because so many people in the underground were arrested, that a friend saw them and said I’ve seen so and so, and that week -- and then the person was arrested.</span> <span id="s2694">Because friends who thought it was interesting to say when they were looking for you, I’ve seen them.</span> <span id="s2695">And I rang the bell there, and I thought they say, “Hi Diet, there you are, and your parents don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2696">Because I had disappeared, they never got those notes any more.</span> <span id="s2697">And they s -- “Hi, I am here.”</span> <span id="s2698">And nothing exciting.</span> <span id="s2699">And I said, “How are father and mother?”</span> <span id="s2700">They said fine.</span> <span id="s2701">And then I said, “ come out of Vught.”</span> <span id="s2702">My parents had given the story that I was -- I had my wedding license, and my -- and I didn’t know how to boil a potato, and Hein had 10 kids there in that family.</span> <span id="s2703">My parents had all the time said when there is -- where is Diet, where is Diet, she -- “Oh, she doesn’t know anything about the household and she’s learning it at Hein’s parents that she knows the household.</span> <span id="s2704">So they did not know it.</span> <span id="s2705">And then I told them, and they went to my parent’s house.</span> <span id="s2706">And then I did the dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s2707">We lived very close to a corner, but in our street were a few Nazis.</span> <span id="s2708">And I said, “Oh, I want to see my parents.”</span> <span id="s2709">You know, I really thought they might have been shot, so I wanted to see them.</span> <span id="s2710">[indecipherable], “Can you go to our parent’s house, and tell them to leave the door open, and then I go on the corner, and I look.</span> <span id="s2711">If nobody is there, and I shoot in the house.”</span> <span id="s2712">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s2713">And then Mom was so happy, because they had really thought I was dead, they hadn’t heard.</span> <span id="s2714">And when -- she was helping, I told you, the baker and the milkman came to the house always, and she was just helping the milkman, and then my father came home, but she didn’t want to say Diet is home, you know, because that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s2715">So my father walks in, and I had -- we had kind of a long house at that time, so I had -- when the doorbell rang, I had gone to the back, because then if there was danger, I would climb over the wall from the rosebushes, and in an alley disappear.</span> <span id="s2716">So I was in the back.</span> <span id="s2717">And then my father came to the back, and he sees me, and he turns around, and walks in a side room.</span> <span id="s2718">And oh, he is furious at me that I caused him so much trouble.</span> <span id="s2719">So I followed him, and that was the first time in my life I saw him crying.</span> <span id="s2720">And he was so happy.</span> <span id="s2721">So then I stayed only till it was dark, and then I left, and found the underground.</span> <span id="s2722">And then I went to all the guys, to Aalt and Alie, and Ab had been arrested.</span> <span id="s2723">No, Ab at that time hadn’t yet been arrested, the other leader.</span> <span id="s2724">And I went also to my sister and her husband.</span> <span id="s2725">So I went to all, and then they said we need you, so many have been a -- arrested.</span> <span id="s2726">And then a guy, this [indecipherable] troop was also helping, because so many were arrested.</span> <span id="s2727">And that -- tho -- they were more in, really, you know, munition things and so.</span> <span id="s2728">And one of them, a spy had to go all the time on dangerous missions.</span> <span id="s2729">And it was -- we had -- he has false papers.</span> <span id="s2730">But it was safer if he had a woman with him, so we had false papers that I was his wife, and then he prin -- it tell you that we were daily laborers, and helping with farms.</span> <span id="s2731">So I went many times with him over the rivers, and through territory where you really weren’t allowed, but that we say we have to work for that farmer, and showed our false papers, and so -- and then he was really in spying, so he asked.</span> <span id="s2732">“Can you work for us while you walk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam?”</span> <span id="s2733">I saw troop movements and everything, and where they are building fort and quarters, and so then that’s that stuff that they gave me for instructions, and I did that till the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: And who was taking care of all the Jews who were still in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: I did too, in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: You did that also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: Because he had often to go to other parts of the Netherlands, but if he needed somebody, I went with him, but I went full time, like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: And it was December of ’44 that Ab was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: Ab was in December because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: -- that family where they had the pilots, that had leaked out, and he got a message from the good police -- there were -- there were bad police and good police, you -- your house will be raided, they suspect you.</span> <span id="s2742">So he disappeared -- he disappeared and went in hiding.</span> <span id="s2743">And Ab was arrested, that Ab also had heard the other leader that they were going to arrest him, because you’ve got mostly warned by the good police, and he went to warn him.</span> <span id="s2744">But the guy, Dries Klooster had already disappeared and gone in hiding.</span> <span id="s2745">And just when Ab was there to warn Dries, the police came, and he was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: He was arrested, so both of them were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: And he never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: And the sad case was with Klooster, and that was another question mark to God.</span> <span id="s2750">I mean, he was hiding at the farm, in the little village, it’s really a -- a settlement, was called [indecipherable] one, two, three.</span> <span id="s2751">And when the allies came, and that were in this case the Canadians, they came from the east, after the battle of Ironham, and the whole thing, and then they were marching up.</span> <span id="s2752">And they wanted to cut off the Germans, and they marched up, and then they were really shelling.</span> <span id="s2753">When they want to advance, they shell, so we said three days and was shell fire in the -- I was with Aalt and Alie at that farm, and Dries was not too far, maybe a few kilometers, but the shells were falling everywhere.</span> <span id="s2754">And one shell hit that farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: And he was killed.</span> <span id="s2757">And I was liberated on Hitler’s birthday by the Canadians, so I got the biggest present.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: April 20th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">A: April 20.</span> <span id="s2760">And the rest of the country was later, but we were really by fighting.</span> <span id="s2761">When I came out after three day, you -- you thought day and night you heard the shells fall, and that was so horrible, boom, boom, boom, and you didn’t know if it would be on your roof, and that it would hit you.</span> <span id="s2762">And we don’t have big basements because we are such a water country, if you go a bit deeper, you’re in the water.</span> <span id="s2763">So we sat there, and then after three days and three nights it was quiet, and that was even spookier than when it got all absolute quiet.</span> <span id="s2764">And you know, like Noah, that we let a dove out to see, and somebody had to go out, what happened.</span> <span id="s2765">And the Jewish people couldn’t go, and the farmer and his wife and two little babies, and she was pregnant, she couldn’t go, and the -- so I felt I was the one who had to go, and I came out, and on the road in the distance, I saw all tanks, and that were the allies, the Canadians.</span> <span id="s2766">Oh, and it -- and I ran towards them, but then I thought, no, that is selfish, I have to go back to the farm, the Jews had been all the time, years in that little room that they can -- and I turn around, and we have so much water, so there was kind of a small river, and it had all those weeping willows.</span> <span id="s2767">And I had heard that in Italy more allies died by snipers than really in battle.</span> <span id="s2768">And when I ran back to the farm, I see three Germans in camouflage in the water, and there’s no -- their daggers between their teeth, and their guns up, and they were walking away from the allies, under the weeping willows.</span> <span id="s2769">And they saw that I had seen them, and I thought, oh my goodness, they are not planning to surrender, otherwise they would have gone the other way.</span> <span id="s2770">So I went -- I went back, I thought, now I have to go to the allies, but I was afraid that they would shoot me in my back.</span> <span id="s2771">I zigzagged to tho -- to those Canadian tanks and I said, “There are snipers.”</span> <span id="s2772">And they turned around, and then they went there, three tanks, and each took one of the Germans like -- really like [indecipherable], and then I said there they are.</span> <span id="s2773">And I said that’s when I won the war, I was triumphant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Now tell me something, did any of the Jews that you -- your group was hiding, did any of them get caught?</span> <span id="s2775">Nobody got caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">A: From our original group, never.</span> <span id="s2777">The group from Mies that we helped, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: The whole group.</span> <span id="s2780">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: But not the original group of 60?</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: No, they all got through.</span> <span id="s2783">Miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Really a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: But if we knew that a thing was getting unsafe, we had -- you know, there was one -- you know, Esso, that is that very wealthy oil -- a son of them, Hans von Esso, and his sister Alie, and I was somewhere, and this Hans from Esso came to us for an address.</span> <span id="s2786">And I never forget, I was at Yen, that was another one of our group in The Hague, and he saw me, and Yen said she brings all the Jewish people to the -- to [indecipherable] to that area.</span> <span id="s2787">And he stuck his hands in his pockets, and he held it out, and it was full with diamond and emeralds, and he, “Please, find me a place.”</span> <span id="s2788">I said, “You can put that away, that doesn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2789">I help -- the forest and whatever, if we find a place.”</span> <span id="s2790">And then -- but this was so far in the war, I think they had been somewhere else, where it wasn’t safe, and he had real trouble finding a place.</span> <span id="s2791">And then he found something, but he asked for his sister Alie, she was beautiful, and younger than he was.</span> <span id="s2792">And we found a place at this very poor farm, so poor, it was really the married daughter of the farmer where we had Herman.</span> <span id="s2793">And she was a sloppy household, where they had a bunch of babies.</span> <span id="s2794">And you know she was -- so that was the only place, and it was so poor, and she had to sleep in the hay.</span> <span id="s2795">And Rosa was at that time at an address [indecipherable] safe, so Rosa was there, too, and Rosa got scabies, you know, that’s really from dirt.</span> <span id="s2796">And Alie got it too.</span> <span id="s2797">And Rosa went to -- back to Arlington when it was safe, and there she was, you know, bath and what -- boil the clothes, and so -- but Alie couldn’t take it any more because Rosa told me later, she said, “That wife of that farmer was so filthy,” they had on the table a piece of oilcloth or something, and then she said, “that’s where we had to eat, they didn’t have any tablecloth,” or whatever.</span> <span id="s2798">So -- but she changed the dirty diaper of the baby there too, on that table, and sometimes didn’t clean, so it was a filthy house.</span> <span id="s2799">And then Alie, who came from such a wealthy family, and probably had lots of servants, she couldn’t hack it any more, and she went back into her other [indecipherable] and she was arrested, and she was killed.</span> <span id="s2800">And I think oh, that poor Alie, if she had only had held out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A: Because the camps might have been just as dirty.</span> <span id="s2803">Hans came through [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2804">No, we were very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: But you’re not so fortunate personally, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: I have to look at it this way.</span> <span id="s2807">We were four, really five years in this war, and if you think that more then two and a half year, every month we had to do those robberies.</span> <span id="s2808">And they were only once [indecipherable] and you always prayed beforehand if God would protect everybody, also the enemy, where the Dutch people were [indecipherable] and I think God is almighty, and Hein was killed in the end of January ’45, the war was over.</span> <span id="s2809">I was free in April [indecipherable] I just know that God [indecipherable] have protect [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2810">So I figured -- and so many didn’t come back, and I was spared three times that I thought this is the end, when I were driven in the dunes, when I had my hearing, when I was arrested with all that stuff.</span> <span id="s2811">So then, I think God still has something for me to do, and I have to find it.</span> <span id="s2812">And now that I look back I see it, because it’s telling the young people in the universities, and you don’t know a thing here in America.</span> <span id="s2813">I had to speak for Yad-Vashem, I got [indecipherable] later from -- and I met that rabbi, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s2814">Mordechai Paldiel, have you heard his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: And I mean, he is -- really became a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s2817">And then they asked me to speak for Yad-Vashem as a fundraiser, they want to build the school next to the museum, and they invited in, I’d learned, a very wealthy [indecipherable] a very wealthy Jewish people, and I had to speak, and then they all got a book, and need to write a fat check, and so on.</span> <span id="s2818">But I mean, I met them, and I think well, I have a purpose, you know?</span> <span id="s2819">And they say, go along with -- tell, tell, tell, and that’s what I do.</span> <span id="s2820">And they do that now with teachers, that they over the whole world make [indecipherable], and there was in Canton, in Ohio, there is Malone College, that’s a liberal arts, Malone College, and there’s a large Jewish group, and they ask me -- they started -- I think that’s now about eight years ago, in the summer when the college is closed, they have a week long that it’s a whole Holocaust week.</span> <span id="s2821">And the rabbis, and the people [indecipherable] they had then one survivor of Auschwitz, an old man, and they had a Jewish lady who was hiding, a Polish Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s2822">They had the Polish lady who had taken Jews in, and they wanted me then to come, and I [indecipherable] the whole week, and you know, I was really surprised.</span> <span id="s2823">The first year they told me they had 12 people, and now there were 45, so this was the third year, and now I hope it grows.</span> <span id="s2824">But those teachers, that is good, they go back to their schools and talk.</span> <span id="s2825">Because I -- one lady there, they asked -- I mean, she says, “When I was in college, my prof told me the Holocaust never happened, and it’s a sob story that the Jewish people do just to get pity.”</span> <span id="s2826">So can you imagine that you say that to a class of students?</span> <span id="s2827">So I feel I have to go.</span> <span id="s2828">I have to go and then like I was those 10 years in Venezuela, that was a healing time away from everything, no talking about it, nothing.</span> <span id="s2829">Because when my friends from Venezuela, we only 18 Dutch families, and I knew them all because those women married mostly, they ha -- they were engaged, and then they got this great job after the war from Shell, so they quick got married and they had their first baby their, and the doctors only spoke Spanish, and they were scared stiff, because [indecipherable] they were expecting their first baby, so I was called out for every delivery, and they all became my friends, and they were like brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s2830">And I still have contact with them.</span> <span id="s2831">But you know, that was such a healing time, and I never talked about the war.</span> <span id="s2832">And then when the book came out later, they said, “We were 10 years with you, and you never said it.”</span> <span id="s2833">But I think that was the good thing that I was away from all memories there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">End of Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: How did you find out about Hein?</span> <span id="s2838">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Well, his father -- of course we weren’t married, he got a notice from the Red Cross, and that notice said that he had died in Dachau on March nine.</span> <span id="s2840">So he let me know, and I right away said, “If he has died, it was January 20.”</span> <span id="s2841">And the father really got angry with me, but that was the night I couldn’t sleep, and that I was pacing that big room at that farm.</span> <span id="s2842">And I had to sleep in a double bed with a girl in her -- a few years older than I was, if I slept there.</span> <span id="s2843">And it was so cold, and there was no heating, and she said, “Willie, come in in bed, it’s so cold.”</span> <span id="s2844">And I said to her, “There is something with Hein,” it was that horrible feeling again that I got.</span> <span id="s2845">I said, “What is today the date?”</span> <span id="s2846">She said, “January 20.”</span> <span id="s2847">I said, “When he comes back, I’m sure he’s very, very sick, and that I have to ask him if he was sick.”</span> <span id="s2848">And that was the night he died, and I heard that later.</span> <span id="s2849">And the Red Cross say nine, but when other people were let out, some survivors and they -- I -- I me -- I met them, and they said Hein was taken out of the barrack on January 20 in the evening, and never came back.</span> <span id="s2850">But he was very weak, and he had [indecipherable] where you couldn’t work any more, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q: This was your biggest tragedy.</span> <span id="s2852">This was your biggest tragedy, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: It was terrible, and I know that I made it so difficult for the guy who came to tell me.</span> <span id="s2854">That was the father of one of those guys that Henk had mentioned to me [indecipherable] was arrested, Dekker was his last name, and he was in the town hall, or town city, or something in -- in Eindhorf also, and he had to go to The Hague, and Hein’s father wrote me the letter that Hein had died.</span> <span id="s2855">And I was so happy that we were free, and this terrible -- and the Jewish people could come back, but there was also a fear, there were too many in Germany, who comes back, who co -- doesn’t come back.</span> <span id="s2856">So you were mixed, you didn’t dare to be really happy because you didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2857">And then this man came back and rang the bell, and I opened the door, and I said, “Oh, Mr. Dekker,” and his son had come back, and I said, “How nice to see you.”</span> <span id="s2858">I said, “Oh how wonderful that we are free and now waiting for our guys to come back.”</span> <span id="s2859">And I was so bubbly.</span> <span id="s2860">And then he said to me, “Yeah, but some won’t come back.”</span> <span id="s2861">And so he wanted to push me a bit down, you know, and I -- yeah but -- and I was just bubbling, and then I got that letter.</span> <span id="s2862">It was terrible, I don’t know if I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: On the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: But then -- very -- remember very little, I was in a daze.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2866">On the other hand, you thought that that might have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: I expected --</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: A -- on bo -- you expected [indecipherable] some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: [indecipherable] and I nearly -- I don’t know how well you know the Torah and the Bible, but you know, Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac, and I thought maybe this is the sacrifice that God asks me, but I know I didn’t want to live any more, because then, from our group of 15, eight were killed, so more than half I thought I didn’t want to live any more.</span> <span id="s2870">I said, “Lord, why didn’t you take me too, I don’t want to live any more.”</span> <span id="s2871">But then slowly but surely, you -- it -- that you have always a task for you.</span> <span id="s2872">Oh, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2873">And then Ab was killed --</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: And Hergen Feesler was killed, the man who took the picture when we are hugging, that he wanted to.</span> <span id="s2876">But Herg was very brave, he -- now allies were coming, and the Germans had mined a bridge, and thought if they come over, we let it go in the air.</span> <span id="s2877">And Herg knew that, and then the allies were real close, he ran through that bridge, and he cut all the wires on the explosion, and he was shot, and he also gave his life, he was brave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Why did you write in your book --</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: Write it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: -- why did you write in your book that in some way you thought it w -- if one of you had to live that -- not that it was better that you were the one who lived, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: -- you could do it, that somehow you could do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: I think it was harder to stay alive.</span> <span id="s2884">I think it would be the easier to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: I went through such terrible things, because when I was let out of the camp, I didn’t want in any way that they knew I had been in prison.</span> <span id="s2887">And I had smuggled a note out with this girl whose husband had been shot, tortured, and I had said don’t ask me any questions, but I knew her husband had been executed, so she was okay, she was not [indecipherable] and she lived in a suburb of The Hague.</span> <span id="s2888">So I said, please go to [indecipherable] this note, ask anything.</span> <span id="s2889">If you see that there is Gestapo around, pretend that you are collecting for the winter help, that was from the Germans.</span> <span id="s2890">I said, “But if you get to see, tell that Willie is in Vught, and that they may not do anything to try to get me out,” because I was creating this image from the stupid girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: And I -- and too, the guys, the underground was trying like to [indecipherable] to bribe a big -- they were saving thousands of guilders to get me out, right?</span> <span id="s2893">But that would have ruined my whole story, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">A: -- then I was important if they give so much money.</span> <span id="s2896">So she did that.</span> <span id="s2897">Then my parents knew where I was.</span> <span id="s2898">But I -- I told also in that message, and let the guys never do -- and let Hein not know that I am also in prison, because it was such a torture when somebody you love dearly -- I think with children, too, if your children suffer, you want to suffer yourself, but not them.</span> <span id="s2899">And that’s how I felt with Hein, and I thought, oh, that was one of the cruel things that guy did, the -- the German.</span> <span id="s2900">I had told him, I’ll bring you everywhere, drive me, but there are two places in this world where I never want to go, and that is the concentration camp Amersfoort, because Hein was terrible tortured there.</span> <span id="s2901">And it’s right in the middle where we hid all -- I’ve thousand times passed it, but I don’t want to go there, what for?</span> <span id="s2902">To cry?</span> <span id="s2903">Then to think of all the suffering, and the horror, he was killed.</span> <span id="s2904">And I’ve three times passed the road that it says kil -- three kilometers [indecipherable] and I never go in, I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s2905">And this guy drove me the last day he went off th -- he went many times off the track, and I said you’re going wrong, you’re going wrong.</span> <span id="s2906">[indecipherable] and the last day I couldn’t -- I was so happy it was over, he was a miserable guy.</span> <span id="s2907">And then he turns off the road, and he come in the woods, and I had no idea.</span> <span id="s2908">I said Martin [indecipherable] straight ahead today.</span> <span id="s2909">And he come in the woods, and he stops at the building, says here we are.</span> <span id="s2910">I had no idea where we were, and the -- then is the sound guy and the camera man were there, and they [indecipherable] me up.</span> <span id="s2911">And Martin starts on the new path, slightly up, and I follow, and I see the sign, the place of execution of that horrible camp.</span> <span id="s2912">Now, is that cruelty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: Sounds cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: Where I told him --</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">Q: Not to do it, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">A: And I was so furious, I said, “What a creep you are.”</span> <span id="s2917">I said, “I told you this is the place,” I said, “I’m 82, I can decide.”</span> <span id="s2918">And I did not -- I said, “I have no words for you.”</span> <span id="s2919">And I turned around and I walked away.</span> <span id="s2920">And then the sound guy, who had always disconnected [indecipherable] an-and the camera man, they said that they have left this on, that the TV station knows what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2922">You -- you have Hein’s diary.</span> <span id="s2923">You have loads of letters, and there’s one final letter that he threw out of the tra -- train, that he threw on the ground, and somehow it reached you.</span> <span id="s2924">Can -- can you read that, part of it?</span> <span id="s2925">Or do you want me to read the English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: No, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: You can’t?</span> <span id="s2928">Can you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: I can, yeah.”</span> <span id="s2930">It is still very unexpected,” -- it’s so small -- “r-really, they didn’t count on this any more.</span> <span id="s2931">I am happy that they have left the camp Amersfoort,” -- so he must have suffered there -- “and yesterday” -- you see, it’s so small and my eyes are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: Here -- here’s -- here’s from your book, you can read this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">A: Oh that’s better, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: You can read it from the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: “Yesterday, about nine in the evening we left, and now it’s seven in the morning.</span> <span id="s2936">We just passed Rijssen,” and that is the last city in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s2937">“I think that trip will be quite long.</span> <span id="s2938">Darling, don’t count on seeing each other again soon.</span> <span id="s2939">I have the feeling that it will take at least a year.</span> <span id="s2940">But we are with friends here altogether, and you will soon be in free country, so we have many reasons to be optimistic.</span> <span id="s2941">And here we see again that we do not decide our lives.</span> <span id="s2942">Dieneke,” -- that was his nickname for me -- “even if we won’t see each other on earth again, we will never be sorry for what we did, and that we took this stand.</span> <span id="s2943">And know, Diet, that of every last human being in this world, I loved you the most.</span> <span id="s2944">And it’s still my great desire that we be -- will become a happy family someday.”</span> <span id="s2945">And then he ends with the words, “Omnia vincit amor.”</span> <span id="s2946">That is Latin for love conquers all.</span> <span id="s2947">And you know, when we got engaged, it was on the tram in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2948">We had our rings, and -- because we had ordered our rings, and what we wanted engraved.</span> <span id="s2949">And then he came home, there was a manila envelope and he was on list to go to England, and then he found that manila envelope, and he said, “Diet, these are my instructions to go to England,” he said, “and I have to leave right away,” and it was a Saturday afternoon, we had just ordered our rings and what we wanted inscribed, and he said, “And I may not tell you where I go and what I do, but I go tonight to England.”</span> <span id="s2950">He said, “Do you remember,” -- I didn’t know Amsterdam [indecipherable] he said, “Do you remember where we ordered the rings?”</span> <span id="s2951">I said [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2952">He said, “Go there, pick them up,” -- he had paid for it and for the engraving, he says -- and there was a tramway that go to the main station, the central station, and it was line two.</span> <span id="s2953">He says -- and the tram mostly had three or two or three carriages, and there was a balcony that was open where you step on, and then you went inside.</span> <span id="s2954">And he said, “Hop on the last balcony of the last car, and then after two stops, I’ll hop on too.</span> <span id="s2955">I have to ta -- get a few things.”</span> <span id="s2956">So I ran to that store, and I got our rings and the guy said, “I haven’t engraved,” I said, “Doesn’t matter.”</span> <span id="s2957">So I hopped on the tram, on the last cart, and two stops later he came, and he gave me his ring, and I gave him my ring, and that was our engagement, on the back balcony of the -- and then we had it engraved later, it -- he was in very big danger, it was a dangerous trip, and he never got to England.</span> <span id="s2958">But at that time, in the beginning we thought that’s where you can be useful --</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: -- but later those people were bored stiff, we could do much more.</span> <span id="s2961">But then we have engaged on the [indecipherable] and his name and the morning, it was another premonition, the morning -- the day that I was arrested -- I had always that ring on, and I took it off, and I said to Alie from the farm, I said, “Today I’m going to be arrested.”</span> <span id="s2962">She said, “Willie, you are nervous, and,” -- Hein had just been arrested then, maybe.</span> <span id="s2963">I said, “I know I’m nervous,” I said, “but I have such a strong feeling that I’ll be arrested today.”</span> <span id="s2964">And I said, “Will you take this ring till after I come back,” because his name was in the ring, and so then they could say it was Hein.</span> <span id="s2965">So I gave her the ring, and it was really funny, because I had all white underwear, but I had se -- one set black, and I thought when you are in prison, and you can’t wash it, and it gets dirtier and dirtier, it -- I thought I’ll put my black one on, it get also dirty, but you don’t see it.</span> <span id="s2966">I put my black underwear on, and I knitted [indecipherable] with the cable stitch, and I thought that is nice and solid, and that’s how I went on that trip, and on that trip I was arrested.</span> <span id="s2967">Strange, huh?</span> <span id="s2968">I’m always scared when I get that feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2970">Do you ever regret having been in that group with you all --</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">Q: -- being in resistance, even though you lost Hein?</span> <span id="s2973">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: I tell you, I saw -- I never go to war movies, but I saw “Schindler’s List” because I heard he changed later.</span> <span id="s2975">But he started with wanting cheap labor.</span> <span id="s2976">And I sat there, and I cried the whole film, and long times I closed my eye [indecipherable] hated Hitler, and the swastika, and that wolfs angel and those hated uniforms, and all.</span> <span id="s2977">And I had a horrible time, but I wanted to see it, and in the end Schindler’s changed because he -- later he’s very sorry that he didn’t save more.</span> <span id="s2978">And when I walked out of that theater, the only thing I said, “Thank you God, I did something.”</span> <span id="s2979">Because I thought, if now I would have seen that movie, I thought you were there.</span> <span id="s2980">You were young, but you were an adult, 20 year a -- an adult.</span> <span id="s2981">And I thought, you were there, and this happened all around you, and you didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2982">I don’t know if I -- and that’s what I tell the young people, I said, “Make the right choices,” I said, because -- and I tell them this, I said, “If I now -- you can’t go back and do it over.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: “You have at that moment,” and I said, and that ma -- may [indecipherable] during the [indecipherable] and I says, “Whatever your religion have -- you have, you have guidelines.”</span> <span id="s2985">I say, “And if you don’t have a religion, you have a little voice in your heart, and you listen to that.”</span> <span id="s2986">It’s the only way that you can in the morning when you brush your teeth look in the mirror and not despise yourself.</span> <span id="s2987">No, I never [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2988">And to be honest, spiritually it was the closest time to God, because He was all I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2991">I think I’ve had a very wonderful, rich, life, and not always the things that you choose, but I asked for it, I really did.</span> <span id="s2992">Not a dull life, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2994">Well, I thank you more than you know for coming and talking with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: It’s good to be here, because you keep this for hundred and 200 years later --</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: -- so then people will know, and it’s good that you have eyewitnesses, because hearsay is never the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">Q: That’s true.</span> <span id="s2999">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: No, I am glad that I came.</span> <span id="s3001">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">[Note: At the conclusion of the interview, several photos are shown while Ms. Eman describes each.]</span> <span id="s3003">End of Tape #10</span></p> <p><span
