And I was born in Czernowitz, Chernowoods(ph), Chernofsa(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: In Bukovina?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Bukovina, the, at that time still province of the Austria-Hungarian empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Can you tell us in a few words about your background, your, your family life, your school years in, in Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s19">My father was a, a lawyer but worked for the government for the, the Department of Finance in Czernowitz and in 1914, he was transferred to Vienna by the Ministry of Finance and lived there for four years with my mother and my 16 years old sister, so born 1912.</span> <span id="s20">She went to school, we always spoke German at home.</span> <span id="s21">And my parents were example of Austrian, very loyal Austrian citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: So how was your life, what do you remember about your school years?</span> <span id="s23">Where, where did you go to school, why type of school was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I went to Romanian school the first, I did not go to kindergarten, the Romanian grade school.</span> <span id="s25">I went to a public Romania, there were private schools, but I went to a public Romanian schools, had colleagues, Gentile and few Jewish.</span> <span id="s26">It was a Gentile school and felt comfortable.</span> <span id="s27">And I have only one, especially which is in my mind, one memory of anti-Semitic and hostile remark of someone and I was I think seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s28">And that was in the house of my, a friend of mine whose father was a priest.</span> <span id="s29">It was a Greek, a Greek Orthodox religion was prevailing and he was a Greek Orthodox priest.</span> <span id="s30">And it was Paysa(ph) time and he asked me, he knew that I was Jewish and asked me very intensively about our habits and whether we ate mussels and did I know that there might be blood in it, etc.</span> <span id="s31">And that shocked me then, in much I did not cry or what, and that was my first experience with remark like that.</span> <span id="s32">Otherwise we had Christian neighbors and so on, we, we’re just in peace of, with them.</span> <span id="s33">It was grade, I mean grade school and then high school we went to a private school and that was mostly, many Jewish colleagues, also some Christians.</span> <span id="s34">I, that was first to eighth of lycee and then, should I go on with my studies, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Yeah, if you could be so kind as to continue about, about, how whether [talkover] years before the war and if you encountered any other cases of anti-Semitism directed or your family encountered cases of anti-Semitism and then we’ll go on with the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: It was encountered directly and indirectly.</span> <span id="s37">Directly, it was just very much in my mind, was already, I was a student at the University of Czernowitz, where I, I had one year of law and, and at the same time literary humanities and I continued this __________.</span> <span id="s38">And at that time, there was the Kova Kooza(ph) time in Romania, 1938, and I watched, I was supposed to go out at night and I see coming toward me some, I mean at some distance, some colleagues of mine from the law school with clubs in their hands and looking for Jews and beating them up.</span> <span id="s39">And they ran back home but I then had the report from many people who experienced it and that was very strong shock because I did not, these were my boyfriends, my colleagues, my friends, among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So, so these people were followers of Kova Kooza(ph)?</span> <span id="s41">[talkover] But followers of Kova Kooza(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No, they were followers, they were not, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s44">Can you, can you describe, at length, please take your time, what happened to you and your family once the Soviets took for one year, Bukovina in 1940.</span> <span id="s45">What did you witness in terms of what happened to the Jewish population of Bukovina between July 1940 and June 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: May I go back to the, my student years because that is something very important about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Sure, please, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I told you about direct experiences and I will tell you two indirect experiences of which, affected my, my career, my life.</span> <span id="s49">In 1936 when I finished high school with my baccalaureate, the dream of my life when I was a little girl, you would have asked me what I am going to become, I would tell you a pediatrician.</span> <span id="s50">I had this great election for medicine.</span> <span id="s51">And in 1936, there was numerus noolus(ph) which means that I could not get into any medical school.</span> <span id="s52">I, resignation, I continued my humanity studies until 1940 when the Russians come in.</span> <span id="s53">The other indirect, so that affected me personally very much, the other indirect experience in the family was my sister who had her PhD at that time, still pretty rare, in humanities, in French.</span> <span id="s54">And she was very well qualified for being a university professor.</span> <span id="s55">She could teach only at the high school level and not in the public school.</span> <span id="s56">So that affected both of us.</span> <span id="s57">I would, now I can come back to the place which you asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Sure, so, so again, if you could tell us, what did you witness before, between July 1940 and June 1941 during the one year of occupation of Bukovina and of Czernowitz of course by the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: By the Soviets?</span> <span id="s60">I had to interrupt my studies.</span> <span id="s61">I worked, I did not continue my studies.</span> <span id="s62">I was supposed to have my __________ at that time.</span> <span id="s63">And I worked in factory in the, some secretarial work, I had picked up some Russian and that was enough for my job.</span> <span id="s64">And I, I mean this is the experience of the Russian Occupation.</span> <span id="s65">From my very personal, I told you that I had this 16 years older sister and she, she’s much more, I was closer, closer to her than to my mother or my father.</span> <span id="s66">And she was not married at that time and we spend a lot of time together.</span> <span id="s67">And the, the discrepancy between her and me, she was crying for, for the collapse of the old world, of the belle epoch(ph), which she experienced and was very sad and, and worried.</span> <span id="s68">I was, and me being very young, there was a lot of curiosity what are the Russians, what is going to happen now?</span> <span id="s69">And I had a, quite a good year, from the, let us say from the emotional and, point of view, however, our standard of life went way down because my father is a lawyer, did not earn one penny, only what my, the very poor salary which I earned and my sister also teaching in some school.</span> <span id="s70">And so from that point of view but, and how did I experience that?</span> <span id="s71">I knew some, I picked up some Russian that I knew also from before something and I felt quite comfortable not, not enthusiastic but not really very bad, not threatened yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you, did you witness for deportations done by the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: By the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, the first were the Russians who did it.</span> <span id="s76">I witnessed it only from my home and from hearsay.</span> <span id="s77">But there were very close friends of my father’s who were deported and never came back.</span> <span id="s78">And there were others, and there were relatives who were deported and never came back.</span> <span id="s79">There was, and some cousins and the very old parents of them volunteered to go with them and that is __________ Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Do you remember which, when this was roughly, the months when this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: The month when, when the deportations [talkover] .</span> <span id="s82">.</span> <span id="s83">.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Was fall or was winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Before 1941, it, that was, they, at the end of, in the spring, summer ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s87">Unless you want to say something more about this year, 1940, 1941, the, the year of Soviet Occupation, we can go farther and start to talk about what happened to you and your family once the Germans and Romanians entered Czernowitz and what exactly, what happened to you during the first and your family during the first days of the war.</span> <span id="s88">So we are on 22nd . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Of June, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">I could elaborate on ’40, ’41, but it is not, I don’t think it if very relevant, only for the fact, the only fact which is relevant is that I met my husband at that time.</span> <span id="s93">Although we were, he’s also from Czernowitz and we lived quite in the neighborhood but we never met each other because we somehow belonged to different circles.</span> <span id="s94">And, and so I met him in this factory where I, where I worked as a secretary and we went out a whole year already.</span> <span id="s95">No, only the last few month of this year.</span> <span id="s96">No, as a matter of fact, some eight or nine month and during the Russian Occupation.</span> <span id="s97">And, that is the only thing which I think is important for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s99">Very good so we are on 22nd of June, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: ’41.</span> <span id="s103">Yes.</span> <span id="s104">When the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: This is the following.</span> <span id="s107">In, okay, a neighbor rang the bell and told us that the, the airport was bombarded.</span> <span id="s108">And I was, the war broke out and my, I had a __________ director there at the factory, I was in the factory.</span> <span id="s109">And this, my director said, “Nobody goes home.</span> <span id="s110">You stay here, overnight.”</span> <span id="s111">And my husband, went somehow to him, and talked to him and he let me go home.</span> <span id="s112">And we, Czernowitz was, when the, when the Russians left, this town was without water, without light and now let me, I don’t want to mix something up.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">And I, I told you that I already was with my, so to say engaged . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: We, what date in, that when, this, my husband did not work yet, a little later but he will tell you about that but we were in our house until October 11th, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: But let’s, let’s back off a little bit.</span> <span id="s119">Let, let’s describe, if you could describe to us what did you witness when the Romanian troops and the German troops entered Czernowitz and what happened until October, I mean what happened during the summer, and during the early fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That was not yet the wearing of the star, there was not yet, there was not yet restrictions that you have, cannot go out at, at certain hours.</span> <span id="s121">That, that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So, so, so the life wasn’t a [talkover] the first few months was a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Not, not normal because everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s124">The city was [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: But for Jews there were no discrimination during [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: For, for Jews, we already, until, that was October 11th, we were already taken to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Then already, yet I don’t, I don’t remember very exactly when they imposed this not going out in the street and not going [talkover].</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: How ‘bout, how ‘bout, let me, let me back off again and ask you, did you witness during the first days of the war, or more exactly when the Romanian and German troops entered Czernowitz, did you see, did you witness any executions, any deportations during those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I did not witness executions but I heard of them immediately.</span> <span id="s131">There were a lot of people taken to so-called house of __________, and they were, and they were friends, two friends of mine there, of ours there.</span> <span id="s132">And they were in, and they were, I think I made a mistake, and they were threatened, all the time threatened by people who watched over them.</span> <span id="s133">And finally, many of them were taken out and executed, among them our chief rabbi, Mark(ph), and but, but nobody was, and all the others were just threatened and let go home again.</span> <span id="s134">When I think back now, I remember that there was sooner than that imposed, the star and the curfew because I, I was not married yet but we were always together, my husband and I and he spent a lot of time at my house and I remember that there was already wearing the star and I remember the first day, that I do indeed wear the star which was very strong emotional [talkover] experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Can you describe please, where and how they moved you and your family to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">On, we did not know anything about an establishment of the ghetto be, before the very early morning of the, of the 11th of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: October 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: October 1941.</span> <span id="s140">Again, very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s141">We were at the same neighbor, rang the bell and told us there are some signs, big signs put up in the street that you should not, but the signs were not a direct, it was indirect authority.</span> <span id="s142">It said something which you could not understand very well.</span> <span id="s143">It was written that you cannot, you shouldn’t have contact with Jews, you should not buy anything from them, you should not sell them anything, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s144">And it was not clear.</span> <span id="s145">By the way, interesting is that the, my, Carl, my betrothed at that time went to work.</span> <span id="s146">He worked at the railway station.</span> <span id="s147">And he went to work and I was alone with my parents, with my sister and they told us __________ this, this ghetto and we have to be there as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s148">And you already, we, we looked out of the window and right on the second or the third floor and we saw people with bundles already leaving the house.</span> <span id="s149">What did they, what did the Czernowitz people do, they, I mean, the Romanians.</span> <span id="s150">They enclosed a certain part of, of the city and all the Jews who had somebody there walked in and we moved to another, our house was evacuated, our apartment.</span> <span id="s151">And we had to move to some, some relatives.</span> <span id="s152">Interesting is, that when we, there were some neighbors in the house and they said, “You know, well look at that, they’re taking us to a ghetto and they’re, they will deport us.”</span> <span id="s153">And my father, who I told you was a lawyer, he said, “But this is against European, the __________.</span> <span id="s154">The European right of, European law.”</span> <span id="s155">And the, so my neighbor thought __________, didn’t know that you are, that you’re, don’t, I’m not an alcoholic, I would think that you had something to drink because you see the people, the people go for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s156">We of course prepared and then my husband came and, and all the family together, the whole family, I don’t enumerate all the family.</span> <span id="s157">And we lived in house of a cousin who lived in a street which belonged to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s158">Our street did not fall into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s159">And we were immensely crowded there but we were still together.</span> <span id="s160">The family was together.</span> <span id="s161">And in, on this, yes, then we stayed there until let us say the, 16th, in this particular house.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: 16th of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Of October, or maybe it was the 15th.</span> <span id="s164">They evacuated street by street and they came, the people on, on these peasant carts to the railway station and putting __________ and taking them away.</span> <span id="s165">Very interesting event, also, I would like to mention that my, my Carl and I, we had everything packed on this cart already, already, yes.</span> <span id="s166">In the, I go back.</span> <span id="s167">In the, the early morn, morning, I don’t know, six or seven o’clock, some soldiers came and knocked at the __________ said to us, “We, it’s, it’s your turn.</span> <span id="s168">You better pack.”</span> <span id="s169">And we packed the things of the whole family on this cart and it was loaded to the top and everybody was looking for only Carl and me because we were the youngest of the family.</span> <span id="s170">And we were, they were standing there, some of them, very old and broken, and, and Carl and I were walking the street, back and forth.</span> <span id="s171">And a friend of ours came and said, “Carl, you know they’re, they are making lists of specialists, of people who have a certain profession.</span> <span id="s172">And these people won’t go.”</span> <span id="s173">And Carl went to the, yes, and when we walked, some officers came, Romanian officers came and he accosted, he went to one and told him, “I am an engineer and I hear about lists.”</span> <span id="s174">And he said to him, “Stay __________.”</span> <span id="s175">Not one word, and, and left, this officer.</span> <span id="s176">Very kindly he said it and but only one word.</span> <span id="s177">And when we arrived, and then came our turn, there were cart by cart standing there in line and when our, it came our, our cart came on the turn of us, at this court, on one side it went to the railway station, on the other side it went back to the city.</span> <span id="s178">Carl took some bill out of his pocket and gave it to the soldier who was watching there and he took us to the other direction.</span> <span id="s179">And then we went to another relative who lived there but not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">And of course, they, then we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: So there were some Jews left out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: There were some Jews left out.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: They, there, they were, I mean, yes, no, there were some Jews who did not live in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s186">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Who did not, part of us [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So the soldiers took you, took you back to the ghetto, practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Not to the ghetto, it was not, it was outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, no, it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s192">But the, it was still in the ghetto but it was not to the, he took us back to the ghetto but not in the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And we went to live, stayed there for a few, how is it in, about Parryom Poppovitch(ph) probably, who was the mayor of our city.</span> <span id="s197">He came to bring the news to the house of this relative of mine that some Jews are going to stay and we knew . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, I did not see him.</span> <span id="s200">He came, we heard about it, he came to the Jewish hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: And, and talked to people.</span> <span id="s203">And so we, we stayed in, in this house and after one day,

time, what we are, as far as we are concerned, we had to these curfews and we had, and we had to wear the, the star and we led a relatively normal life.</span> <span id="s255">But we had no, no income

about what important things and about life first of all.</span> <span id="s256">And of course family, family and friendship was very important.</span> <span id="s257">And the Jewish life went

your time and describe to us, at length, what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: The deportations of 1942, I witnessed direct, direct __________ or more than that from the window in, where I stayed at that time.</span> <span id="s269">Where we lived at that time.</span> <span id="s270">It was a house in a corner and, and this particular corner they assembled, the Romanian police assembled Jews, Jewish people whom they collected from several houses.</span> <span id="s271">One night, they, the rang bell at our, the bell rang, the bell rang at our house, at our apartment, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s272">It was two o’clock and my husband went to the door and asked, “Who is there?”</span> <span id="s273">And they said, and they said, “We are looking for Kahanni(ph),” which was a neighbor and which was hidden so she, they did not get her.</span> <span id="s274">But you can imagine our state of mind until we heard that they’re looking for Kahanni(ph) and not for us.</span> <span id="s275">So, but we, that was it.</span> <span id="s276">Another time, we looked, we heard some commotion at the window and we looked down.</span> <span id="s277">We were always watching from this window and watching what is going on at that corner.</span> <span id="s278">And there was several families but my eyes was on one of them because these were some people we knew.</span> <span id="s279">And there was a very Orthodox Jew with his long gray beard and this is family and, in a very dignified way, he conversed and communicated with his family and he probably wanted still something from the house and talk to them.</span> <span id="s280">And, and I think these people let him still go back to the, it was very close to where he lived, that is how we knew them.</span> <span id="s281">And I just witnessed the, how to say, __________ your faith as such without complaining or without whining unlike a neighbor of ours who lived upstairs and who was a very, let us say, simple and simplistic.</span> <span id="s282">And this man, we heard him walking back and forth and crying, crying, shouting, in Yiddish, “__________, what do they do to us and what, what will happen to us?”</span> <span id="s283">And he called, he did not stop, all night long we heard him like that and this is a quite a contrasting one, still to tell you that reminded me of something but I forgot right now.</span> <span id="s284">Yes.</span> <span id="s285">I know what it reminded me of.</span> <span id="s286">It is nothing to do with the Romanians and nothing, but it is to do

broke out, night and I was in the factory with my colleagues and there was one of maybe one of my bosses and he came next to me and held my hand and said, “ Shtoybooyitznomee(ph) what is, what, what, because it is, what is going to happen to us?”</span> <span id="s292">And I could not understand.</span> <span id="s293">He was a young man with a big family in Russia, and this uncertainty, he addressed me, but it was just the outcried, outcry, the moment of crisis which remains the same.</span> <span id="s294">It, it was just a human outcry.</span> <span id="s295">So, this is what happened with this too, that is how I watched.</span> <span id="s296">And it was watching and at the same time, watching out for yourself and always being prepared.</span> <span id="s297">And we had this __________, I remember this knapsack.</span> <span id="s298">It was in the corner in the room, it stayed with us, it slept with us, with the [talkover] . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: For the

where and she went to this house and, and there were some SS and the result, she, she came to ask for her husband and they made her come in and she came with them.</span> <span id="s371">And we were locked up in the house.</span> <span id="s372">My family and my mother and father and the war(ph) and the neighbors and some, the neighbor from across the street signaled to me that my sister was taken away.</span> <span id="s373">I did not know that.</span> <span id="s374">So Carl and I went to save, to, to rescue her.</span> <span id="s375">And then she came out with two SS and, and they were, it, they saw that she was very sick and they took her home and sort of well, human in a way, behaving humanly to her.</span> <span id="s376">But what happened to, at the same time, they, some

weeks but and, you made that.</span> <span id="s388">And you wanted to know about how we left?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Yah, I wanted, I wanted to know more exactly.</span></p> <p><span

working in the embassy of the German Democratic Republic.</span> <span id="s393">Resigned, because I knew that that doesn’t go together, this was something, romantic.</span> <span id="s394">I resigned and, and applied.</span> <span id="s395">We stood in line at the police and applied for departure.</span> <span id="s396">We did not apply, okay, people mostly they applied to go to Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s397">But very few, some got it, some didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s398">And I remember that you got a certain, a certain notice that you can leave and the woman who delivered the mail, the mail __________, she said, she came and gave that envelope to me and said, “I don’t know, you never, I didn’t know you were Jewish because you never asked me whether I had the good, good news for you, you know.”</span> <span id="s399">So then we, we left and that was a very emotional moment because I, we have, we just did not know what is going to happen to us.</span></p>
