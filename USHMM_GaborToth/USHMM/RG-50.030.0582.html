id="s17">My mother’s name was Malka(ph) Pollak.</span> <span id="s18">My oldest sister was Bluma(ph) Pollak, my older brother was David Pollak.</span> <span id="s19">And another older brother was Misha(ph) Pollak, and then was my name, Ernie Pollak.</span> <span id="s20">And my younger brother was Shlerma(ph) Pollak, and my younger sister was Menicha(ph) Pollak, and my younger brother, another younger brother was Ishmael(ph) Pollak.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: We’re eight children.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And you were number five of the eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Number five, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Of the eight.</span> <span id="s26">Can you tell me something –</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was number four, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Number four, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s29">What your life was like before the war?</span> <span id="s30">Can you describe your religious affiliation, was it a religious home, what your language you spoke at home, your father’s occupation?</span> <span id="s31">What can you tell me about your life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: We spoke mainly Yiddish in the house.</span> <span id="s33">My father had the butcher store, kosher butcher store in the town.</span> <span id="s34">And as far as religion, we were quite religious.</span> <span id="s35">We went to shul almost every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was it a Chassidish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, well this – that time I would not know what – you know.</span> <span id="s38">But I know we – somebody used to always call [speaks foreign language here] you know, with the five boys.</span> <span id="s39">So this is the way the saying used to be.</span> <span id="s40">So this is how I know, and I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And what type of schooling did you go to?</span> <span id="s42">Were you at a cheder, yeshiva, or a secular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: We went – we went – I was too young to go to yeshiva.</span> <span id="s44">My older brother went and we [indecipherable] town from – from – from us about six kilometers, which we had a [indecipherable] yeshiva there.</span> <span id="s45">My older brother, I remember, went to that yeshiva because he was older – older.</span> <span id="s46">David.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And were you in cheder, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: After we finished school around two – two o’clock or three o’clock, I don’t remember, we went straight to the cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And tell me something about the composition of the town.</span> <span id="s50">Was it a mostly Jewish town?</span> <span id="s51">Were there much in the way of relationships between the Jews and the non-Jews in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, it was not – it was not – I don’t – I – this I cou-couldn’t tell really, because I remember when it used to be Christmastime.</span> <span id="s53">We had to close the windows and close the doors, and lock the windows for the protection, otherwise all – all the windows would have been broken from the house.</span> <span id="s54">Cause this is the way it di – because th-they demonstrated during the day Christmastime.</span> <span id="s55">Not the Jews, but the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s56">And that’s what brought up the hatred, a little bit.</span> <span id="s57">But then during the rest of the year, my father had the butcher store, here was kosher and here was non-kosher, different part.</span> <span id="s58">So they used to come and buy meats from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And at school, did the Jewish children and the non-Jewish children socialize together at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: This is a hard question to answer, because when children get together, you know, they love each other, or they not – they hate each other, not e – but there was nothing really involved that we hate each other or something, just fun.</span> <span id="s61">But later on, you know, when I was already 12 years, 13, I remember certain things, yeah, in school.</span> <span id="s62">But by that time the Hungarians already occupied us, in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And in terms of secular languages, did the Jewish community speak Hungarian or Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My father spoke Hungarian, because he was in the first World War, and that was during the Hungarian time.</span> <span id="s65">And most of them spoke Romanian and – but that – somebody else spoke Hungarian, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s66">You know, it’s tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: And extended family, did you have an extended family living in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I – y-yes, in the same town, next door was – lived my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s69">And the town next, two kilometers away, lived his brother.</span> <span id="s70">So it was always together, you could walk – Saturday you could walk the three kilometers and meet, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And holidays you spent together?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Holidays, sometimes but not really, because everybody had a big family, and you didn’t have homes that big, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: So [indecipherable] Oh, let me record again.</span> <span id="s74">So what about your grandparents, were they in the area, in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My mother’s father lived about half a kilometer away from us, on this side of the town, and we lived almost on this side of the town.</span> <span id="s76">But the cheder was across the street from him, the cheder where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: And he was a very religious person, you know.</span> <span id="s79">So the kids who came into the syn – to the synagogue Saturday morning, they were afraid for for Selig(ph).</span> <span id="s80">His name was Selig(ph) Lassa(ph).</span> <span id="s81">Because he just took a look, and everybody was trembling.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What was his occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: This I wouldn’t know, you know, what his occupation, because I think he lived to be 80 or 85 or something, you know, because he was quite old when we – we knew him, because my mother was the youngest get – to get married, and she was born in 1994.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: So let’s fast track a little bit, and I want to ask you about 1939, with the start of World War II, did news reach Romania about the invasion of Poland?</span> <span id="s85">Did you have any knowledge of what was going on in Germany and Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No, beca – not completely, you know.</span> <span id="s89">The only knowledge we could know, if somebody came from that area, from somewhere in [indecipherable], because there was no telephones in the town.</span> <span id="s90">There was no electricity in town, and once in a while you just got the newspaper from somewhere else, you know.</span> <span id="s91">So it’s – and nobody really knew until later, whatever happened in Poland, or whatever happened somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: But you remember people coming from other towns, making it into Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, I – I remember that, but as a young boy, you’re not that much interest what he has to say, you know, because you wouldn’t understand it much.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: You know, really.</span> <span id="s96">I’m telling the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So 1940 your life changed.</span> <span id="s98">What – tell me about the year 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: In 1940, when Hitler told Horthy, whatever his name was, from Hungary, you can re-occupy this area, Maramures, you can re-occupy that you had it the first – before the first World War.</span> <span id="s100">So the soldiers came and traveled days and nights.</span> <span id="s101">You know, they – they could not have that many soldiers that they should go around and we should see them for two weeks.</span> <span id="s102">But we saw the same guys coming the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And how did that change your daily life?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: It – not at the moment, the first year it didn’t really change, you know?</span> <span id="s105">The only thing is, we had to learn a different language and we went to [indecipherable] school, and we didn’t understand anything what we – because it was Hungarian already, Hungary.</span> <span id="s106">So you didn’t understand anything, because we went to Romanian school as children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Was it the same teachers, or did they bring in all new teachers who were Hungarian born?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I’m sure they ki – brought in the teachers, because the teachers that we knew – and I really didn’t know whether they speak hungar – I know my father spoke Hungarian for one reason, because the soldiers must have had on their agenda certain things that Yorel(ph) Pollak was – was a g-gender(ph) urmeshda(ph) they call it that time, like a – not a general – not a – in the army, like a – how do you call it?</span> <span id="s109">A little officer, you know, in the army, in the first World War.</span> <span id="s110">So the soldiers who passed through my town, some of them stopped in our house, and they wanted to have some wine to drink and this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s111">So I knew, but we were not allowed to go into the room when they talked to my father, as children.</span> <span id="s112">Nobody was allowed to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: And your father never told the children –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: He wouldn’t – he wouldn’t – he wouldn’t hurt us, you mean, he wouldn’t say that that’s what they said, and things like th – but later on, we felt something is not right.</span> <span id="s115">But at 1942 already, I had somebody come, a friend came from – who went to Budapest a half a year before.</span> <span id="s116">[indecipherable] And he says, Ernie, you’re already 13 - 14 years old, 15 years old, 15 and a half years old.</span> <span id="s117">Come to me with – to Budapest and you’ll learn a trade.</span> <span id="s118">What are you gonna do in this small town?</span> <span id="s119">I was very good with my hands and making, you know, certain things, you know, in jewelry or anything.</span> <span id="s120">So he says, come, you’re gonna become a jeweler.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And did you take him up on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: And I went right after Pesach, when he went back.</span> <span id="s123">I went back to Budapest and I couldn’t get anything on the jewelry, I couldn’t get – so he says, let’s go to a dental laboratory, maybe you’re gonna be – they’re going to teach you to be a dental technician, cause he was there in that place also.</span> <span id="s124">But he quit after a while, you know, so I went in there and I stood there til the Germans came in, for a year and a half, almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So w-were – from 1942 to 1944, you’re living in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Lived in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And did you have any contact with your family, did you know what was going on in Mamorsha(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, because we used to write, we used to write almost every week, you know, in Yiddish we used to write the postcard.</span> <span id="s129">But my older brother was with me that time, because he also wanted to come to Budapest, away from the small town, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And was the motivation for coming to Budapest because they thought it was easier to earn a living, or because –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: – they were politically safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, easier to earn a living, because politically I did not – I don’t know whether anybody as young boys and girls thought about politically at that time, but they saw that you could sense certain thing.</span> <span id="s134">You sensed it, but you didn’t make anything of it, as long as you were okay.</span> <span id="s135">But to make a living had gotten harder in the town, so I figured I got to learn a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And from the postcards that your family sent to you, did you have a sense that their life changed over those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes, the last year especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: And how did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Changed – they were not allowed – let’s say, soon as the ger – soon as the Hungarians came in, and my father was a butcher in the – in the Jew – in a – in a strictly Orthodox sense, you know?</span> <span id="s140">And a – and you have to slaughter a cow or a calf or a sheep in a certain way to be kosher.</span> <span id="s141">You have to slaughter.</span> <span id="s142">You have to get a shochet, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: So we used to have our own place, you know, we were three butchers [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s145">And we had the same place, we just – to take the cows, or the calf, or the – the – to slaughter.</span> <span id="s146">But as soon as the Hungarians came in, they forbid you.</span> <span id="s147">You’re not allowed to get a shochet to slaughter.</span> <span id="s148">How do you have to slaughter the cow?</span> <span id="s149">You got to hit it right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And so wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Which is – that’s ridiculous because when you’re slaughtering, the reason why you slaughter the cow, because you’re – you’re taking all the veins, which are here, and the blood comes out from the animal.</span> <span id="s152">So this is what you call it the kosher.</span> <span id="s153">Nothing could happen to the – to the – to the meat, or to whatever.</span> <span id="s154">So that [indecipherable] so, right away, even while I was still home.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So did your father then begin to continue on as a butcher but for non-kosher meat, or did he stop working?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, he st – no, no, we still had the meat, kosher meat, cause instead of going in during the day to slaughter, you went in two o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And to provide for –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: And we were hiding it.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: And did he continue to sell it to the other –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah, we took my older brother – took my older brother Moishe(ph), and me and my father, and we went down and we took the shochet and they slaughtered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: And did other Jews in town continue to buy it –</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: – surreptitiously as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, yes, they knew it, because the shochet lived in town, you know, so they knew it.</span> <span id="s165">But it gotten always a little bit worse, because when I – when Hitler came into Budapest in May, I think it was in – not in May –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: March.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: March.</span> <span id="s168">March 17.</span> <span id="s169">Came into Budapest.</span> <span id="s170">I already had letters from my hometown, from my father, that in April, and before April, they already gathered them, you know, in the synagogue, and they already started the transports to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: So I wanted to come and talk about your experience in Budapest, but let’s just still talk with your parents.</span> <span id="s172">So when did you find out that your parents had been deported, and how much of your family – the Germans came in in March, and then you said already the next month they were gathered up?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Th-Th-They came in – they came into Budapest in March, but to my hometown they came in earlier.</span> <span id="s174">This why I said, because I got a notice from my parents in April yet, that we were gathered already to be shipped out somewhere, but I didn’t know any place where, I didn’t know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Where – where my brother – only my brother who was with me in Budapest, that’s it.</span> <span id="s177">I didn’t know nothing what happened with them the first two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So who was still in Romania?</span> <span id="s179">Was your parents and the other six siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, because they were – the four of them that were younger, and my sister, and they were – yeah, my sister [indecipherable] so my sister was older, but were still home, you know.</span> <span id="s181">Only my second, the one who was after my sister, David and I [indecipherable] the fourth, were in Budapest, the rest, six, were already a-all home, didn’t go no place.</span> <span id="s182">As a matter of fact, I found out after the war that my older brother Moishe(ph) was going to run over to Poland and hide some – somewhere there.</span> <span id="s183">But this is what somebody told me who I met after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: So, now let’s move to Budapest, and we’ll move back in time.</span> <span id="s185">So, in ’42, you come with your brother, and you become a dental technician.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yeah, I worked in a laboratory.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Now, tell me about the life in Budapest for you, away from your family, for those two years before the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: It was not bad, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s189">Really not – before the – before the Germans came in, it was not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: I was living in Dabutsa(ph), it was not far from the real – the synagogue, you know, I was living by mys – by a – by a – an older couple who rented me a room.</span> <span id="s192">Not my own apartment, or my own [indecipherable] gave me a room –</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And you’re still religious at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">And as a matter of fact, the Dahani(ph) synagogue was not far away, and I used to go every Friday night to listen to the cantor.</span> <span id="s196">You know, it’s used – things from home, so I – so I was going every Friday night to listen to the cantor because I wanted to, and my older brother did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And was your older brother living in the same house, or he was living elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, no, because they didn’t have big rooms enough to have two people living there, so he lived in another apartment with somebody else, another older couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: But you saw each other frequently beside?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes, we saw each other frequently, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And so now, March 1944, Germany occupies Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How did your – tell me your memories of the day when you found out that Hungary was no longer independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, we looked out of the windows and we saw the marching.</span> <span id="s205">And each one came to sou – there’s gonna be trouble, it’s gonna be trouble.</span> <span id="s206">Because a few days later, they already send out notices to the Jewish people like no – now, if I had to put down a stick here, and start a [indecipherable] and if somebody killed me during the day, he knew nothing is going to happen to him, because the Germans is not going to prosecute him, or the Hungarians, because he killed a Jew.</span> <span id="s207">So you were afraid to go out on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And you noticed a difference in terms of how the Hungarians treated you, apart from the Germans.</span> <span id="s209">The Hungar –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: The Hungarians were almost the same way, you know.</span> <span id="s211">Almost – almost like the Germans.</span> <span id="s212">Now, but that time, I don’t know how much control the Germans had yet, but the Hungarian army had a lot of control.</span> <span id="s213">I guess Hitler gave them the – gave them that they can do that.</span> <span id="s214">They called munka [indecipherable] zwangsarbeit, you know, forced labor for the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And when were you called up for forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: For forced labor I co – was called – even though you’re supposed to be only 18 y – you’re supposed to be 18 years old, but I was called up.</span> <span id="s217">And you had to wear a card with the s – with the re – with the – with the yellow band here, and gather here and then they took you to forced labor.</span> <span id="s218">Because by that time, the Americans – the Americans did a lot of damage to Budapest.</span> <span id="s219">They bombed a lot of things, important things in Budapest.</span> <span id="s220">And they marched us to clean up whatever they had there.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And was your brother also conscripted?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, my brother ran – somewhere was hiding.</span> <span id="s223">He found a – he found a family that he could hide, you know.</span> <span id="s224">And he had a girlfriend, you know.</span> <span id="s225">And to me, I think he disappeared during this time already.</span> <span id="s226">I didn’t see him and I didn’t know where he is, because see, either he didn’t want to come out, he should be recognized.</span> <span id="s227">So I had to do things on my own, even though I wasn’t 18 years old yet.</span> <span id="s228">But they took me to these kind of works.</span> <span id="s229">And then, month later, this was – let’s see, this was May, June, July, around July already – I mean, rumors went down that they’re going to ship us away to ric – to a camp, right.</span> <span id="s230">So, because we lived already in a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: It’s called a close out there, close ou – I mean, the streets, just like let’s say you – you – your Connecticut circle or something like this.</span> <span id="s233">So this is the streets that they have.</span> <span id="s234">And that was a ghetto there.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And so you were in the ghetto and then each day they marched you forced la –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: In the ghetto, each day, they knew because they came into the hall in the bottom, you know, in those – because the ghetto is, you know you’re there, they have the big apartments here, and here is like a garage you can come in the middle, you know.</span> <span id="s237">And all you had to see, all the Jewish people should come down, you know, and they knew who we are.</span> <span id="s238">So they forced us to the labor camp, because most of them were Jewish, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And so when you were in for forced labor, were you living in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s240">Were you already moved to a labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: In the – in the – in the – in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s242">In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s243">Because I remember the Holocaust Museum’s name, what is the street where you –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Raoul Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Raoul Wallen – I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: So wha –</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: He was still there when we – he gathered us – you know, a lot of Jews who were below 18, you had to be still, you know, gathered us, because I would have been 18 in 2,000 – in na – in – in September, but that was, I think, a little before September, because I think they were – he came from – from Sweden bu – Sweden bu – but we didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s248">So he told – spoke to hundreds or maybe thousands of Jewish boys and girls, you know.</span> <span id="s249">What was the talk?</span> <span id="s250">Hitler wants the Americans should – I should [indecipherable] to the Americans.</span> <span id="s251">They want 10,000 trucks and he’s gonna let 10,000 boys and girls go to America.</span> <span id="s252">Jewish.</span> <span id="s253">But the Americans refused the trucks, so the Germans came right away to cross [indecipherable] Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So let me ask – move back a little bit and ask you two questions.</span> <span id="s255">One is if you can describe a little bit more about the type of work you were doing in the labor battalion, and the other is, when you talk about having seen Raoul Wallenberg, do you know any people who made it to the glass house, and were saved through him?</span> <span id="s256">If you can address those two areas?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No, no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s258">Really I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s259">But you know, you didn’t – you didn’t go there every day, because you weren’t in the ghetto, you know, in the place that’s a – maybe it was in the shul, in the synagogue that he gathered us, or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s260">But you know when you’re this age and you – one day you come and one day you don’t come.</span> <span id="s261">It’s – it’s not something that – that – that – that – that – that you believe something is going to happen, you know.</span> <span id="s262">You hope, but – and then they just disappeared, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: And did you have enough to eat in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: In the ghetto nobody had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s265">That – they gave us, let’s say, a bread, for three days, a pound of bread, or four days.</span> <span id="s266">Now, you tried not to eat it, correct, in Mauthausen, you tried to eat every day a piece.</span> <span id="s267">But you had to sleep with it, you had to hide it, you had – otherwise somebody stole it from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So after a month, say you left – you were taken from the ghetto and –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: We were – we were – we were walked, we were not thre – we – we – they didn’t – see, let’s say this is Budapest, Hungary, and this is the border to go to Austria.</span> <span id="s270">And Mauthausen could be here, maybe 500 kilometers, or I don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s271">So we walked from here, over here and here.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Th-They made us sleep in certain places, I’d say –</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: How long was the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It took maybe a month, or maybe six weeks, or maybe two months, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And do you know about how much – long you were marching each day?</span> <span id="s277">Was it 10 kilometers, 20 kilometers?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: This – well, you marched, because – this I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s279">No, you just obeyed orders, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s281">And but all day long, you got up in the morning, walked –</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Right, right, but – but the – the funny thing is this, because I been saying those things too.</span> <span id="s283">Once we crossed the border, is we didn’t – we didn’t sleep outside because it – the winter started to come, you know, in – in – in September, October, there’s cold already.</span> <span id="s284">So – so, in certain places where they knew the – let’s say they took us into a place like this, which in – can take in, if you want to sleep 30 - 40 people, so they put in a hundred people.</span> <span id="s285">So you couldn’t sleep, you couldn’t lay down.</span> <span id="s286">You could only stay.</span> <span id="s287">Now, if somebody died – I se – I been saying this all the time, if somebody died, you didn’t report it to them, you just took them as – as a pillow, and you slept on them, you know.</span> <span id="s288">So that was a difficult situation, walking and stopping, and walking until we reached Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Who was guarding you while you were walking?</span> <span id="s290">Were these Hungarians, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No, once we crossed – we went, we crossed the – from ha – from Hungary, that was the Austrian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And in Hungary it was Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Hungary was Hungarians, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: And when you were walking, what were you wearing?</span> <span id="s295">Were these the clothes you had with you from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Well, I had – no, see, it was too late for that time when we came to the ghetto, or the changes, the clothes like you see in the movies that you had those stripes and [indecipherable] no.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So it was civilian clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: We did have – we still have the – had the – only the clothes that we came with, you know.</span> <span id="s299">Nothing else but a pair of pants and a jacket an-and a shirt or whatever, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s300">Cause you couldn’t – we were not allowed to take anything with you while you were walking, cause you didn’t have nowhere to put it, no place, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: And then when did they – did they feed you once a day, or week, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: In the ghetto they fed us once a day, lunchtime.</span> <span id="s303">So in other words, they gave you a bread for three, four days.</span> <span id="s304">You had to be your own master on it, to eat it one time, or you can not eat nothing for the next three days, or just cut it, or – or tear off a piece and eat today and tear off a piece and eat tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And while you were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: While we were marching, you know, it’s – it’s – it’s gonna be stopped, because they have nothing to feed us when we were walk.</span> <span id="s307">They brought us a soup sometimes, you know, later on, because let’s say we stopped five o’clock, two hours later they brought in the [indecipherable] you know, for everybody something.</span> <span id="s308">But food, forget it, it’s not really –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: This why people died, mainly cause you didn’t have any food at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So of your group – you started with about a hundred?</span> <span id="s312">About how many people died en route, was the mortality rate –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I wish I knew, but because y-you know, y-you’re talking – first of all, you’re talking to a very young person, you know, who did not experience anything of the sort.</span> <span id="s314">And it didn’t think that it should go into my mind to watch –</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I only think I watched because they told you when you walked, let’s say here, five people walked in the street, and they announced it in German, if somebody’s going to step out, is gonna be shot.</span> <span id="s317">So everybody was – was very, very alert, just to walk exactly behind anybody, not to step out this way from the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Now, when you were walking, did civilians, Hungarians or Austrians ever stop and sort of look at you?</span> <span id="s319">Did you ever see people –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: They stopped, but they didn’t say a word, you know.</span> <span id="s321">They laughed, they didn’t s – didn’t say a word, I mean, it’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Did they come out thinking that it was something interesting to see, or was it just –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh, they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s324">This is the way it looked to us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So were you walking through towns, or in the countryside?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Most of it the countryside, you know.</span> <span id="s327">Sometimes you had to walk through a town, because in order to find somewhere to put us up, so the towns had – either they had the churches, or they had other things.</span> <span id="s328">[indecipherable] you could – you could – stalls, you know, from – for the cows.</span> <span id="s329">They took the cows out and they put us in there for the night, you know, things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And at any point did they they tell you where you were marching to?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: So eventually af – you arrive in Mauthausen, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Eventually we arrived in Mauthausen, but Mauthausen was so full that they didn’t have empty space for us where to put it – put us.</span> <span id="s334">So they built, you know, for the outside, those – th-those – how – th-they build now f – you know, when – when the –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: At barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Tents.</span> <span id="s339">Tents, you know, they built for – they built tents.</span> <span id="s340">I mean they built not small tents, they built tents that could take in a thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And tell me what your reaction was when you saw Mauthausen for the first time.</span> <span id="s342">You’ve been marching for a month and then you get to this place.</span> <span id="s343">What was the first thing that crossed your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Scary, very scary.</span> <span id="s345">You don’t know what’s hap – gonna happen.</span> <span id="s346">You did not know nothing.</span> <span id="s347">The only thing you heard, a lot of bombing at night, because I think the Americans already bombed these places.</span> <span id="s348">Because they bombed Budapest and the Americans [indecipherable] was still there.</span> <span id="s349">And they bombed, you know, so th-that’s the only thing we could hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And did you get to talk to any of the prisoners who had been there before?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: So you had no idea what it was, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No, because there was Jews and non-Jews prisoners and a lot of Russian prisoners in there also, o-on those – in the regular barracks, you know, it was very, very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And when you arrived, did they issue you camp uniforms, or you stayed –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No.</span> <span id="s356">This why I’m saying this, I found this picture in my pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: And did you have any work assignments once you got there, or you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Most of the time no, because you know, every – every barrack had – had a – a kapo, a leader, a Jewish leader, that’s it.</span> <span id="s359">The Germans said, you’re going to be the kapo, you’re going to be responsible for those thousand people.</span> <span id="s360">They cannot go out unless you take them out.</span> <span id="s361">We tell you to take mi – take out 10 or 20 or 30, and go there and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What was your impression of the kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I really don’t know, because m-maybe I – maybe when you’re younger than – they were older people there also with us.</span> <span id="s364">They probably would have known certain things or they would have, you know.</span> <span id="s365">But my a – my impression was to just keep quiet and don’t mix in, and don’t do just you are t – what you are told.</span> <span id="s366">That was my impression and this what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And so one day was pretty much the same as the other for your last time –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Right, the same.</span> <span id="s369">You see, as – as – as they came closer, the Germans – I mean, the Americans, you know, occupy this part of Austria and this part, they came [indecipherable] closer – I’m talking months later, they used to take us out to work on schützengraben.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Describe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Schützengraben.</span> <span id="s372">This is for the – for the army it was you go into those foxholes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: So you were digging them, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yep, we are digging, digging and digging, di-digging, and digging and digging and then brought back, you know, brought back you know, but – and then the Americans still came closer, right.</span> <span id="s375">So this was already January, February.</span> <span id="s376">In February, I think, in the beginning of February they marched us out from Mauthausen – or – or in January, I’m not sure – marched us out from Mauthausen, and they took us to a place, Gunskirchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And was life there any different than Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Worse.</span> <span id="s379">Because that was in ou – in the mountains, you know, and it was raining and muddy.</span> <span id="s380">You – you – you couldn’t even go and lay down to sleep, you can only stay, because the mud was still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: To your –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: In the barracks, with no floors.</span> <span id="s383">Til – til May the fourth, of the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Describe liberation day.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I talked so much about that liberation day.</span> <span id="s386">We get up in the morning from like I said, the kapo.</span> <span id="s387">Me – not me, because the older people who were in the camp.</span> <span id="s388">So the kapo going in and out, several kapos, knock on doors – on there.</span> <span id="s389">They didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s390">So I don’t know, at 10 o’clock or 11 o’clock [indecipherable] people looked out, they didn’t see any Germans in the uniforms, they didn’t see any be – if they saw a German he was running this way, you know.</span> <span id="s391">So they came in and told everybody, something is wrong, something is going on, you know.</span> <span id="s392">But by two o’clock, you know, the kapo came in, says the German left because the Americans are coming.</span> <span id="s393">But we have to wait til the Americans are going to come here, because yo-you don’t know where the Germans are now.</span> <span id="s394">They are not here.</span> <span id="s395">If you go out now, you might find a German who can do harm to you.</span> <span id="s396">So we were in there, but some people, older people, younger people – I was too weak and too young to s – to – to think, went out from the – from the – from the barracks, and they went to the – where they had the food that – you know – and started to open up the stores there, whatever they have sas – and they started to bring it into the camp, you know.</span> <span id="s397">The reason why I remember these things, I was too weak to go there, so I stood by the door – my wife, I used to tell her that story, and this was a funny thing, what happened.</span> <span id="s398">I see one fellow, maybe a little older, a year or two than I, which I never knew him, comes in with – with something in his hands like this, a jar like, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A2: Honey.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Honey.</span> <span id="s401">I didn’t know it’s honey.</span> <span id="s402">So I j – I was laying down there and I jump up and I grab it.</span> <span id="s403">And it made him full of honey on his face, and he was very angry at me.</span> <span id="s404">But I had some honey, and – and started eating.</span> <span id="s405">And then I didn’t see him again, we didn’t – no, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s406">But – I’ll tell this later on.</span> <span id="s407">So by f – I think it was around four o’clock, was no – who had watches, but we just looked at – was around four o’clock that the Americans came in.</span> <span id="s408">And they opened the door, so they says, you can go any place you want.</span> <span id="s409">So where do you go from d – you don’t know – nobody knew where.</span> <span id="s410">So they directed us to go into the town, it’s called Wels.</span> <span id="s411">Wels, it’s 30 kil – 30 kilometers or less than Linz – from Linz.</span> <span id="s412">So we all went into that town, I don’t know how many thousands of people, but a day later – we slept outside, because there is no place where to sleep.</span> <span id="s413">A day later and two days later and three days later, we were still walking around [indecipherable], but the Americans came with their Jeeps and grabbed us, put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels, because Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp, officers’ camp.</span> <span id="s414">And everything was empty, so they brought us there, you know.</span> <span id="s415">So we are there and they didn’t know how to feed us, so they gave us too much food.</span> <span id="s416">A few days later, I je – I remember on a Sunday morning, hundreds of people were laying outside hardly breathing because their stomachs swelled up, you know.</span> <span id="s417">And – an-and I found right there, some of my – some – two people from my hometown laying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Had you known they were in the camp before?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No, no I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s420">What happened to them, I don’t know, I think one of them died, but what happened to the other one, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s421">But then the Americans got somebody in and they – and they advised them what to cook and what to serve for those people, otherwise [indecipherable] are gonna die.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Were there any Austrians still in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: And what was their attitude to what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s426">They were – just nothing, I mean, they j – they just looked, I suppose.</span> <span id="s427">I mean, nobody had any conversation with them.</span> <span id="s428">Not me, and not – not my friends who were with me.</span> <span id="s429">Friends – those people who came with me.</span> <span id="s430">So we just looked and looked and looked, you know, so – but – until the Americans came and took us into the Jeep, said, let’s go – no, come.</span> <span id="s431">So, I remember else, I’m – I’m a week, two weeks, three weeks, I think after the fourth or the fifth week, I don’t remember exactly because nobody counted.</span> <span id="s432">I’m in the – in the – taking a shower, because it has community showers, like the people, you know, here for the women and here for the men.</span> <span id="s433">And I’m walking out dressed up to take a shave or whatever it is, and a girl comes over to me.</span> <span id="s434">And she looks at me.</span> <span id="s435">She says, I know your name.</span> <span id="s436">So I almost dropped dead.</span> <span id="s437">You know, she said, what do you mean you [indecipherable] in Yiddish [indecipherable] she says, your name is Ernie Pollak.</span> <span id="s438">So I figured right away somebody knew.</span> <span id="s439">Says, how do you know?</span> <span id="s440">She says, I was with your sister in the camp.</span> <span id="s441">Her name is Bluma(ph) Park.</span> <span id="s442">So I says, oh my God, tell me exactly where, you know, this was at – it was already four or five weeks, I don’t know exact.</span> <span id="s443">So she says to me, she is in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s444">Now, Bergen-Belsen, I don’t know how many hundreds of kilome – kilometers, because it was in Germany – it was from there.</span> <span id="s445">Now I would not – I did not expect that I’m gonna figure th – say to myself I’m going to go to Bergen-Belsen, how am I gonna go to Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s446">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s447">I don’t have good clothes even, I don’t have [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s448">So she says, when I came here, I came from Feldafing, an – another DP camp.</span> <span id="s449">She says, you come with me to Feldafing, you know.</span> <span id="s450">She came to see her brother, she found out that her brother was – was in Wels with me.</span> <span id="s451">And she’s, you come with me, and then from there you gonna go to Bergen-Belsen, which is not that far.</span> <span id="s452">So I went to Bergen-Belsen, it took us three months.</span> <span id="s453">We got to Bergen-Belsen Erev rontef – Erev Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s454">Can you imagine how – how long it took us to go there?</span> <span id="s455">I found some people from my hometown, you know, and I started asking questions.</span> <span id="s456">You know Gans(ph) [indecipherable] his brother, you know?</span> <span id="s457">And he says, your sister was never here.</span> <span id="s458">Whoever I asked, your sister was never here.</span> <span id="s459">Nobody knew what – what I’m asking, nobody knew her, nobody – so, I don’t know why she said to me that my sister is in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s460">But I was glad I was there amongst some other people that I know from my hometown.</span> <span id="s461">And then, a year later – and I’m just jumping certain things because there’s a lot of things from here til the year later, I just want to bring two things together about that fellow that I took the honey.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: He came with his sister from Romania back to Bergen-Belsen, because he also said something, because we are sitting, you know, in Bergen-Belsen with friends, having lunch or something.</span> <span id="s464">Ber-Bergen-Belsen was also a camp which it had a – A2: A DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: A DP camp, yeah, because you know where Anne Frank was?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: It’s jus – it’s – Anne Frank was in Belsen.</span> <span id="s468">And Bergen was a – was an SS camp, which it had 10 - 15,000 officers there, you know.</span> <span id="s469">And ben – berry – when vi – the liberation was, they took from Belsen th – where Anne Frank was, all boys and girls in here to the Bergen camp, because they had where to live there, but in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s470">So it became Bergen-Belsen, together.</span> <span id="s471">So I sitting at a table, and this guy was sitting with his sister, you know, I mean that’s much later, about half a year later, or – or – or – or 10 months later.</span> <span id="s472">And we are talking, what do we talk, with him and with him and with him, we telling the stories about camp, we telling the stories about camp, we telling what happened this.</span> <span id="s473">And I happened to tell that story.</span> <span id="s474">The guy sitting in front of me, he said, you son of a gun, it was you who did this to me.</span> <span id="s475">And [indecipherable] you know who.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: So I apologized, what can I do?</span> <span id="s478">But we were friends, all the way.</span> <span id="s479">We came to the United States aga – together, and he wasn’t – he wasn’t in a – used – I used to invite him to – to my Bar Mitzvahs to the kids, and th-that.</span> <span id="s480">So it worked out, you know, thank God, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Now, did you ever find your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, in order for me to find my sister and the rest of them, it’s – it’s a story, if you’re ready.</span> <span id="s483">Bergen-Belsen was a camp for thousands of boys and girls, thousands of them.</span> <span id="s484">And we – you know how it was, there was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s485">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s486">You go again to eat lunch, you go again to eat breakfast, you go again eat.</span> <span id="s487">Was nothing.</span> <span id="s488">It was separated by Bergen-Belsen and five different camps: camp one, camp two, camp three, camp four.</span> <span id="s489">And each one had about a thousand boys and girls or – or maybe more.</span> <span id="s490">You had to get a bicycle to travel somewhere, so after I was there six or seven months, the Haganah came down, the Israeli hag – soldiers, maybe a hundred of them, dressed in civilian clothes, cause Bergen-Belsen was under the – the eng – the – the – the – England’s occupation.</span> <span id="s491">No, not American, was England, you know.</span> <span id="s492">And they started to get 50 people here in this room, 50 people here in this room, 60 people here, or a hundred people here.</span> <span id="s493">And they used to talk to us, what you should do.</span> <span id="s494">And nobody knew whether anybody survived.</span> <span id="s495">So they used to say like this here; you, I’m gonna give you five postcards; you I’m gonna give five post – postcards.</span> <span id="s496">Write the name where the postcards should go, to your hometown; whether it’s Romania, Czechoslovakia, or – o-or it’s Hungary, or – or – o-or it’s in Poland, or it’s in any of these places.</span> <span id="s497">He says, I don’t care how long it’s gonna take to get there, just write the name to go there.</span> <span id="s498">And write not the name, just write to the city hall.</span> <span id="s499">This postcard should go to the city hall for Osovish(ph) let’s say, to my hometown.</span> <span id="s500">And in the other side write, my name is Ernie Pollak.</span> <span id="s501">The first Jew who comes into the town, give him my postcard.</span> <span id="s502">Don’t you think I wrote one day, I wrote next day.</span> <span id="s503">About three months later I get a postcard from my younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: He had survived Auschwitz, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, he was in Auschwitz, but he – they send him from Auschwitz to a camp, to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s506">And he says to me, your older brother is alive, and your older sister is alive, and they are in this and this town in Romania.</span> <span id="s507">I came to my homet – to our hometown, and there’s nothing here.</span> <span id="s508">Don’t come home.</span> <span id="s509">I’m gonna come to you.</span> <span id="s510">Of c-course I wrote the address where I am, this why the postcard came to me.</span> <span id="s511">Says don’t come home.</span> <span id="s512">It took a few months and then he got to me.</span> <span id="s513">So we were already –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So – so was 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: – two brothers – yes, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So, first time in four years you had seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And were you able to communicate with the older brother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Well, he told me that my older brother – as a matter of fact, years – a little while later, my older brother, like I said in the beginning, that he and his girlfriend – he had a girlfriend in Budapest – he found her after the war because they were liberated in December, I think, ’44.</span> <span id="s520">He found her, they got married and they got home, he went home, December [indecipherable] not in Budapest, it was – well maybe to her hometown.</span> <span id="s521">And she had a baby girl, and she got very sick, she fell off a table, something with her foot, she – and they had to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s522">Later on, I don’t know when this happened, maybe a year later, she had to go to Vienna when she was a year old, or three years old, in order to fix her leg.</span> <span id="s523">But while he was in Vienna, he stood there already for a while, you know.</span> <span id="s524">And then he came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s525">I don’t know – I don’t even remember why they came to Bergen-Belsen, but he came to the United States after this.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So, and, of the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A2: Never came [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A2: Never came to – never came to Bergen – I d – I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: No, I thought he didn’t come to Bergen-Belsen, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So, of the rest of your family – so that’s three brothers.</span> <span id="s532">Did any of the other five siblings survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s534">It’s – it’s – as a matter of fact, when I got to Bergen-Belsen, and I met him, yost – your – what’s his name?</span> <span id="s535">Gans(ph), Gans(ph), I met, from my hometown, and the first thing he told me, I was with your father, and with your brother Moishe(ph) in camp together, but a few days before the liberation, they moved us from one place to the next place, and we had to walk and walk.</span> <span id="s536">And your brother went out of – ran – went out of line, Moishe, and he ran to a store, and – and the SS ran after him.</span> <span id="s537">But your father ran after him also, to bring him back, so I heard two shots.</span> <span id="s538">So they must have shot both of them, cause only the SS came out, and your brother and father didn’t come out from that store.</span> <span id="s539">This is two days before the liberation.</span> <span id="s540">That’s all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: And the rest of your family you never heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Because they were too young anyway, because I know my mother got killed in Auschwitz with the rest of the three or four sibling, a little girl.</span> <span id="s543">Because one was born 1930 – ’30, one was born 1938 –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: – an-and one was born 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And Bluma(ph), who – she sat –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Bluma(ph) got married to our cousin [indecipherable] Klausenborg(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Befo – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Afterwards –</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: After –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Oh, so she did survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: After she was liberated, yeah, after.</span> <span id="s554">This what he said to me, my ran – he – he’s – my younger brother send me the message, says, Bluma(ph) is home, and David is home, you know.</span> <span id="s555">And he had – the husband she married had three brothers in Israel, so he wanted just to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s556">So they went to Israel – I think I was told, I’m not a hundred percent sure, I was told that she went with the – with the Exodus boat, I’m not a hundred percent sure, but the Exodus boat went in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: And they wouldn’t let them into Israel, so they – they – they went over – what is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A2: Cyp –</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Cyprus, they went into Cyprus for a year.</span> <span id="s561">Then when Israel became a state, they moved them into Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: So when were you able to communicate with her for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: When I was able to communicate with her the first time, that – I don’t – I don’t remember exactly when, I must have, because my – yeah, because after Israel became a state, I was able to communicate with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And let us go back to [indecipherable] so how long did you stay in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Bergen-Belsen I stood til 1949, September.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Then I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: And why did you decide to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, to me and my younger brother, there was something, you know – in 1934, one of my mother’s sisters – my mother had four sisters and two brothers in New York.</span> <span id="s570">One of my mo – my brother’s sisters came to my hometo – our hometown, because my mother gave birth to a boy and she wanted to name him – to name the boy after her husband who died in – in – in New York.</span> <span id="s571">But the husband – in – not new – yeah, but her husband had a brother in the small town – in the middle time, you know [indecipherable] brother.</span> <span id="s572">Now in the Jewish religion, if you want – if the brother is alive, in the Orthodox religion, and if you have a boy and you want to give his name [indecipherable] the person, hi-his wife has to get Halitzah, separation.</span> <span id="s573">So whi – she came from New York to my hometown – to our hometown, and he gathered the full synagogue and they made – the rabbi made Halitzah, in other words a separation from her husband, who was dead, and this little boy can be named on his name.</span> <span id="s574">So this how I knew her, and then you know, we se – my younger brother said look, we have very no – whoever remained alive, your sisters went to Israel.</span> <span id="s575">We have to wait to go to New York to see the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s576">And this is what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Let me just ask a couple concluding questions.</span> <span id="s578">You began the interview by talking about your life before and that it was a very religious home and you were going to the synagogue every day.</span> <span id="s579">Did your attitude towards religion change as a result of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: It’s – it’s – it’s – it’s a funny thing that you ask.</span> <span id="s581">We remained three brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s582">My brother married a cousin, and he was religious, but my – my – my sister married a cousin and he was religious, the one in Israel, and they observed everything religion – quite religion [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s583">My older brother became Orthodox also, because he was Orthodox always, and he didn’t leave.</span> <span id="s584">So a matter of fact, I have a kosher home and sometimes he realized and he used to come and eat in my house.</span> <span id="s585">And at one time he realized that it might not be as kosher for certain reasons, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s586">Then he says, I’m not going to eat in your house again.</span> <span id="s587">So I went to Brooklyn and I brought in food for him, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s588">But my younger brother, Shlerma(ph) – and I used to talk to him, you know, but I didn’t say anything; he became an atheist.</span> <span id="s589">So I says [indecipherable] sometimes, why.</span> <span id="s590">He says, if God could stay up there and watch two million boys and girls as young as I get killed, He didn’t do nothing, he says, why should I believe in Him?</span> <span id="s591">I am relig – I’ll go – I go to synagogue, I sometimes read the Torah sometimes here – here in new yor – in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A2: Leisure World.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Leisure World.</span> <span id="s594">And we observe, we have a kosher home, but I’m not as religious as I should have been, or – or as – and it – I f – I feel comfortable like this, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And before we ask – then we ask, is there anything else you think is important to know before we conclude?</span> <span id="s596">How your earlier experiences changed your life after the war, influenced the decisions you made after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Career-wise, family-wise, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: – I – my family is – became my first, you know.</span> <span id="s600">I met her not even a year I was in New York, right?</span> <span id="s601">And then we got married in 1952, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: And then we – and your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Lucy.</span> <span id="s604">And thank God, you know, we build a nice hou – home.</span> <span id="s605">I have two children, a daughter and a son, and I have five grandchildren, three boys, and they all have a kosher home, you know.</span> <span id="s606">And my granddaughter in – my – my daughter belongs to [indecipherable] and my older – my granddaughter, who’s already 17 years old, she reads the Torah day re – every – every month.</span> <span id="s607">And I just came back here, she read the Megillah, part of it.</span> <span id="s608">So I’m happy.</span> <span id="s609">And – and I – my – my son sent the three children til eighth grade in Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s610">And thank God –</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A2: Jewish day.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A2: Jewish day.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Jewish day school, yeah, to a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s615">And it works out okay, he’s married happily and my daughter’s married happily and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s617">Well thank you so much for talking to us.</span> <span id="s618">We’ve been talking to Mr. Ernie Pollak, doing an audio interview for the Holocaust Museum, March second, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A2: Your second
