and I am at the home of Mrs. Frances Zatz of North Woodmere, New York.</span> <span id="s4">I am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview Mrs. Zatz about her experiences during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s5">Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: In Warsaw, Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Warsaw, Poland, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: In 1932, May 4th.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was not, I had a younger sister, four years younger than myself.</span> <span id="s15">Her name is Eileen.</span> <span id="s16">She lives not too far from me here and we see each other very frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was your name when you were a Polish girl in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Frania.</span> <span id="s19">Everybody called me Frania and I’m being called by my friends that know me from Europe still Frania.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And your family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Prawer.</span> <span id="s22">That was pronounced Praver.</span> <span id="s23">Praver in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What kind of home did you live in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, our first home that I recollect, which was a very tiny apartment, on Nilefke (?)</span> <span id="s26">.</span> <span id="s27">We lived over there for awhile until my mother gave birth to my sister and I guess the apartment became too small and we moved to Moronovska 2 (?)</span> <span id="s28">, and we lived there even while the ghetto started to be built.</span> <span id="s29">The Wall, which happened to have been on the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What kind of apartment was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Very small rooms, but they were like two small bedrooms, a living room and another little room where my parents worked.</span> <span id="s32">They used to do ladies lingerie, like piecework.</span> <span id="s33">They used to bring it home every morning and work until late at night, and if they finished making the lingerie they would fold it up, put it in boxes and deliver them to a certain place where I suppose they paid them rather well.</span> <span id="s34">Because from what I can recall now, that couldn’t have been a very cheap apartment.</span> <span id="s35">It was a brand new building when we moved in, it was a corner building, we were on the fourth floor and everyone had a window, so I remember it being a lovely apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was your father in business for himself or was he producing for retail outlets?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: It was together with my mother.</span> <span id="s38">They worked together in the house.</span> <span id="s39">They had machines and I remember them working until late hours at night.</span> <span id="s40">You know putting out their certain quotas that they used to bring in.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: So they would make lingerie which would then be brought to stores, which would then be sold.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I don’t think that they brought it to the stores themselves, they brought it back to the people who gave them the pre-cut pieces.</span> <span id="s43">They just put them together, folded them up and put them in the boxes and delivered them back to the places.</span> <span id="s44">I suppose a factory or a warehouse and they, on the other hand, would sell it to the stores who sold it to clients.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How would you describe the religious life of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: We were not religious.</span> <span id="s47">I remember Polish and Yiddish being spoken in the house.</span> <span id="s48">I don’t even remember, too well, observing any of the holidays too well.</span> <span id="s49">I do not recollect any specifics except for some minute little things, I guess it must have been maybe like Chanukah I would receive some gifts and I was told it was a Jewish holiday, and I was told also there was a holiday, of course now I realize it was Passover, where we couldn’t eat bread.</span> <span id="s50">But, I didn’t remember it too well.</span> <span id="s51">I remember eating something else beside bread.</span> <span id="s52">So this is all I have a recollection of actual holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Both of your parents were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: So you would describe them as secular?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Jewish but secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Were both of your parents born in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No.</span> <span id="s61">My father was born in Warsaw, my mother was born in Kovrin (?)</span> <span id="s62">, in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What were their names, your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My mother was always called Toby.</span> <span id="s65">I guess in every language it’s still Toby.</span> <span id="s66">My father was called, my mother had a name for him Srulik (?)</span> <span id="s67">, she used to call him.</span> <span id="s68">His Jewish name was Israel.</span> <span id="s69">I remember this mostly as Srulik I remember my mother calling his names.</span> <span id="s70">That’s why this name was more outstanding than whatever else other people called him.</span> <span id="s71">And his sisters in Israel also when they talked about him it’s always Srulik.</span> <span id="s72">That’s how he was known.</span> <span id="s73">I guess it’s an abbreviation of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What kinds of schools did you attend in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I did not go to any school.</span> <span id="s76">I never had a chance to go to school because the war broke out, but my father gave me some education.</span> <span id="s77">We used to sit, he used to teach me how to read and write and I used to have to spend a certain amount of time everyday looking, if it was an old book, or if it was just a page from something, whatever was readable material he made sure that I know how to read and write.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: In Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: In Polish only.</span> <span id="s80">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So you could read and write Polish and you could understand Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Well, Yiddish I learned actually in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: You didn’t understand Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I did not know a word of Yiddish until I came to this country and my mother made me learn Yiddish because it was the only way she could correspond with me here.</span> <span id="s85">She did not allow me to speak Polish in this country.</span> <span id="s86">She did not know too well English, which I caught on within one year.</span> <span id="s87">I spoke English when I came here, and for her it was more difficult and she used to speak Yiddish most of the time to all her friends and I guess in no time I learned the language and she would talk to me in Yiddish and I would answer back in English or half Polish until after awhile I learned the language well.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you know your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: My mother’s father, he came once, I remember seeing him once.</span> <span id="s90">He was a tall man with a beard.</span> <span id="s91">It must have been a special occasion and I think I wasn’t more maybe than three or four years old.</span> <span id="s92">It must have been my mother’s sister’s wedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw him.</span> <span id="s93">My grandmother died after she gave birth to my mother’s youngest brother, and my father’s side, I don’t remember a grandfather at all, but I do remember a grandmother, my father’s mother living around the corner from us when we lived on Moronovska (?)</span> <span id="s94">.</span> <span id="s95">It was walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed.</span> <span id="s96">She lived there with my father’s oldest brother.</span> <span id="s97">His name was Shlamik (?)</span> <span id="s98">, and she was in the last bedroom and I remember my father said every week we have to go and see grandma.</span> <span id="s99">So that’s , I remember just seeing her being ill in bed.</span> <span id="s100">She probably must have had polio, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you have any hobbies or pets when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What did you want to be when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: You wanted to be alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Just to be alive.</span> <span id="s107">I was grateful.</span> <span id="s108">Nothing else and just to make sure there’s always enough food.</span> <span id="s109">Never to go hungry again.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Before the war was up, did you have any ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: I don’t remember too much from before the war.</span> <span id="s112">I was just a child playing.</span> <span id="s113">I had some toys.</span> <span id="s114">Since one of my mother’s sisters had a booth in a market, I guess it was like a flea market at that time.</span> <span id="s115">Like an indoor flea market and she had a booth.</span> <span id="s116">She would sell toys so she used to bring me certain things I would play with and she told me not to break them because they would be resold tomorrow.</span> <span id="s117">Naturally I could never keep anything, but I played with a lot of things and then she would carefully put them back in boxes and sold them.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No.</span> <span id="s120">I remember also as I’m talking to you, my biggest love, I remember, I was five or maybe six or even younger, my father taking me to the movies to see Shirley Temple.</span> <span id="s121">I fell in love with her and at that time I used to go to see every Shirley Temple movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So you liked to see movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I loved to see movies, especially with Shirley Temple.</span> <span id="s124">They were the only movies I ever saw was only when Shirley Temple appeared.</span> <span id="s125">Which, I guess, must have been once a year or whenever</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Were these dubbed?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes, they were dubbed.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Were there any other films that you liked?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I never saw any other films.</span> <span id="s130">Those were the only ones.</span> <span id="s131">I must have seen maybe two or three Shirley Temple movies and they used to sell outside, when you walked out of the movie theater, they used to sell little rings with her photograph that used sort of flash like she would smile on those little pictures on the ring.</span> <span id="s132">That was my biggest treasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the thirties when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No.</span> <span id="s135">No, ,none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s136">I didn’t know the meaning of it even.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Would you say you had a rather protected or rather sheltered life?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s139">Very sheltered.</span> <span id="s140">I was very secure.</span> <span id="s141">I was a very happy child and having a little sister, you know, made my life complete, I guess.</span> <span id="s142">Somebody to play with.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: You didn’t particularly dream of having a baby brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Would you say your parents were easy going or strict?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Very easy going.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: If it had been possible, you would have loved growing up in your house in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s149">It was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s150">I remember my relatives living very close by and we used to gather rather frequently.</span> <span id="s151">Visit each other.</span> <span id="s152">I don’t remember what days or what evenings, but we were always not so much with friends; I don’t remember my mother’s friends or my father’s friends, but I remember the relatives always.</span> <span id="s153">Cousins, aunts, uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Do you remember any grownups talking about politics during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span> <span id="s156">I remember that in 1939, they were talking about a war that looks like it was going to be a war.</span> <span id="s157">I remember everybody being worried.</span> <span id="s158">I remember the look on their faces, they were very worried that there was going to be a war.</span> <span id="s159">Then of course all of a sudden we were covered with bombs.</span> <span id="s160">They started bombing Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So you remember the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I remember the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s163">I remember us running downstairs in a shelter in the basement of the building and hiding until the sirens blew and then you could go upstairs again.</span> <span id="s164">And this happened quite a few times a day sometimes.</span> <span id="s165">It was very bad and we had very few close calls, but our building was never hit.</span> <span id="s166">Not in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Do you remember the battle for Warsaw in September 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: When you say a battle ---</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: A battle, the bombardment and the siege of Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I remember the wall being built and I remember people being squished into quarters.</span> <span id="s171">There were so many people in the streets at that time, they had to move from other areas to move to another area where we were all like closed in.</span> <span id="s172">It’s like if you have people scattered all over they took a certain section and they made you move there.</span> <span id="s173">You had to find a room where to stay.</span> <span id="s174">People usually stayed with relatives.</span> <span id="s175">This did not last very long because the starvation came in very soon after the water, gas and electricity was shut off, food was shut off.</span> <span id="s176">No newspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast.</span> <span id="s177">I remember every morning I looked out my window I saw dead people downstairs.</span> <span id="s178">They used to come around with wagons and pick them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Can we back track just a little bit.</span> <span id="s180">Do you remember when the Germans first marched into the city of Warsaw?</span> <span id="s181">When you first saw Germans in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I saw them, it seems like, after the bombing.</span> <span id="s183">They were like animals running on the motorcycles.</span> <span id="s184">I would see trucks.</span> <span id="s185">They made such noises that it frightened me tremendously.</span> <span id="s186">And everybody used to hide and run away, escape.</span> <span id="s187">They would hit people as would drive by or run over people.</span> <span id="s188">And I remember them as my instinct told me this very cruel people, they are.</span> <span id="s189">And it’s best to hide and not show your face.</span> <span id="s190">I understood that immediately.</span> <span id="s191">Even though I saw my parents talking quietly to each other, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to get the next bite of food, but I saw them worried and I realized what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: This was the year you were supposed to start school?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: You probably had made plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I made plans.</span> <span id="s196">I remember my mother buying me a beautiful outfit.</span> <span id="s197">I think the sailor suit I was wearing in the picture.</span> <span id="s198">This must have been the picture.</span> <span id="s199">The outfit I was going to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: What school would you have gone to?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: There was a public school I would say about ten blocks away from us.</span> <span id="s202">We used to walk there.</span> <span id="s203">There was a park not too far from us.</span> <span id="s204">I remember my father used to take me for walks.</span> <span id="s205">We went to the movies, we used to go for ice cream, go walking in the park and play and he passed by once pointing out to a building saying, see, someday you’ll go to this school right over here.</span> <span id="s206">So I remember it was not far because we walked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: So your father liked to take you for walks?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, my father would be the one to take me for walks and explain to me, and tell me stories and things, sort of educating me.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Would you know what kind of schooling your father had?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s211">My father finished Gymnasia and I remember all the children of his family, brothers and sisters were all educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: How many languages could he speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I don’t remember, but I did not understand certain languages that he spoke, but as you can see he wrote German on the photographs.</span> <span id="s214">I suppose he must have known more than two or three languages that I probably did not understand.</span> <span id="s215">I only spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s216">That was the only language I knew and everything else sounded like clatter to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Which it was.</span> <span id="s218">Do you recall any other changes that occur after the Germans take over Warsaw?</span> <span id="s219">You couldn’t go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Everything was cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What about your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: The business had ceased.</span> <span id="s223">Stopped right away.</span> <span id="s224">There was no need for it.</span> <span id="s225">It seemed like there was no money.</span> <span id="s226">There was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So what did your mother and father do during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Trying to survive.</span> <span id="s229">We were very busy hiding in the shelters, getting food together, trying to sell off things and to buy maybe flour, maybe an apple.</span> <span id="s230">Whatever was available.</span> <span id="s231">Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s232">There were factories, there were businesses and they would still be coming in.</span> <span id="s233">They would smuggle in things, a lot of Jews would buy things off them and give away a lot of precious things.</span> <span id="s234">They would give away art, they would give away jewelry.</span> <span id="s235">They would give away whatever was precious for the slightest piece of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Do you remember when the ghetto was first set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">I lived in the building and on the corner of that particular building the wall had started, so I was watching the bricks going up.</span> <span id="s239">Men were working over there, which I didn’t understand at first why they’re closing off.</span> <span id="s240">In other words our building was on the inside of the ghetto which was the last building by the wall.</span> <span id="s241">I remember that and I remember them putting, the wall was so high, it seemed so high to me, they were putting broken glass, I remember the smashing of bottles and glass putting on the top of the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Do you remember how long it took for them to build the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: It did not take long at all.</span> <span id="s244">It seemed it grew by a foot or two or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Do you remember who was doing the construction work?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I didn’t know who.</span> <span id="s247">I saw men working.</span> <span id="s248">I don’t know if they were Poles or Jews.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know, but I saw men working and the Germans watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Not soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: They were German soldiers watching, standing with guns and civilians were working, and I don’t know who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you remember when this wall was built?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: The date?</span> <span id="s254">I cannot give you a date.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: The time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I guess it was all the same time, the very beginning, during the bombing and that’s when the wall started.</span> <span id="s257">They must have decided right then and there.</span> <span id="s258">The bombs will stop, you know, start building the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So you continued to live in your old apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes, we stayed in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did anyone move into your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Do you remember any other changes following the building of this wall?</span> <span id="s264">For example, when you went out in public were there any changes in the way you went out?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, you did not go out in public.</span> <span id="s266">You were afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s267">You never knew when the Germans would come through the gate and attack and capture people.</span> <span id="s268">And a lot of people were captured.</span> <span id="s269">I remember seeing children dying and begging for food.</span> <span id="s270">I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself and four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write.</span> <span id="s271">So he used to take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take another little girl, I don’t know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take us to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went on for six months.</span> <span id="s272">I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six months maybe.</span> <span id="s273">And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the street.</span> <span id="s274">I was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my jacket off and they hit me and I came home bleeding and this was the end of my education, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Or the beginning of a new education?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s277">You don’t go out anymore.</span> <span id="s278">Because at that time even there were hours, there were times you knew when you were safe to go out in the street.</span> <span id="s279">And she was only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five minute walk.</span> <span id="s280">So that’s the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or I would walk back.</span> <span id="s281">And that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: This was inside the ghetto after the wall had been built?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, inside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you know who attacked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I don’t remember the face.</span> <span id="s286">I know I remember somebody hitting me and ripping off my jacket and I had something in my hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or something was grabbed.</span> <span id="s287">Maybe somebody who was starving, maybe he thought I had food.</span> <span id="s288">Maybe his child was cold and he needed a jacket or something so he took it off me.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: So he got it?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: So he got it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: He was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes, it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s293">You saw a lot of these things happening.</span> <span id="s294">You were afraid to carry something.</span> <span id="s295">If you had something to carry, you usually carried it inside your coat so nobody would detect it, or else you were attacked by other people if they suspect you have food on you, they’d do anything.</span> <span id="s296">I guess when your stomach is growling and you’re starving you know no honor, you know no shame, you know nothing, you just know one thing, you have to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: The few times that you did go out with your father, for that matter, did you wear any kind of armband or star or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No.</span> <span id="s299">I did not have to wear anything.</span> <span id="s300">After that incident I was never allowed anymore to go outside anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Do you remember whether your parents wore Jewish armbands?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes, when my father went out he put on the armband and the minute he entered the building, he would take it off.</span> <span id="s303">Just in case somebody spots him, he had to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I don’t remember my mother.</span> <span id="s306">I guess she must have worn it also.</span> <span id="s307">I don’t remember her putting it on or taking it off.</span> <span id="s308">Maybe she did it outside when she left the apartment.</span> <span id="s309">It was something you did not wear with pride, so like you didn’t want even your own children to see this so no questions would be asked.</span> <span id="s310">But I saw people wearing them.</span> <span id="s311">I didn’t ask because I think I knew what the answer was going to be so I didn’t ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s312">I was very silent.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I saw a photograph of your mother during these years.</span> <span id="s314">She looked like a very glamorous as well as a very lovely woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did she go out a lot in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well the only time it was when they closed the ghetto and as I said the factory still continued and she got a job there.</span> <span id="s318">A very prestigious job.</span> <span id="s319">But this took a while until she went out on the Polish side and she was in contact with the other Poles about papers.</span> <span id="s320">She got alien papers that she was not Polish, she was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s321">Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana Gregorief (?)</span> <span id="s322">.</span> <span id="s323">I will never forget that because she spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s324">She did not come from Warsaw so her Polish had a very bad accent.</span> <span id="s325">And, therefore, to make sure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s326">Then it’s OK to have an accent.</span> <span id="s327">So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these papers and as Ana Gregorief she got the job in the ghetto so she could go in and go out and she would bring in food.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So she worked in the ghetto, but she was living outside of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: She had to go in and she had to go out.</span> <span id="s330">She could go in and go out, she had a special passport.</span> <span id="s331">The factory was like going around the clock.</span> <span id="s332">This was not a nine to five job.</span> <span id="s333">They were in a rush to make these uniforms or whatever they were doing over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: So she was making uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes, the factory where they were making uniforms, maybe they were making other things.</span> <span id="s336">She never discussed what they were doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You don’t remember the name of the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No, but I remember her once, she came in, but this was a long time, much later, 1943 already when she brought in a suitcase into the apartment and there were uniforms on the top and when she picked up the uniforms I remember seeing guns.</span> <span id="s339">Long shotguns and boxes I guess must have been bullets.</span> <span id="s340">She was bringing it into the ghetto from the Polish side because they were talking about an uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So your mother smuggled guns into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, she smuggled in several times, and of course she carried the suitcase as if it weighed only twenty pounds and it could have weighed over a hundred pounds.</span> <span id="s343">That’s how she got all dressed up so people would never dare, or the Germans never dared to question her.</span> <span id="s344">She would just show them the flashed Ana Gregorian, her name, her special pass that she could go in and go out and that’s how she got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Does the name Tobins mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I don’t remember any names.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: I know there was a factory making uniforms it was known as the Tobins Factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I never saw the factory.</span> <span id="s349">The only time I ever saw was the time she brought the suitcase when she brought once.</span> <span id="s350">I said what are these uniforms and she said these belong to the factory.</span> <span id="s351">That’s all I remember her saying.</span> <span id="s352">I don’t know if this was the factory or another factory.</span> <span id="s353">I don’t even know where she worked.</span> <span id="s354">There was no conversation, there was nothing was talked about so my sister and I could hear.</span> <span id="s355">My father and mother when they talked nobody else could hear a word they were saying.</span> <span id="s356">She didn’t want us to know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: She slept though in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s359">She would go in, she would go out she would like to go back and forth.</span> <span id="s360">She had the permission to go back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: She would also bring food?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: She also brought food.</span> <span id="s363">So we had food and nobody bothered her.</span> <span id="s364">Because nobody after awhile knew who she was.</span> <span id="s365">As people were dying out and, of course the crowds in the very beginning were all gone already and there were very few people now in the streets and those that survived already at that point were hidden in their apartments or in basements trying to scrounge food, together mainly.</span> <span id="s366">The ghetto was getting smaller at that point, we had moved several times already.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So you were forced to move out of the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh, yes, we were forced out of the apartment and they said we have to move.</span> <span id="s369">My mother at that time would say, we’re going to move to a much nicer place.</span> <span id="s370">She still tried to protect us that we should not know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s371">We were like in the blind in a way because she never wanted to reveal to us what was going on at that time.</span> <span id="s372">But I remember moving and then again moving and then again moving.</span> <span id="s373">We were constantly on the go.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Were these nicer places?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s376">They were just temporary quarters.</span> <span id="s377">We would walk into a building and we would be the only ones in an entire building.</span> <span id="s378">We could take any apartment, so we would run to a building that was not bombed and there were empty apartments.</span> <span id="s379">Every floor we looked in all over, we looked for food.</span> <span id="s380">There was nothing there and we just slept anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: What kind of food would your mother bring you?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: She would bring maybe a potato, she would bring flour, some kind of a vegetable, a lot of fruit, a piece of bread, a piece of salami once she brought in.</span> <span id="s383">It was scrounged together, I guess, like leftovers they looked like more.</span> <span id="s384">It was not like you went to a store and you bought it.</span> <span id="s385">She would ask the workers maybe they had leftovers from lunch, whatever it was, those were the leftovers she would buy it from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Before the time of the ghetto, were you considered a picky eater?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I was a picky eater, yes I was a very picky eater.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: These are not the things she would have ordinarily given you?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: How about your father, did he get any jobs during this period?</span> <span id="s391">Was he working at any factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No.</span> <span id="s393">He was watching my sister and me while my mother was the one looking very Polish.</span> <span id="s394">Because as you can see on the photograph she did not resemble a Jew.</span> <span id="s395">That’s the reason why she got away.</span> <span id="s396">So she would get dressed up, she bought herself a coat, a hat to make sure she looked as elegant as possible.</span> <span id="s397">Because if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away.</span> <span id="s398">Like this if you walked with your head up high and very positive nobody bothered you.</span> <span id="s399">I guess your attitude was very important.</span> <span id="s400">That’s why she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Your father stayed home and watched the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well, he was watching us and he also kept an eye on his mother, his relatives, we were still in contact in the beginning, we’re still in contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: They also lived in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: In the original ghetto.</span> <span id="s405">When the ghetto got smaller, my grandmother must have died because I never heard about her again or maybe she was shot, I don’t know, and neither were her uncles.</span> <span id="s406">Like nobody had remained.</span> <span id="s407">It was just my father, my mother and the two of us.</span> <span id="s408">We were kept on the move.</span> <span id="s409">And then after awhile we found out that one of his brothers was nearby when my mother said would try to find her.</span> <span id="s410">She’ll go into the building and would try to find her.</span> <span id="s411">We found her, we found only my father’s sister-in-law, my aunt.</span> <span id="s412">She had given birth to a baby at that time.</span> <span id="s413">She was there with an infant.</span> <span id="s414">The infant was crying and we heard like an echo, the ghetto was so empty.</span> <span id="s415">We heard the echo and we heard German voices.</span> <span id="s416">We heard shotguns and we saw my aunt was thrown out of the window.</span> <span id="s417">She was on the sidewalk and the baby was ripped in half was also on the sidewalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: So you saw your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I did not see, my father saw and my mother saw.</span> <span id="s420">We were hidden, at that time we were hidden in a basement so I did not see anything what was going on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: So your aunt was thrown out of the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s423">This I remember my father and my mother, my father crying terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Your cousin was torn?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A; Yes, torn, it was a newborn infant.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: So all you heard was the echo and the crying ?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Crying and then a silence.</span> <span id="s428">And if somebody marched blocks away you could hear the footsteps.</span> <span id="s429">Especially German footsteps.</span> <span id="s430">You could hear German cars, trucks or motorcycles.</span> <span id="s431">It was a dead silence.</span> <span id="s432">Nobody even breathed so you are not discovered.</span> <span id="s433">At that time you are already hidden in ghetto and the building that we were there were quite a few people with us.</span> <span id="s434">I would say about twenty people were together and this is when the conversation started with the uprising.</span> <span id="s435">And then other people came and we were all like together in this one particular area and they started talking.</span> <span id="s436">You know, there were very few of us left, that something should be done and this is where my mother started bringing in the guns.</span> <span id="s437">Whatever should be done and this is when my mother began bringing in the guns.</span> <span id="s438">Whatever we need to do, she said, first we need to shoot our way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s441">I was very afraid.</span> <span id="s442">I didn’t know what the next hour was going to bring.</span> <span id="s443">If we will be discovered.</span> <span id="s444">My biggest fear was if someone will put a gun against my head and shoot, because I’ve seen so may to others and it looks so terrifying, this was my biggest fear.</span> <span id="s445">It was bigger than starvation even.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So you saw people who were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s448">I saw people shot, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: People you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: People I knew?</span> <span id="s451">Even if people I knew I probably would not have recognized them.</span> <span id="s452">People looked very different during the war.</span> <span id="s453">They became extremely skinny, they ages, they were very ragged looking, very dirty.</span> <span id="s454">There was no water.</span> <span id="s455">If there would be no rain, we would never have nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s456">So even if somebody was shot, I did not know who they were.</span> <span id="s457">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s458">I didn’t recognize anyone.</span> <span id="s459">I just saw their brains being shot out.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Right on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: On the street.</span> <span id="s462">Running.</span> <span id="s463">If you were running they would grab somebody and shoot them right in the head.</span> <span id="s464">If it was a child, or a woman, it made no difference, and leave them.</span> <span id="s465">And then there would be somebody to come with a little wagon picking up bodies.</span> <span id="s466">The bodies piling up and taking them someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: How long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: This went on until the plans were made for the Jewish uprising.</span> <span id="s469">Which was, I would say, 1943.</span> <span id="s470">Since 1939.</span> <span id="s471">At that point when my mother knew there was going to be an uprising, she made arrangements for my sister and myself to be taken out of the ghetto and taken by the Poles, one family was called Doblinkov (?)</span> <span id="s472">and whom I was held in their home.</span> <span id="s473">I was taken out, smuggled out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: By your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, not by my mother, the Poles with a truckload of merchandise went out and we were hidden on the truck and then we were supposed to be dropped off at a certain point, we jumped off the truck and they were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s476">Two people were waiting for us, one took my sister, one took me.</span> <span id="s477">I didn’t know the whereabouts of my sister and this was the last time I saw my parents.</span> <span id="s478">And we stayed with the Doblinkov (?)</span> <span id="s479">family which was about, quite a ride with the trolley.</span> <span id="s480">At that time, on the Polish side, the trolleys were going.</span> <span id="s481">So we were changing trolleys and going like to the outskirts of Warsaw and I saw a very little, private little cottage, a little house.</span> <span id="s482">This is where I was brought in by this man.</span> <span id="s483">He had a daughter about a year or two older than myself and a son about a year or two younger than me.</span> <span id="s484">And he introduced me to the family that I am going to live with them and I and their mother’s sister’s daughter who died so they are to take care of me and I come from another town.</span> <span id="s485">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s486">Lodz or Krakow, or whatever.</span> <span id="s487">They picked a city and said this is where I come from and this is going to be my name and this is where I’m going to stay.</span> <span id="s488">My name was Yasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Yasha?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, I became Yasha Doblinkov.</span> <span id="s491">And they said this is where I am to stay and this is going to be my family.</span> <span id="s492">And I had to adjust to that instantly.</span> <span id="s493">The first thing, I was very happy, they gave me food.</span> <span id="s494">They gave me, I remember, a giant bowl of potatoes, mashed potatoes and I think I finished it.</span> <span id="s495">It was I think maybe five pounds and I finished it all.</span> <span id="s496">And they gave me a glass of milk, which is something I had not seen in years, since before the war.</span> <span id="s497">That was good.</span> <span id="s498">So I think they got through to me through my stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: You had never seen these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I have never seen them, I have never known them.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Would you say you were quite skinny when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s503">I was very skinny and she said to me, I am going to fatten you up.</span> <span id="s504">Don’t worry you’re going to look very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Did she say anything else to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">Of course when the uprising started, which did not last very long.</span> <span id="s508">After that all of ghetto was burning.</span> <span id="s509">It was aflame.</span> <span id="s510">One giant flame and she took me outdoors and she said to me, you know, this is where you come from and this is where your parents are.</span> <span id="s511">And I remember remarking the sky was so red, like blood, it looked like and it was towards evening.</span> <span id="s512">And she said to me, you will never see your parents again.</span> <span id="s513">They perished in the fire.</span> <span id="s514">So you are going to stay with us.</span> <span id="s515">I am going to take you to church.</span> <span id="s516">You’re going to go through a Communion.</span> <span id="s517">You’ll become a Christian and you’ll become part of my family and we will treat you equally with my children.</span> <span id="s518">I started to cry.</span> <span id="s519">I wanted to see my mommy and I wanted to see my daddy and I didn’t want to live with them.</span> <span id="s520">I didn’t want to go to a church.</span> <span id="s521">But she said, if you are not going to obey we will have to take you back where you came from.</span> <span id="s522">So I just closed my mouth.</span> <span id="s523">I shut up and I didn’t say another word.</span> <span id="s524">I just did whatever they told me to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: And you ate the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: And I ate the food, yes, and they gave me a little bed in the corner to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Is this around the time you started to wear the cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: They put a cross on me, yes.</span> <span id="s529">They put the cross on me a very short time after that.</span> <span id="s530">They said to me you are going to church so you must wear a cross and I did not take that cross off until six months after the war.</span> <span id="s531">This was I felt like my, in a way I wasn’t hungry anymore since I wore the cross.</span> <span id="s532">So I felt that this maybe protected me from starvation.</span> <span id="s533">And they said if you wear the cross you will never be hungry and you will always have a roof over your head and we are going to be your family because you have nobody else</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: How long did you live with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Oh, for a few months, I would say, quite a few months.</span> <span id="s536">At that point already, I realized that my mother and my father are gone.</span> <span id="s537">I didn’t realize, of course, that my father was captured.</span> <span id="s538">Right during the uprising he was captured taking _____________, my mother, of course, head out.</span> <span id="s539">She was still in the ghetto for quite some time and the way she got out is a whole story by itself.</span> <span id="s540">It was very miraculous.</span> <span id="s541">At that time she did not look so elegant, she did not look so glamorous as she did just a couple of months before that.</span> <span id="s542">She was hungry, she was tired, she lost a husband in that time and she changed tremendously and the few people that did survive were in the sewers for quite some time and then when they got on the other side, that’s the reason why it took such a time, until she finally one evening just knocked on the door and came to the Doblinkov family and when I saw her, to me it was like a new world had opened up.</span> <span id="s543">I never believed I’d ever see her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: You never believed the Doblinkov’s _______.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: They were going to be my parents, I had to mentally adjust myself that this is it.</span> <span id="s546">I am most probably stay with them.</span> <span id="s547">I never thought that my mother was going to march in through the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Did you recognize her?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s552">Immediately I ran to her arms and I wouldn’t let go.</span> <span id="s553">I held onto her dress.</span> <span id="s554">She took me by the hand, she took a few things and said that some of the people gave them something when we walked out.</span> <span id="s555">We had a car waiting outside.</span> <span id="s556">I don’t know if it was some kind of taxi, or somebody doing my mother a favor or whatever.</span> <span id="s557">Whoever it was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s558">All I know I was so happy looking and staring at my mother’s face, I couldn’t believe that she was there and then we drove for about fifteen minutes to another building where I had to sit in the car and she brought my sister down all wrapped up in a blanket and it seemed like they were starving my sister because she looked terrible.</span> <span id="s559">She was all swollen with no clothes on, frozen and it was very cold and my mother wrapped her up in the blanket and came running down angrily what they had done to her child in those few months only.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: So you had not seen your sister since March of ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I saw her only one time when that family has written a letter to the Doblinkov family that they have the other sister and they probably want to know, maybe they can get rid of her and send her to me.</span> <span id="s562">So there was an address and I said to my _____, I used to call her my aunt, I said to my Aunt Doblinkov, I said can I please see my sister?</span> <span id="s563">I had five minutes.</span> <span id="s564">So, I remember going on a trolley and her daughter went with me and we went upstairs and I only had five minutes and I remember my sister laying over there in bed and Mrs. Doblinkov gave a piece of salami and a piece of bread to give it to my sister.</span> <span id="s565">So when I came in I gave this to her and she was very cold and the woman was standing there and watching.</span> <span id="s566">I gave her the food and she hid it under the blanket and I stood there helpless not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s567">I saw that she was dying, that she was starving and there was nothing I could do about it.</span> <span id="s568">And the woman said, OK., your time is up you got to leave.</span> <span id="s569">I said I just want to sit with my sister a little more.</span> <span id="s570">No, she said, you have to go.</span> <span id="s571">Lady, I said, I want to be with her.</span> <span id="s572">She said no, leave and I had to leave.</span> <span id="s573">I left her the food and when I came back to Mrs. Doblinkov she asked about my sister.</span> <span id="s574">I said she is very, very hungry.</span> <span id="s575">I’ve known children that look like her they usually die right after that.</span> <span id="s576">She said there’s nothing I can do about it, I cannot help her.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So your mother snatched her?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Snatched her out in the nick of time, and she was dying.</span> <span id="s579">As a matter of fact, she did not grow for five years, not one inch, after that incident.</span> <span id="s580">After those few months of the starvation I guess this is what happens to children.</span> <span id="s581">The lack of everything.</span> <span id="s582">My mother was very frightened that she’ll be a midget, she was so tiny.</span> <span id="s583">Not until we came to the United States she started growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Where did your mother take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">SIDE 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: A very nice apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: In Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: In Warsaw on the Dobra Street, which was right across from the Vislag (?)</span> <span id="s589">River.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: This was outside of the __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: As Poles, yes.</span> <span id="s592">We lived as Poles.</span> <span id="s593">We all had our papers.</span> <span id="s594">I had my ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: My mother found an apartment on the Dobra Street, this is where we lived and she got a job.</span> <span id="s596">She was working in a factory again.</span> <span id="s597">I guess run by the Germans, so she had enough money to pay for the rent and it was also food was scarce in Poland, but you were not starving and we came to ourselves after awhile.</span> <span id="s598">In the meantime my mother did a lot of heroic things while she worked in the factories and manufactured the uniforms, she decided to custom make some uniforms for some big generals, big “machers,” they called them in Jewish.</span> <span id="s599">And they sent her to several different concentration camps.</span> <span id="s600">She wound up going.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Not as a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Not as a prisoner, but asking them what sizes they are, what kind of uniforms they want.</span> <span id="s603">So she could make them up custom made for the upper echelon type of generals.</span> <span id="s604">This was one time when she saw my father very briefly, from a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: She saw your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: She saw my father from a distance, and she whispered to him, of course nobody could see, you got a chance, you can put on one of those uniforms and you can escape.</span> <span id="s607">He says I cannot run even, how can I escape?</span> <span id="s608">You go, save yourself and save the children, forget about me.</span> <span id="s609">And this was the last she saw him.</span> <span id="s610">But there was another man that did run away with her.</span> <span id="s611">Went along with her on the truck.</span> <span id="s612">This is the man that has written a book and he has written about this whole episode in the book.</span> <span id="s613">His name is Cheslov (?)</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">I don’t know if this man is alive or not, and I have the book that he has written.</span> <span id="s616">There is a whole chapter about my mother.</span> <span id="s617">And after she took him out she brought him on Dobra Street.</span> <span id="s618">She brought him into the apartment and we held him there for awhile.</span> <span id="s619">Then the following week, she went to another camp and she brought in two sisters she took out, two women that she said she needed them as assistants.</span> <span id="s620">They let them out, she brought them and she brought them to the apartment also.</span> <span id="s621">And one night the Germans were knocking at the door.</span> <span id="s622">The two sisters were caught and they were taken out.</span> <span id="s623">This man went out the window and he was not captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: The man that she smuggled from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes, he was not captured.</span> <span id="s626">And they left with the two sisters, they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: They didn’t punish your mother for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No.</span> <span id="s629">They, I don’t remember what was the story, she just must have told them that maybe they knocked on the door and she let them in.</span> <span id="s630">They just came in, they just walked in, or something, some kind of an excuse.</span> <span id="s631">She made believe she doesn’t know them.</span> <span id="s632">It’s not like this was an old friendship or something.</span> <span id="s633">That she did it intentionally.</span> <span id="s634">Seems like these two women just walked in and they asked to sleep over maybe, or they asked for something, so they let us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Do you know when your mother saw your father for the last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: The last time I would say a year before the war ended, maybe less.</span> <span id="s637">Maybe it was less than when the war ended.</span> <span id="s638">She said he looked terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: You had been living in the Polish part of Warsaw for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Which camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: My father?</span> <span id="s643">In Miedniewice.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Would you know which other camps your mother visited as a custom seamstress?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s646">I know she went to several camps.</span> <span id="s647">She never discussed anything with me or my sister.</span> <span id="s648">She never told us very much.</span> <span id="s649">She would say I have to go away and I’ll be back in a few days.</span> <span id="s650">That’s all we knew.</span> <span id="s651">We never questioned her.</span> <span id="s652">She would say you are not to leave the house and you are not to leave the apartment.</span> <span id="s653">Keep it locked at all times, and that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Nobody was there to take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s656">We were there ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Did she tell you that she saw your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: She told us that a long time afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Until that time you did not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No.</span> <span id="s661">We knew, I sensed that something was wrong when she came back.</span> <span id="s662">She did not sleep, she talked to herself, she was shouting, she was crying and I knew something was wrong, but she didn’t want to tell us what it was.</span> <span id="s663">It was only years after when she told us.</span> <span id="s664">I saw him from a distance, I would have never recognized him in a million years if he stood a foot in front of me, but he recognized me.</span> <span id="s665">So he called out my name and I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So he recognized her first?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: He recognized my mother first.</span> <span id="s668">She did not know where the voice was coming from.</span> <span id="s669">She would not have known it was him.</span> <span id="s670">All she told him I can save you.</span> <span id="s671">If I’ll throw you the uniform, put it on and walk out, march out like a German.</span> <span id="s672">And he was like behind a fence and she was on this side of the fence.</span> <span id="s673">There were a lot of fences.</span> <span id="s674">There were men standing there with those striped uniforms and she tried to save him, which I think would have been hopeless anyway, so he was afraid that he’s going to jeopardize her life, so he says no, no.</span> <span id="s675">He did not want to go.</span> <span id="s676">In a way she could not forgive herself seeing him and yet maybe she could have helped him as a Ukrainian but he didn’t want to jeopardize her life.</span> <span id="s677">He didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Was he a slave laborer?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: I don’t know he was just standing there with other men.</span> <span id="s680">She doesn’t know, he must have been working, they must have been feeding him a little bit, because he survived.</span> <span id="s681">He did survive sometime there.</span> <span id="s682">I would say maybe like seven or eight months later when she saw him.</span> <span id="s683">This was the last person on earth she expected to see.</span> <span id="s684">She knew that he was taken to this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s685">This she knew.</span> <span id="s686">Because she realized that this particular truck they captured people, that’s where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: So she knows when he was taken away during the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s689">It was just the beginning of the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: The very beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: The very beginning of the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Did you ever find out later what your mother was doing during the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: What she did during the uprising?</span> <span id="s694">I guess she was fighting like the handful of people that were there.</span> <span id="s695">They were fighting until there were very few people left.</span> <span id="s696">She said it was a glorious fight.</span> <span id="s697">It was glorious.</span> <span id="s698">So they gave her a reason to live again.</span> <span id="s699">There was a thread of hope, of course.</span> <span id="s700">They knew they cannot do very much but just to give the Germans something back.</span> <span id="s701">A little revenge for all the aches and pains they caused everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Did she ever describe how she got out?</span> <span id="s703">how this Ukrainian factory woman who became a Jewish fighter how then she survived and got out of the ghetto and then found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Oh, this was through the sewers, this took time, this took time, until she finally got out of there.</span> <span id="s705">They could not escape, they put the gas in the sewers, they made sure that nobody can escape, there were dogs all over.</span> <span id="s706">They had to be at a hideout for quite some time until they could get out from wherever they were hiding until it became clearer that she could get out of there.</span> <span id="s707">But this took awhile, because they were on the lookout.</span> <span id="s708">They knew that whoever survived this uprising would want to escape because there was nothing else left there.</span> <span id="s709">It was a handful of heroic people and they’re not ready to give up.</span> <span id="s710">So even the sewers you couldn’t go, it was all gas there.</span> <span id="s711">They would have gotten poisoned.</span> <span id="s712">So they had to wait probably until it was o.k. to find a way to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Did your mother survive and escape by herself or was she with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No, I think they could not go in groups.</span> <span id="s715">Everybody went their own way, because in a group it is more dangerous.</span> <span id="s716">Singularly it always easier to escape when a single person runs.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound up individually, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s718">She never talked about that particular incident.</span> <span id="s719">It was a very painful incident in her life.</span> <span id="s720">Very painful.</span> <span id="s721">And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto, at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone.</span> <span id="s722">It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we’re going to put the building on fire whoever’s there doesn’t run away or doesn’t give themselves up they’re going to get burned alive.</span> <span id="s723">So I don’t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I’m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning.</span> <span id="s724">He did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone.</span> <span id="s725">And when the Germans came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace.</span> <span id="s726">So, we went downstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall there to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a few other buildings.</span> <span id="s727">They were also empty, so we didn’t know what had happened to the building we were originally.</span> <span id="s728">I don’t know if they put it on fire or they didn’t put it.</span> <span id="s729">But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another building and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to apartment which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere.</span> <span id="s730">We turned quietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they’re entering the building and here’s my sister and I alone in this apartment and it’s all empty.</span> <span id="s731">I remember I took her and I put her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet.</span> <span id="s732">I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest.</span> <span id="s733">I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they’ll think there are rags there.</span> <span id="s734">And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there.</span> <span id="s735">We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in this apartment.</span> <span id="s736">They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to apartment.</span> <span id="s737">This was their preoccupation and that’s how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns.</span> <span id="s738">They were shooting in every apartment.</span> <span id="s739">All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting.</span> <span id="s740">I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something.</span> <span id="s741">So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn’t understand what they were saying.</span> <span id="s742">Then I heard them walk out.</span> <span id="s743">And when they walked out and they left the door, my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister’s name, are you alive?</span> <span id="s744">She says Yes, are you alive?</span> <span id="s745">I said yes.</span> <span id="s746">So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet and we decided we’re going to hide in the attic.</span> <span id="s747">From now on it was no good in the apartment because they are shooting and they may shoot us.</span> <span id="s748">So we’ll go in the attic.</span> <span id="s749">We go all the way up in the attic and there’s a lot of furniture and we hear voices.</span> <span id="s750">So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the attic.</span> <span id="s751">We started moving the furniture away and the people outside didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s752">And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you.</span> <span id="s753">So my sister said, well, I’m going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I’m going to tell them that you’re hiding there, so let us in there.</span> <span id="s754">We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Did you know who these people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I had no idea.</span> <span id="s757">We just walked in.</span> <span id="s758">There were about three or four people there.</span> <span id="s759">It looked like older people, maybe at that time, maybe they were in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s.</span> <span id="s760">I don’t know I couldn’t even judge the age.</span> <span id="s761">We stayed with them for a few days and then we left them, and we were going from building to building, we got to find our parents, where are our parents, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s762">And from one of the buildings we saw there were schlep carts and we saw people gathering and the two of us would look out the window, you know hidden behind the curtain, to make sure we don’t see our mother or our father.</span> <span id="s763">I didn’t know what to look for.</span> <span id="s764">I didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s765">So, I said, you see they did not get caught, they didn’t get caught they must be someplace.</span> <span id="s766">Don’t you think my mother came around.</span> <span id="s767">She walked also from building to building yelling quietly, Frania, Chaja, just like an echo from the distance it sounded like.</span> <span id="s768">So she found us.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: She found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And my father must have gone to work also that day.</span> <span id="s771">My mother went to work, my father went also to do something.</span> <span id="s772">Maybe to look for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So your father worked sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Like sometimes, depending.</span> <span id="s775">They were always very busy, they were always doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: What would your father do whenever he found some work?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I guess whatever labor they gave you.</span> <span id="s778">They didn’t ask you what your talents were.</span> <span id="s779">They needed somebody.</span> <span id="s780">I guess like today, you know, people want a job, whatever they’ll tell them to do they’ll do, so there was no question of asking what your talents are or what you specialize, I’ll do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: This episode that you just described, this flashback, this was before the ghetto uprising, long before?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s783">Not long before.</span> <span id="s784">This was in a small ghetto.</span> <span id="s785">This was when we had an apartment ________, when we were staying there for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: This wasn’t the Morenovska (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No, the Morenovska, we were gone already.</span> <span id="s788">This was like the third or the fourth apartment already, that we were on the go.</span> <span id="s789">So we were like constantly like gypsies on the go running.</span> <span id="s790">The minute we were afraid maybe they heard footsteps, we would leave the building already.</span> <span id="s791">We were afraid to stay in the same place three or four nights that’s it and you had to be on the move.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: And that’s the way it was until they took you to the Doblenkov house?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s794">This was up until, I would say, the last few weeks before we went to the Doblenkov’s.</span> <span id="s795">Then we were like more settled with other people.</span> <span id="s796">All of a sudden I saw a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t remember their faces, but I remember there were quite a few people there and they were talking constantly and making plans and they would tell us, there were a few children, go sit on the side, go away, not to bother anybody, and they were making their plans.</span> <span id="s798">So we were there for a while.</span> <span id="s799">Once they made up, I guess, a date when they’re going to start this.</span> <span id="s800">This is when my mother made up her mind to get me and my sister, to get us on the Polish side so we’re not going to get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Now, back to Warsaw after the uprising, when you were living in the -----</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: On Dobra Street?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s804">Were you living in Warsaw when the Polish uprising occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s806">It did not take very long, I heard shooting in the streets and my mother came running in like she was being chased for G-d knows how many blocks or miles and when she came in she says would you believe that the Russians were supposed to come and they’re not coming, they’re on the other side, on the Prague side, and they’re not crossing the river and they told the Poles to start.</span> <span id="s807">This was the first time she talked to me, and she says and the Poles are starting an uprising now.</span> <span id="s808">So we’re going to get caught now in the middle of their uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: How long had you been there when the uprising begins?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Immediately.</span> <span id="s811">We had to leave right away.</span> <span id="s812">They made announcements.</span> <span id="s813">Everybody to leave the buildings.</span> <span id="s814">Everybody to go.</span> <span id="s815">They’re going to shoot every Pole that’s going to stay here and help the Russians to cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: So how long had it been since you left the Doblenkov’s and then lived in Warsaw before the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: On the Dobro Street?</span> <span id="s818">A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q; Just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Just ac few months, yes.</span> <span id="s821">Then we had the uprising again and we were on the go again.</span> <span id="s822">And I remember my mother burying a suitcase.</span> <span id="s823">She says one thing I don’t want to carry with me is luggage.</span> <span id="s824">Let’s bury it in the basement, we’ll come back if we ever survive the war we’re going to take out my little treasures, pictures, letters, addresses of relatives in Israel, relatives in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: She was not involved in this particular uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s827">She couldn’t care less about it.</span> <span id="s828">It was a nuisance.</span> <span id="s829">It was a tremendous nuisance.</span> <span id="s830">They started burning buildings and chasing the Poles and running through the streets and the buildings were all burning and they were chasing.</span> <span id="s831">Also I remember running for about twenty blocks and the last few blocks the buildings were ablaze and we couldn’t crossing.</span> <span id="s832">We couldn’t go through anymore.</span> <span id="s833">There was a church and they made us all, quite a few hundred, pushed into this church.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: The Germans pushed?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Yes, all the Poles pushed into this church.</span> <span id="s836">My mother made sure ----</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: And you were still passing as a Pole?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s839">We had Polish papers and nobody knew otherwise.</span> <span id="s840">We were right at the door.</span> <span id="s841">At the door or there was a window, some kind of exit even if we were locked in we would be able to get out, because my mother said I have a feeling they’re going to do something to us.</span> <span id="s842">They’re going to, she thought they’re going to put the poison gas and they’re going to poison everybody there.</span> <span id="s843">We didn’t know they were going to put it on fire.</span> <span id="s844">So we just broke through the glass and people started panicking.</span> <span id="s845">They were breaking all the like stained glass, whatever there was there.</span> <span id="s846">People started climbing from the windows and running and jumping into the flames and we ran.</span> <span id="s847">At that point we ran with the fire on both sides.</span> <span id="s848">My mother grabbed me and my sister.</span> <span id="s849">I don’t remember how far, I was like in a daze, we just ran until finally it was a clearance and all the people that came out into a clearance, the Germans were there and there was a train and we all were pointed to get on the train and my mother saw a train and she was like petrified.</span> <span id="s850">She says oh, my G-d, we’re going to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s851">She already knew at that point that all trains were going only in one direction.</span> <span id="s852">But it did not go to a concentration camp, it went to another camp, some kind of camp, a detention camp where as Poles we were held over there, but there were not like guards, they gave us to eat, they gave us cots to sleep on and we had like a army blanket even to cover ourselves and I remember that my mother said, this is no good, I don’t like this business here, you know, with the Poles they’re going to do something with them also.</span> <span id="s853">It’s mostly women and children here.</span> <span id="s854">The men, they were shooting them like dogs.</span> <span id="s855">And we escaped.</span> <span id="s856">We were not there very long, we escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Do you know the name of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: No.</span> <span id="s859">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: So where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: We started running.</span> <span id="s862">Most of the time we were hiding out during the day and we were on foot at night.</span> <span id="s863">And we went through towns and villages all on foot and we stopped at different, and I remember my mother saying, if we’re going to walk in this direction another twenty kilometers there’s a small town I know some people there.</span> <span id="s864">We’ll go there and when we made it over there, we stayed with them, I think for about two nights, and we heard the Germans outside so we ran out to the back, the three of us escaped.</span> <span id="s865">And we were on the run continuously on the run until I don’t know for how long on foot until we came to this primitive little village where only farms, like small little straw roof type of little huts.</span> <span id="s866">People lived like that and we were all very ragged, and my mother marched into these houses, claiming some kind of accident, something happened and we needed refuge for just a few days.</span> <span id="s867">And when they asked us where we come from.</span> <span id="s868">We said we come from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s869">She said, oh, she heard about Warsaw, can you tell us stories about it.</span> <span id="s870">She says if you let me sleep here, I’ll tell you all the stories you want to know.</span> <span id="s871">They heard about wagons going on electric.</span> <span id="s872">This was all primitive, and when I think back, my G-d like a few hundred years behind times.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: These were peasants?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Real peasants.</span> <span id="s875">Good natured, nice people, that were afraid of their own shadows.</span> <span id="s876">They knew there was a war, because the Germans came and took away most of their cattle, and took away whatever they had.</span> <span id="s877">They were constantly coming and took away their wheat and their corn, whatever they were growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Do you remember the time of the year that you were with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: We were there in the winter.</span> <span id="s880">We were there until the Russians came into this village.</span> <span id="s881">That’s how long we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Do you remember the day the Russians came to the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s884">I remember the day they marched in I don’t remember the date, because I think we were all in a state of shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Was it the middle of winter though?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I remember it being cold.</span> <span id="s887">I don’t know if it was the beginning, the end or the middle of winter, but I remember it being very cold.</span> <span id="s888">When the Russians came in my mother started talking Russian to them.</span> <span id="s889">She could not get over that they came in, and the first question she had for them, did you hear of a Bernard Friedman, my brother is in Russia, maybe he is in the army?</span> <span id="s890">Well after awhile we found a Jewish Russian soldier who was a Jew.</span> <span id="s891">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s892">As the Russians came in and the war is over, and they said they are chasing the Germans are just in front of them and they were passing with tanks which were so loud and we packed up our few little belongings and they did not mind taking us, jumping in the truck and taking us along, a part of a truck and part we sat on a tank.</span> <span id="s893">Just to get out of this village, and we wanted to go to any town and as we were going through on these vehicles we saw the Germans hanging from trees.</span> <span id="s894">Which was some sight to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: How were they hanging?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: They were hanging some by the legs, some by the neck, some by the hands.</span> <span id="s897">Some by one foot.</span> <span id="s898">They just hung them live.</span> <span id="s899">They were hanging live there.</span> <span id="s900">As they turned around, they were practice shooting with them.</span> <span id="s901">They took guns, they were shooting at them and they were jumping on their ropes, and they were yelling in Russian, this is for my mother and this is for my father, what you did to my country to my Mother Russia.</span> <span id="s902">For the millions you’ve killed.</span> <span id="s903">You know.</span> <span id="s904">And this is what they were yelling at.</span> <span id="s905">Even I understood the few words in Russian.</span> <span id="s906">I didn’t know Russian, but I understood those few words, it was very similar to Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: What was your reaction to this scene?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I was glad.</span> <span id="s909">I was very glad.</span> <span id="s910">I hated the Germans so much with such passion that I think if they cut them alive, it would not have bothered me.</span> <span id="s911">On the contrary, I think I would have found some kind of satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: How about your mother, how was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: My mother went into a shock.</span> <span id="s914">She actually went into a shock because after a short while after she got very sick.</span> <span id="s915">And they told her that she was in a shock.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t think it was a stroke, it was some kind of a shock she went into.</span> <span id="s917">When we came into one of the cities, we passed by a city, I don’t even know what big city we passed by, she went to a hospital.</span> <span id="s918">I was there sitting and they told her they have to treat her for a few days.</span> <span id="s919">And I didn’t know what was wrong with her.</span> <span id="s920">But I remember my sister and I sitting and waiting for her to get well, because we couldn’t go anyplace without her.</span> <span id="s921">This was it, you know.</span> <span id="s922">She got well after a few days and I remember she became very calm.</span> <span id="s923">She was not as wild as she was during the war.</span> <span id="s924">She would do crazy things.</span> <span id="s925">She would jump, and run, and lift and pick.</span> <span id="s926">But here after she got sick, we were released, I guess from the German agony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come.</span> <span id="s927">Every day was a year, you’re talking about five long miserable years, miserable years.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: The period you were on the run, from when you escaped from the Polish detention camp until the time the Russians caught you.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: That took also quite a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: When you first escaped, what time of the year was it?</span> <span id="s931">Was it summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: It was warm.</span> <span id="s933">I know it was warm because from the fire it was hot, or something, or the people in trains.</span> <span id="s934">But I was warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: How did you manage to survive the change in seasons?</span> <span id="s936">You probably were dressed lightly in the summer and then months later it was winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: We were shivering.</span> <span id="s938">If we could steal something to wear or if we saw a body we would rip off something to wear.</span> <span id="s939">I wore maybe a hundred different kinds of shoes.</span> <span id="s940">Whatever I could find, I had no shoes at all.</span> <span id="s941">Most of the time my mother wanted me to be very quiet when I walked so she made me walk without shoes.</span> <span id="s942">And I shouldn’t knock.</span> <span id="s943">But we used to always find something on ways.</span> <span id="s944">We found rags.</span> <span id="s945">Once we passed a small river, so my mother washed my face, she said my G-d, I forgot what you looked like.</span> <span id="s946">I was black from mud, from crawling, from hiding,</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: You were still at Doblinkov until the Russians came?</span> <span id="s948">Were you still called Doblinkov?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No.</span> <span id="s950">Once my mother took me out from the Doblinkov family.</span> <span id="s951">I was not a Doblinkov anymore.</span> <span id="s952">I had those papers like this.</span> <span id="s953">The only thing was she claimed that she adopted a daughter, I was a relative’s daughter and she adopted me.</span> <span id="s954">So that’s the reason why she and I had two different names.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: So officially you were still Doblinkov.</span> <span id="s956">And this went on until the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, once in the primitive village, we didn’t need any papers or anything.</span> <span id="s958">Nobody questioned us, nobody knew from anything anymore.</span> <span id="s959">It was like I said, they didn’t even know anything exists.</span> <span id="s960">You know, from a clock, they knew nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Did they know Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: They heard about people that were Jews and they heard, they’re supposed to look out for them because they are very cruel and very mean and you can usually tell just by looking at them.</span> <span id="s963">That was a propaganda, of course.</span> <span id="s964">Oh, if you see a Jew you’ll know right away, he’ll look subhuman, first of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Are they worse than Nazis, these Jews supposedly?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Not in that way, no.</span> <span id="s967">They were just vicious and they were ugly and they tried to steal from you whatever you had.</span> <span id="s968">They tried to connive you whatever you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: More than the Germans did?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s971">It shows you this was in the schools.</span> <span id="s972">The children were taught like that.</span> <span id="s973">The children were taught, the Polish children were taught, they would make a picture of this, I don’t know, a witch I guess they would pick, and they would say this is what a Jew looks like.</span> <span id="s974">And it is the biggest honor to find one, and if you want to kill them yourself, it’s o.k., and if you want to give him to us, we’ll kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: But they wouldn’t know one even if they were under their own roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No.</span> <span id="s977">They never saw one.</span> <span id="s978">They only know from what they heard.</span> <span id="s979">Don’t forget, the war was on for quite a few years already at that point and they knew nothing of what was going on in the outside their village.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: So they had three of them right in their own house?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: And they thought that we were very fancy people from Warsaw after we washed up.</span> <span id="s982">They realized that they called my mother.</span> <span id="s983">In Polish there’s an expression, “Pania (?)</span> <span id="s984">Intelligencia” that means you are a lady pf intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Of intellect.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Of intellect and, therefore, if we have any questions they would ask her when Christmas comes out, when the holidays.</span> <span id="s987">Of course, they have no calendar, no clock, nothing, no radio.</span> <span id="s988">Didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s989">If I thought ________, and they gave us this tiny little room that was supposed to have been an attached bathroom originally, just some boards.</span> <span id="s990">This is where we slept.</span> <span id="s991">So they knew nothing about Jews if they hit them over the head, probably.</span> <span id="s992">Luckily, they were very nice to us, They gave us food, we ate with them and my mother helped them with the farm, with the work and I did some work.</span> <span id="s993">I would sweep and clean and grow things.</span> <span id="s994">Whatever she told me to do, we would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: When did you become Frania Prawer again?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: I mean openly.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Openly?</span> <span id="s999">In Germany.</span> <span id="s1000">Because after the war, after we left Warsaw and we saw we had nothing there, we registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: You returned to Warsaw eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Right after the war we returned to Warsaw, my mother wanted to get that briefcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And what did she find?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1005">Rubbles.</span> <span id="s1006">All rubbles you couldn’t even tell if a building was once standing.</span> <span id="s1007">It was all burned down and we went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1008">We stayed in Berlin for about six months and we were in Berlin we tried to get to the American side because we were told it was best from the Russian side with the Russians, eventually, like with cars, trucks, trains until we got from Poland to Berlin we did a lot of traveling.</span> <span id="s1009">So we wound up on the Russian side of Berlin and then we escaped to the French side and then finally got to the American side.</span> <span id="s1010">Once we were on the American side, we re-registered and we found a lot of other Jews there and they told us that there are some camps in Germany, they’re called DP camps where all the Jews after the war should gather, and from there we will see what to do further, where to go further.</span> <span id="s1011">So this is where we wound up from Berlin we went to Eschfegan (?)</span> <span id="s1012">, Germany, a DP camp where we lived for almost four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: From when to when were you in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: In that camp we got there in the beginning of ’46, I would say, until ’49, when we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So you came to the U.S. in ’49, the three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And lived happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Well, much happier than during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: And your sister finally grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yes, she did grow up.</span> <span id="s1021">My mother took her to several doctors.</span> <span id="s1022">She used to get some vitamins and very special things but she did grow up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Looking back, what was the worst part of this experience for you, the worst moment?</span> <span id="s1024">Was it the time when you and your sister were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: That was one of the moments.</span> <span id="s1026">It felt like it was the end.</span> <span id="s1027">We had no place to go.</span> <span id="s1028">This was the finality because we didn’t think we were going to see our parents again.</span> <span id="s1029">Also, when I was separated from my sister with the Doblenkov family, this was petrifying thought for me that I would be a Pole the rest of my life with a family I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s1030">I have to live with them and I had to live their style.</span> <span id="s1031">Whatever I remember from before the war or even during the war the love, the affection I got from my parents, it’s all gone.</span> <span id="s1032">I don’t know this was one of the moments.</span> <span id="s1033">There were so many moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: When did you remove the cross that you wore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: This was after the war when we were in Poland, when we were in Warsaw, just before we went to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">The first thing she found out that Jewish children, they want all the Jewish children in this summer camp, and it was a magnificent place.</span> <span id="s1037">It seemed like there was a palace over there and everybody lived over there.</span> <span id="s1038">It was like they took over something and we lived there.</span> <span id="s1039">There were like a hundred children for a very short time, and we were supposed to be, I suppose they must have advised my mother to bring us there for a few months to retrain our thoughts to make us aware that the war was over, which I refused to believe.</span> <span id="s1040">Although I saw signs of the war being over, but I still did not believe, I thought that the Germans would spring out from someplace, make a surprise.</span> <span id="s1041">I didn’t trust anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s1042">I did not believe anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s1043">I didn’t want to get close to anybody.</span> <span id="s1044">They tried, they worked on me very, very hard, until I took the cross off, it took awhile and I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp, there were some young Israeli, all though there was no Israel at that time, it was Palestine, but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1045">They were dressed with the berets and I was so impressed when I looked at them and they said, you see they are just like you, they are also Jews.</span> <span id="s1046">And these are young soldiers and this, I think, I fell in love with them the minute I saw them.</span> <span id="s1047">It was almost like all of a sudden I discovered something, a goal, something different to leave my past and this is the future to go to Israel and to be just like them.</span> <span id="s1048">And I wanted very much to be just like them and this is where I realized I’m not Polish I’m going to go to Israel and I’m going to find a new enemy called Arabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: If you had been old enough you probably would have married one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: You were still a little girl.</span> <span id="s1052">Never went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: No.</span> <span id="s1054">In those few months they prepared us that we’ll have to start going to school.</span> <span id="s1055">When I was in Germany _______ we went to school six days a week and many hours a day.</span> <span id="s1056">From morning until evening we were going to school, and they tried to put in those few years all the missing years of schooling that the majority of kids were.</span> <span id="s1057">Everybody was missing five years of school, so you had children from all ages.</span> <span id="s1058">There were also children that were born in concentration camps, there were children that were orphaned, they were taken away from Polish people.</span> <span id="s1059">I met a lot of people in _____, also in that camp where we stayed right after the war when we came to Warsaw after the war when we stayed in this camp.</span> <span id="s1060">I also met some people from all over and the majority were staying with other families.</span> <span id="s1061">That’s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some of them were older already.</span> <span id="s1062">Some of them at that time were like 17 or 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1063">They must have run away when the war was over and they came voluntarily to this place to find themselves to know who they are.</span> <span id="s1064">Some, maybe the families, the Polish families, brought them, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1065">But they were like dumped.</span> <span id="s1066">Before you know it within a few weeks more than a hundred children there.</span> <span id="s1067">So they brought all these psychologists, people talking to us and retraining us, trying to make us forget the war in a way and to think that there is another life now is going to start.</span> <span id="s1068">There’s a future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: So when was it you realized the war was over and that a new life was about to begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: When I was in that camp, that summer camp.</span> <span id="s1071">I found it to be beautiful.</span> <span id="s1072">Because I found people like myself.</span> <span id="s1073">At first I thought I was the only survivor on this planet.</span> <span id="s1074">This is a horrible thought that you think you are the only Jews that have remained alive and I bet there’s nobody else, so let’s keep it a secret nobody has to know what we are.</span> <span id="s1075">I remember telling this to my mother, don’t tell nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Yet you left the camp.</span> <span id="s1077">You went another direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1079">After that camp we went to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Your mother was the leader of the pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1082">She always was, she always thought with a clear head and she knew exactly and was an extremely brave woman.</span> <span id="s1083">Such a brave woman that when I think back at things that she did I don’t know where she got authority.</span> <span id="s1084">I’ve never come across anybody else like that.</span> <span id="s1085">With such impact, with such go in her, like nothing could stop her.</span> <span id="s1086">Yes, in times of desperation you pick up strength you never knew you had and courage or you die from fear or else you turn the other way around and you become extremely courageous.</span> <span id="s1087">Life is so important that you will do anything to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: I would have loved to have met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: She was something.</span> <span id="s1090">She was very, very loved, she had so many friends here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: And those who came to America and the three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Well the originally I did not want to come to America.</span> <span id="s1093">My goal was to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: With the other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well that wasn’t with the other kids.</span> <span id="s1096">I was in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s1097">This was already almost four years later and I remember they were always coming from Israel.</span> <span id="s1098">They were coming to train us.</span> <span id="s1099">To train us to become young soldiers.</span> <span id="s1100">How to protect yourself, and I was going through all this training and I was ready to become a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: You were seventeen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Didn’t make no difference, I was ready to run away from my mother and to go there, and she said “you’re not going nowhere”.</span> <span id="s1103">And I remember a few of my friends went on the ship Exodus and I was supposed to be on it and my mother caught me the last minute.</span> <span id="s1104">She said you are not going.</span> <span id="s1105">After going through a war like this you’re not going to get shot by an Arab.</span> <span id="s1106">We are going to America.</span> <span id="s1107">At that time, of course, I was trained Hebrew, I was taught Hebrew in Germany, it was a language It was supposed to unite us all.</span> <span id="s1108">I said, but I don’t speak a word of English but I do speak Hebrew, so I’ll be at home in Israel and all my friends here from the camp are going and I want to go there too.</span> <span id="s1109">My mother forbid me, you are not to go by yourself, we are all going together.</span> <span id="s1110">We have relatives in America and this is where we are going.</span> <span id="s1111">And sure enough we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Any regrets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: No.</span> <span id="s1114">I go to Israel every opportunity I have.</span> <span id="s1115">I’ve been there many times, at least a thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Well, on behalf of the United States Holocaust Museum, I thank you for your time and for your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
