id="s11">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Can you describe for me the transport to Sobibór and you arrival there, and what it was like and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">I didn't come by train, I came by horse and wagon because I came from a small working camp.</span> <span id="s14">We were like 800 young girls and young men, and we, they, we rode the whole day to Sobibór, and the month, it was December, 1942, December 22, 194...3, 42, 42, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s15">And after riding the whole day in the mud, and the wagons got stuck in the mud and we had to go down and pull them out, and on the way the farmers were outside, and they said there's no way you're going, they're going to kill you and they're going to burn you.</span> <span id="s16">As much as we knew before, and as much we had heard, we didn't believe.</span> <span id="s17">I-i-it was a very hard to comprehend, to believe.</span> <span id="s18">Why take innocent people and just kill them with no reason at all, and, as the day came to an end, was only 20 kilometers, but it took a whole day.</span> <span id="s19">Everybody of us, from us, was so disgusted, that we wanted to get over with.</span> <span id="s20">If that's what they're going to do to us, let's do it fast, so we, we won't have to suffer.</span> <span id="s21">I mean, not physically, we didn't, but mentally.</span> <span id="s22">You know, it was very hard to sit there and think, I have 4 hrs or 3 and a half hrs or 3 hrs.</span> <span id="s23">And as we came close to Sobibór, the whole day, natural without food, without water, but that really didn't bother, we were used to it.</span> <span id="s24">The, the SS came out with dogs and started barking, I mean, they never talked, they barked.</span> <span id="s25">You could never make out what they saying.</span> <span id="s26">A-although I spoke very well in German.</span> <span id="s27">I had it in school, and I picked it up more experience during the time, and they started barking, and the SS told us to assemble on the platform, the railroad, platform, and we all assembled there, and I stood in every way, that, and, and you felt already the smell there from the burning bodies, and you saw the fire, but, you, you don't believe.</span> <span id="s28">It's, it's just, I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s29">I myself and so my friends, and all of the sudden, I saw that girlfriend of mine with whom I came walks by with a commandant from camp, that was Wagner, the biggest murderer, and the biggest of all the Nazis that ever existed.</span> <span id="s30">He was caught later, in 1979 in Brazil.</span> <span id="s31">And he picked, she picks up one girl, and another girl, and I said, "Mira, who you looking for?"</span> <span id="s32">and she says, "I looking for girls who know how to knit."</span> <span id="s33">And I said, "That's about my talent," and that was just a split second, and she pointed out to me, he said, "Raus," and I came out from the whole transport, they took out 8 girls and 2 men which were fathers of the girl--of some of the girls, one was a shoemaker and one was a tailor, and they marched us out to the camp, and we figured we didn't have no idea what's going on, what they going to do later with us.</span> <span id="s34">And the others they marched out, and at that moment, I don't you're capable of think.</span> <span id="s35">You don't plan, you don't think, you don't argue, you don't--you just numb, and that's how I was, numb.</span> <span id="s36">And then he took us, all the girls with the 2 men, and they marched us in to the camp, and as we, the, the ------- of the camp was very small, very small because when we came in we made out, up, 20 women and 100 men, so was very small, and, and that's smell, and I thought to myself, "What is that smell?"</span> <span id="s37">That smell was...you couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s38">And as he put us in, in an empty barrack and then came and ,and like the commandant, the Jewish commandant of the inmates, he said, "You know where, where you are?"</span> <span id="s39">and we didn't say boo because you didn't know who to trust, you didn't know what to say, so we had to be very careful, and by looking at each other we understood what we are supposed to do, and he explained it right away--"You see the fire, you see this," and then they brought us in blankets, and bread, and coffee, and we figured that's the last meal, and we remained there, un-until the morning, we laid down we slept, we didn't sleep, but, I cannot explain the feelings we had.</span> <span id="s40">If to believe that all those who were with us are not here anymore...or, or not to, we, we didn't know, we were just numb to the whole situation.</span> <span id="s41">Early in the morning, they told us to get up, and they marched us off to the sorting shed, the next morning, where they told us to sort out the belongings of the people, then when we found the belongings and the pictures and the documents of the girls and the young men that were with us, we realized, but it's very hard to just putit into your head, they're all dead.</span> <span id="s42">Why?</span> <span id="s43">It was very difficult, it was very difficult, it was very hard, and inside it builds up right away such a resentment, such a feeling of revenge, such anger, if I could just kill one.</span> <span id="s44">For that what had happened, I would feel better, but you have to keep your mouth shut, and just pretend you don't see, you don't hear, no emotions, no emotions whatsoever, we didn't even cry, not one of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Can you describe the transports coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">The transports, well, usually, most of them used to come in during the night, but there was some in the daytime too, when you heard that whistle from the commandant of the camp, that man, that the transport was coming in, and the men in the camp should get ready to unload the people, and so, that whistle was like somebody would tear out you insides, you knew here are other people, children, our, older people, people who never did anything wrong in their life, and they're going to go, and you cannot say, you cannot resist, you cannot just inside it builded up, that revenge, and that resentment, and that anger, and that pain, you know that we have builded up inside, and sometimes they came in during the day, and sometimes so many came in that they couldn't handle, so they would put them behind our ----------, and we were -----------, and tell us just to walk back and forth, and forth and back, so what they told them that they going to work should seem to them to be the truth, and that was hard, it was hard.</span> <span id="s47">You walk by, and you look at the face, and you know in a half hour won't be here, can't even tell.</span> <span id="s48">You just put on a smile, your best face you can, it hurted, it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s49">And then some transports usually, when I had to work near the railroad tracks, you know, near the -------, there was, and, and sometimes when a transport came, we had, they sent us all to the compound, except for those who worked with the unloading of the people, but a few times, we went to clean the houses from the SS, and there wasn't enough time to run back, so they would lock us in, or we knew ourselves we are not supposed to walk out and watch it, and, and sometimes we saw the people the way they were delivered, before they're dead, they torture before they're dead.</span> <span id="s50">We saw them leaving and screaming and children crying and elderly people, and, and, I cannot explain the feeling that I had, and I wondered why, why, just why that why was such a big question, and nobody could answer.</span> <span id="s51">Like, for instance, once, I, I was called to clean up the...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">We just ran out of film.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Beep Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">This will be take 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">This is uh, an incident which is going to be with me the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s57">All the people that I saw going, and, and imagining what's going to happen, but once a big shot was supposed to come to Sobibór, usually they brought them, even Himmler was in Sobibór, to show them how efficient, and how perfect they had killing, and how good, and they brought a transport so they took me to clean up the, the quarters, the living quarters of the SS, of some of the SS people, which the windows face the railroad track.</span> <span id="s58">And, when I was there cleaning with another girl, the whistle was there that a train comes, and so we knew we have to remain there, we cannot go out, and the transport came in and went everything very fast, the load, unloading of the people, and a mother left a baby, I don't know for what reason, in the boxcar, and Frenzel who was at that time in charge of the transport, grabbed that little baby, and smashed the head, the skull against the boxcar, and they just threw it in like a dead rat, and that just, I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s59">I was at this trial for, about 4 times, and I told them what he did, he didn't deny it, but he followed orders, and this I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s60">Why kill that child in such a miserable way?</span> <span id="s61">Why?</span> <span id="s62">Why?</span> <span id="s63">It was a human being.</span> <span id="s64">I just wish that somebody would do to his children and he should have to watch.</span> <span id="s65">And this is with me, I cannot, for all the gruesome things that I saw, I saw a transport come, came, the people probably resisted in the boxcar, I don't know, so they threw in chlorine, into the boxcar, and the whole transport came, so, dead, natural.</span> <span id="s66">All bodies were 3, 4 times the size, some even were busted open, and they just deposit them.</span> <span id="s67">It's, it's a really difficult to think about it and to talk about it.</span> <span id="s68">And all those builded up in me, such a anger, and the feeling of revenge, and I remember after a few days, I came to the camp with a pair of brown leather boots, which, not everybody had, probably nobody, and I said to the group that we slept together, I took my boots, wrapped them up nicely, and put them under the bunk bed, un-under my head, but they said, "Why you put them??"</span> <span id="s69">I said, "With these boots, I'm going to escape from Sobibór."</span> <span id="s70">Don't ask me why.</span> <span id="s71">Don't ask me how.</span> <span id="s72">And maybe it's not, doesn't even make sense, but I'm going to escape with these boots, and I did escape with these boots.</span> <span id="s73">And things like this, every day was something new.</span> <span id="s74">Like they took all the sick people, when we stood in the sorting shed, and sorted the things from the people, the belongings, and you see the ----------- the wagons, go by, and the older people, or children who were maybe orphans or, were thrown in like cabbage, and then at the end rides Gomesky, who was in charge of them, with a pistol, and just asks, "Who is tired, and who cannot work, and who is sick?</span> <span id="s75">I'm going to help you."</span> <span id="s76">And then bullet, and then a bullet, and...I cannot describe here the feeling.</span> <span id="s77">I cannot describe, I don't think there are words really to describe it.</span> <span id="s78">I was at his trial too.</span> <span id="s79">He said also he followed orders.</span> <span id="s80">And I told the judges, "If Hitler would come now and give him orders, or somebody else, they would do it again."</span> <span id="s81">And, it was very hard just to watch, like winter sometimes came a transport, and they were busy, and they couldn't handle so many.</span> <span id="s82">They told the people to undress, in the snow, in Poland it's very cold, in the snow, naked, and they chased them like, like cattle, cattle I think you take better care of.</span> <span id="s83">All the way to camp, straight to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Let's stop...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Can you talk about, uh, you talked once about a person named Mitchell, and the charade that he had telling people to hang up their clothes, and he talked about...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">This was in the beginning when it first started.</span> <span id="s88">They, they weren't as well-organized as later on, so the German efficiency, they had a yard, a fenced in yard with hooks to hang up the clothes, and they would assemble all the people from the transport and he would go out, -------Mitchell, we used to call him the, the House Beater???</span> <span id="s89">, you know, and he would say in German, "Jews, you think you're going to die.</span> <span id="s90">It won't happen.</span> <span id="s91">It won't happen to you.</span> <span id="s92">You're brought here, you give up all your belongings with a number, you'll get a number, and you hang up your clothes, and you go to the showers because we're afraid of sicknesses, and then you'll be sent to work.</span> <span id="s93">But the way he said it, it's, in German he said, "--------------------------," that if the Jews would want to die, but it won't happen, and I feel it was their way of doing it, I mean, they were very well- organized and I'm not surprised at myself and other people that we really didn't bel-not that we believed it because we saw it, but, we couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s94">The way it was done.</span> <span id="s95">With such a German efficiency, and everything to the minute and to the second, and, and you always ask why, why, you cannot ask it.</span> <span id="s96">It wasn't easy to be in Sobibór or any other camp, I suppose, death camp.</span> <span id="s97">I don't think you could even think straight.</span> <span id="s98">I remember once came a big, when Himmler came to our camp, they brought 400 girls from Majdanek, that was also a death camp, to show him, and that's when they uh, ordered to shave the heads, from those ----------------, and they shaved the hair from them, and he went and, and ----------------, and they got such reward, that they doing such a good job, that after a while they liquidated Treblinka, and they, and all of the sudden when they closed up Treblinka, they brought all the inmates to Sobibór to be killed, they were afraid to do it there.</span> <span id="s99">So one afternoon all of the sudden, the whistle, and they lock us in in our camp, then we knew something extra ordinary has happened.</span> <span id="s100">And we could hear the train coming in, the Ukrainians took care of it, not our inmates, and we could hear shots, and we counted the shots, so much and so much, and after the last shot, they came they let us out, and they sent us to sort out the belongings, and as we started, we all ---------- very careful, everything, for papers, for documents, for notes, for, for, anything, and we saw that they were from Treblinka, and every, and every pocket was almost a note, "Take revenge.</span> <span id="s101">Take revenge.</span> <span id="s102">We couldn't, maybe you can take...the revenge."</span> <span id="s103">And in times like this, and you felt they using you and look at what they do to you, the same thing, so why be here?</span> <span id="s104">Why?</span> <span id="s105">Just for their convenience?</span> <span id="s106">Why?</span> <span id="s107">And then after a while, they brought the people from Belgitz because they closed up Belgitz too at that time, and they were in the same story, happened there.</span> <span id="s108">And then they expanded Sobibór, and business started booming.</span> <span id="s109">Night and day you had transports.</span> <span id="s110">You, we used to work 14, 16, 18 hours a day, I mean, into the night, just the men took care of the helping to unload, the people empty of the belongings, and then you had to --------, and they had to ship it to Germany.</span> <span id="s111">It was very difficult, I, I cannot explain that feeling.</span> <span id="s112">And the resentment and the hate, and the, and the revenge.</span> <span id="s113">The revenge was so great, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">This will be synced with CR-3, Take 4 coming up.</span> <span id="s116">Correction, end sound roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">(Long tone).</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Can you talk about the choices that the guards had vs. the choices that you prisoners had.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">First of all, the guards had all the privileges.</span> <span id="s121">They could do whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s122">They didn't have to account if they killed somebody, or hit somebody, or mistreated somebody.</span> <span id="s123">We didn't have no privileges.</span> <span id="s124">We were there to serve the Germans, probably as long as they would have needed us, and then it would be the end.</span> <span id="s125">They guards could go outside, the guards could have furlough, the guards had enough food.</span> <span id="s126">It's altogether a different ballgame.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Did you have choices?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">No, I didn't have no choices.</span> <span id="s129">Whatever I was told I had to do, and maybe better than I could, and whatever they gave me that was to eat, and that's it.</span> <span id="s130">The only thing that we had in our favor in Sobibór which other camps didn't have, I don't know about Treblinka and Belgitz, that they didn't shave our hair, the inmates, and that we could take clean clothes from the transports, and change, and we could wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s131">And I think this was keeping ourselves clean wasn't so dehumanizing that people had in other camps with the dirt, with the filth.</span> <span id="s132">They did it only for one reason.</span> <span id="s133">First of all, was a, as propaganda if some transports came in, they should see that we still look like human beings, and second of all, they lived so close to our quarters, the German quarters, that they were afraid for diseases.</span> <span id="s134">And there was enough clothes so we could take and keep ourselves clean.</span> <span id="s135">This was one of the biggest things that kept us going.</span> <span id="s136">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s137">Not enough, sometimes we stole something from the transport, the people used to bring bread or, or whatever, but there, that was very risky because most of the time when we walked to the barracks from the working place, they used to check us.</span> <span id="s138">They used to check us if we didn't take something or so, but we tried, sometimes we were successful, but the main thing that we could keep ourselves clean, and that's why we had that courage and that will to do something, because when you way down, physically, and filthy and dirty, and shaven and this, you give up very fast, but I, I feel that kept us going, and that's why we thought, even if one makes it and go out, he'll look normal, he won't be right away suspicious.</span> <span id="s139">He has a, a striped outfit, he doesn't have no hair, that was one plus that they didn't think about that we had in our favor to think about uprising and about taking revenge and so forth.</span> <span id="s140">Once a partisan group approached the camp, and they wanted, I don't know, liberate, or, whatever they wanted to do, but we knew it was a partisan group, and during the night a whistle came, we had all to run out, whatever we had on, and stay barefooted in the snow probably, 2, 3 hours or more, surrounded by machine guns, and everything.</span> <span id="s141">They figured if they should happen to go through, they'll kill us all, but they left the Partisans and we went back, and at that time, they made mine fields around the camp, before there were no mine fields.</span> <span id="s142">We were so deep in the woods, that nobody could even know that something goes on.</span> <span id="s143">So, we started thinking about uprising and about revenge, and I think that kept us going, although it was silly thought, but, you know, that gave us the courage to survive, to do, because we planned, we planned.</span> <span id="s144">The plans weren't worth it, maybe in the beginning, five cents, but we planned and we saw ourselves outside, and we saw all the Nazis killed and this kept us going, and every day in 1943 probably in February or well, Leinfeld Hendler was picked out from a transport and brought in.</span> <span id="s145">We were cousins by marriage, and after we told him what's going on, everybody who came in or they took him our, if they killed ten from us, they picked out another ten from the next transport.</span> <span id="s146">We told them, and he said, "We have to escape," and we asked how, he said, "There must be a way, and we're gonna escape."</span> <span id="s147">And we tried started planning, and going to meeting, which only a few went because you had to be very careful, and coming back, you felt like you doing something, you planning something, you trying something.</span> <span id="s148">If you'll succeed it would be wonderful.</span> <span id="s149">If not, you'll get a bullet in the back--it's better than going to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s150">I promised myself I'll never go to the gas chamber, I'll start running, I'll start do--they have to waste a bullet.</span> <span id="s151">And we started organizing and talking and, it, it kept us alive again, you know, that maybe we'll be able to take revenge for all those who can't, who already burned there.</span> <span id="s152">And, and, and we promised ourselves, it didn't matter if we'll survive or not, but to do something, not, the, the world shouldn't say 'the Jews went like sheep to the slaughter.'</span> <span id="s153">It's not true.</span> <span id="s154">We saw a lot of incidents in camp where women hit the SS people.</span> <span id="s155">They hit once the Unterschum Fuehrer Neumann, they almost popped out the knife for him, he was all bandaged up.</span> <span id="s156">They did, they did, but they're not here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s157">And I feel that the resistance, in general, not talking about Sobibór, which Sobibór had a successful revolt.</span> <span id="s158">The others tried and didn't succeed, you know.</span> <span id="s159">This was the only successful revolt.</span> <span id="s160">But people fought back.</span> <span id="s161">They fought back in the woods, they fought back on the train stations, they fought back every step of the way, but they, they are not here to tell.</span> <span id="s162">And that hurts, it hurts.</span> <span id="s163">And, and the uh, and time runs out on the survivors too.</span> <span id="s164">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Tell me what a death camp is.</span> <span id="s166">Assume that I don't know.</span> <span id="s167">Just define a death camp as opposed to other kinds of camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">You see, our ca-the other camps were half slave labor camp, and half death camp.</span> <span id="s169">Sobibór was only a death camp.</span> <span id="s170">There was no such thing as slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s171">That was only strictly the inmates that were picked out from the tran--they just took care of the killing of the people, I mean, they didn't kill them, but they helped.</span> <span id="s172">You know, they had to.</span> <span id="s173">And of the work in the camp of taking care of the SS people, that's the difference.</span> <span id="s174">From Sobibór to Auschwitz, let's say.</span> <span id="s175">Auschwitz was a half slave labor camp and a death camp.</span> <span id="s176">Sobibór was just a death camp.</span> <span id="s177">No slave there, no work, no producing, no doing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Can you tell me about the seamstress and her baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">She was there, she came with a transport in my time already, with her husband.</span> <span id="s180">She was a seamstress and he was a tailor, but during the film she says that he was in the Partisan group, but she came with her husband, and she had that baby, I would say about 2 wks, and then they finally found it, because they used to come in on...uh,...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">unannounced?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">unannounced, and they walked in and they saw the baby.</span> <span id="s183">They gave her a choice, it's true.</span> <span id="s184">They gave her a choice, that they're going to take the baby and she can remain because she was very good seamstress.</span> <span id="s185">They used to wear underwear only from silk, from the parachutes.</span> <span id="s186">They didn't use plain materials, the SS.</span> <span id="s187">So, and she was excellent, shirts and underwear to make from those parachutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">This will be CR-4, Take 5 coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">There's a squeak.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">I think it's-----------, it's getting louder now...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Okay, start again and do that whole thing again.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">With the...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Seamstress, tell me about what her work was, what she did, what did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">She came into the camp with her husband, he was a good tailor, and she was an excellent seamstress, and the Nazis didn't wear underwear just from plain material, everything had to be made from silk, the shirts, the underwear, so she was excellent.</span> <span id="s198">They brought a lot of silk from the parachutes, and she used to be able, if you told her out of this piece has to come out 3 shirts and 3 under-it came out.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know how she did it, but it came out.</span> <span id="s200">And then after the, she had a baby, and we all pitched in to help.</span> <span id="s201">I mean, first of all was the baby.</span> <span id="s202">Second of all, again, to do something against the Nazis, you know, maybe we'll be able.</span> <span id="s203">It was a challenge at the same time.</span> <span id="s204">And so, she kept it for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s205">And once Wagner walked in unannounced, unexpected, and he heard the baby, and he gave her a choice, he gave her a choice, just because they needed her, otherwise they wouldn't have.</span> <span id="s206">And which mother would give up her baby.</span> <span id="s207">And she just spit in his face right then and there, and they shot them both.</span> <span id="s208">But, they were such murderers that he had to shoot the baby first, so the mother should, should die with more pain, and so, I mean, I cannot explain what went on in the mind of those people, of those SS people.</span> <span id="s209">I mean a human being was nothing as we know, but they took such a joy in seeing blood and hurting.</span> <span id="s210">It, it, they weren't...people, they were animals, hound dogs, I always said, they bark like dogs, and they act like wild dogs.</span> <span id="s211">It's, it's very difficult, and we were very hurt at that time.</span> <span id="s212">When you see things like that, and especial when they took one of us.</span> <span id="s213">We were a small group, and you felt like they tear out a piece of you.</span> <span id="s214">That here she was, and here--and, and the baby was here, and you know there was a little life, and the, uh, seamstress too, and they tore it out completely, and, you just, you have to put up a face, but inside everything is boiling and boiling and boiling and boiling, and, and, it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s215">Not once we said to ourselves, we wish they would finish up.</span> <span id="s216">But then one encouraged the other, especially when Leon came.</span> <span id="s217">You'll see, we'll get out, and we'll get out, and we'll get out, and one looked at the other, and figured the other one is crazy, you know, thinking even about it.</span> <span id="s218">And that's how, every day passed by with the hope of revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Tell me about escapes and punishments for escapes that went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">First there escaped two people, they were ----------, they were plasterers, like, and, at that time, there were no, uh, there were no mines around the camp.</span> <span id="s221">So they dug a hole underneath the first fence, and they escaped.</span> <span id="s222">When they escaped, they always explained why they're doing things to us, they assembled us, and they said, every tenth, and they took out every tenth, and they shot them in front of us, and if somebody escapes, that's what's going to happen, and those two marauders??</span> <span id="s223">didn't make it, they didn't make it.</span> <span id="s224">Then we had, they used to take out people to the woods because they, as Sobibór was announced the best, the most efficient death camp, so they had to expand, and they had to build, and they had to do, and always kept busy.</span> <span id="s225">The Nazis didn't want to go to the Russian front, so they built and they expand, and they said they need this and they took out more people in order to escape from the Russian front.</span> <span id="s226">And they took out some people to the woods to cut woods, and they used to make their own logs, everything was done on the premises, and two escapes.</span> <span id="s227">They lived a while and they are not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s228">They went with the guards for water, and they hid, and, and they escaped.</span> <span id="s229">They survived the war even.</span> <span id="s230">And when they escaped, that day, I was in the weaponry.</span> <span id="s231">They were low on ammunition, so they brought some bullets which they got from the Russians, and they were rusty, so a few girls, we sat there and we sanded them down, and filled the barrels with the ammunition, and all of the sudden, the guy who watched us, the watchman, he was the Ukrainian, but he was a nice guy, but we didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s232">He said to us, "You'll see what I'm going to do, one will get killed because of me."</span> <span id="s233">And it was true, but you don't know who to trust.</span> <span id="s234">And he came running in, and he said, "I have to lock you up, something is going on, and there's not enough time for you to go back to your compound, and we saw those people walking in from the main gate, underneath, with their hands like this.</span> <span id="s235">They were beaten up, you couldn't tell their faces anymore.</span> <span id="s236">And then, all of the sudden, as they walked out by the veterinary, we heard the whistle, and he came in here, opened the door, and we had to run to the compound.</span> <span id="s237">And, assembling right away, and as we assembled, uh, ---------------- was such a dog, such a miserable character, I went to his trial too.</span> <span id="s238">He followed orders too.</span> <span id="s239">And, they marched us off to Camp 3.</span> <span id="s240">Camp 3 was where the gas chambers, and they told us to assemble in a half moon, and all those poor guys were standing there.</span> <span id="s241">You couldn't tell who was who.</span> <span id="s242">That's how they were beaten up.</span> <span id="s243">And they told them to pick out another 25 from us.</span> <span id="s244">And they were going to be shot with them.</span> <span id="s245">First they held a long speech, that some guys of ours killed two, uh, killed one watchman, one Ukrainian, and for this we have to pay.</span> <span id="s246">On the way to Camp 3, they told us that we're all going to be shot.</span> <span id="s247">But as we came there, they probably changed their mind, or I don't know why, and they told them to pick out.</span> <span id="s248">And I can imagine how hard it was on those guys to go over, and choose that you have to be killed.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, in the morning he was my friend, and now I have to, to, it was a difficult time.</span> <span id="s250">The-if not, they said they're going to take 50.</span> <span id="s251">So some stepped out, and they picked blindly, and they shot them all in front of us, in their faces.</span> <span id="s252">They wouldn't have let them, and Frenzel went over, whoever may be uh, botched or something, another bullet.</span> <span id="s253">And these things were so hard on us, harder than a transport, because here we're like a family, we planned together, we suffer together, we, we do together, and we hoped together.</span> <span id="s254">And if you take out such a part from us, it's, it's like tearing out your own heart.</span> <span id="s255">It was the, but you had to go away and pretend again, that you didn't see it.</span> <span id="s256">Or maybe what happened, happened, and it wasn't easy, it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s257">I always said to myself, if they would kill me, it would be easier for me than to watch somebody that I knew and maybe, and ate together, and stayed together and suffered together, and planned, it was very difficult, was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">We're almost, we only have one minute left, why don't you just describe for me Wagner or Frenzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">I think Wagner, he was caught in 1979 in Brazil.</span> <span id="s260">Wagner was illiterate, that's what they said.</span> <span id="s261">But he was such a devoted Nazi.</span> <span id="s262">And there were days when he needed blood.</span> <span id="s263">Like a dog, like uh, needs blood.</span> <span id="s264">He needed it.</span> <span id="s265">When he used to walk in with his thumbs in his pocket, we knew that somebody's going to go.</span> <span id="s266">Otherwise, he won't ask???</span> <span id="s267">Besides what he did with the transport.</span> <span id="s268">And we knew also.</span> <span id="s269">But at the same time, as illiterate he was, he was so shrewd, that he knew what you think, not what you saying.</span> <span id="s270">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">(Long tone).</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Why don't we ------------------------(couldn't hear question).</span></p> <p><span id="s274">We planned all the time, and we talked about it, and we had the plan ready.</span> <span id="s275">It was just a matter of time, because we had to plan when Wagner is on vacation.</span> <span id="s276">Because we knew on furlough, if he'll be in the camp, he'll smell it, there's no 2 ways about it.</span> <span id="s277">So we waited.</span> <span id="s278">In the meanwhile, we knew their schedule with furloughs.</span> <span id="s279">By being there, we knew about everything.</span> <span id="s280">So, and before Wagner, had to go 28 days before, they brought in a Russian unit from POWs.</span> <span id="s281">At first, we did-couldn't understand why, but then we found out they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s282">They were POWs, and we got in touch with one of the leaders--every group had a leader, and we told them our plans, and we asked them because, if we didn't know what's going on outside, how far the front is, and what's going on in general, and he told us approximately what's going on, and how far, and he, we needed that encouragement, and they gave us.</span> <span id="s283">And I said, "You're plan is good, and it's going to work, and it has to work, and we have to try, we don't have what to lose."</span> <span id="s284">And we decided the date when Wagner left, and, the, the date was original the 13 of October, and that day we all got ready, ready, put on two, two sweater, and, and my boots I put on for the first time again, and I got dressed with a coat and a kerchief, and you know, you didn't take no luggage with you, you didn't know where you going, or if you'll make it.</span> <span id="s285">And then, some units from military gestapo came to the camp, never used to come on that day, and we thought somebody maybe...slipped out, but they left, and the next day exactly, the plan was, at 4 o clock should start, everybody has to kill his, his SS man, and his guard, at his place of work.</span> <span id="s286">And it started working, and I was like messenger girl, going here, oh I killed them, five, I killed, just throwing signals, not talking, but, we couldn't find Frenzel, and we thought, although the electric wire was cut, the telephone wire was cut, we were afraid that somehow he got out on the outside and, and went for help.</span> <span id="s287">And this was before decided, in case anything goes wrong, everybody on his own.</span> <span id="s288">And whoever, wherever one can run, or wherever one can jump, should go.</span> <span id="s289">Maybe one will survive, and will be able to tell the world.</span> <span id="s290">And we assembled like on a normal day, and then Sasha and Liem, the organizers, went up on the table, and they said, "We can't find Frenzel.</span> <span id="s291">Something--everybody on his own."</span> <span id="s292">But a lot of people were panicky right away.</span> <span id="s293">A lot of people didn't want to go, they gave up.</span> <span id="s294">And those who felt they want to try, just run in all directions.</span> <span id="s295">I saw that somebody put a stepladder behind the par-uh, carpenter's shelf, and that people climbing up, no one explained that this was all split second.</span> <span id="s296">And I just jumped up that stepladder.</span> <span id="s297">And as I was on top, I noticed a lot of bodies already on the mines, some people went before me.</span> <span id="s298">I got a bullet shot from the tower right here, and I fell down.</span> <span id="s299">As I fell down, I was so much aware, and the will to live was so great, there's no measurement to it, that I started hopping on dead bodies, and soon as reached the woods, we were in the woods, it, it was, I felt, I did it, I made it.</span> <span id="s300">For all those, I just looked back to the fire, the fire was still burning, and to the people in the back, and I figured, I did it for you.</span> <span id="s301">We took revenge.</span> <span id="s302">What's going to happen from now on, it's a different story because the war was still on.</span> <span id="s303">And I had to survive another 9 mos.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">When you said everyone had to kill an SS man, what was the plan for that, how did you----------?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">If he came in, let's say they called him in, they said his suit is ready to try on, his uniform, so when he came in, he put it on, we had everybody, everybody had sand in his pockets, and a knife, this we all had, because we felt, if you throw sand in the face, then it's easy to stick in the knife because the person gets blinded.</span> <span id="s306">So, that's what they did.</span> <span id="s307">The minute he came in, they threw sand, they stuck a knife in, and they hit, hit him.</span> <span id="s308">And that's how we did it.</span> <span id="s309">We didn't have no weapons.</span> <span id="s310">The original plan was to assemble, to go to the weaponry, take out all the weapons, and march out through the main gate.</span> <span id="s311">But, we, we didn't succeed, the plan didn't succeed, the plan didn't succeed because we couldn't find Frenzel, and had to be everybody on his own, so we did the best we could with whatever we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">When you got shot in the head and you fell down, how did you manage to get up again?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">You get up.</span> <span id="s314">When your life is at stake, you get up very fast.</span> <span id="s315">You don't think--the blood was streaming and I was running.</span> <span id="s316">And I didn't get an infection, all those weeks that I was in the woods.</span> <span id="s317">And I didn't get sick without food, without water, for 2 weeks until I reached a farmer where I wanted, where I thought I would find refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Tell me about that, tell me about you dream, tell me about your--------.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">You see, in Sobibór, all the time that we planned, we knew, actually, the one thing that we want to accomplish is to kill a few Nazis and get out.</span> <span id="s320">And maybe the, they'll close up Sobibór, and all that would end.</span> <span id="s321">And, you know, you didn't think where you're going to go, what you're going to do, and, especially when we had planned to go to the weaponry, take the ammunition, and go into the world, and form a Partisan group.</span> <span id="s322">If we had weapons, we can--and we had the military people who knew how.</span> <span id="s323">We didn't know how.</span> <span id="s324">But, like the first day when it didn't come, we didn't, we couldn't run because of the visitors, when, a-at night we laid down in Sobibór, I never tried, nobody tried.</span> <span id="s325">You were so numb that everything that you saw around you, that you, your feelings were dead.</span> <span id="s326">You just acted like a mechanical thing, you get up, you go to work, you listen, and that's it.</span> <span id="s327">And this, that evening we cried, we cried very, very much.</span> <span id="s328">And everybody said goodbye because we figured, in our wildest dreams, we didn't think one of us is going to survive.</span> <span id="s329">And as I cried, I cried myself to sleep, I dozed off, and I saw my mother coming in through the camp, through the main gate.</span> <span id="s330">The way I left her, that how she looked.</span> <span id="s331">And I said, "Mom, you know that we're going to escape tomorrow?"</span> <span id="s332">She says, "Yes, that's why I came."</span> <span id="s333">And she said to me, "Come with me."</span> <span id="s334">She took me by the hand, and she led me out through the main gate.</span> <span id="s335">And as we came out, she took me into a barn, and she showed me the loft where the straw is on top, and she says, "Go up here, and you'll survive," and that was the end of the dream.</span> <span id="s336">In the morning when I got up, I recognized the barn was a friend of ours, my parents'.</span> <span id="s337">And they had a farm, they lived in the city, but they had a farm like a gentleman's farm in, in the suburbs, and I said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s338">If I'll survive, and I'll escape, I'm going to go to that farm, and see what the, what's there.</span> <span id="s339">I'm--," so they all said you probably, uh, thought about your mother, so you dreamt about it, you know how they explain it.</span> <span id="s340">But, as we escaped, and they told us to go in groups, not all together because we didn't have any weapons, we had a few, and, if one group was going to get caught, the other one will maybe survive.</span> <span id="s341">So, I wound up with 7 men, and another girl from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s342">Natural for the girls from other countries was very hard for the people because of the language barrier, you know.</span> <span id="s343">And they were right away recognized.</span> <span id="s344">So, I walked from, we escaped on Thursday, and it was already Sunday morning, and I just couldn't anymore, my wounds started hurting me, it was probably infected.</span> <span id="s345">And in Poland it was so hot, uh, cold, and rain, and mud, and I being, when I..</span> <span id="s346">.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">CR-6 starts here, CR-6...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">(Several small tones).</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Let's go back to getting out and making your way to the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Yes.</span> <span id="s355">So, uh, on Sunday, I was finished.</span> <span id="s356">No food since Thursday night.</span> <span id="s357">No water.</span> <span id="s358">You s--in Poland, there's a lot of like mush in in the fields because of the rain, used to squeeze in just a half a drop of water, and on Sunday morning, I saw from far away, there's a little deserted house, and I said to them, I'm going here.</span> <span id="s359">Whatever will happen will happen.</span> <span id="s360">I cannot take it any longer.</span> <span id="s361">So one guy said, "I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s362">And we started walking, and the other said, "If you'll be able to buy some food, you'll bring it back."</span> <span id="s363">And as I approached that little house, a house, a room, and another guy followed us.</span> <span id="s364">And I knocked on the door, and there was a little room, a Polish farmer without teeth, I don't know how old he was.</span> <span id="s365">The towel was there, the bed was there, the stove was there, those were the conditions.</span> <span id="s366">And he said, "You must be from Sobibór."</span> <span id="s367">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s368">And he said, "You did the right thing."</span> <span id="s369">And he said, "What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s370">I said, "I'm hungry, and I have that wound, and I need cleaning up.</span> <span id="s371">I had very long braids in Sobibór, and on the way when I took out the pins one day, just fell off because the ------------.</span> <span id="s372">And he said, "Listen, how many are you?"</span> <span id="s373">And I said "Two," and then the third one crawled in, and I said, "That's it," and he took us into the barn, and he said he has to go to church.</span> <span id="s374">And after he'll--because the people will get suspicious--after he'll come back, he'll feed us.</span> <span id="s375">And that, I was afraid he's going for the SS.</span> <span id="s376">We didn't trust nobody.</span> <span id="s377">And as he left, and came back in a few hours, and he brought us in food, uh, I still have the taste in my mouth.</span> <span id="s378">Borscht and meat and milk and bread and cheese, and I said, "My God, that's probably also our last meal."</span> <span id="s379">And then he said, "When it'll get real quiet, and you will, you'll come down, and I'll help you out."</span> <span id="s380">And then when it got real quiet, he, he lived there with his son.</span> <span id="s381">His son was in his 20s.</span> <span id="s382">He called us in to the house--I'm telling it fast--and he had a big pot of water boiling, and he said to me, "You go behind the tub there, and wash up a little bit, and wash up your wound, and I'll see what I can do for you.</span> <span id="s383">And we came ba--and I came back and he put unsalted lard.</span> <span id="s384">He said, "This helps."</span> <span id="s385">I don't know if it helped.</span> <span id="s386">No infection, infection or anything.</span> <span id="s387">And he gave us again to eat, and he said, "What do you want to do now?"</span> <span id="s388">I said, "I have to go to one place, and if that man won't, that farmer won't take me in, I'll come back, but you have to tell me the village, and your name."</span> <span id="s389">He was afraid, if they catch him, he'll start to--we try and just...So he said, "My son, midnight, he'll take you out, and he'll show you the road where to go."</span> <span id="s390">I told him where I want to go, but I didn't tell him the village either because I was afraid to give away.</span> <span id="s391">So he gave us a bottle of milk, and a loaf of bread, and we had some money, and I took out, wanted to pay him, he said, "No, there'll be peo-people that won't give you without money."</span> <span id="s392">And the son took us to the woods, and he told us where to go.</span> <span id="s393">From there to the village where I wanted to go was probably 15 kilometers, about 10 miles.</span> <span id="s394">I could make it easily in a half a day, but we walked for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s395">And then we didn't find the others.</span> <span id="s396">The others thought we went in and we are not coming out.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe they killed us, so they ran away.</span> <span id="s398">Nobody from them survived.</span> <span id="s399">Nobody.</span> <span id="s400">And while walking those 2 weeks, we just walked at night, and in the daytime we were afraid.</span> <span id="s401">We met a lot of Partisan groups, and those 2 guys said, "Why don't we join them?"</span> <span id="s402">I said, "If you want to go to the Partisans, you go.</span> <span id="s403">I'm going where I'm supposed to--where I want to go.</span> <span id="s404">And we walked two weeks, 3 days we stayed near the highway just to cross.</span> <span id="s405">There was such a busy, uh, on the highway because the Russians prepared the offensive against the Germans for the Spring, and this was already in October.</span> <span id="s406">And we crossed, and then I went up, and I, I recognized the house, in the dark.</span> <span id="s407">But I knew that his mother lives across the road, so I said, "Let me go in to his mother.</span> <span id="s408">I know she is alone, but, in his house, who knows who can be there."</span> <span id="s409">So, I knocked in the window, and the guy came out and said, "Please don't shoot, don't shoot!"</span> <span id="s410">He thought we are partisans.</span> <span id="s411">And I said, "I'm not shooting.</span> <span id="s412">I just want to know where the owner from this farm is."</span> <span id="s413">I--he said, "Why do you want him?"</span> <span id="s414">I said, "I have something to settle with him."</span> <span id="s415">I couldn’t tell him I want him to take me in.</span> <span id="s416">So, he said, "He doesn't live here.</span> <span id="s417">In the other house lives his old mother, and he lives in the city, which I knew he lives in the city from before the war, but, so we went across, and we're went into the barn, we climbed up, and we laid on that loft upstairs, but nobody came.</span> <span id="s418">We heard babushka going out, feeding the chickens, feeding the cow and nothing.</span> <span id="s419">We stayed there for 3 days, and we got hungry.</span> <span id="s420">So we said, "Soon it will get dark, we'll go to the neighboring village.</span> <span id="s421">Maybe we'll organize some food by, or maybe some...So we went, and we went a few kilometers, and we got a bottle of milk again and a loaf of bread, and some onions, and we started walking back, and we came back, and we climbed up the loft--I'm making it very short you see (laughs)--and, the bottle of milk, the guy, one of the guys left it on, on the floor downstairs, and I said, "Where's the milk?"</span> <span id="s422">He said, "I left it."</span> <span id="s423">It wasn't the bottle of milk, but we were afraid to leave it.</span> <span id="s424">Any traces that people are here.</span> <span id="s425">So, I told him, "Go down, and in the dark, just try to find it."</span> <span id="s426">And as he went down and looked, and I said in Jewish to him, "Did you find it?"</span> <span id="s427">And as I said, "Did you find it?"</span> <span id="s428">like a ghost jumped out from that loft, dressed in white, he said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s429">And then I said, I recognized his voice, and I said, "Erol!"</span> <span id="s430">That was my brother's name, and he said, "You're dead.</span> <span id="s431">You better sit down, and we'll wait."</span> <span id="s432">Took my hand, and we waited until they left.</span> <span id="s433">We didn't talk to each other either.</span> <span id="s434">In the morning, I told him how, where I came, and he, he was there already nine months or ten months, and I told him about the dream, that mother told me to go here, that I will find--she didn't say why, she just said, "You'll survive there."</span> <span id="s435">And, it took probably, so my brother said, "Listen, he had ------------------------ like a floor high----------------, you could climb down underneath the ground, that's how they made him a bunker, underneath the ground, through the cement floor, a hole.</span> <span id="s436">He said, "Let's go in, and when he'll come, I'll tell him that you were sick and one of the men helped you, and the other, won't, we won't say nothing.</span> <span id="s437">Whatever, if he'll take you in, whatever, he'll give us to eat, we'll share it, because 3 might be too many.</span> <span id="s438">So after a few days, he came, and he had a certain whistle that my brother knew it, that the coast is clear.</span> <span id="s439">My brother jumped out, and he said Partisans are looking for him, they want to kill him.</span> <span id="s440">I don't know if I'll be able to bring more food or so, because he used to bring the food from the city, food--bread--and my brother said it's not partisans, it's my sister, but she didn't want to say, so she said, she said, I should come out, when I came out, he just went blinded.</span> <span id="s441">He said, "If God put you all together, we going to try to survive all together."</span> <span id="s442">And that's where I survived with the other 2 men.</span> <span id="s443">I was nine months there.</span> <span id="s444">Without the, without a drop of warm water or cooked food, only bread he used to bring us some onions, some garlic, he claimed that that helps, helped.</span> <span id="s445">Now they come out with the same thing.</span> <span id="s446">Sometimes on the holidays, a little jam with margarine, but he did the best he could.</span> <span id="s447">He did the best he could.</span> <span id="s448">And, I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s449">I mean, he's not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s450">Mom is not alive.</span> <span id="s451">I'm going almost every year to back to Poland to visit the children.</span> <span id="s452">This is already a grandson of his, the one who drove me in.</span> <span id="s453">They all were in the United States.</span> <span id="s454">We, we, they all, we helped them all out, they all have a good education, they all nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">(Sandy says something in background).</span></p> <p><span id="s456">(Long tone).</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Beep.</span></p> <p><span

of the escape, everybody was very nervous and very shaky, but there was no way back.</span> <span id="s461">You had to go.</span> <span id="s462">One pushed the other.</span> <span id="s463">It wasn't easy, but, actually, we didn't have time really to think and sort out our thoughts, but it was, you have to go and you, and you try to survive, even if you hop all over bodies, you don't look back.</span> <span id="s464">You did, everything happened, split second, there was no time to think.</span> <span id="s465">You were afraid, you were scared, you were nervous, you were shaky.</span> <span id="s466">But, you didn't think, just go as far as you can, and those who uh--it was very fortunate for us that the woods were right next--that we were in the woods, and, and the field between the camp and the woods wasn't too big.</span> <span id="s467">That's, y-you know, my legs were like rubbery, they couldn't even run, but I did.</span> <span id="s468">I remember, I grabbed a girl, to hold on, and when it's meant for you to survive, or to live, you have to believe, I'm a strong believer, my, I never gave up my faith, and I grabbed her, Sarah was her name, and she saw that I'm bleeding and I'm, so she pushed me away and she said, "I want to live," a bullet hit her.</span> <span id="s469">It was meant for her to die, it was meant for me to live.</span> <span id="s470">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s471">She wasn't worse than I am.</span> <span id="s472">I wasn't better than she was.</span> <span id="s473">It just, you have to believe, you have to have the faith, because I realize that my faith helped me an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Were there people who betrayed you when you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">No, no, I never had that, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Now let's go back to before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">It's, just one thing I want to add on.</span> <span id="s478">As I ran with all, with my group, after 3 days, 3 nights of walking, we came back to Sobibór, we walked in circles, we didn't know, and then we started all over again, running.</span> <span id="s479">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Let's go back to--let's do one other thing, what happened to Sobibór?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">They erased every tr--they killed all the people who remained there or they ------- them or whatever.</span> <span id="s482">A lot of didn't even go.</span> <span id="s483">They didn't want to, they had given up.</span> <span id="s484">They lost all their families, they just didn't care.</span> <span id="s485">And they erased every trace, they dismantled everything and they planted little pine trees.</span> <span id="s486">You know, it's already going to be soon, 50 years, 49 years that we escaped.</span> <span id="s487">Those pine trees, the way they plant them, they never grew, they're just the same size.</span> <span id="s488">I go back to Sobibór often.</span> <span id="s489">Almost every year now.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Now tell me about before the war, how life changed for you, what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">I remember everything.</span> <span id="s492">I had a very happy life.</span> <span id="s493">We were 2 children.</span> <span id="s494">My father wasn't rich, but he was middle class, comfortable middle class.</span> <span id="s495">I finished public school, I went to business school, and I never finished because the war came.</span> <span id="s496">And I had a big family, lots of cousins and aunts and uncles and, and, besides friends, and I had a very happy life.</span> <span id="s497">And all of the sudden, everything was gone.</span> <span id="s498">And I was left alone.</span> <span id="s499">My father was shot in 1939 when the first unit of SS came into our city.</span> <span id="s500">They picked out--they told the people to report to the main...place there in our city.</span> <span id="s501">The rich people, the not so rich people, the educated people, the, the important people, and, it was six hundred and some, and they shot--my brother went with them, and they shot them all--my brother pretended that he is dead, that he got shot and came back.</span> <span id="s502">That was right away in 1939 in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Tell me the incident where you were in line, and the mistress of the SS ---------.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Yeah, this was, and then they put us in a ghetto in Helm when they make the ghetto.</span> <span id="s505">My mother couldn't live there.</span> <span id="s506">There were another woman and six children, my mother and the two of us in the room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s507">And, the poor, she couldn't take it, she couldn't, so we had family in a small town, not far from the city where I was born, and they wrote us that we should come there, that it's not so bad, and they, they have plenty of room in their house to take us in.</span> <span id="s508">And we moved there--to Silesta??</span> <span id="s509">And we stayed there for about a year.</span> <span id="s510">We moved in 41.</span> <span id="s511">About a year or longer, and there it wasn't really so bad.</span> <span id="s512">I had to go to work every day, to dig ditches.</span> <span id="s513">They wanted to dry, uh, Poland had a lot of swamps, and they wanted to dry up the fields so they can plant more, and the, they were sure they're going to stay there forever.</span> <span id="s514">So I used to go with my brother every day to work, and my mother would remain at home.</span> <span id="s515">We would hide her during the day.</span> <span id="s516">In the evening we would come back, and she would come out of the hiding place, and we stayed together until, uh, 42, October, and it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s517">We worked, we went every day to work, we had enough to eat, not luxuriously , but we weren't hungry, and being my mother was home, she could wash our clothes and help us out.</span> <span id="s518">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s519">And there was in charge, he was a Polack, not a Ukrainian, of our, he was the engineer of the whole project, and one day I noticed that his, he had a girlfriend, which lived in our city, and I knew before the war, very beautiful nice girl, and I used, when she saw me in town, she would say hello, and ask me if I need something, and we became, not friends because, who am I to be a friend to her, but just, like, acquaintances, let's put it this way, and then, from there, from this place, they took us to Stafnovushulke.</span> <span id="s520">And Stafnovushulke was the worst place I ever went except Sobibór.</span> <span id="s521">The conditions were unbearable.</span> <span id="s522">So one day they told us to get our belongings, they gave us a half hour, we were going.</span> <span id="s523">So we went, and we walked ------------, went 12 miles, in October, in the mud, and the--I did, uh, my mother said take this and take this and maybe you'll be able to sell it, and maybe you'll be able to buy something, food or some.</span> <span id="s524">So my brother and I, we had bundles, and I had 2 coats, my mother's coat, a good coat, and my coat, she said, she don't need it right, right now, she has another one, and we walked all that way, the 10-12 kilometers, and we, when we came into Staf, I turned yellow.</span> <span id="s525">Just yellow.</span> <span id="s526">And I was a young girl, 19, 18 and a half.</span> <span id="s527">And they assembled us, and they started picking out, to the left and to the right.</span> <span id="s528">Staf was also a working place.</span> <span id="s529">And, as it came up to me, they put me with the older people, and she was walking around there with her boyfriend with the big German Shepherd, you know, and I said, "Wanda, look at what they did to me."</span> <span id="s530">She said, "Come out."</span> <span id="s531">And I came out, and she took out the lipstick, and she wrote in my cheeks, and she says, "Take off the babushka--I had a babushka to keep warm.</span> <span id="s532">And she pushed me in again in the line.</span> <span id="s533">And as I went by again, they took me out with the young people.</span> <span id="s534">You always felt maybe with the young ones, you have a better chance.</span> <span id="s535">So, I have to say, all through the war, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s536">Luck was with me from the first day out.</span> <span id="s537">I mean, I wasn't lucky that I had to go through what I went through.</span> <span id="s538">But, by being there, I, I was lucky that somehow, somebody lended me always a hand to, to take me out of, of, a dangerous situation.</span> <span id="s539">And, she took me out, and I went in with the young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">We have to change rolls.</span></p> <p><span

id="s545">Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">People like to believe in heroism and people like to believe in humankind.</span> <span id="s547">What does your experience make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">That I tried the best, I wasn't a hero, there were people who were much smarter than I am, and maybe more capable, but I just was at the right place at the right time, and I took advantage.</span> <span id="s549">And, I wouldn't say that I'm a hero.</span> <span id="s550">I just had made my, up my mind that I, I would get out, but, I didn't organize it.</span> <span id="s551">I just was at the right place at the right time, in touch with the right people, and together we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Before the escape and other than the planning together of the escape, were you inmates supportive of one another?</span> <span id="s553">Very much so, very much so.</span> <span id="s554">It's just because we were such a small amount of people.</span> <span id="s555">So we became like a family.</span> <span id="s556">If we knew that this one worked very hard, and needs maybe an extra piece of bread, or a little soup, we shared.</span> <span id="s557">I think the, the relationship in Sobibór was so close, and everybody tried to help the other ones so much, that this helped too.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">And now, can you talk to me a little bit about the age group who survived primarily.</span> <span id="s559">Who were mostly sacrificed?</span> <span id="s560">When you say they young and the old, how old were the old?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">You see, when you're so young like I was, probably 30 was old, or 35, so really, to judge who was old, and who was--there were older people who were professional uh, professionals in certain fields, if it was carpentry or ------------, but I couldn't say, but after the war, I would say half and half survived, when I think older ones and younger ones, was all, I feel it was a matter of luck.</span> <span id="s562">You had to be lucky to survive.</span> <span id="s563">God had to be with you to survive.</span> <span id="s564">It isn't, nothing that you planned, or you were smarter than the next one--I don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Was there spiritual resistance in Sobibór?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Yes, there was a lot of spiritual resistance, and one isn't surprised, and I wasn't surprised either.</span> <span id="s567">When you see day by day how many transports that were being killed for no reason, you start asking questions, "Where is God?"</span> <span id="s568">But there was s-some who believed and it was, don't ask my why, I was a strong believer, don't ask me why, it just was in me, and because I had that faith, I think it was much easier for me than for the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Were you able to pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">I mean, if you prayed you prayed only t-to see the Nazis dead, that was the only prayer you, you prayed.</span> <span id="s571">But, everybody prayed in his own way, I suppose.</span> <span id="s572">Deep down.</span> <span id="s573">Not out loudly.</span> <span id="s574">And there was once uh, you know, Yom Kippur, that's the holiest day of the, by the Jews, and being it was shortly before the date that, that we set for the escape, so they made like services, one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s575">So, the ones who didn't believe and didn't want to go in, they stood guard outside, they respected what we are doing, and they didn't go in, but they helped us.</span> <span id="s576">So, I feel there was a, a great deal of compassion and caring.</span> <span id="s577">There was a great deal of closeness.</span> <span id="s578">There was a great deal of respect for one another.</span> <span id="s579">And there was a great deal that we tried to help each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">And now, can you tell me the story of how when the war first came, your mother described World War One, and what she thought it would be like.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">You see, when the first, when the war came, started, I mean, we didn't, I never saw a war, I never knew what a war was, I was born after the First World War.</span> <span id="s582">And I talked my mother, "How does a war look?</span> <span id="s583">And what's going to happen to us," and so forth, so she said in the first war, what did my mother know?</span> <span id="s584">In the First World War, they were fighting near the railroad station, and they brought up the wounded to the city, she said, and everybody sat in the house.</span> <span id="s585">I don't know how long it took, but they used to go out.</span> <span id="s586">And that's what they said, and my father brought home a lot of groceries, and a lot of flour, and a lot of sugar, and a lot of -------.</span> <span id="s587">He said in case we won't be able to get, we'll have enough to eat, until this thing...will blow over.</span> <span id="s588">But, it wasn't like that.</span> <span id="s589">The first day, when Germany declared war to Poland, they bombed our city.</span> <span id="s590">The Polish army was nothing.</span> <span id="s591">They weren't, they weren't capable to resist anything.</span> <span id="s592">That was a different ballgame.</span> <span id="s593">And then my father realized that, that, with my mother??</span> <span id="s594">we saw the planes fly.</span> <span id="s595">We never saw planes flying before.</span> <span id="s596">In a few days, uh, Poland was gone.</span> <span id="s597">And then the Russians came to us.</span> <span id="s598">Because they had some kind of an agreement that the Russians would go to, to Warsaw, or whatever they had the agreement, and the Russians came, and, and, we had the Russian officer sleeping in our house because he was in charge of the bakery from the man who saved our life, and he came to us and he said, "Listen, you better pack up everything and take your children."</span> <span id="s599">When they made a new agreement that the Russians go back to the River Buch, and the Germans come in here, and he said, "In, in Russia, your children can study, they can become something, you'll be all right.</span> <span id="s600">The Germans are going to do to you awful things."</span> <span id="s601">But nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s602">Who, who believed that they'll come and kill us?</span> <span id="s603">They'll gas 6, 3 and a half million people only in Poland?</span> <span id="s604">You're dreaming?</span> <span id="s605">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s606">Nobody thought that something like this can happen.</span> <span id="s607">But it happened.</span> <span id="s608">First they came and attacked.</span> <span id="s609">I mean, they were so efficient in their killings, you know, and I think, I think they still are--first a Nazi, always a Nazi.</span> <span id="s610">I don't believe that they're any different.</span> <span id="s611">I went to so many trials in Germany, and the only thing that hurted me the most, that nobody from those murderers said, "It was wrong, what we did.</span> <span id="s612">We shouldn't have done it."</span> <span id="s613">Everybody followed orders.</span> <span id="s614">And I feel, if somebody would come today, and give them orders, they would do all over again, without hesitation.</span> <span id="s615">And that hurts.</span> <span id="s616">That hurts very much.</span> <span id="s617">Especially when, when I went to the first trials, and the judges were older gentlemen, or older people, one Nazi defended the other.</span> <span id="s618">And I feel that, that's why it's so important.</span> <span id="s619">It shouldn't be forgotten.</span> <span id="s620">It shouldn't be forgotten because it can happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">(Can't hear question).</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Whenever I go to sleep, all of Sobibór comes back.</span> <span id="s623">And the worst part was, after the war, if I said, told somebody I was in Sobibór, never heard it, never heard it, never heard it.</span> <span

other death camps or slave labor camps were liberated by the army, with, with, uh, the ----------, with all the press, and, and the world knew Sobibór, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s631">If I told them after the war, there was a Sobibór, never heard of it, and never heard of it, and that hurted me so much because I thought it would just be forgotten.</span> <span id="s632">It will go away.</span> <span id="s633">If not for Richard Drosky, who found a footnote in the library when they arrested Wagner in Brazil, and he took the story, and he worked on it, and he interviewed people, and he put in his money, and he wrote a book.</span> <span id="s634">The book opened the eyes that there was a Sobibór, and that people, that was the biggest uh, uprising in the history of the World War Two.</span> <span id="s635">Why not tell it?</span> <span id="s636">And thanks to him, Sobibór came out, the story came out, the world knows what's happened, and, and it's written about it, and people, uh, and the book is translated to so many languages, and children learn in school thanks to that.</span> <span id="s637">Otherwise Sobibór would have been forgotten.</span></p> <p><span
