id="s12">My name is Israel Ipson.</span> <span id="s13">I've been born in Lithuanian in 1911, March 15th, 1911.</span> <span id="s14">And my father was a worker, worked in the brewery.</span> <span id="s15">The brewery was in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s16">Why is it the brewery was in a place in Slobodka?</span> <span id="s17">You know, the Lithuanians didn't want to have the industry, what coming up, to the Lithuanians, that they should have it.</span> <span id="s18">The Jews were not allowed to go to work in Kovno, which Kovno was the capital city of Lithuania, so we had to go to work in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s19">Slobodka was a suburb.</span> <span id="s20">In Slobodka lives around 10,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s21">Mostly the poor.</span> <span id="s22">They didn't have nothing to eat, and it was a pity.</span> <span id="s23">For where I come from a very, very poor family.</span> <span id="s24">My grandfather worked in the brewery with Golswolf Ingleman (ph).</span> <span id="s25">My father worked in the brewery.</span> <span id="s26">My unclealmost everybody in the poor Jews in Lithuanian worked for the brewery.</span> <span id="s27">Why?</span> <span id="s28">The owner from the brewery was the Wolfs, Wolf brothers.</span> <span id="s29">There were six brothers.</span> <span id="s30">The family were the Wolfs, and they were a very philanthropic family.</span> <span id="s31">And they support the Jews.</span> <span id="s32">How?</span> <span id="s33">They build the brewery, and everybody almost work for the brewery.</span> <span id="s34">They also invent a timeused to be a time where full of snowing.</span> <span id="s35">In Lithuanian is a lot of full of snow, and they used to be covered up and drowned in snow.</span> <span id="s36">Was sending in with horses for the brewery to get the people, bring them back to the place of work.</span> <span id="s37">That's how heavy the snow it was.</span> <span id="s38">And my father was liked by the brewmeister (ph).</span> <span id="s39">The brewmeister was a German from Bavaria, and he was his helper.</span> <span id="s40">Anythingthe war got to benow my father used to do in the brewery, the brewmeister done only sit and got the taste of the beer, the color.</span> <span id="s41">I remember father used toI used to bring my father lunch every day.</span> <span id="s42">My mother used to send me potato sweet herring.</span> <span id="s43">It would want that my father should be thirsty, be able to drink the beer and save the tune for the beer, they call it.</span> <span id="s44">And the pilsner and all the names, they funny.</span> <span id="s45">And it's the way the poor Jews in Slobodka, they make their living.</span> <span id="s46">Later on when Lithuania become an independent nation run by a school teacher, or the name Smetona, he gave the Jews more right.</span> <span id="s47">What he done, he brought the Jews away from the brewery.</span> <span id="s48">The brewery was filled with , but it opened up more industries to the Lithuanians to make him happy.</span> <span id="s49">Smetona was a smartverywas such a nice man.</span> <span id="s50">Tried to help also the Jews to participate in the industry.</span> <span id="s51">It shouldn't be any fights between the Jews and the Lithuanians, try to avoid it.</span> <span id="s52">But still after, there's still was plenty bad feeling between one and the other.</span> <span id="s53">And what has happened, the biggest problem I think what it was, the Lithuanians start taking outthe German took the Lithuanian out and send them to camps to work.</span> <span id="s54">They also, the Russians, the communists, was being picked, like the school teachers, manufacturers, the richer element of people, they used to be sent to Siberia, blaming them for the things which not happened.</span> <span id="s55">But also the Jews didn't knew nothing about it, but they should be saying that the Jews kill their own, that take no other Lithuanians to Siberia.</span> <span id="s56">Siberia was athe camp, a labor camp.</span> <span id="s57">It is a very, very, very miserable place to be.</span> <span id="s58">But mostly 90 percent from the people who be sent to Siberia been dead because they didn't seem to come back alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Question: What era are you talking about right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A:Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q:When you're talking about the Germans and the communists, what year are you talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A:Oh, it was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q:You're talking later?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s66">Let's go back a little.</span> <span id="s67">And I want to ask you a little bit more about your family life as a boy, your religious background.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A:Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:Just the lifestyle in Slobodka.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A:Right.</span> <span id="s71">Well, I was also came in time when we didn't have any telephones; we didn't have any lights.</span> <span id="s72">I used to go in school they call it.</span> <span id="s73">What was theever was the old person, knowledgeable, been pitching for pay to the boys to go to hayda (ph), we used to call it.</span> <span id="s74">And at the hayda we used to come in and stay there until, in wintertime, 7:00, 8:00 o'clock at night until it get dark and bring them home.</span> <span id="s75">And that was our education to people.</span> <span id="s76">Like my wife was just saying, she speaks good Jewish, the Jewish language.</span> <span id="s77">The Jewish language was a language from childhood you got it up.</span> <span id="s78">And I had two rabbis, because one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewish.</span> <span id="s79">And then we had in Slobodka a rabbinical seminary.</span> <span id="s80">The biggest rabbinical seminary in the world, because in that time, in 1914,17, the only thing they knew is to learn the bible.</span> <span id="s81">The people was poor.</span> <span id="s82">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s83">They were sitting there all day long in the seera (ph), they call it, it is a rabbinical seminary.</span> <span id="s84">And people from all over the world would be sending their youth to that seminary in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s85">It was not only later onthe later years grew up, it was with their also young kids been going there to teach to become a rabbi.</span> <span id="s86">But it is reallythe big leaving to be a rabbi at that time, they couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s87">They couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s88">But they been supported by the American people, even in World`War`I.</span> <span id="s89">They already been sending help to the Jews in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s90">The chief rabbis used to come in here and in speeches speaking through the American Jew to help the Jews in Slobodka, because all it be these weddings used to come between rabbis andand then the rabbi had a daughter who had got to get married, used to take along with him the comment of a trip to America and findgo to the seera to pick a boka (ph), to pick a learning young man that they should get married and been supported by the Jews in America.</span> <span id="s91">It was a tradition to help the orthodox.</span> <span id="s92">And it is still right now in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s93">The seera is in existence now in Israel.</span> <span id="s94">They know more in Slobodka, but after the war they move the chief rabbi, moved him to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q:So your boyhood was very involved with religious learning and</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A:Right.</span> <span id="s97">And then I wasafter the learning, the religious learning, I went in high`school.</span> <span id="s98">It became the Jews decided to open up a hipper (ph) high`school.</span> <span id="s99">And it became the Germans in 1917 they had a lot of educated people in the army and they decided to stay in Lithuanian to teach us, and then we had enough people to get a private school going.</span> <span id="s100">And it was like one famous teacher, Karlbah (ph), and hein his name was created a high`school, and it called Karlbah .</span> <span id="s101">And then we had also in the Russian language a high`school.</span> <span id="s102">And we had in Lithuanian we had three high`schools.</span> <span id="s103">And then we had the orthodox school was in Kovno.</span> <span id="s104">And everybody been happy until Hitler come to being.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s106">Whattell me a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s107">Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:I haveI had two sistersdidn't have any brothersand they perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s109">And one was married, and the other one was still a girl.</span> <span id="s110">She was married, but she was a famoushow you call it?</span> <span id="s111">Painting.</span> <span id="s112">She was a oil painting.</span> <span id="s113">She had a name.</span> <span id="s114">They ask her to come to Paris, and she was staying for three months in Paris and learning the painting guys.</span> <span id="s115">She come back with the famous paint pieces and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q:Do you have memories of your family life together?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A:Oh, I have, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q:Nice family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A:Very nice.</span> <span id="s120">Well, we been all together until I married.</span> <span id="s121">I was staying home with my parents.</span> <span id="s122">And my father, he was a orthodox Jew, and everythingwe used to come to holidays.</span> <span id="s123">We took it together, like the Passover holidays, the high holidays, and we been meet together.</span> <span id="s124">Everybody would come.</span> <span id="s125">And the womanit was orthodox fashion, the prayer separate.</span> <span id="s126">They have a separation between men and woman.</span> <span id="s127">But that reminds me different moments that theyI don't know what you call it.</span> <span id="s128">A helper who helps the synagogue.</span> <span id="s129">Summis (ph), is that how you call it?</span> <span id="s130">Hell.</span> <span id="s131">I'll have to skip it.</span> <span id="s132">I don't know how to say in English.</span> <span id="s133">They call them a specialused to go out on every Friday night and say, "Jews, you got to close the stores.</span> <span id="s134">There's all this coming around.</span> <span id="s135">Don't do any business anymore."</span> <span id="s136">So someone got to stop them, and they used to stop it.</span> <span id="s137">But everything was fine until 2042 when the war started with Hitler and Stalin and Churchill.</span> <span id="s138">I used to like to listen to the shortwave radio.</span> <span id="s139">And the Jews which was locked up in the ghetto, we used to come to my place where I lived to hear what's going on in the fronts.</span> <span id="s140">Well, how is Hitler doing?</span> <span id="s141">Well, Hitler is winning the war or losing the war?</span> <span id="s142">And we was very interested in this.</span> <span id="s143">They come from my working place, which was the airport, and talking till the group, which used to come to listen to me, what's happened on the front, how Hitler is doing.</span> <span id="s144">And they used to come up.</span> <span id="s145">To explain the truth, I was already scared.</span> <span id="s146">They could lock me up and find out about it, because if you were a Kraut.</span> <span id="s147">And I be begging them they shouldn't come no more, becauseand Ithey didn't have a place nowhere to go, and they stillI said, "Tell them it's very important."</span> <span id="s148">And they were very interested, like they would be generals, they used to tell me.</span> <span id="s149">One would sit here this way and one would sit that way, and they knew what they were talking about and they been leading the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s151">Let'sI don't want to get quite there yet.</span> <span id="s152">I still want a few more questions about before the war began; okay?</span></p>

he got to go in court who working for five years.</span> <span id="s169">After the five years working in the court, he can practice law.</span> <span id="s170">I didn't have no choice, but I still did not have any choice.</span> <span id="s171">I couldn't get in to work in the court, because they answerwhen I used to send application to the courts and ask them for a job in court, to open it up that I should be able to become a lawyer, the answer used to be all the time, "Sorry.</span> <span id="s172">We don't have any vacancies.</span> <span id="s173">We cannot help you."</span> <span

farm country, like 87 percent of the Lithuanians was farmer.</span> <span id="s194">Then they didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s195">And now already the countries likelike now the Balkans, already they are Czechoslovakia started in their time, Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s196">Here no one with fighting with all that stuff.</span> <span id="s197">And Hitler's told this Czechoslovakian,

Hitler and half Stalin.</span> <span id="s211">And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have nothing but what we had in the bank.</span> <span id="s212">We lost everything.</span> <span id="s213">Stalin took away all the few pennies which we got it together.</span> <span id="s214">And I went on a trip to Belgium because of the fact that they asked me.</span> <span id="s215">They want I should could come there.</span> <span id="s216">They want to talk with me about a new contract.</span> <span id="s217">Because I am doing good and all that, I had to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s218">And I came in Berlin.</span> <span id="s219">I have relatives.</span> <span id="s220">My mother had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s221">And the

I should became a doctor and she should give me a room in her house.</span> <span id="s223">Well, and nothing could be worked out with all that, with all the woman.</span> <span id="s224">And then in 1939, September 8th, I was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s225">I was in Belgium to the factory.</span> <span id="s226">I was making a contract for the Karmann Ghia.</span> <span id="s227">Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s228">You heard about Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s229">It was the night of Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s230">I didn't know for nothing.</span> <span id="s231">I came, and mother told me and say I should take for her aunt a kilo bada (ph) and to take somea few cheese, and she felt sorry for you, poor relatives they had.</span> <span id="s232">But I took it with me and gave it to them, to my mother's aunt, and I run in not knowingly in the Holocaust in thenot in the Holocaust, in the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s233">What meansKristallnacht means crystal, breaking windows, breaking in, the burning stores.</span> <span id="s234">Was a tremendous big store I wasbefore the war I used to go there, and in house father owned in Germany.</span> <span id="s235">And in that store I used toanythingthey used to markanybody who wants to make money gets $5 when he comes in herein Israel and goes to the colby (ph) storeand go in the store and ask for a product and can't find it, gets 5 mark.</span> <span id="s236">A premium for that.</span> <span id="s237">That's how proud they were with each other.</span> <span id="s238">And it was the next year I came there, but it was when it was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s239">All ready all over the streets "Juden Traboden" (ph) for the Jews, the Jews not welcome.</span> <span id="s240">The Jews cannot come no more into the store.</span> <span id="s241">So we didn't go there no more, because they took away the cars from the Jews and they took away the businesses, took away the bank accounts.</span> <span id="s242">Anything they had, they lost it.</span> <span id="s243">Then we stopped going.</span> <span id="s244">And then HitlerI mean Churchill used toon shortwave radio used to and tell Stalin, "Be careful, Stalin, you're going to lose your head."</span> <span id="s245">And then, "Your good friend Stalin is getting prepared to fight you."</span> <span id="s246">And this was Ribbentrop.</span> <span id="s247">Stalin sent his secretary of state Ribbentrop andno, the Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent Molitof (ph).</span> <span id="s248">Molitof was for Stalin.</span> <span id="s249">They had been getting together one against the other keepingthey didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and started World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q:Let me ask you a few personal questions here.</span> <span id="s251">You saw what was going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q:You went back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s254">Did you have any sense that the life you had in Lithuania would change so dramatically?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A:No.</span> <span id="s256">We hadWe had a feeling thatbut to kill people, that the Lithuanians would kill Jews.</span> <span id="s257">Friends which have been with all our life, which I have been staying with them going through law school, I couldn't imagine that that should happen like that.</span> <span id="s258">It was unbelievable, that we didn't evenI had a big opportunity to go, but I was already married.</span> <span id="s259">I had a little child.</span> <span id="s260">Jay was four at that time, and Imy hand was tied.</span> <span id="s261">I still say, oh, it still not so bad.</span> <span id="s262">It still only right now who is closed (ph) is the poor little Jews, and the poor little Jews used to come to Lithuanian to find a place of where to hide, where to live.</span> <span id="s263">And I was in that time a young lawyer.</span> <span id="s264">I still could take cases, but Ibut they used to come to me.</span> <span id="s265">They open up a office in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s266">Vilnius is the capital city of Poland right now, too.</span> <span id="s267">And I've been working out with them papers that they should be able to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s268">The only place that was open for the Jews to go in that time was for Japan, and everybody was running.</span> <span id="s269">But they had to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s270">And they find out

going away in Moscow.</span> <span id="s343">Hitler been pushing Stalin, that he wants to take Moscow and didn't have no airport.</span> <span id="s344">That's why they got to have a place to let the planes go, and that's what he started with pushing strong.</span> <span id="s345">But Moscow was saved by the Siberiacs (ph), they call it, small, little people.</span> <span id="s346">They were mean, and they were ones who stopped Hitler by 15 miles from Moscow.</span> <span id="s347">Couldn't move.</span> <span id="s348">And that's why they start losing with Stalingrad and start losing the

was on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s359">We all run out in the streets.</span> <span id="s360">It was 5:00 o'clock in the morning, and we didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s361">We waswe getpeople got so lost.</span> <span id="s362">They was running like wild.</span> <span id="s363">Run into me, "What you going to do?"</span> <span id="s364">Run into them, "What you going to do?</span> <span id="s365">Are you going by train?</span> <span id="s366">Are you going by boat?</span> <span id="s367">How are you going to run away?"</span> <span id="s368">People got confused.</span> <span id="s369">You wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s370">You know, "What's happening?"</span> <span id="s371">Hitler dropped two bombs.</span> <span id="s372">One bomb they dropped right over the railroad bridge.</span> <span id="s373">It's they wanted the bridge to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s374">Another one they dropped right by Slobodka.</span> <span id="s375">There was a big field, that' what all the selection was, those who live and those who die.</span> <span id="s376">Thenthen people didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s377">And I was working in that time in the transportation company.</span> <span id="s378">Worked with the transportation horse and buggies.</span> <span id="s379">Around 50 horse and buggies, I don't know, got together, and I was their secretary, organized the horse and buggy transportation committee, and we made a living from that.</span> <span id="s380">It's as long you were a tail (ph), you went in the system from Stalin, Stalin was happy.</span> <span id="s381">Then he didn't bother us that we made a living.</span> <span id="s382">As soon as Stalin used to come with the all kind of directions, you already lost.</span> <span id="s383">You had troubles.</span> <span id="s384">And then when the in that time we had a week without a government.</span> <span id="s385">You see, even the Germans, the murderers, couldn't take it no more when they find out what the Germansthe Lithuanians doing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s386">They made pogroms.</span> <span id="s387">You know what a pogrom is?</span> <span id="s388">They been attacking them.</span> <span id="s389">And if you had a street, you would go.</span> <span id="s390">You will go the long street, go from the bridge going on the waythere was a way going you could go to Moscow.</span> <span id="s391">If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I can understand.</span> <span id="s392">But here, they are going with little children, pushing children's carts, pushing to Moscow.</span> <span id="s393">But from Moscowfrom Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and they going with horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s394">And they'll never can reach there, because here was already flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing people in the street.</span> <span id="s395">You could see here, boom, right lane already send people been killed going to Moscow.</span> <span id="s396">They couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s397">You had to turn around and go back home.</span> <span id="s398">We had no choice.</span> <span id="s399">And I had a little girl, a little girl who was three months old.</span> <span id="s400">I had to go with girl, and I had a horse and buggy, but the copper wheels they had before they were, and it wasn't.</span> <span id="s401">I was the ownerthe , not the owner.</span> <span id="s402">The owner was Stalin.</span> <span id="s403">And I went there and I took him.</span> <span id="s404">There was nobody.</span> <span id="s405">"Where is the manager?"</span> <span id="s406">The manager took also one and he run away.</span> <span id="s407">Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on the way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I had to turn around and go back.</span> <span id="s408">Then I go in back, Edna tells memy wife tells me, "I got to have milk for the girl."</span> <span id="s409">I went out to the farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me some milk.</span> <span id="s410">They sold me some milk.</span> <span id="s411">And they said, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s412">I say, "I am going to Kaunas."</span> <span id="s413">"Don't go," they tell me, "Don't go.</span> <span id="s414">They're killing Jews, and they going to kill you.</span> <span id="s415">You stay away from this road."</span> <span id="s416">The farmerI was luckythey told me.</span> <span id="s417">And I told to Edna, I say, "You know, Edna, we better go with the bad streets, second way road, not to go with the highway.</span> <span id="s418">The highway we'll go, we'll get running in with the people taking to the fortress where they're killing Jews.</span> <span id="s419">Isn't that the waywe start going to the worser place.</span> <span id="s420">Not to go for the highway, but to go where the secondsecond grade road.</span> <span id="s421">And that saved our life.</span> <span id="s422">And we came in Slobodka.</span> <span id="s423">I see my fatheror my grandfather and Edna's fatherEdna's was the second, her mother married twicegoing in front of us.</span> <span id="s424">I saygoing face run into us.</span> <span id="s425">I say, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s426">"Are you survived?</span> <span id="s427">Gosh, you're lucky."</span> <span id="s428">And I looked at Edna's father.</span> <span id="s429">His hair is white.</span> <span id="s430">He was a black‑headed man, and he looked terrible.</span> <span id="s431">I say, "What's happened?"</span> <span id="s432">He said, "Don't ask.</span> <span id="s433">There isthey're still laying."</span> <span id="s434">He said, "Last night they killed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s435">They kill the blacksmith," whom I know, "and the printer," whom I know.</span> <span id="s436">The man from the Zionist organization, they killed him.</span> <span id="s437">They killedfrom house to house they been walking and kill now Jews the street.</span> <span id="s438">Killed close to a hundred people.</span> <span id="s439">And like it was terrible.</span> <span id="s440">I went up in the attic and looked a little.</span> <span id="s441">All along the killed people laying in the back of the street.</span> <span id="s442">And next day they went running, the Lithuanians, from house to house picking a group of murdered people, and the cemetery wasn't too far, and they bury them and in probably grave.</span> <span id="s443">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s444">Since then, I decide not to go out even for the street, and I don't know it's interested.</span> <span id="s445">I don't know.</span> <span id="s446">It was verya very religious man came to me.</span> <span id="s447">Before the war was a famous rabbi, Rabbi Itrac Elholan (ph).</span> <span id="s448">They have here a lot of seminars in that man's name.</span> <span id="s449">He was a very, very, high educated, religious man.</span> <span id="s450">Called him Itrac Elholan.</span> <span id="s451">And his assistant, assistant rabbi, the assistant rabbi came to me.</span> <span id="s452">I was home, and he tell me I got to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s453">I said, "I got to help the Jews?</span> <span id="s454">What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s455">He said, "You got see Jordan.</span> <span id="s456">We got now a Gestapo lieutenant.</span> <span id="s457">He's terrible, killing all the people."</span> <span id="s458">I say, "What you mean?</span> <span id="s459">He say, "He's in charge over the Jews, and it's all give the right to the Lithuanians, do with the Jews what you want.</span> <span id="s460">Kill them.</span> <span id="s461">Do them.</span> <span id="s462">We want to liquidate the Jews people."</span> <span id="s463">That's what he say.</span> <span id="s464">I say, "What do you want from me?"</span> <span id="s465">He say, "You had when you were in your younger days," he tells me about this story of Esther in the bible.</span> <span id="s466">You know, Esther.</span> <span id="s467">You know Esther.</span> <span id="s468">And Esther also went to Ahasuerus, to the king, and to Babylonians, and asked mercy for the Jews then, and they survived.</span> <span id="s469">Haman was the murderer, the one to kill all the Jews, but Esther saved their life.</span> <span id="s470">And it what he want now.</span> <span id="s471">I got here in ghetto now such a beautiful girl and her husband, and she's willing to go and talk to Jordan he should save the Jews, not to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s472">And she don't care about her life.</span> <span id="s473">They can kill her.</span> <span id="s474">She's going.</span> <span id="s475">"What you want now?"</span> <span id="s476">"And now I want you"that I should go and talk with Jordan, the German lieutenant that was in charge, and ask him for mercy to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s477">Well, I say "Yeah, but the girl does it, and let's find out.</span> <span id="s478">"Yeah," I say, "I'll do it."</span> <span id="s479">I went, and I almost got killed right by his door.</span> <span id="s480">You see, I open up the door.</span> <span id="s481">I went into his office, and he say, "What you doing?</span> <span id="s482">What you want?"</span> <span id="s483">I say, "I got to speak to you."</span> <span id="s484">And I tell (ph) him with his title, andGestapo title, and he jump to his gun and grabbed the gun and start shoot.</span> <span id="s485">And he start shooting.</span> <span id="s486">I run, and I took off right behind the building and come back in ghetto.</span> <span id="s487">I was lucky that that thing was cold, because in that time I seenwe had a sexton in by the Gestapo building, what they call it?</span> <span id="s488">What it was La Tucas (ph).</span> <span id="s489">That is Ukus (ph) means let the Lithuanian Ukus, th crown department from the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s490">And I come running, and theyI see in there, they put in Jews right in that La Tucas gate.</span> <span id="s491">There is a big yard surrounded with the wire, barbed wire, and they put that place on fire.</span> <span id="s492">And the stays and go, and put it by the match and blew up the place.</span> <span id="s493">And didn't the people to run out to save their life.</span> <span id="s494">They didn't let us go, just stay and shooting them.</span> <span id="s495">And they been catching Jews in the street and taking them to jail.</span> <span id="s496">They call the a jail.</span> <span id="s497">They call it tomb.</span> <span id="s498">They're packed up.</span> <span id="s499">The jail full.</span> <span id="s500">And here it was for a month in jail.</span> <span id="s501">I was lucky to get out because I had a pack of cigarettes, but I have to give one cigarette at a time to certain people to see how to move out from the jail.</span> <span id="s502">I got out of jail and come back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q:How long were you in the jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A:A month.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q:A whole month?</span> <span id="s506">Your family, did theydid you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A:No, I didn't see them, but I didn't have no choice ofI trying to go in there when I could.</span> <span id="s508">But then it would start I signed up for to work at the airport.</span> <span id="s509">I work at theI will be agreeable to work at the airport, they could let me out from jail.</span> <span id="s510">But what's the thing, the Jewish people that were afraid to go to work.</span> <span id="s511">And the airport was the worsest working place where the person can gethow the ghetto exist?</span> <span id="s512">The ghetto been existing from cabbage, what the Germans been giving the Jews for working for the airport.</span> <span id="s513">The airport was a company, a German company, by the name of Mole (ph), Mole Company.</span> <span id="s514">Mole Company to cover the building of fixing up that airport that they should have a place where to come down with the planes.</span> <span id="s515">And they used to have a rough time to get workers.</span> <span id="s516">Jews didn't want towant to work.</span> <span id="s517">They did not get nothing to eat and didn't get any place to work.</span> <span id="s518">They say they're better one to get killed.</span> <span id="s519">They don't want to go at airport.</span> <span id="s520">That's what the wife tell before.</span> <span id="s521">And they decide not to go to work.</span> <span id="s522">So Jordan came himself one early morning and startand it was the four Jews.</span> <span id="s523">They evading the place where not to go to work, and he kill all the four without even asking, nothing.</span> <span id="s524">They didn't done a thing.</span> <span id="s525">But he want to scare the Jews when they gave the order to go to work to airportand at airport doesn't mean nothingthey got to go to work.</span> <span id="s526">And then they made no choice, got to go to the airport.</span> <span id="s527">Go to the airport to work was no picnic.</span> <span id="s528">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s529">It's what I say.</span> <span id="s530">They used to give us a lunch, cabbage with water.</span> <span id="s531">Once a month that's the little slice of meat, but it was horse meat.</span> <span id="s532">They used to bring dead horses, killing them, and give them to the Jews for meat.</span> <span id="s533">It wasit was a terrible.</span> <span id="s534">But you didn't have no choice.</span> <span id="s535">I lost two fingers.</span> <span id="s536">I've been staying and workingthe way they do it to make the airport, to build the airport, they been bringing gravel and put it in full for the farmer to bring in so many buckets of gravel, and put the gravel on top, and putting the 12‑feet highno, it was 12they had 12‑feet high.</span> <span id="s537">No, 36.</span> <span id="s538">It was I say 36 feet tall wooden block, and then on top of the gravel, and it would make a hard surface, a hard bottom that the planes, the German planes, should be able to come.</span> <span id="s539">And they stopped up to 15 miles from Moscow.</span> <span id="s540">And it was the night when I decide I better go to the airport to work.</span> <span id="s541">I don't want to go to work no more brigade, we'd be packagea package house.</span> <span id="s542">We'd be withall the Jews will be with me, too.</span> <span id="s543">And I told Edna and I say, "Edna, I cannotI am going to the airport."</span> <span id="s544">And her father tells me, "I am going with you, too," and one of her brothers.</span> <span id="s545">Three of us, we went to work for the airport.</span> <span id="s546">And every time in the morning, 7:00 o'clock in the morning, we used to come trucks, loading us up on trucks, and taking it to the airport.</span> <span id="s547">And then we doing the all‑day work until 9:00, 10:00 o'clock at night, because they been pushing hard.</span> <span id="s548">They needed the airport it should start function.</span> <span id="s549">And that what we been happy.</span> <span id="s550">Happy was nothing to eat, but better than nothing.</span> <span id="s551">Airport was .</span> <span id="s552">We had a uncle, a farmer, and it was a rich farmer, because he had the cattle and he had the horses.</span> <span id="s553">And the farmer, a neighbor of his, he used to come to him to his mother.</span> <span id="s554">Old, old woman.</span> <span id="s555">She was in the 80s.</span> <span id="s556">Come in to her and say, "Youngkalova (ph)," it was her name, "how is?"</span> <span

horse.</span> <span id="s564">We don't have a horse to work.</span> <span id="s565">They are filled."</span> <span id="s566">He'd been helping everyone, and they didn't forgot it.</span> <span id="s567">You see, people nowadays think when they head in the right direction, you bringyou can teach him into be a murderer, and he'll become a murderer.</span> <span id="s568">You can also at the same time to teach them to be become a rabbi, and he can be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s569">It's like now we have it in Israel, Rabin.</span> <span id="s570">Yeah, it'syou can't blame everything on the murderer.</span> <span id="s571">The murderer been brought up maybe the wrong way with the .</span> <span id="s572">And I be saying it all the time.</span> <span id="s573">It's wrong, we been going in the wrong direction.</span> <span id="s574">Well, well, then got tothen I am going anddecide that to stay at the airport a long time, not so hot.</span> <span id="s575">I amit's a very bad

go in and fight, and start fighting with all that mess.</span> <span id="s671">Even I have a lot of people who I knew very well, with whom I went to the school together.</span> <span id="s672">Here's Golub.</span> <span id="s673">You maybe heard.</span> <span id="s674">You got ityou talk yesterday here about a book he wrote about a ghetto, ghetto day by day, and he's become now

get on that quite yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A:Right.</span> <span id="s701">I know what you</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q:I want to ask you a lot more about the ghetto life.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q:And we have a few more minutes on this tape, so should I just ask you some</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s707">When youwhen the ghetto was formed, you were already living in that area or you had to move?</span> <span id="s708">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A:No.</span> <span id="s710">I was living already in that area.</span> <span id="s711">I forgot it.</span> <span id="s712">What the biggest problem, it's what's should come up and I forgot to mention to talk, and I got to talk now, is the selections, left and right, who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s713">I got to go over that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q:Yeah, we'll get to all of that.</span> <span id="s715">But I'm just tryinglet's go back a little bit to the summer of 1941 and how the ghetto came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A:Right.</span> <span id="s717">Well, after the pograms and after the Lithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they decide, the Germans, to get over, and the Germans start get bringing more to order, because they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went, they'll never accomplish nothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and bad for the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s718">They gotthey got to get it straight, and it's what they started to straighten them up.</span> <span id="s719">And then we decided to run out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s720">One night I got Jay ready and talked to Edna, talk to him a couple times.</span> <span id="s721">But he was a kid, five years.</span> <span id="s722">I got to get him in his mind that he should listen, because we were afraid to take and do something.</span> <span id="s723">And the only way we could take him out from the ghetto was to put him inin the small ghetto was a place where they runpeople been running out from the small ghetto to the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s724">And that's the way they survived, together they run out in the part of Lithuania in the fields, in the woods.</span> <span id="s725">Oh, but Hitler decided he got to kill every one, and Himmler gave the victory order to get the Jews locked up and get rid of them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they got to kill them.</span> <span id="s726">The first thing they done is get a order that the Jews not allowed to walk the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s727">They got to use the gutter.</span> <span id="s728">They walk in the gutter.</span> <span id="s729">The Jews, the second decreeHitler was in Golub's book, I think, saying the same thing.</span> <span id="s730">The second degree was when the Jews got to wear the star of David on the front and in the back.</span> <span id="s731">Why on both sides when the one side would be enough?</span> <span id="s732">They say, no, when they see a Jew they got to kill him.</span> <span id="s733">That is a point where they set up the shotgun or the rifle tostar of David, to kill him.</span> <span id="s734">And a Jew doesn't have the right to have a car.</span> <span id="s735">They took away the cars from them.</span> <span id="s736">A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary, to have an accountant to work for him.</span> <span id="s737">Nothing.</span> <span id="s738">And it was rough.</span> <span id="s739">Butand the Jewand the main thing, they got to go to work at the airport.</span> <span id="s740">And we'll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mrning every day and take them to the airport to work.</span> <span id="s741">And it was also the airport there to work.</span> <span id="s742">It's Jordan, he was the one in that time.</span> <span id="s743">He was Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was his assistant.</span> <span id="s744">And Avraham Tory worked also with the same Miller.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q:Iunfortunately I have to stop you because the tape is finished; so we need to change the tape and then begin again.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s750">I just wanted to clarify a few points you made earlier.</span> <span id="s751">You talked about trying to get out of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able to get horses and buggies and all of this, even though it didn't work.</span> <span id="s752">Why isdid everybody have that opportunity?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A:No.</span> <span id="s754">You see, when the waron a Sunday morning, the Germans were commencing to drop two bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s755">And they were what scared the living out of many people.</span> <span id="s756">This special bomb must be such a blast that everybody not run outfall out from bed and come running out outside.</span> <span id="s757">And didn't know what to do, had the people like crazy.</span> <span id="s758">It maybe was thousand people in the street waiting for a solution.</span> <span id="s759">Somebody said "Help them."</span> <span id="s760">Even it got so confused is when the younger couples who was, where they only had to go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s761">The communists kept a train at the train station for almost a full day begging everybody to go in the train and go to Moscow.</span> <span id="s762">They want tothey are willing to carry them to Moscow, and the train was staying there.</span> <span id="s763">And they wait and they didn't go and they didn't use their opportunity and they got killed.</span> <span id="s764">You see, other ones went with horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s765">Where they got the horse and buggy?</span> <span id="s766">They had a cooperative, a cooperative, to tell the Russian people.</span> <span id="s767">They had to tell what all the private horse and buggy people.</span> <span id="s768">Like I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners.</span> <span id="s769">The horse and buggy they want only to belong to the cooperative, because they were afraid for the Russians.</span> <span id="s770">They say whothose who work, those who eat.</span> <span id="s771">And they were so scared that they don't go get any food, that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation cooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work.</span> <span id="s772">And work, what they made a living out of it.</span> <span id="s773">And how is me by being educated?</span> <span id="s774">And I got my two uncles, three uncles, right in the board of that cooperation.</span> <span id="s775">Through their influence, I been accepted on the job to be their bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s776">Then I went carrying their books, and I got calls, people been calling in.</span> <span id="s777">They want to bringthey found each other, they want to bring up a safe on first floor, on the second floor, all that kind of work.</span> <span id="s778">They used to call mein.</span> <span id="s779">I used to give it all to the dispatchers, and they used to do the work.</span> <span id="s780">And then it's the way we've been working with the transportation.</span> <span id="s781">With me, if you had a place like a stable, a lot stable, which we kept about 30 horses with wagons, and people were running to that place there for a horse and the wagon.</span> <span id="s782">They go off with the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s783">Was going to Moscow, going to save himself in Moscow.</span> <span id="s784">Going 1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s785">They didn't realize they what foolishness they were trying to do, but when a person is scared and the devil is after him and chasing him, they don't have no choice.</span> <span id="s786">They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular person.</span> <span id="s787">But they done it.</span> <span id="s788">The Germans were on top flying over the heads with the little planes.</span> <span id="s789">Lithuania only had two paper cups, I call it, two of them.</span> <span id="s790">They didn't have any more.</span> <span id="s791">It was a poor nation.</span> <span id="s792">That's all they had.</span> <span id="s793">They had eggs plenty, chickens, turkey.</span> <span id="s794">That kind of items they have: food to eat.</span> <span id="s795">And that's what they struggle even right now, here right at the present time, with the and all what's going on.</span> <span id="s796">There the Lithuanians all struggle to the Russians.</span> <span id="s797">Can't help it.</span> <span id="s798">They'll have to have a war.</span> <span id="s799">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s800">I hope not, but what the way it's happened, the way it's going on, it's big troubles.</span> <span id="s801">Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years.</span> <span id="s802">He may be educated, maybe he's a doctor, a lawyer, and here he cannot practice no more and he's got to move on.</span> <span id="s803">And he say, "What, it's my country."</span> <span id="s804">He say, "I was born here."</span> <span id="s805">And you see this all coming up.</span> <span id="s806">It's all kind of problems is developing.</span> <span id="s807">And the Lithuanians from their side was trying to do the best they can, and they can't do it and it doesn't work.</span> <span id="s808">Well, when they got in, the Germans, and the Lithuanians lose, it were the Lithuanians done the biggest mistake: kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s809">It's not kill the Jews; it's destroying the Jewish nation.</span> <span id="s810">The Jews done so much good for them.</span> <span id="s811">And even right now they been going and asking in Israel for help, because they got to go to France, they got to go to England, they got to go the States, seeing that to recognize their independence, to recognize them as a nation.</span> <span id="s812">I one time came to the German Council in Richmond, and I was right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question.</span> <span id="s813">I say, "Would you tell me what's happened to Kennicksburg (ph)?"</span> <span id="s814">Kennicksburg is one of the largest cities in north Germany, and there was a population of around 5 million German, and the Lithuanians took in maybe 5 million Germans.</span> <span id="s815">It wouldn't be a Lithuania.</span> <span id="s816">And the problem isthe United Nations all have problems how to get it straight again.</span> <span id="s817">It's headachesEurope is in problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q:Right.</span> <span id="s819">Okay.</span> <span id="s820">But</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A:Well, then, they came.</span> <span id="s822">When the Germans decided to get the force, the labor force, was we were locked up, 17,000 Jews, in Slobodka before the war started with Hitler and Stalin.</span> <span id="s823">And theyI got to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q:Let melet's go back a minute.</span> <span id="s825">I've now learned that you wereyou had a good position in the transportation cooperative, because of your education and your uncles and your family.</span> <span id="s826">Why did somebody in the community come to you in the beginning to go talk to Jordan?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A:Jordan was the lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A:Because theythat rabbi knew me personally from way before the war.</span> <span id="s830">He was the President Smetona's good friend.</span> <span id="s831">And anythingwhen he had to write a letter or something or something to ask the President Smetona for help, he used to come to me and ask me I should write him in the Lithuania language a letter.</span> <span id="s832">Or when he used to send a letter to Roosevelt right in the States, he used to come also to me and ask me to help him to write in English, even when I didn't know the English language.</span> <span id="s833">He didn't took "No" for an answer.</span> <span id="s834">I say, "Your own sister‑in‑law works for Shell," Shell company, the gasoline.</span> <span id="s835">I say, "Why don't you go to your own sister‑in‑law?</span> <span id="s836">She can help you more in this case than I can."</span> <span id="s837">But he didn't want to.</span> <span id="s838">He want me.</span> <span id="s839">And I couldn't help him.</span> <span id="s840">To satisfy him I say maybe I'llmaybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings.</span> <span id="s841">I'll go.</span> <span id="s842">What am I going to lose?</span> <span id="s843">More so than the death, it couldn't be.</span> <span id="s844">And I went.</span> <span id="s845">And I went to the side streets.</span> <span id="s846">I know to the university was right there.</span> <span id="s847">Then I used to go every night and knew the places where to go.</span> <span id="s848">I went, but I almost got my head cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q:So because of your education, you were able to help people in ways that maybe some people could not?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A:Not, no.</span> <span id="s851">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s852">Everybody hadin the ghetto was such a life that everybody got to help themself.</span> <span id="s853">You don't help yourself, you lost.</span> <span id="s854">And nobody could help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q:So after a while the education didn't matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A:Didn't matter.</span> <span id="s857">It matter was a good little corner where there is room in the living, can serve you a loaf of bread for aa two pair of stockings for a woman.</span> <span id="s858">Or earrings, with a golden earing.</span> <span id="s859">You see, when also the Germans come out with the decree, they want to have the Jewish people should give all their gold, jewelry, and diamonds, to turn it in into the central committee.</span> <span id="s860">And theylater on they'll have new orders, and when they got that order, and the Jews, not so dumb, were giving away all their valuables for they had it for years.</span> <span id="s861">Then some of themone was my father‑in‑law.</span> <span id="s862">Took out a brick from the wall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s863">He put in his gold watch, he putting inhis wife had a chain, a golden chain around her neck that's plain solid gold.</span> <span id="s864">He took that and put it all in the hole from the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up, and you couldn't even tell.</span> <span id="s865">And it come up after we come after we got liberated, we went and got to find the gold pieces right in the wall where he put it in.</span> <span id="s866">And then it waswell, this is one item.</span> <span id="s867">And then we went and then to go to work at the airportno, it was the second time, then the Germans decided they got to have the airport still done, with the company, it was a German company, been building the airport.</span> <span id="s868">And everybody had to go to work regardless.</span> <span id="s869">It took all the brigades and turn around and send all of them to the airport delivering gravel to help the airport done.</span> <span id="s870">And they done it in a hurry, in no time, but they work day and night.</span> <span id="s871">And one brigade I work at night, I cut my fingers off.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q:Let me now, let's just talk about the ghetto for a while; okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A:Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q:If you don't mind.</span> <span id="s875">You said before that after the Germans took over there were all kinds of laws, what Jews could and could not do.</span> <span id="s876">Then soon after, did they decide you had to go live in a ghetto?</span> <span id="s877">When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A:No.</span> <span id="s879">Theyall of they gave that the Jews had the right they should build theirself a ghetto.</span> <span id="s880">And what they done from the Jewish people theirself, to pick out a large brigade, what they went in in the ghetto with barbed wire in the section with 27,000 Jews lived in it.</span> <span id="s881">They surrounded them with barbed wire, and had Jewish police with helpers staying there at the gate, where you going in and going out from the ghetto, staying there and helping the Germans who getting already thereyou say to German soldier and just stay the Jewish with young men, and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not to run in any troubles.</span> <span id="s882">To help there shouldn't be any shooting, shouldn't be any killing.</span> <span id="s883">And then that's the way they stay there and build the ghetto.</span> <span id="s884">And not that the ghetto was finished.</span> <span id="s885">Was in August`15, 1941, that's when they got finished, and they started in June 29th in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q:Now, did you have to move into this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A:No, I didn't, because I lived there already.</span> <span id="s888">My whole familymy family and Edna's family, we all were in that same apartment.</span> <span id="s889">We had been sleeping four, five people in one room on the floor, but we didn't want to move away.</span> <span id="s890">You staybetter stay in the one place and not to keep moving around.</span> <span id="s891">And wewe been there all the time.</span> <span id="s892">Since I got married, I was in together with them, and we stay all in the same place.</span> <span id="s893">And only when they need the helpthey used to come, the Germans, right on the corner where I lived, come with trucks and pick them up and take them to work.</span> <span id="s894">And one thing would just happen.</span> <span id="s895">When they come with trucks to work, it canthis idea was from the mayor from Kovno, from Kaunas, came with a smart idea.</span> <span id="s896">He come to Jordan, and told Jordan that he got to doto get more people to do work, and the people are not coming.</span> <span id="s897">Something, they got to do to keep them moving.</span> <span id="s898">And they came in one day and shot four people by the gate by coming in and going out to scare the Jews.</span> <span id="s899">And when they all come here, they shouldn't run, they should go to work.</span> <span id="s900">And it comehe come up with the idea that he need 530500 people he need first.</span> <span id="s901">And he got to have young people.</span> <span id="s902">What he need them?</span> <span id="s903">He need them for the archives, because of the communists run away and left behind him so many papers, so many archives, in the Russian language, and the Jews knew Russian language perfect, that the Jews should go and help thehow to take out the paper and check them, and then know what's all about them in the paper.</span> <span id="s904">And who was idea is?</span> <span id="s905">The idea was the mayor from Kaunas; he suggested it.</span> <span id="s906">And they took fiveplaced the 500534 people came.</span> <span id="s907">And all of the 534 young peopleboyfriends of mine, cousins of mine, a lot of people whom I knew, a lot of them I went to school together.</span> <span id="s908">All this appeared at night and everybody was there.</span> <span id="s909">They kill them the same night.</span> <span id="s910">When they took them out 7:00 o'clock in the morning, by 10:00 o'clock at night they all were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q:Now, why didn't you have to go with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A:That's what I don't know.</span> <span id="s913">A power in me told me not to go.</span> <span id="s914">I just until this day askrabbis ask people why I didn'tI stayed with them.</span> <span id="s915">And there was my house.</span> <span id="s916">And I told it to my buddy next to me, I say, "You know, I kind of feel funny.</span> <span id="s917">I don't think I'll go."</span> <span id="s918">He say, "You're crazy.</span> <span id="s919">What you going to do all day long here with the woman.</span> <span id="s920">They'll run you nuts.</span> <span id="s921">Where my husband, where is this and that.</span> <span id="s922">Stay here.</span> <span id="s923">They don't come in time back, it will be murder."</span> <span id="s924">But, I said, "Nope.</span> <span id="s925">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s926">I'm not going.</span> <span id="s927">You want to go with me, let's go."</span> <span id="s928">"No," he say, "I'm going," and he went with them.</span> <span id="s929">And I went back to the office from the committee.</span> <span id="s930">What we call them?</span> <span id="s931">You know, I went to the central committee office with Dr.`Elkes, the head man was there, and Avraham Tory, his office was there.</span> <span id="s932">I went back there and to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s933">I come in there.</span> <span id="s934">There is a good friend of mine and a good friend of Edna, worked for his brother.</span> <span id="s935">He gives megrabs me and he want I should go with the 534.</span> <span id="s936">And something in me gets me power in me, I should get rid of him.</span> <span id="s937">I say, "Now, look Isaaci (ph)"his name was Isaac.</span> <span id="s938">I say, "Don't play with me.</span> <span id="s939">I come to ask you what's going on with 534?</span> <span id="s940">What's happening to the young men?</span> <span id="s941">What do you want me to push there?</span> <span id="s942">What's the interest you got in me?"</span> <span id="s943">He say, "Look, I don't want nothing.</span> <span id="s944">You go with them."</span> <span id="s945">And it made me hot.</span> <span id="s946">I hadI had to knock him in his nose.</span> <span id="s947">I didn't want to do him any harm, but hemy life depended and he stops me.</span> <span id="s948">It was three, four cases like this in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q:So nobody forced you or</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A:He forced me?</span> <span id="s951">Nobody forced me, no.</span> <span id="s952">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q:Now, all of the people who didn't live in the ghetto area before</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A:Uh‑huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q:how did they come in?</span> <span id="s956">I mean, how did they find places?</span> <span id="s957">Was there some organization to help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A:No.</span> <span id="s959">It was goingbecause Hitler or the Gestapo let them until August 15 we got to have a ghetto created.</span> <span id="s960">We got to have also until September`15 a bridge made, and then they went towe went to work.</span> <span id="s961">The people who didn't live in the ghetto who went to work and helped build the ghetto, because they find out that is safer, because they say they've been guarded by the German, guarded by the Jews, and we don't have to worry about it so much at night when you go to sleep that somebody will wake you up and take you out and beat you and kill you and all, what they call it, selections.</span> <span id="s962">The 534 was a selection.</span> <span id="s963">They picked out the young men, and it is the cream of the crop for many reasons.</span> <span id="s964">Not only for the paperwork, but they were a power.</span> <span id="s965">It was an underground it was in the 534.</span> <span id="s966">It what the ghetto needed, and the young people understood it, but they were not ready.</span> <span id="s967">It wasn't so simple to do.</span> <span id="s968">But the main reason was that they should be organized to get something to fight the German before they go in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s970">But all of the people who maybe lived not in Slobodka before the war, they had to come to the ghetto also?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q:Did anyone help them or did they just sort of come over there and find places?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A:No.</span> <span id="s974">It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who came in and swapped the houses, swapped rooms.</span> <span id="s975">It been swapping.</span> <span id="s976">"Here you take mine in the corners, and I'll take you what you outside out by the field."</span> <span id="s977">They been swapping between theirself, and nobody helped them and nobody bothered them.</span> <span id="s978">It was a big mistake and it was a big mess.</span> <span id="s979">Everybody was running, doing anything they can to help theirself or help the other one.</span> <span id="s980">It didn't work.</span> <span id="s981">Then they stop it.</span> <span id="s982">Startedand they find out that they don't have enough space.</span> <span id="s983">They got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.</span> <span id="s984">They had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto.</span> <span id="s985">The small ghetto was 5,000 Jews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s986">And to go in the small one, they didn't have enough more room, since a lot of Jews werebecause Germany decided to send Jews from Austria, to send Jews from other countries, to Lithuania, to Kaunas, to the Ninth Fortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the selection.</span> <span id="s987">And they build a bridge from one ghetto to the other, from the small one to the big one.</span> <span id="s988">And in the big one they still have room to put in, but in the small ghetto they didn't have no more.</span> <span id="s989">And Iwhat they done, they told everybody, all small and big, say, "Go out in the large field."</span> <span id="s990">It was where they were building the airport.</span> <span id="s991">It's where they have thewhat they call it?</span> <span id="s992">Rockstaten (ph), the work places.</span> <span id="s993">And they all been sent there.</span> <span id="s994">But there they got a select, and the namea German soldier by the name of RaucaJay got his picture of a writeup with him.</span> <span id="s995">He was the head of the selection.</span> <span id="s996">And he had the help of the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s997">They helped to guard so the Jews shouldn't run.</span> <span id="s998">And they was directing the Selection A and B, big ghetto and small ghetto, who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s999">And then after everybody come around and stay there all morning.</span> <span id="s1000">I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1001">From 5:00 o'clock in the morning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food, without water, without nothing.</span> <span id="s1002">Andit was little children, sick people, unbathed.</span> <span id="s1003">It was a terrible picture, seeing the way they been mistreating.</span> <span id="s1004">Mistreatingthe people wanted they should be shot, but they didn'tsurrounded them with machine guns around the allaround the ghetto, and they kept them all day.</span> <span id="s1005">And then Rauca come around with a little stick, like you would play music, play an orchestra, directing all what to do, and asked everybody's occupation, everybody's name.</span> <span id="s1006">And then after a while, we seen a German on a motorcycle come running and told Rauca something.</span> <span id="s1007">And Rauca gave the order, "Everybody home.</span> <span id="s1008">We don't need it.</span> <span id="s1009">Go home."</span> <span id="s1010">Well, they were trying to, the Germans, to find out how much time and what kind of power it will take to control a situation like this, because they were afraid for the balance of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1011">After all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1012">They cannot take and 40,000 and shoot them out.</span> <span id="s1013">Somebody will get ahold of guns and somebody will get ahold of machine guns, and in worse cases like that it's not so shameful.</span> <span id="s1014">Well, then they send everybody back.</span> <span id="s1015">And what the religious Jews was say, they were saying, "Here is a God"I mean "the hand of God.</span> <span id="s1016">God saved the Jews."</span> <span id="s1017">And they allthey all go andand we all Jews start praying, and God is the one.</span> <span id="s1018">Jews, you listen, and all that.</span> <span id="s1019">The orthodox, and they were so happy.</span> <span id="s1020">"You see, we still have a God.</span> <span id="s1021">God saved us."</span> <span id="s1022">And I remember it like today they been saying.</span> <span id="s1023">And they send us back home.</span> <span id="s1024">And this was the small ghetto was liquidated, but they had a bridge made.</span> <span id="s1025">The bridge to bring in the Jews from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same time from the large one to the small one, and started Selection Number`2.</span> <span id="s1026">The big selection, which was October`28th, 1941.</span> <span id="s1027">That's when they had the big selection.</span> <span id="s1028">And, again, comes the case, I am with all my family, with my family and with Edna's family, all together.</span> <span id="s1029">That the way they had it, in groups.</span> <span id="s1030">They want, they pick outevery groups they pick out a head an who is the talker, who can talk with the Germans, but not everybody should go come and complain of say this and that.</span> <span id="s1031">And I was selected by the Germans that I should be the speaker for my group.</span> <span id="s1032">In my group it was around 3030, 35 people.</span> <span id="s1033">And he asked me my occupation.</span> <span id="s1034">And Ithe power in me tells me I shouldn't say a word that I am a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1035">I should only mention about my occupation.</span> <span id="s1036">What occupation I had when it's all I know is, all I learn, it's all my occupation?</span> <span id="s1037">But the power still tells me, don't say a word.</span> <span id="s1038">And then he start hollering, "I asked you your occupation."</span> <span id="s1039">He hollers a little .</span> <span id="s1040">Well, power tells me I should say I'm an auto mechanic.</span> <span id="s1041">And I say, "I am an automobile mechanic."</span> <span id="s1042">And when I say "automobile mechanic," he holler, "Right.</span> <span id="s1043">All groups go to the right."</span> <span id="s1044">They say this, "To the right should leave, and the left die."</span> <span id="s1045">And all the left people, the 5,000 that night, been killed, every one of them.</span> <span id="s1046">My uncles and I have lots family, and everybody been dead, killed.</span> <span id="s1047">The children, the cousins, raped and all.</span> <span id="s1048">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1049">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q:So your whole family stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A:They stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q:At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q:Now, in this big selection, where did it take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A:Vonugas (ph), a large country field.</span> <span id="s1056">It was a big farm, a lot of farm, a lot of acres of land, and there they brought us all up.</span> <span id="s1057">It used to be the horse market and all kind of place, all kind of business places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q.</span> <span id="s1059">How did people get there?</span> <span id="s1060">Were they told in advance what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A:They don't care.</span> <span id="s1062">They say, "You got to be there 7:00 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1063">How you get there is your headache."</span> <span id="s1064">They say they don't have to worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q:So at that time everybody went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q:Nobody thought about staying home and hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1069">Nobody was staying home as sick.</span> <span id="s1070">They killed them right in bed.</span> <span id="s1071">They did stayed home, but they killed them.</span> <span id="s1072">The Gestapo came in, the Germans in there, and killed them.</span> <span id="s1073">They also killed some of them they called got to be in .</span> <span id="s1074">It was like a bath, they take a bath.</span> <span id="s1075">And they say, "Oh, you need a bath.</span> <span id="s1076">Go in there."</span> <span id="s1077">And they go in there, and Gestapo kill them.</span> <span id="s1078">That kind of problems they had.</span> <span id="s1079">Well, this was the worsest.</span> <span id="s1080">After this is over, it got a little relaxed after they killed out over half and start all over.</span> <span id="s1081">And it still stays in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s1082">I can see the way they passed.</span> <span id="s1083">I was right at the corner.</span> <span id="s1084">They going mostly by alphabet.</span> <span id="s1085">The letter "I" was right in the middle.</span> <span id="s1086">I could see mythe rabbi from my temple, they bring the president from the temple, a lot of older people mostly.</span> <span id="s1087">They bring older, the old ones, they killed out.</span> <span id="s1088">The young ones they still kept because they need them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q:So you saw them actually leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A:They going from the big ghetto to the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s1091">The small ghetto was empty.</span> <span id="s1092">And there in the small ghetto it was not so easyin the beginning not so easy to get in.</span> <span id="s1093">You had to have , a round number.</span> <span id="s1094">You weren't no more after death.</span> <span id="s1095">The selection, after that, they didn't have no more when the person, whether he had Number 10, Number 50, Number 57, Number 80, that kind.</span> <span id="s1096">And since I register myself as automobile mechanic, one morning, I assume it was the two days later, a German come running with Number 570.</span> <span id="s1097">It was me.</span> <span id="s1098">He said "Come report to the gate."</span> <span id="s1099">The Jewish bodies had to deliver right away.</span> <span id="s1100">And they come right away running and told me I got to go to work at the airport.</span> <span id="s1101">Well, they took me.</span> <span id="s1102">I had to go to work, because I'm a mechanic.</span> <span id="s1103">Because there I came, and they told me what to do.</span> <span id="s1104">And I was also lucky.</span> <span id="s1105">It's a luck.</span> <span id="s1106">I'm standing with the foreman on a truck, it was a German.</span> <span id="s1107">A German army soldier come into the foreman with a pickup truck.</span> <span id="s1108">And he say he has trouble.</span> <span id="s1109">The truck isn't running right.</span> <span id="s1110">He talks to the German, the foreman, can we help him.</span> <span id="s1111">The foreman called me up, "Come here.</span> <span id="s1112">Talk with him and ask him what he wants."</span> <span id="s1113">I go to him, ask what he wants.</span> <span id="s1114">He tells me he has trouble with his truck, it doesn't run.</span> <span id="s1115">I've got do something about it.</span> <span id="s1116">I said, "Well, let me see."</span> <span id="s1117">He start it up.</span> <span id="s1118">I didn't hear nothing.</span> <span id="s1119">I said, "Tell you what I'll do.</span> <span id="s1120">I can to lay down on the floor and you drive slow and over me, and I'll see what is knocking there."</span> <span id="s1121">I heard a knock.</span> <span id="s1122">We hear it.</span> <span id="s1123">He say okay.</span> <span id="s1124">And he say when will I be able to have ready.</span> <span id="s1125">I say a couple days.</span> <span id="s1126">He say, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1127">Can you do it earlier?</span> <span id="s1128">I'll give you a good loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1129">I mean, you can do it?</span> <span id="s1130">I have a farm not far from here, and I want to run up to see what's going on home."</span> <span id="s1131">"I'll do my best," I tell him.</span> <span id="s1132">And I do.</span> <span id="s1133">And I lay down, and I seen a big pipe with the universal joint with the drive shaft is loose, and I use my head.</span> <span id="s1134">I say, "What I am doingI moved it.</span> <span id="s1135">It wasn't the newer kind of car; it was the old late model Ford.</span> <span id="s1136">And I took it out with my hand.</span> <span id="s1137">It was loose.</span> <span id="s1138">And I go into the German, and I tell them I need a universal joint, and they bring me the part in stock.</span> <span id="s1139">And he sa, "Look, I can't understand.</span> <span id="s1140">Tell me, how do you took off a drive shaft withso long with so little bolts with a big tools.</span> <span id="s1141">I gave you a screwdriver with a pipe wrench.</span> <span id="s1142">I told him, I sayyou see, you all the time you got to be in your .</span> <span id="s1143">And I told him, "Well, I had it here, it was so loose, the pipe, that I didn't have to have any wrenches.</span> <span id="s1144">With my fingers I took it off and it got loose," and that's what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1145">"Oh, I can understand now."</span> <span id="s1146">He understood.</span> <span id="s1147">He gave me the parts, and I became the best mechanic in the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q:I need to take you back cause I have a few more questions about that big action.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A:Uh‑huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q:Didyou had a Jewish government in place and you had Jewish police in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1151">What was their involvement in these actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A:The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q:The Jewthe Judenrought (ph).</span> <span id="s1154">Those people and the people on the Jewish police force, did they have any involvement in this action?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A:Not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q:Did they help?</span> <span id="s1157">Did they try to help Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1158">Did they help the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A:I don't thinkI don't think it was init was rumors was coming around that the Jewish police knew where children hiding places were, and they reported it to the Gestapo, andbecause to save their own skin that there, that's all they had.</span> <span id="s1160">They didn't want to get involved or something.</span> <span id="s1161">They just point the place where you can see Jewish kids been laying in hiding and been killed.</span> <span id="s1162">That's the kind of rumors I hadI heard, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1163">I cannot verify, I can't say nothing because I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q:Were they present at the selection, the leaders of the Jewish Council?</span> <span id="s1165">Were they present?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A:Before.</span> <span id="s1167">The leaders of the council, there wasn't too many.</span> <span id="s1168">The only one was Tory, and it was Dr.`Elkes, and Tory had a secretary woman.</span> <span id="s1169">It's all it was.</span> <span id="s1170">That was the council.</span> <span id="s1171">And one was by the door, the Isaac, who didn't let me in to ask him find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s1172">About five, six people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q:So were they there at the time of the big action?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A:Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q:What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s1177">They didn't done nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">Theythey didn't bother the police.</span> <span id="s1179">The police saying at first they had to have a working permit, and to get a working permit was hard.</span> <span id="s1180">It wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s1181">They been payingbuying working permits, because they been told the person with a working permit his life is secured.</span> <span id="s1182">They don't go do nothing to them; he'll survive.</span> <span id="s1183">And they been giving us a working permit Number 537, and 537 is Israel Ipson.</span> <span id="s1184">And it was been already 537 in the , in that department.</span> <span id="s1185">They been making it forin a minute for you.</span> <span id="s1186">They had the special printing material and they be printing up 537.</span> <span id="s1187">They made 721 and they madeand it the way it went.</span> <span id="s1188">They had it made.</span> <span id="s1189">And then everybody was trying to go to the police because the city police don't bother.</span> <span id="s1190">They have enough troubles the way the average person has it.</span> <span id="s1191">But nobody can go into the police.</span> <span id="s1192">They didn't took it.</span> <span id="s1193">They want me.</span> <span id="s1194">Why they want me?</span> <span id="s1195">First thing, I was born there in that place, raised in the place.</span> <span id="s1196">I knew every little corner, every little hole.</span> <span id="s1197">They need me, but I say, "No, huh‑uh.</span> <span id="s1198">You don't go get me.</span> <span id="s1199">I don't want it.</span> <span id="s1200">I'd rather go to the airport."</span> <span id="s1201">But then, that's my help me too, by not going into the airport.</span> <span id="s1202">Some of them say, "Well, we cannot keep Ipson so long.</span> <span id="s1203">He been so many years already here.</span> <span id="s1204">We got to give him a better job.</span> <span id="s1205">It's not fair.</span> <span id="s1206">We got to recruit all the work on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s1207">We got more Jews got to go to the airport.</span> <span id="s1208">We swap it."</span> <span id="s1209">Well, but that when I decided on to my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s1211">We stillI have a lot more questions about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s1213">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q:All right.</span> <span id="s1215">So do youis there anything more that you can tell me about these horrible actions, thewhat happened with the small ghetto or what happened with the big action at the end of October?</span> <span id="s1216">Is there anything else?</span> <span id="s1217">Could you see the people as they were actually leaving, leaving the ghetto, walking out towards the forts?</span> <span id="s1218">Was thatcould you see that happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A:A walk in the , no.</span> <span id="s1220">I didn't see it happening.</span> <span id="s1221">It would be very, very rough.</span> <span id="s1222">And that's funny.</span> <span id="s1223">The Germansat the end of the Germans taking, there was a member by the name of Lipzer.</span> <span id="s1224">Lipzer was a heada right man for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1225">It was a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1226">Ihe becamehe was a nothing.</span> <span id="s1227">He was a television salesman before the war.</span> <span id="s1228">I knew him personally very well.</span> <span id="s1229">And he became a big shot because he wantedhe want to gowhen someone been locked up by the Gestapo and going to Lipzer, Lipzer used to bring him out.</span> <span id="s1230">How he been doing it, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1231">Had he been paid off, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1232">Used to save you something to the Gestapo, to Miller, for him for his wife a present, and take it out and three.</span> <span id="s1233">But it was the main thing.</span> <span id="s1234">In my case, I felt a little better, but I didn't bother with him.</span> <span id="s1235">I stayed away from him.</span> <span id="s1236">I didn't want no part.</span> <span id="s1237">Like when they put in Edna in jail, and I don't know why she got involved with it with her mother.</span> <span id="s1238">ot in jail my sister, and they put him in jail by the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1239">It's a timeand I had arranged to take him out from ghetto to run with him to keep the place where to work, but it didn't worked out.</span> <span id="s1240">I got another very, very, terrible what happened.</span> <span id="s1241">The worsest part of what happened with me in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1242">I even don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1243">I had a cousin who worked for me.</span> <span id="s1244">He's a very smooth operator by the gate.</span> <span id="s1245">He wasn't afraid for nothing.</span> <span id="s1246">He had been supplying to the ghetto population anything they want.</span> <span id="s1247">A young kid.</span> <span id="s1248">He was around 19 or 18.</span> <span id="s1249">And he helped me to go to the gate with Jay, because his house was also by the gate.</span> <span id="s1250">And he helped me also to get to my farmer whom my uncle sent to pick me up with Edna, because they want to bring me home.</span> <span id="s1251">And I see one day myit was a couple months later, my cousin is in my hiding place.</span> <span id="s1252">He came.</span> <span id="s1253">How he came, I find out; but where he get the idea, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1254">I didn't want to have nothing to do with him.</span> <span id="s1255">Everything when he done for me, I paid him.</span> <span id="s1256">I just didn'twasn't in me to have to do it, all this smoke‑miray (ph), they call it.</span> <span id="s1257">But this time he come to me and ask me, "I need a favor."</span> <span id="s1258">He wants a favor from me.</span> <span id="s1259">I say, "What do you want?</span> <span id="s1260">I paid you for my favor to take me to the gate."</span> <span id="s1261">"Yeah, you pay me.</span> <span id="s1262">I don't want that."</span> <span id="s1263">I say, "When you want somebody"he say he want to bring his brother also in my place where I am staying.</span> <span id="s1264">I'll agree with that provided you can bring my mother with the sister, with the older sister.</span> <span id="s1265">You can bring them from ghetto to me, I'll do anything you want."</span> <span id="s1266">He say "Okay."</span> <span id="s1267">I say, "But you remember, you got to bring my mother," and I repeat him three times.</span> <span id="s1268">And I say, "Marches"who is the gentile who come to pick us up.</span> <span id="s1269">I say, "Look, Marches, you see he should take my mother and sister."</span> <span id="s1270">"I don't know who they are."</span> <span id="s1271">I say, "You'll find out."</span> <span id="s1272">He didn't.</span> <span id="s1273">He come on board his other brother with his wife, bring her to me.</span> <span id="s1274">And I come to the ghetto and I say, "Who arewhat you brought them for?</span> <span id="s1275">Who the woman?"</span> <span id="s1276">"This is my wife," he say.</span> <span id="s1277">"But who give you the permission to bring them in here?</span> <span id="s1278">I didn't ask you to come."</span> <span id="s1279">It was the best hiding place.</span> <span id="s1280">It was mine.</span> <span id="s1281">Why?</span> <span id="s1282">It was in a safe.</span> <span id="s1283">The Gestapo wouldn't dream to fnd somebody.</span> <span id="s1284">A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto, but he done it.</span> <span id="s1285">Well, I got hot.</span> <span id="s1286">I said, "Now, look.</span> <span id="s1287">I don't want no more part of you.</span> <span id="s1288">I told you a bunch.</span> <span id="s1289">I don't wantI want my family.</span> <span id="s1290">I didn't have nothing do with strangers.</span> <span id="s1291">Your wife, fine.</span> <span id="s1292">I don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1293">I'm not married to your wife."</span> <span id="s1294">Didn't listen again.</span> <span id="s1295">And he come with his less brother and his wife.</span> <span id="s1296">And something got him when they came to a little town they had to go through to come to me.</span> <span id="s1297">It was Zezmer, Zezmer.</span> <span id="s1298">And go in three soldiers.</span> <span id="s1299">And that to them comes a wagon, and the wagon was my auntthe boy's motherand his wife.</span> <span id="s1300">Four already been with him; two more came.</span> <span id="s1301">And I'm seeing the soldiers, and they were thinking that the soldiers go enough that they want to arrest him.</span> <span id="s1302">And they start running, aboutmy aunt and my cousin, and the soldiers didn't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s1303">There were a big pile of hay.</span> <span id="s1304">It was the fall of the year.</span> <span id="s1305">And they got in the pile of hay, they were hiding in the hay, and the soldiers then come around, took him out of the hay, and shot him.</span> <span id="s1306">Killed him.</span> <span id="s1307">Took him not the same day, next day.</span> <span id="s1308">Mother and son, pardon me.</span> <span id="s1309">Took him.</span> <span id="s1310">I can't forget.</span> <span id="s1311">This is almost a fault of mine, when I would insistmaybe they would be more easier, but I insist to bring my mother.</span> <span id="s1312">I wanted to have somebody.</span> <span id="s1313">Many, many nights I don't sleep because of thatbecause of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q:Now, I want to go back to the ghetto a little bit.</span></p>

packet, and he goes away.</span> <span id="s1344">And what they gave him?</span> <span id="s1345">A brick.</span> <span id="s1346">A paper wrapped around a piece of brick, and took away the suit.</span> <span id="s1347">And it was worker worked with him all his life.</span> <span id="s1348">He could fix him, and I told him, I say, "Don't bother.</span> <span id="s1349">I'll buy you

id="s1354">A:Betternaturally, it's better in the ghetto providing you have something to support yourself.</span> <span id="s1355">Inside of the ghetto was the main thing, the malin (ph) what they call it, the working groups.</span> <span id="s1356">Vachstaten (ph).</span> <span id="s1357">The work places.</span> <span id="s1358">There was around 5,000 Jews working, because the Germans needed them very bad.</span> <span id="s1359">They needed them to make loafs and to make ears.</span> <span id="s1360">And they used to catchbring cats and dogs and killing them, and taking the ear covers and making ear covers from their skins.</span> <span id="s1361">And they were bringing them in the places where they have been hauling the cats and dogs was in synagogues, bringing them full synagogues dogs and killing them.</span> <span id="s1362">And there was already sitting sewing machines, making ear covers for their ears from the dogs.</span> <span id="s1363">And one day I come to workI come

bottles."</span> <span id="s1373">And the Germans couldn't get any beer when they didn't have empty bottles.</span> <span id="s1374">"Well, I'll arrange that," I said, since I knew the people who knew my father.</span> <span id="s1375">And I told him, I said, "I need bottles," and they arranged it to give me three, four cases empty bottles, but for my boss to have beer .</span> <span id="s1376">And one day, I seen the Gestapo man come looking for me.</span> <span id="s1377">I got scared to death.</span> <span id="s1378">I say, "Oh, this is the end.</span> <span id="s1379">This time I no get out."</span> <span id="s1380">And who it was?</span> <span id="s1381">It's funny.</span> <span id="s1382">The brewmeister from the brewery who it was before the war, who worked together with my father before the war, and now he became a big Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s1383">One of the big, big ones.</span> <span id="s1384">And he was trying to find out his boss.</span> <span id="s1385">He want

of them were dead already.</span> <span id="s1388">And he came to bring a package, the Gestapo man, that I should take over a package to one of his bosses.</span> <span id="s1389">And he was a philanthropic man, a nice man.</span> <span id="s1390">And I took over a package, put it in ghetto, and I save it.</span> <span id="s1391">And if they going to catch me, I told them I gothe give me his card.</span> <span id="s1392">He say, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1393">When they going to catch you, give them this by the ghetto gate.</span> <span id="s1394">They're going to let you in.</span> <span id="s1395">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1396">And they'll see in this card and know it was ."</span> <span id="s1397">And then Mr.`Wolf came.</span> <span id="s1398">He came through friends of my father.</span> <span id="s1399">I told him, I say, "Look, help me.</span> <span id="s1400">Have your son bring me a package I got from Wolf, a package for me."</span> <span id="s1401">And I had to deliver packages.</span> <span id="s1402">The Gestapo man used to bring packages for the Wolfs until the big selection.</span> <span id="s1403">That's when they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q:You were saying that it was better to work inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q:Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A:You didn't have to put up with guysat the gates with the guard, with the police.</span> <span id="s1408">with butter, with water, you had nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s1409">When you worked inside the ghetto, you go from your ghetto place to your home or from home to the ghetto place.</span> <span id="s1410">And for thatthe only thing when you had a sewing machine or anothertoaster, helped to trade it in by the gentiles.</span> <span id="s1411">Items like that, they used to grab it and give you a good price, and they had money to buy it.</span> <span id="s1412">I had from one of my competitors when I wandered out of one of the buildings it was, a cigarette box mixed from gold.</span> <span id="s1413">Asked me to trade it in for food.</span> <span id="s1414">It was from Mr.`Frumpkin (ph).</span> <span id="s1415">And I'll take it.</span> <span id="s1416">I'll try to do it, but I took it but I wasn't capable to make a deal and I brought it back.</span> <span id="s1417">He didn'tif they would have caught, they would have caught me, not him.</span> <span id="s1418">It's not interested.</span> <span id="s1419">It's not involved in it.</span> <span id="s1420">I was the one involved by tooking the transaction.</span> <span id="s1421">My life was in danger, but not theirs.</span> <span id="s1422">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q:Well, but now, isn't it possible that if you worked outside the ghetto you had more of an opportunity to do business or to get extra food or that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1425">They right, they live.</span> <span id="s1426">But I don't know that life is worth it so much to do it.</span> <span id="s1427">Well, mostly Edna she was more for that.</span> <span id="s1428">I didn't go for that.</span> <span id="s1429">Didn't want to risk her life.</span> <span id="s1430">I had been looking for her twice.</span> <span id="s1431">And now when I run away from the ghetto, I run no more from the ghetto, but I had a new working place already.</span> <span id="s1432">They gave me rifemeister (ph).</span> <span id="s1433">What I really been

big shotsI wouldn't call themgoing out in the city, encounters, looking around to get something for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q:They weren't that helpful to the population?</span></p>

crawled through that hole.</span> <span id="s1976">Across the street was maybe by 200 feet was already houses.</span> <span id="s1977">It was a small ghetto who wasthat was liquidated.</span> <span id="s1978">That is their houses where they lived, the people.</span> <span id="s1979">And from there already a farmer, my uncle send to us, was waiting outside of the territory was a hundred andclose to a hundred miles.</span> <span id="s1980">And there we got together again there.</span> <span id="s1981">Jay, me, and Edna and the farmer.</span> <span id="s1982">And he put in Jay in the wagon, which was full of straw, covered him up, so it shouldn't be nobody should see him.</span> <span id="s1983">And I was walking with that wagon, because to the danger places I didn't want to run and to make some noises, should be as quiet as could be.</span> <span id="s1984">I even asked the farmer to take the shoe of the horse, to put the shoe with rubber pads we shouldn't hear him go around or do anything, we be quiet.</span> <span id="s1985">The same is what's very important for us, the German, they had these boots there with nails.</span> <span id="s1986">You could hear it for a mile.</span> <span id="s1987">And that's the way we moved.</span> <span id="s1988">I seen one stopped us with a wagon, "Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1989">What you got?"</span> <span id="s1990">They gotthey thinking he the farmer.</span> <span id="s1991">"You got anything for sale?"</span> <span id="s1992">"I don't have anything for sale," and they didn't bother.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1996">We had a wagon to take us in and go as fast and all we want, but we didn't walk that way.</span> <span id="s1997">You were so scared every little noise.</span> <span id="s1998">A rabbit goes by, you jump, scared to death.</span> <span id="s1999">Who is that with that noise?</span> <span id="s2000">And then we were successful.</span> <span id="s2001">Thank God.</span> <span id="s2002">My cousin when he went to me, he went on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2003">It was a long, long worn out trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q:How far did you have to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A:60about 75 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q:So now, did you go with this one farmer the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A:That farmer, the younger, he's brave, smart.</span> <span id="s2008">He didn't fit in for a farmer.</span> <span id="s2009">When I could bring him here, I would have done anything for him, as good as he is.</span> <span id="s2010">And they work, as I say, everything fit together.</span> <span id="s2011">I tell you, not like a farmer, but like a professor, you know, everything right.</span> <span id="s2012">He told us ahead of timewhen we came in the ghettoI mean out of the ghetto, he brought us in in his house, and he didn't hear nothing.</span> <span id="s2013">The poor farmer, his house was a smokehousewhat they call?</span> <span id="s2014">A smokehouse.</span> <span id="s2015">Like the smoking ham or it'she had the oven without the chimney.</span> <span id="s2016">And he get two little boys, very noisy, and for the boys are more worriedscared more for them than I was scared for the big ones.</span> <span id="s2017">But first place he told the boys they should put us on the top of the oven.</span> <span id="s2018">The oven is almost as big as half of that room, and it was nice and warm and comfortable, because it was cold, ice and snow, and he put us right under there.</span> <span id="s2019">And we were asleep, and it was enjoyable sleep I ever had.</span> <span id="s2020">But here comes in the farmer, and he start snooping.</span> <span id="s2021">And he say, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2022">Who is here?"</span> <span id="s2023">He asked the children if he knew whom to ask.</span> <span id="s2024">The children they would tell him.</span> <span id="s2025">The rest, we wouldn't tell him.</span> <span id="s2026">"Who lives here?</span> <span id="s2027">Who moved in here recently," he asked the kids and asked the farmer's wife.</span> <span id="s2028">They sayhis wife ask him, "Why are you asking?</span> <span id="s2029">What does that have to do with your business?"</span> <span id="s2030">"No, here is city folks moved in.</span> <span id="s2031">I smell.</span> <span id="s2032">The smell is a city smell.</span> <span id="s2033">And somebody, stranger, moved in.</span> <span id="s2034">Who could move in?"</span> <span id="s2035">He started figuring the people telling to the room and whom you think could be?</span> <span id="s2036">"It must be city lawyer.</span> <span id="s2037">That's all.</span> <span id="s2038">The lawyer come here."</span> <span id="s2039">And it was me.</span> <span id="s2040">You see, "The lawyer with Itska (ph)", Itska was her uncle, "they are the one moved up right here.</span> <span id="s2041">They in that house," he tells the woman.</span> <span id="s2042">Well, she send the kids right away to come home, his .</span> <span id="s2043">And he came, and she told them both the man's name or was here and what he said.</span> <span id="s2044">He said, "We in trouble.</span> <span id="s2045">We got to get out immediately," the farmer said, "for mine house.</span> <span id="s2046">And let's take them to his sister's home."</span> <span id="s2047">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s2048">And we going halfway, the sister, the bugs, the dogs start barking, carrying on.</span> <span id="s2049">He says, "It's no good.</span> <span id="s2050">The farmer was going with us to the people we were going.</span> <span id="s2051">He told Edna, "We'll have to go to the Paskavitz (ph), to the people Paskavitzes."</span> <span id="s2052">And they the only one in this situation they could helpcan help us, because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with them because their son‑in‑law the chief of police of Volitus (ph), a city.</span> <span id="s2053">A small city, not a big one.</span> <span id="s2054">And theyand he's very tough, tough chief of police.</span> <span id="s2055">And then they have to worry when people are find out, they'll go everywhere until his house, untilto that chief they don't want to start it.</span> <span id="s2056">Well, everyone in this time was not kosher.</span> <span id="s2057">Everybody will be taking it to the table, taking , stealing, covering, all kind of mismatch of business was going on.</span> <span id="s2058">But up to the chief of police.</span> <span id="s2059">And then the farmer told Edna, "When you can go in in the house and tell the old lady who you are, then they'll do it.</span> <span id="s2060">She'll do for you because of your mother."</span> <span id="s2061">And her mother was already dead.</span> <span id="s2062">Then he told the boys to watch out, not to go home, never go with him.</span> <span id="s2063">The farmer took him around and let the boys go on around because it would maybe be caught and can be messed up.</span> <span id="s2064">He was smart.</span> <span id="s2065">And then every 5every 10 minutes, the farmer used to lay down on the ground with the ears, and knew the movement from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2066">The Gestapo was already looking for us.</span> <span id="s2067">And when theythey knew exactly where the Gestapo were, because the noise, the walk, when they been walking.</span> <span id="s2068">It was wintertime and cold, and the snow was ice, and we go with boots on ice it's makes a noise which you can hear far away.</span> <span id="s2069">And every half hour we used to lay down.</span> <span id="s2070">We go into woods, and they say "Let's go.</span> <span id="s2071">It's good.</span> <span id="s2072">The dogs are there," and they be giving us the plans on moving with us where the dogs are.</span> <span id="s2073">The dogs were making the noise because the new strange people came in.</span> <span id="s2074">They think the strange people they were after them.</span> <span id="s2075">And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking, because I was the dangerous one.</span> <span id="s2076">Dangerous than the partisans, because partisans was living right there too in those woods, in the woods.</span> <span id="s2077">It was thick woods and good , and it what the partisans need.</span> <span id="s2078">They live in there.</span> <span id="s2079">And it's the way we moved up to the Paskavitzes.</span> <span id="s2080">Edna knocks in the window, and "Who's there?"</span> <span id="s2081">And Edna saymentioned her mother's name.</span> <span id="s2082">"Don't know her."</span> <span id="s2083">The old man comes up to the door, opens it a crack, and say, "Who you?"</span> <span id="s2084">And she tells him she is Esther'sEsther's daughter, and she want to talk with him.</span> <span id="s2085">"Esther's daughter?</span> <span id="s2086">Which Esther are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s2087">Say "Esther from Slobodka, from Lithuania, that is my mother.</span> <span id="s2088">And I am Hikki (ph)," they call it, yeah, "I am Hikki's daughter."</span> <span id="s2089">"Oh, Hikki's daughter."</span> <span id="s2090">They know who it is.</span> <span id="s2091">They let us in home, she and her husband.</span> <span id="s2092">Her son, second son died.</span> <span id="s2093">They had a daughter and a son.</span> <span id="s2094">The son did not investigated what goes on in the village, because they knew each other.</span> <span id="s2095">Every movement.</span> <span id="s2096">Anything in a little village they knew.</span> <span id="s2097">Then he went out that night to report the mother and father what's happening in the village.</span> <span id="s2098">And they come back the next day and reported that the Gestapo was looking forspent two hours checking, searching around the lake, although they had a round lake, and couldn't find them.</span> <span id="s2099">Couldn't find nobody.</span> <span id="s2100">And they dissolve it.</span> <span id="s2101">They decided to move in another time.</span> <span id="s2102">They didn't .</span> <span id="s2103">Two days they come again.</span> <span id="s2104">And this time, they were very close to us, closer here, but there was not time even to get if you were laying right in the attic, laying the cover it up with all junk, with all hay and all that.</span> <span id="s2105">But wehe didn't even let us stay there no more.</span> <span id="s2106">The farmer's brother‑in‑law took us from the attic.</span> <span id="s2107">Edna and me and Jay, all three, out.</span> <span id="s2108">He don't want even to have us close by.</span> <span id="s2109">He's afraid that when we get caught, he'll be shot by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2110">And they let out rumors more and more they were killing.</span> <span id="s2111">It was true.</span> <span id="s2112">They beenthe Germans around there caught a lot of underground people in those woods.</span> <span id="s2113">And the only thingthe only salvation people had, the Germans were scared to death for the woods.</span> <span id="s2114">For woods they were afraid, because they know with the underground is no place to play.</span> <span id="s2115">They when they do a job, they do it.</span> <span id="s2116">They blew up five train loads with soldiers right in this section.</span> <span id="s2117">It was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been sending the partisans by plane in those sections.</span> <span id="s2118">Well, and when we came to them, we could stay only three weeks and we had to move out again.</span> <span id="s2119">Had it rough.</span> <span id="s2120">That moving is terrible.</span> <span id="s2121">Why we had to move?</span> <span id="s2122">It was right before Christmas, and before Christmas all the families had got together for the holidays, and the people were laying there in a big bottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were afraid that the kids, that two small kids were came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going up in the in daytime, they can find us.</span> <span id="s2123">Then PaskefskiPaskofski, I got ahold of Edna's uncle, and told him, I said, "Take us out of there.</span> <span id="s2124">He's afraid to keep us."</span> <span id="s2125">Because we could beenall could get in dangers.</span> <span id="s2126">We had to move out again from this place and go looking for another place.</span> <span id="s2127">The only place we decidewhich I decided with Edna's uncle, it would bethere was Paskavitzes was the first one, but this was Paskofski.</span> <span id="s2128">This was two separate families.</span> <span id="s2129">Another one, Paskofski.</span> <span id="s2130">Paskofski was a very, very, very poor farmer, a very religious man.</span> <span id="s2131">Nice man.</span> <span id="s2132">And he done it anything for a reason.</span> <span id="s2133">He didn't took from medidn't even want to take from me.</span> <span id="s2134">I offered him money.</span> <span id="s2135">I had a few gold pieces.</span> <span id="s2136">I say, "Take it to him only at least one for memory for me."</span> <span id="s2137">He took one.</span> <span id="s2138">We used to sit down outside at night.</span> <span id="s2139">The only conversation with each other.</span> <span id="s2140">At 1:00 o'clock at night, and talking about the things, what's going on, what's happening in the world, with the fight, what with all the traveling, with the predicting when can we be liberated.</span> <span id="s2141">Here we already have the war in Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s2142">In Stalingrad with the Russians took the overhead, and they been already stopped.</span> <span id="s2143">The German army to go forward and start already pushing them back.</span> <span id="s2144">And I tell them the war.</span> <span id="s2145">When we came then to Paskofski, we were a little happier.</span> <span id="s2146">Why poorand nobody was looking for a poor farmer.</span> <span id="s2147">Everybodythe partisans came, they look for a partisan with money.</span> <span id="s2148">A partisan with goodbuy ammunition.</span> <span id="s2149">And where they would find the ammunition?</span> <span id="s2150">Right by the farmers.</span> <span id="s2151">The farmers used to sell the ammunition.</span> <span id="s2152">They used to come in, andthe partisans, and to the farmers, and have the names and have everything they already knew also their investigation, through their investigation, what's happening.</span> <span id="s2153">But Paskofski had two potato peats.</span> <span id="s2154">And a potatoyou know what a potato peat?</span> <span id="s2155">Ninety percent of the people don't know, never heard of it, they don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s2156">But a potato peat, there we used to lay.</span> <span id="s2157">I was one cuple days in the barn sleeping there.</span> <span id="s2158">I wasn't safe.</span> <span id="s2159">I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s2160">I was scared all the time.</span> <span id="s2161">Maybe somebody's coming in.</span> <span id="s2162">And then I mostly staying right there.</span> <span id="s2163">And then Paskofski also have a German shepherd, a dog, smart like acalled him Vilgas (ph).</span> <span id="s2164">I gave him a name Vilgas.</span> <span id="s2165">Vilgas means wolf.</span> <span id="s2166">And I been talking to him and eating together from one plate, bring him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had bones left over.</span> <span id="s2167">Why, sometimes I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting food from the farmers.</span> <span id="s2168">I used to go with Edna's uncle.</span> <span id="s2169">He knew everybody.</span> <span id="s2170">He knew where to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there was an enemy right there; to know where to go, to watch their step and not to go.</span> <span id="s2171">That's why we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything.</span> <span id="s2172">Every step we do he say, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2173">Come back."</span> <span id="s2174">We used to come in the morning, he say, "You go and do your job."</span> <span id="s2175">I say, "What's your job?</span> <span id="s2176">He say, "Kill the lice."</span> <span id="s2177">I hate forshower for months, and they were covered up with all this stuff.</span> <span id="s2178">But then the only thing early in the morning a little sign of sun, a few rays came in, we stay in there and clean it up ourself that we should be able to wear another day.</span> <span id="s2179">And but thenand the rest of them, the uncle, all my cousins, we were 14 people in the two peats.</span> <span id="s2180">And how I done the peats, one of them were apart from the other, like from this wall until here, it was a tunnel.</span> <span id="s2181">A tunnel that used to be able to go in and out.</span> <span id="s2182">To go to the tunnel, you had toon your belly, particularly for kids, you had to crawl up to the exit.</span> <span id="s2183">And it wasn't such a easy job because we had five, three, fivesix kids, and they been for them it was there to play.</span> <span id="s2184">For Jay he was at that time five, he would crawl in there and crawl in here, who was crawling faster.</span> <span id="s2185">But I was scared to death that it could collapse.</span> <span id="s2186">I didn't have any support.</span> <span id="s2187">I put in a few branches, but that's all.</span> <span id="s2188">And I said the ground couldthe sand could fell and killed the kids.</span> <span id="s2189">And then I would be in trouble; they would be all over us dead.</span> <span id="s2190">It was rough.</span> <span id="s2191">And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me.</span> <span id="s2192">He had to listen.</span> <span id="s2193">And I told them, every one of them, that I am the boss.</span> <span id="s2194">That they should know not play around, not to run around, because our lives depend on it.</span> <span id="s2195">Finally the kids, after they understood I was right, they already been controlling theirself.</span> <span id="s2196">When somebody been talking a little louder, the other kids would say, "You shut up.</span> <span id="s2197">You keep quiet."</span> <span id="s2198">And at night we used to go out and get some bread.</span> <span id="s2199">And then when in day, in daytime, well, the woman got to go out after all, say person cannot be all the time, we have empty stomach.</span> <span id="s2200">And then we had to a fix up for that, too.</span> <span id="s2201">A big bucket with all that outside and cover it up with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes.</span> <span id="s2202">I made it that way that the rotten potatoes was high, and I'd been pulling with a string to opens it up a little opening, and all the rotten potatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't see the entrance And people been coming.</span> <span id="s2203">First thing, the dog used to take care of a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2204">Never did let nobody to come in close by.</span> <span id="s2205">I've been training him so that I didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it up, get himself a placeI did a job.</span> <span id="s2206">I had some fun.</span> <span id="s2207">And it worked.</span> <span id="s2208">I've been talking to him like to a person, and he believes me.</span> <span id="s2209">And I'm staying one evening, and I used to go out to fix the peats.</span> <span id="s2210">It was around 10:00 o'clock at time and all the farmers are asleep, and I shouldn't get in any troubles by staying and digging.</span> <span id="s2211">I wasn't careful enough, and it collapse on me.</span> <span id="s2212">The sand from the peats got together in one spot and got wrapped to here in sand.</span> <span id="s2213">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2214">I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s2215">The first time I understood what it means being covered up with sand that is unable to move away nothing.</span> <span id="s2216">I was staying in one spot.</span> <span id="s2217">I couldn't even move a hand.</span> <span id="s2218">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2219">I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and harder to breathe.</span> <span id="s2220">Vilgas was right with me.</span> <span id="s2221">And I told Vilgas, "I'm in troubles.</span> <span id="s2222">Go and bring me Paskofski.</span> <span id="s2223">Go and bring me Paskofski."</span> <span id="s2224">And I showed him a bone, and it cooked.</span> <span id="s2225">And he come to get for a bone.</span> <span id="s2226">I took the bone.</span> <span id="s2227">"You go and bring him and then I go give it to you."</span> <span id="s2228">I been talking to him like I talk to a person.</span> <span id="s2229">Anytime after I have a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off.</span> <span id="s2230">Where he goes, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2231">I told him, I said, "Go to the old man," the owner, the farmer.</span> <span id="s2232">I said, "Wake him up."</span> <span id="s2233">But he didn't.</span> <span id="s2234">What's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph).</span> <span id="s2235">His name's Stacese (ph).</span> <span id="s2236">That's he used to goevery weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there to dance and carry on.</span> <span id="s2237">And passing by every time, automatically he used to pass by the peat.</span> <span id="s2238">See how the dog didn't bother him.</span> <span id="s2239">He knew him very well.</span> <span id="s2240">And the dog seen Stasook Stacese coming up, and he jumped right on him and start pushing him.</span> <span id="s2241">His paw back, and should go front, and said go to the peat.</span> <span id="s2242">And Stacese understood something in trouble.</span> <span id="s2243">"Who's in trouble?</span> <span id="s2244">Tell me," he asked the dog.</span> <span id="s2245">And the dog grabbed him from his coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me up to the hole to the peats where I been laying, and he dug me out.</span> <span id="s2246">And I could move.</span> <span id="s2247">I was a feeling like I got from dead to alive.</span> <span id="s2248">It was a terrific.</span> <span id="s2249">And I got out.</span> <span id="s2250">Then he say, "Well, they'll make a meal."</span> <span id="s2251">"Okay.</span> <span id="s2252">We make a meal.</span> <span id="s2253">I'll pay for it."</span> <span id="s2254">We got a pig, and we had to smoke some for Jay.</span> <span id="s2255">He loved Jay, give him something to eat.</span> <span id="s2256">And that's the way we got out for a while.</span> <span id="s2257">Now, the war came to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was around 75 miles.</span> <span id="s2258">And a week later, I seen the oldier.</span> <span id="s2259">The soldier going clear up without a , with holes, with all that.</span> <span id="s2260">And Paskofski tell me, he say, "It's a Russian solder.</span> <span id="s2261">It's not a German.</span> <span id="s2262">A German wouldn't go sloppy the way he's going."</span> <span id="s2263">I say, "Wait a minute."</span> <span id="s2264">I look a minute.</span> <span id="s2265">I say, "Yeah, it's a GermanI mean Russian."</span> <span id="s2266">I holler in the Russian language to him.</span> <span id="s2267">He responds and come up to me.</span> <span id="s2268">I ask him, "What you doing here?</span> <span id="s2269">The Germans will kill you."</span> <span id="s2270">"No, they wouldn't kill me."</span> <span id="s2271">I say "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s2272">He say, "My army somewhere around here.</span> <span id="s2273">They full now here around.</span> <span id="s2274">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2275">Nothing going to happen to you, too."</span> <span id="s2276">He knew right away.</span> <span id="s2277">I told him how I got up there, and I sounded potato peats and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s2278">And I say, "Now I got to findtell me, where is your captain?</span> <span id="s2279">I want to talk to a captain, to anybody."</span> <span id="s2280">He say, "Let me first find him."</span> <span id="s2281">I don't know about the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2282">They go fight with the Germans and they don't know one from each other.</span> <span id="s2283">But finally they come up, and he was one of the Jewish captain.</span> <span id="s2284">And I told him who I am, how I come here, and what's is here, and who's Paskofki.</span> <span id="s2285">And to be sure, he asked me a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer.</span> <span id="s2286">I said, say, it's a song, it'sthe captain, Russian captain say, "I repeat it."</span> <span id="s2287">I say, "All right.</span> <span id="s2288">You okay.</span> <span id="s2289">Now I know you're not the enemy.</span> <span id="s2290">I am not afraid for you.</span> <span id="s2291">You're not do me any harm."</span> <span id="s2292">And he say, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s2293">And I tell him I want to gothe first thing to go to the

want to clarify, where was this area exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A:Zezmer.</span> <span id="s2381">Zezmer.</span> <span id="s2382">It is a little town.</span> <span id="s2383">It was one street, people living in one street.</span> <span id="s2384">And there it was between Vilnius and Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2385">And there is a lot of woods, and it's the only place we had to pick, because the Germans was afraid for the woods.</span> <span id="s2386">The woods is a trap for them.</span> <span id="s2387">They were scared to death.</span> <span id="s2388">When they already were in the woods and you seen a German group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it.</span> <span id="s2389">They don't go fight.</span> <span id="s2390">They scared.</span> <span id="s2391">They look for another place for to run.</span> <span id="s2392">And it's what happened also with them.</span> <span id="s2393">And we wereevery time we heardwe heard a shot, we were jumping

head.</span> <span id="s2395">You see that Paskofski had a lake, there's a lake on his land.</span> <span id="s2396">And we went there to swim and to lay in the sun.</span> <span id="s2397">It was foolish of us, too.</span> <span id="s2398">We could get shot.</span> <span id="s2399">A German plane could seen here we're having a good time laying in the sun, and here we got to still fight a war.</span> <span id="s2400">It they can shoot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q:You did this while you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A:In hiding.</span> <span id="s2403">It done like a fool, didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s2404">I just was worried.</span> <span id="s2405">And I told Eejicka (ph), I say, "Why are you in there?"</span> <span id="s2406">He was heading there on teaching the children.</span> <span id="s2407">You see, he didn't had nothing to do, and the kids he want to get educated.</span> <span id="s2408">He didn't have any books.</span> <span id="s2409">They didn't know the alphabet.</span> <span id="s2410">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2411">He only worked from the prayer book it's what they had.</span> <span id="s2412">He teach these boys how to read the alphabet.</span> <span id="s2413">And what he done, they been sitting under a little hole, and there was a ray toa ray from the sun coming down, and it's a wide clear place, and there he was sitting with these two boys, and he was teaching the bible.</span> <span id="s2414">And I tell him, "I am going to take a swim."</span> <span id="s2415">He say, "Don't need a swim."</span> <span id="s2416">Well, but I done it.</span> <span id="s2417">I done to the lake.</span> <span id="s2418">The next day I was smarter.</span> <span id="s2419">I talk to Paskofski, and I told him, "Would you make me a bath?"</span> <span id="s2420">And he done.</span> <span id="s2421">He laugh a little.</span> <span id="s2422">I say, .</span> <span id="s2423">What he done, he took rocks he had, he put the rocks with wood, special wood in with the rocks, which red hot from the heat, and there he been and giving mewe used to say a shoulder, a cold shoulder make warm.</span> <span id="s2424">And it was just the best, best moment in my life.</span> <span id="s2425">Many people ask me what I felt and what I want and what I used to at that moment.</span> <span id="s2426">I say the hottest and enjoyable and best thing that happened to me is getting the bath by Paskofski.</span> <span id="s2427">It give meit was terrific.</span> <span id="s2428">And then one day, I am sitting there.</span> <span id="s2429">I am walking in my office, and I take a look at farmer's wife crying, carrying on.</span> <span id="s2430">I say, "What's the matter, Mrs. Paskofski?"</span> <span id="s2431">She say they locked up her husband.</span> <span id="s2432">I say, "Who locked up?"</span> <span id="s2433">She say, "The Russian commander.</span> <span id="s2434">They locked him up.</span> <span id="s2435">They say he don't want to go in the army."</span> <span id="s2436">I say, "Tell him he's crazy."</span> <span id="s2437">Paskofski was a man already in the 70s, don't want to go in the army.</span> <span id="s2438">I say, "Let's go.</span> <span id="s2439">We'll take him out.</span> <span id="s2440">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2441">Don't cry.</span> <span id="s2442">I'll get him back."</span> <span id="s2443">I took and I had a jeep, put her in the jeep, and I went back to the place where we were in hiding.</span> <span id="s2444">And I got in Zezmer, in one of the places between Vilnius.</span> <span id="s2445">And I told them, I sayI tell them who I am, and I came in here to get Paskofski out.</span> <span id="s2446">I say, "Why are you taking and arresting a man who is already 70, time already to die, and you lock him up because they find out a hiding place?"</span> <span id="s2447">The man say thatthat captain, I don't know what, the major.</span> <span id="s2448">He say, "Well, you know what he done?"</span> <span id="s2449">I say, "He didn't done nothing."</span> <span id="s2450">He say, "What do you mean done nothing?</span> <span id="s2451">He took a bunch of drunks," and he say, "put them in a hole that they shouldn't go.</span> <span id="s2452">They had to go register for the army.</span> <span id="s2453">They didn't went to register for the army; they went to drink right there in the peats wherewhat you build.</span> <span id="s2454">And the first thing I don't know is you done it."</span> <span id="s2455">I say, "Why are you doing?"</span> <span id="s2456">I say, "Ask my question.</span> <span id="s2457">How it looks and what you want to know.</span> <span id="s2458">I ain't going to let you know from the peat, if the peat is right or is a wrong peat."</span> <span id="s2459">Well, and this gave meI say, "All right.</span> <span id="s2460">Tell me what ifwhat is in that place and what is that place."</span> <span id="s2461">I had to make a plan, and hey let him out.</span> <span id="s2462">And then I got Paskofski out.</span> <span id="s2463">I say, "Don't go out.</span> <span id="s2464">I'll take you back."</span> <span id="s2465">And it's 50 miles almost.</span> <span id="s2466">I took him back.</span> <span id="s2467">And anyway, I got Paskofski.</span> <span id="s2468">Now Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the troubles.</span> <span id="s2469">He told the neighbors that is the refugees running and hiding in here.</span> <span id="s2470">They been there and they messed it up and he get blamed.</span> <span id="s2471">But they took him in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q:Well, I was asking you if when you were in hiding before the liberation you had contact with any of the partisans in the area.</span> <span id="s2473">Did you ever run across them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't

was a lot of groups, big groups.</span> <span id="s2478">And then the farmer wasn't so anxious to give, and he told him a couple times, I say, "They don't want any monkey business.</span> <span id="s2479">They want food.</span> <span id="s2480">They're notthey'll take it alone.</span> <span id="s2481">When they'll take, they'll take everything that goes."</span> <span id="s2482">And they settled and they gave them food to eat.</span> <span id="s2483">And it wasn't such terrible.</span> <span id="s2484">But they were ready to fight with what killed a lot of them.</span> <span id="s2485">Thenot the Lithuaniansnot the Germans, but the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2486">The Lithuanians say, "Woods doesn't mean nothing, because they live in the woods.</span> <span

id="s2553">I knew I had to see a picture.</span> <span id="s2554">I see it, and it was terrible stage for my eyes.</span> <span id="s2555">Here is laying a hiding place with the man Monkey (ph), Monk's hiding place.</span> <span id="s2556">The namethey call the nickname Monk.</span> <span id="s2557">And he had the best possibility to make a hiding place, because they had a money, they had the
