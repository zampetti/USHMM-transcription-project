id="s21">After three days a man said to me you will have to work because if you don’t work, you’ll go crazy.</span> <span id="s22">So I worked in a wire cable factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">AK: In 1912.</span> <span id="s25">My mother died when I was three years old.</span> <span id="s26">We had a general store— cookies, seltzer, challah, sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s27">My mother was religious.</span> <span id="s28">By 16 I belonged to Hashomer Hatzair and my family didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">AK: Rozwadow.</span> <span id="s31">I had two brothers both of whom died in the war.</span> <span id="s32">We were brought up religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: Where were you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">AK: They took us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s35">We went to Yakutsk and we left in 1944.</span> <span id="s36">We had enough to eat but it was very hard and many people died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: Why did you leave Kenosha?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">AK: I spliced wires for bridges in a wire cable factory.</span> <span id="s39">I was a good worked.</span> <span id="s40">But I had a heart attack in Germany after the war and I also suffered from pleurisy.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">FK: In the camps my husband didn’t speculate because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s42">I had a small child [Perhaps these people, unwilling to take risks, had a way of thinking, of looking at life, that prevented them from making it big in America.]</span> <span id="s43">.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">AK: I was never a big shot and I’m not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">FK: When we came to Kenosha I didn’t ask for or expect anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">AK: Other people asked but we are different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">FK: In Siberia I adjusted and did whatever the Russians did.</span> <span id="s48">Whatever they told me was good.</span> <span id="s49">And this is how we survived.</span> <span id="s50">They liked us.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">When we came to Kenosha, they brought us chulent.</span> <span id="s52">I guess they thought we had to have chulent.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">AK: Americans!</span></p> <p><span id="s54">FK: Maybe they knew something from previous generations.</span> <span id="s55">We had a very good first impression of Americans because they were very nice.</span> <span id="s56">They came to see if we know how to eat.</span> <span id="s57">They gave us a banana and they said: “Oh, they know how to eat a banana!”</span> <span id="s58">Then an uncle of mine found us and said we should come to N.Y.</span> <span id="s59">So we visited and I saw other survivors were here too.</span> <span id="s60">So I said “I’ll be a greener like all the other greener.”</span> <span id="s61">I kept kosher because I went through too much to be Jewish and this is what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s62">But Hadassah had no Jewish friends, there was no Jewish school.</span> <span id="s63">She was the only Jewish girl in the class.</span> <span id="s64">I knew someone there whose child intermarried.</span> <span id="s65">The mother had a nervous breakdown; the father had a stroke.</span> <span id="s66">So I said, this is not for us.</span> <span id="s67">We stayed for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: Do Americans act differently than greener?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">FK: A daughter, an American, says to her mother “shut up!”</span> <span id="s70">And she went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A girl should come in and not say hello or good morning to her mother?</span> <span id="s72">The mother says “Hi” and she says “Shut up.”</span></p> <p><span id="s73">AK: But I believe in the sea you have all kinds of fish.</span> <span id="s74">I don’t think it matters if you’re American or not.</span> <span id="s75">But there are some differences.</span> <span id="s76">Americans can’t say no to a child.</span> <span id="s77">But I believe there are times when you have to say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">AK: I had a laundromat.</span> <span id="s80">I had it for eighteen years.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Do you think Americans like Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">AK: No.</span> <span id="s83">Who likes a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: Do you think a Jew could become president of the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AK: I’m afraid not.</span> <span id="s86">I think a black would be elected first and I would not vote for him, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WH: After everything you went through, Mr. Kessler, do you believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">AK: I don’t know; I think I’ll take the Fifth Amendment on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: Do you think He’s listening?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">AK: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s91">But my children are going in this direction and I see it’s good.</span> <span id="s92">But I don’t agree at all with what the religious do in Israel with movie theaters and shmittah laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: Do you ever dream about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">AK: No.</span> <span id="s95">Never, not even when I came here.</span> <span id="s96">She does, a thousand times.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Are you happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">AK: Yes.</span> <span id="s99">If I’m healthy, I’m happy.</span> <span id="s100">I had a lot of operations but I’m living.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: Do you worry about the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">AK: No I don’t worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">FK: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: Do you think a project like this is important?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">AK: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">We know that it won’t be long before all of us are dead and there won’t be any witnesses left to tell what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Conclusion of Interview</span></p>
