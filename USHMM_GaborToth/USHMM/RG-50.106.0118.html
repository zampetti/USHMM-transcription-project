<span id="s391">So the whole machine with everything was on the roof.</span> <span id="s392">So I and my sister were sitting eight days and eight nights behind this little wall, covered with black material, a pail of water and a bread, and we were sitting and hiding the childrens and we got our childrens.</span> <span id="s393">But not long they liquidate the ghetto, so I had to bring my child on to Auschwitz with my sister together.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Tell me about – you just said that they were going – they took the children from the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A:

<span id="s398">So, you know, not – not everybody was giving out the childrens, so they were sitting in the houses.</span> <span id="s399">So later the SS with the Jewish police came and they took out the childrens from the houses.</span> <span id="s400">This I was hiding on a roof, so they didn’t came on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What did Rumkowski say to the people?</span> <span id="s402">A: I can tell you, he was not a bad man, but he got to listen to the SS because he was the alteste der Juden.</span> <span id="s403">The SS gots with him t-t-to deal, what to do, what di – so he had to listen to them, if not, they would kill him.</span> <span id="s404">So he came out, he said we have to give over the childrens.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: At that point, did – do the Jews in the ghetto know where the transports were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: We didn’t believed, but we heard the rumors the childrens, they giving good, th-th – th-they giving to eat, and th-they – the childrens having foo – th-th – it was rumors.</span> <span id="s407">Th-The – the Germans da-da – la – get out th-the rumors.</span> <span id="s408">So we were thinking, after the war God will help us, we will have the childrens, we will have them.</span> <span id="s409">But when I came to Auschwitz, I saw none.</span> <span id="s410">Here is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Let’s stay in the ghetto just a little longer.</span> <span id="s412">When you – you just said a moment ago that there were rumors that the children would be okay, but you didn’t give your child, you hid.</span> <span id="s413">Why did you choose to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I liked to go with my child together.</span> <span id="s415">I would give away my child, I would – I would lose my memory, I would be crazy.</span> <span id="s416">So I was sitting eight days and eight nights with my sister, with her little boy was younger, he was about three years, mines was five.</span> <span id="s417">So we were sitting and my little boy, I said, Yankovek(ph), I gonna give you a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s418">He said, no Mama, save this, because I’m afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s419">Save this, let’s – because he got afraid we gonna eat up the bread, so we have – we gonna go down.</span> <span id="s420">And he was afraid to go down.</span>

cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We got cards for our ba – for the ri – the racials, yeah.</span> <span id="s432">So I was punished so th-th-tha – from where I gonna eat, where did they took me

save, Mama save for later, save for tomorrow, save, save.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: After that, how did you get rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Later, they gave me back the cards and

better.</span> <span id="s441">So they punished us, this much szpera(ph), we couldn’t get out, we had to stay in the house.</span> <span id="s442">You can’t – we co – we couldn’t go to cook, we couldn’t go – because we didn’t got nothing in the house, we have to go to the places where they got the gas, little gas stoves.</span> <span id="s443">So we were punished.</span> <span id="s444">This was szpera(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Was the ghetto different after the szpera(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, th-the ghetto was the same way til they liquidate the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Was the ghetto different after they took away the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Was like – like a cemetery, a few days after they took away the childrens in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s449">When you walked in the street, you can see the air was crying with us.</span> <span id="s450">I can’t express myself in English.</span> <span id="s451">Th-The atmosphere was so s-s – was terrible.</span> <span id="s452">Was not – not comfortable to see mothers crying about childrens.</span> <span id="s453">I was happy with my child, but I paid with hell for other mothers what they cried what they took away the childrens.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: When did you, in the ghetto, realize where those transports were really going?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: We didn't know where we are going, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Was there any question as to where those trains really went, while you were still in the ghetto, when they were doing the deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: So one – we were va – we walked into my sisters-in-law, and she was in bed.</span> <span id="s458">In the meantime she died.</span> <span id="s459">We didn’t paid attention to her, we left her in the house and in the bed, dead.</span> <span id="s460">So she got twins, so they – we took them with us together.</span> <span id="s461">So a policeman came to our window and he said to us, how long you are able to fight, fight, don’t go.</span> <span id="s462">I said, where we are going?</span> <span id="s463">He said they’re going to give us other clothes, paper clothes.</span> <span id="s464">They gi – gonna take away from us everything, but we gonna go to work.</span> <span id="s465">But he knew we gonna get killed, not to – but he told us in a nice way, how long you are able to fight, don’t go by yourself.</span> <span id="s466">But we go – we got no bribe and we had to go to ourselves and we took a – that time they liquidate the ghetto from the last people.</span> <span id="s467">Now, this was in July, August.</span> <span id="s468">In August, yes.</span> <span id="s469">So we went to

his three, I don’t know how many childrens, he took, this I give in to you, the rest you take by yourself.</span> <span id="s476">So they killed them.</span> <span id="s477">This was from

water.</span> <span id="s1074">They got the – they were – they got fish, so they got a little bit business.</span> <span id="s1075">But the – now the electric station is in the water, so they don’t have fish.</span> <span id="s1076">So they plant eggs – fi-fish eggs in another place.</span> <span id="s1077">So a truck with gasoline was broken and the eggs got full of the gasoline.</span> <span id="s1078">So they don’t have none of the future either.</span> <span id="s1079">So now she traveling to find out the situation for them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1080">My daughter is an

like to go back to your early years in this country, okay.</span> <span id="s1086">When you came to the United States, where did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1088">And they put me in to people from Poland because he knew I can speak yiddi – E-E-English and they spoke with me the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1089">And I lived there, I think a year or two years.</span> <span id="s1090">Was – was on the third floor, was very hard for me to bring up my little boy up there.</span> <span id="s1091">And was pitchy ceilings, I forgot re – I ju – to hit my head all the time.</span> <span id="s1092">So I moved to a regular apartment and I worked.</span> <span id="s1093">I make 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s1094">That time was 75 doll – cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1095">They took out three dollars for Social Security, so I got 27 dollars.</span> <span id="s1096">Later my husband found a place and my husband was making 50 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1097">So we start to save a dollar or two, so we bought a home in Scranton.</span> <span id="s1098">Later I sold the home, I made 10,000 dollars on the home and I had to leave it, my husband to Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1099">My husband is a very sick man.</span> <span id="s1100">He got asthma, emphysema and very serious arthritis, he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1101">So in Tucson, Arizona two months he got much better.</span> <span id="s1102">In Arizona it was one place only, a sewing place, so I went there for dresses.</span> <span id="s1103">So from the 120 dollars what I maked in Scranton, I maked over there 60, because the Mexican, this was very – this is the border for Mexico, the Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1104">So he told me, I’m paying only 40 dollars to them, but to you I’m giving 60.</span> <span id="s1105">I said, Mr. Grossman, I’m making double that they’re making because they came over to me to make them the cards, they were all here ba – about 20 - 30 years and they couldn’t work or speak a – one word English.</span> <span id="s1106">So he didn’t like this, so he told them to come give the cards to him, he is gonna make them out because we had to make out every day the amount what we maked.</span> <span id="s1107">But anyway, I said I would like a raise to Mr. Grossman because I am making double that they are making.</span> <span id="s1108">So he gave me five dollars a raise.</span> <span id="s1109">But later the r – I wor – I worked in oh, a little real estates.</span> <span id="s1110">Got a ga – a ga – university from 26,000 students, so I go – have got rentals for them, because from 60 dollars I couldn’t make a living and to raise childrens to give education.</span> <span id="s1111">So

is students.</span> <span id="s1113">Cheaters and ev-everything.</span> <span id="s1114">So I worked in my lit – my daughter was helping me, my husband, we cleaned th-the – the apartments.</span> <span id="s1115">But thank God I maked a living and I saved a dollar and my childrens graduate Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1116">My son, they send him to – to New York and he graduate the new

<span id="s1120">The Joint gave me 25 dollars every week, and they paid the rent, two months rent they paid for me because I went two months after, to work.</span> <span id="s1121">So I make 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s1122">So he paid the month til I can – I was able to save.</span> <span id="s1123">Yeah, this was I – this what I took from Joint, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q:

I loved Israel, I worked for Israel when I was 12 years old, and my husband was a Hasharah, he was starving and he is from – from a comfortable home, he got [indecipherable] home.</span> <span id="s1131">And he went to Hasharah to prepare himself to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1132">So my husband said fa – aha – ah – over the [indecipherable] I gonna stay here.</span> <span id="s1133">Malka’s married, Max is gonna get married, we are leaving to Israel.</span> <span id="s1134">So we left to Israel, and I bought in Israel a home for 13,000 dollars.</span> <span

dollars.</span> <span id="s1141">But I paid off – I paid two years la – thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s1142">Later I tuv – paid off the whole house for 13,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1143">And

dollars to – I took – my son got Bachelor degree.</span> <span id="s1147">So I took him to Israel.</span> <span id="s1148">When they saw I bought a house well, th – wasn’t – they wasn’t too happy, because they love America.</span> <span id="s1149">I was trying – Malka was that time 17 years, so she got one more year in high school, but she was an honor student.</span> <span id="s1150">So I tried with her to – to leave her in Israel, I would like her to have a cra – at least [indecipherable] another country college.</span> <span id="s1151">So we – we called to [indecipherable] the prin –
