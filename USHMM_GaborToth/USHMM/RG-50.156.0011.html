My mother’s education was probably of an elementary kind – elementary level.</span> <span id="s32">My father also was educated in a yeshiva, but he never received smicha.</span> <span id="s33">He was never ordained a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Now, this was at a time then when a Jew was permitted to enter a school to study accounting?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: It was under the German occupation during World War I that he studied accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: After that period, prior to the war, I suppose it would have been much more difficult for him to have that training, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: In Poland?</span> <span id="s38">It probably would have been possible between 1918 and 1933.</span> <span id="s39">Between ’33 and ’39 it would be very difficult, if not impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did your father convey to you any difficulties for him obtaining an education and practicing as an accountant in his community?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No.</span> <span id="s42">He did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What languages were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Our conversation language at home was Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Have you remained in touch with your Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">I speak, write, and read Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What about the religious orientation of your family.</span> <span id="s49">You said that your father had rabbinic training, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s51">My mother was orthodox.</span> <span id="s52">My father was liberal, probably comparable to the United States would be like Conservative.</span> <span id="s53">My mother attended services at the main synagogue in Radom, and my father attended services in a makeshift synagogue sponsored by the Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: So he was a Zionist then.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did he ever have a strong political philosophy that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My father was a general Zionist, and before the war was the president in Radom of the Keren Kayemet L’Yisroel, which is the same as what you call here the Jewish National Fund.</span> <span id="s58">My father was on very friendly terms with some of the members of the first Knesset, the first government in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: I take it that actually he was a Jewish activist from your earliest days, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s61">Chaim Greenbaum, who was the Interior Secretary in the first government of Israel, was a close friend of my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: And did he manage to impart this strong commitment to Jewish organization and Jewish values to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: We belonged to the Jewish youth organizations.</span> <span id="s64">I always belonged to a Zionist organization before the war, since my early days.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Then you were fully aware of what was going on in Israel then, in Europe, and the attitude of the world toward that…</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: …Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s67">I’m the product of an elementary Jewish day school and a Catholic high school in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s69">How was it possible for a Jew to attend a Catholic high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: The educational system in Poland was such that all high schools were government accredited, and the specialization of education started right after elementary school.</span> <span id="s71">Since my interest was in a business-oriented high school, I applied and was accepted to the only business-oriented high school in Radom.</span> <span id="s72">It was a Catholic high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: So the anti-Semitism at that point was not terribly pronounced, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: That’s a very difficult question to answer, because where do you draw the line?</span> <span id="s75">What’s the level of anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s76">The school I went to, for example, had 60 boys in the class of my grade.</span> <span id="s77">There were three Jews.</span> <span id="s78">Does that indicate anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s79">Or does it indicate the inability of the Jewish people to pay for their children’s education?</span> <span id="s80">There was a Jewish high school which was more of a classical oriented high school where would take Jewish kids only.</span> <span id="s81">Sure there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s82">In the school there was an element of anti-Semitism --on both levels -- not only on the student-body level, but on the teachers’ level.</span> <span id="s83">I can remember a professor of economics who stated unequivocally that there would be no Jewish problem or anti-Semitism in Poland if the number of Jews would decrease from 3,500,000 Jews in Poland to 50,000.</span> <span id="s84">He was wrong, because even now with less than 50,000, there is still anti-Semitism in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What about your formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Since I went to a Jewish elementary day school, my formal Jewish education consisted, on a weekly basis, to be able to recite the Sidra for the week, or the portion of the Bible for the week, in the language which it was written in, and translate it into Yiddish or Polish.</span> <span id="s87">I was able to read and translate the commentary to the weekly portion of the Bible, which was made by Rashi, and I studied Talmud and the prophets on a daily basis in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: This was the Jewish elementary school, so this is full time, your Jewish elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Was there any disappointment on the part of your father that you did not pursue a scholarly career or a career in the rabbinate?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What were your primary sources of information as to what was going on in the world at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I just read the Jewish newspaper every day.</span> <span id="s94">One of the leading newspapers was “Haynt.”</span> <span id="s95">Which in Yiddish means “Today.’</span> <span id="s96">It was published in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Now in the period from the mid-30s to 1941, what events, either within Poland or in the world at large, do you recall being aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Well.</span> <span id="s99">’41 is already too far of a distance.</span> <span id="s100">I think we have to talk from the middle ‘30s to 1939 -- September 1 -- when the war started in Poland.</span> <span id="s101">And I don’t know with that time-frame whether I could recall everything that happened.</span> <span id="s102">But I remember an incident in, I believe, Marseille in 1935, where the king or the crown prince of Yugoslavia was assassinated.</span> <span id="s103">I remember the time when Hitler came to power, when Hindenburg appointed Hitler as the Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Would you elaborate on that a little.</span> <span id="s105">What do you remember of that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: The concern of the Jews of an anti-Semite to come to power in Germany, and be accepted in that power by the president of Germany, Hindenburg, who was considered, at the time, a fair man.</span> <span id="s107">I remember the Spanish War in the mid-30s, the opposition to Franco and the various liberals enlisting to fight Franco.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were there Poles that took part in that International Brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s110">My contact with Poles was limited to my classmates in the school.</span> <span id="s111">I had no contacts with Poles outside of my school environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: The Jews you knew did not take part?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Some of the Jews took part in the International Brigade.</span> <span id="s114">Some of them volunteered.</span> <span id="s115">I remember very vividly the search of the young Jewish people who were Zionist-committed, of going to Achshera, in order to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s116">There was at least two such establishments in Radom, one sponsored by the Hashomer Hatzair, a Left-oriented Zionist organization, one sponsored by the Akiba, which at the time was a youth wing of the General Zionist Group B. I remember the Munich Agreement between Chamberlain and the Germans.</span> <span id="s117">I remember the time when the Germans walked into the Ruhrgebeit, a portion of which was occupied by France after World War I. I remember the time when Germany walked into Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you remember a sense of fear?</span> <span id="s119">A sense that things were closing in for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I don’t know if I was thinking in terms of things closing in for Jews as much as a continuous development and deepening of a resentment and open anti-Semitism against Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s121">I don’t know whether I had a sufficient understanding at the time of the impact those things might have had on the Jews in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Are you suggesting that the political turmoil which existed in much of western Europe created a climate which made anti-Semitism more acceptable within Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s124">And much more visible.</span> <span id="s125">Like, for example, I graduated from high school at age 16 in June of 1939.</span> <span id="s126">There was no chance for me to be admitted to a university in Poland, except that, before I graduated, the director of my school requested that my father comes to the school to see him.</span> <span id="s127">And he insisted that I apply to the University in Warsaw, and he will see to it that I will be accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Were there others who objected to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I never made the application, because the war came in September of 1939.</span> <span id="s130">And since colleges in Poland never started until October or November, I never had the opportunity to make an application.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Well we will come back to that, certainly, to the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s132">Let me go back a little.</span> <span id="s133">What about your contact with gentiles other than this experience with the principal of your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: It was basically limited to my school -- contemporaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Do you recall specific instances of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes, I can recall numerous instances of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Could you share some of those?</span> <span id="s138">Prior to the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: As part of a high school education in Poland, we had universal military training, which was a two or three-hour class every week.</span> <span id="s140">The classes were taking place in a special place for that purpose.</span> <span id="s141">We wore uniforms in high school, and the days when we had the universal military training, we wore the regular blue slacks and a khaki blouse on top of it with a wide belt.</span> <span id="s142">We used pens with ink, and the ink wells were in each desk.</span> <span id="s143">I took off the belt one day, and on the belt was written, “You dirty Jew.”</span> <span id="s144">Right by my classmate who sat behind me.</span> <span id="s145">Well, I did not let it go by without some argument and a fight.</span> <span id="s146">I can remember being insulted -- openly -- in the classroom with the teacher present -- by another student -- for being a Jew.</span> <span id="s147">I turned around, and in the presence of the teacher, got into a fight with that fellow, in the class.</span> <span id="s148">And the teacher’s only comment was, “Well, you Jews are very touchy about those things.”</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Was this sort of resistance to anti-Semitism something that your father instilled in you?</span> <span id="s150">That you needed to take a stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I just thought that I could not run away from being a Jew, and letting people trample on me just because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s152">And being the number one student in class, I felt that I was entitled to some respect, whether I was Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s153">So I did not feel that I could be pushed around just because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s154">And I did not allow the other Jews to be pushed around either, in my class, because I did have the sympathetic ear of the director of the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So there was a certain leadership responsibility that you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: I suppose you inevitably felt like an outsider in a non-Jewish school from the start.</span> <span id="s158">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Always an outsider.</span> <span id="s160">And always felt part of the environment.</span> <span id="s161">I had no contact with my non-Jewish friends other than the school.</span> <span id="s162">I must admit that we went to school six days a week, which included Saturdays.</span> <span id="s163">I did go to school on Saturdays, but I never went to school some Jewish holidays, so I always made arrangements with some of my non-Jewish classmates to drop off the assignments at my house.</span> <span id="s164">And it never failed that somebody would drop off the assignments of what happened in class the days which I missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So there was a certain degree of respect that you earned from others?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And do you think that was because you took a stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I would think so.</span> <span id="s169">Because I can recall in other classes, there was not that kind of a relationship between the Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you have relatives living outside of that community?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I had an uncle who lived outside of the community.</span> <span id="s172">All the other relatives lived in the community – all the close relatives lived in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: What happened to your uncle?</span> <span id="s174">Did you ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: My uncle lived in Lubicz, which is not far from Bydgosczcz, which was in the northwestern part of Poland around Posen.</span> <span id="s176">When the Germans occupied Poland, that part was annexed as part of Germany and the Jews were evacuated, and my uncle and his family were evacuated to Radom.</span> <span id="s177">So during the war, they were in Radom with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Now, if you would tell me please, about the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s179">You said you were sixteen, and you had just finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, the war started on September 1.</span> <span id="s181">As part of graduating from a high school in Poland, you had to report to the selective service.</span> <span id="s182">And having had the universal military training, you were entitled to be admitted to an officers’ school.</span> <span id="s183">Poland did not admit Jews to an officers’ school.</span> <span id="s184">So while we could not obtain the graduation certificate without having reported to the selective service, we were not accepted by the military either.</span> <span id="s185">We usually received deferments.</span> <span id="s186">I went through the process, and went through the selective service and received that deferment, and got my graduation certificate.</span> <span id="s187">When the war started on September 1st, the first thing we knew about the war was the first night the city was bombed.</span> <span id="s188">We did not live too far from the railroad station, and there were several bombs which fell between our building -- where we lived in an apartment building -- and the railroad station.</span> <span id="s189">It became so shattering an experience that the alarms for air attacks were going off and coming on very frequently, so that after two or three nights, we reached the point that nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s190">Anyway there’s no point of going to the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s191">The air raid shelters were usually canals or tunnels dug up in the back yard of the building.</span> <span id="s192">After about two or three days, my mother felt very nervous about those air raids, and she and my sister went to Prztyk, where she still had family living, and stayed there for about three days.</span> <span id="s193">During that period, I did go to the selective service, showed them my deferment, and asked them to be mobilized.</span> <span id="s194">I was refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: In other words, you were volunteering for the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s197">I discussed with my father the possibility of leaving Radom.</span> <span id="s198">Before doing that, I went on a bike and drove down to Prztyk to discuss it with my mother and sister, wearing the khaki uniform which I had from school.</span> <span id="s199">I saw the Polish army retreating.</span> <span id="s200">I got to Prztyk, and got my mother and sister back to Radom.</span> <span id="s201">It was in about a day or day-and-a-half, the Germans were in Radom.</span> <span id="s202">I think they got into Radom like September 7th or September 8th of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: I don’t imagine that your wanting to enlist was because of any sort of patriotism towards Poland!</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, the reason for enlistment was to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s205">It was not necessarily the feeling that I belonged there, because knowing that under normal circumstances I would not be accepted to a university in Germany, my plan was to go to a university in France, and sooner or later to wind up in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: But you felt that the top priority was to resist the German onslaught together.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s208">Stop the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What do you recall was the atmosphere in that time?</span> <span id="s210">What was the response of Jews in the community around you to this invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: It’s hard for me to say.</span> <span id="s212">I was too young to be part of the mainstream.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Do you recall any meetings in synagogues?</span> <span id="s214">Any organized resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: You cannot compare the synagogue-orientation of this country to synagogues in Europe or in Poland.</span> <span id="s216">The synagogue was not necessarily the moving point of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s217">The Kehilla, which is like a separate Jewish administration of the Jewish people within the general administration of all the people, was the focal point of Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Well now, you were in a Jewish quarter, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: We lived in an area where a lot of Jewish people lived, but it was not the so-called Jewish quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: The more affluent Jews lived in your area?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: So, you don’t remember any meetings of the Zionist organizations that were held to determine the stance of the people at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A; I don’t recall, but it would appear to me that the demoralization of the onslaught, and the speed of that onslaught, I don’t believe left much room, if any, for any congregating of people.</span> <span id="s224">Things happened so fast, the air raids were so frequent.</span> <span id="s225">I can give you an example.</span> <span id="s226">I had a great-grandmother who was alive at that time, who probably was about in the middle to late 80’s.</span> <span id="s227">She had lunch or dinner at her daughter’s, who had a family with six children, living in a large building with maybe several hundred tenants.</span> <span id="s228">And during the meal, my great grand-mother insisted that everybody leave the building right there and then -- that very minute!</span> <span id="s229">They all got out of the building, and within five minutes the building was bombed and everybody was buried under it.</span> <span id="s230">The building was on Walowa 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: How do you account for your grandmother’s awareness?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s233">That was my great grand-mother, who was finally sent in 1942 to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And I don’t suppose you ever heard any more from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Treblinka was only a one way ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Were there other events that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well my memory is not that good, to be able to recall every single incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Do you recall edicts issued by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well when you say “edicts” you are referring to what could be done, what we could do, what we couldn’t do?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">Laws that were passed?</span> <span id="s242">Measures that were taken to restrict your activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well there were many of those.</span> <span id="s244">The first thing, if I recall, as the Germans came in, within a period of two to three days, all radios had to be turned in.</span> <span id="s245">Since we all used shortwave radios, all Jews had to turn in all radios, under the penalty of death.</span> <span id="s246">Everything which was enacted was under the penalty of death.</span> <span id="s247">We could not walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s248">To pass a German, we had to walk into the street.</span> <span id="s249">We had to take off the hat and greet the German.</span> <span id="s250">Could not walk by a German with the hat on.</span> <span id="s251">Right after the Germans came in, they just went into the Jewish areas and caught as many as they could, able-bodied men, for forced labor, on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s252">Sometime at the end of 1939, I believe, we had to wear armbands with a blue star, on the right arm, under the penalty of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Were there attempts to hide the young men so they would not be selected for forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: That’s not a matter of “somebody’ hiding.</span> <span id="s255">Each one had to hide himself because at that time, there was no organized Jewish administration to provide people.</span> <span id="s256">That came later.</span> <span id="s257">The Germans just went from house to house, and picked up whoever they found.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Then were you in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s260">Many-a-days.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Would you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: It’s not a hiding on a permanent basis.</span> <span id="s263">Just hiding when you saw Germans coming.</span> <span id="s264">You tried to hide on the premise that maybe they won’t find you.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: But you remained within the community itself during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Tried to lead some kind of normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Continue with your education in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No.</span> <span id="s271">The education was over.</span> <span id="s272">There was no education.</span> <span id="s273">There was no way for education.</span> <span id="s274">There was no room for education.</span> <span id="s275">The matter of the need for survival was very great.</span> <span id="s276">For example, we had to stay in line to get bread.</span> <span id="s277">And we would stay in line like from all night long, and maybe wind up with no bread, but wind up with being caught by the Germans to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did this happen to you on any occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s280">That they will go through the bread lines and pick the young, able-bodied men and put them to work for the day without any food, without any bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So that was your first, personal encounter with the viciousness of the system?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Was your family relocated at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: If you are referring to another location, no, but we were relocated in Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Would you tell me about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I believe it was sometime in 1940 that all the Jews had to congregate in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s287">And since we lived in an area which was not part of the ghetto, we had to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">We actually had two ghettos in Radom.</span> <span id="s289">One was the large ghetto, which accommodated maybe 25,000 Jews, and one was the small ghetto, accommodating maybe 5-6,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s290">And the distance between the ghettos was maybe two, three miles.</span> <span id="s291">Once we were in the ghetto, we could not leave the ghetto without a special permit from the German authorities.</span> <span id="s292">You could not be found, as a Jew, outside of the ghetto without a permit, otherwise you were subject to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Do you recall any Jews being killed, sent away, for having a concealed radio, or for leaving the ghetto without a permit?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I don’t recall anybody with a concealed radio, but I can recall people, not by name necessarily.</span> <span id="s295">Who were killed for being outside of the ghetto without a permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So people were disappearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: They were not disappearing because the Germans would shoot ‘em and send the body back to the ghetto for burial.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s299">How did you maintain your existence on a daily basis?</span> <span id="s300">At this point, I suppose you father was no longer able to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: My father worked.</span> <span id="s302">One of his clients before the war was some Jewish people who owned a tannery.</span> <span id="s303">And since all Jewish businesses were taken over by the Germans, the German who was in charge of that tannery employed my father.</span> <span id="s304">So he worked in that factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: That must have been a great help to your family, that at this point they were able to work.</span> <span id="s306">What is your memory, then, of events at that time or subsequent to that time?</span> <span id="s307">Things took their course, I suppose, pretty quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: That’s a very broad question, which I don’t know if I can answer.</span> <span id="s309">I cannot relive that time period, and incidents which I might remember, I might not necessarily be accurate.</span> <span id="s310">It’s quite a few years back.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Well I mean the deportations began to occur then, from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: The deportations did not start until 1942, and there are several kinds of deportations.</span> <span id="s313">First of all, the Germans tried to put a fear into the Jews on every holiday, not necessarily Jewish holiday, but every holiday on which they thought they could antagonize the Jews.</span> <span id="s314">Like, for example, May 1st.</span> <span id="s315">There was always an action against the Jews on the night prior to May 1st.</span> <span id="s316">November 11th.</span> <span id="s317">There was always an action against the Jews November 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: What sort of action?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A; To get some Jews and send ‘em away, or kill ‘em, or some activity to antagonize the Jews, to put them in their place.</span> <span id="s320">In the early parts of the occupation, the Germans kept demanding money, payments.</span> <span id="s321">They would come to the -- at that time it was changed from a Kehilla to a Judenrat, which was the leadership of the Jewish community --and demand, for example, to receive two, three million zlotys, within 48 hours, or 72 hours.</span> <span id="s322">And those people would approach the rich Jews and assess them and collect the money and pay over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s323">It was not a daily occurrence, but a rather frequent occurrence.</span> <span id="s324">But the point was reached where the Jews were tapped out.</span> <span id="s325">They did not have any money left.</span> <span id="s326">So after that then, we were locked up in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s327">When I say “locked” in the ghetto, it does not mean that, like in Warsaw, we had a fence built around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s328">That was not so.</span> <span id="s329">The accesses were open, but if you were caught outside of that open access, you were in trouble.</span> <span id="s330">The Germans would come in periodically, and for example, if we had a curfew at 9 o’clock at night -- or 10 o’clock, I don’t remember what the curfew time was -- the Germans would walk through the ghetto, and whoever they would find on the street, they would just shoot ‘em.</span> <span id="s331">No questions asked.</span> <span id="s332">And there were incidents of that.</span> <span id="s333">And I don’t remember whether the May action was because of May 1st or was it because of April 20th, which was Hitler’s birthday.</span> <span id="s334">But in April of 1942, there was a knock on our door, and my father was arrested by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s335">It was still dark, it must have been like 3, 4 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s336">And we did not live too far from the headquarters of the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s337">So I got dressed and went out of the house to walk over to the Jewish police to find out what happened with my father.</span> <span id="s338">As I got to the street, I saw some Gestapo watching a block away.</span> <span id="s339">And when they saw me, they started to shoot with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s340">And I hid in a back yard of another house.</span> <span id="s341">Finally got to --when the curfew was over -- got to the police headquarters and to find out that they arrested many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s342">In addition to my father, they also arrested my uncle -- the one who was moved from Lubitz.</span> <span id="s343">And sometime during that morning, I was told that many of our people were shot!</span> <span id="s344">And the bodies were on the premises of the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s345">So I went over to the Jewish hospital to look at all the bodies, and my father’s body was not there.</span> <span id="s346">And within a day or two, we were advised that all the people who were not shot, were sent over to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s347">We did not know enough about Auschwitz at that time.</span> <span id="s348">We didn’t know anything about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s349">And about a month after they were sent out, a packet came to my aunt from Auschwitz of her husband’s clothing followed by a telegram that he had died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s350">And when she looked at the clothing, she could not believe it, because my uncle evidently used to undress with the shirt and the undershirt taken off at the same time.</span> <span id="s351">And the shirt and the undershirt were taken off at the same time.</span> <span id="s352">We did not know about Auschwitz, or what they were doing to people in Auschwitz, so we assumed that the telegram was a fake.</span> <span id="s353">If that was in April, then the sending of the people to Treblinka started, I believe in either July or August, 1942.</span> <span id="s354">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s355">And the first liquidation was made of the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s356">And whatever room there was left on the trains which they provided for the evacuation of the Jews, they went to the large ghetto and started to weed it out.</span> <span id="s357">We had some wind that they are probably having some action and picking up some young men and sending them away, so I hid.</span> <span id="s358">I went into hiding with some other young men.</span> <span id="s359">We hid on the grounds of the Jewish orphanage, which was outside of the ghetto, and we were not bothered that night.</span> <span id="s360">But as we returned to the ghetto a day later, we found out what happened.</span> <span id="s361">I had an uncle -- my mother’s brother -- with his family who lived in the little ghetto, and that day the evacuation took place at night, and they were all shipped out from the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s362">And I spoke to a friend of mine, a colleague who was probably a year below me in that Catholic school, who was picked up by the Germans for a working crew that morning to bury the bodies in the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s363">And there were about 900, maybe 1,000 people shot during that action.</span> <span id="s364">Among them was my uncle, his wife and two daughters.</span> <span id="s365">From the big ghetto, they shipped out the rest of my family that night, because the rest of my family lived at the very entrance of the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s366">And they were all shipped to Treblinka that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: How many of your immediate family were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I’ll have to count them.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: You had brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, all my immediate family was not affected, but my father had one brother who went with him to Auschwitz, and with a wife and two children.</span> <span id="s371">He had a sister with one child, a single sister, and a mother.</span> <span id="s372">My mother had a brother with his wife and two children, the one which I indicated to you, and a brother with a wife with one child.</span> <span id="s373">And everybody was eliminated that night, except for the second brother of my mother and his wife and the two children who did not live at that entrance to the ghetto, and one of my father’s brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s374">Otherwise, everybody else went to the gas chamber that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: They were deported that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Deported to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: At that point I suppose you didn’t really know where they were headed for.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, but within a few days we knew, because somebody jumped the train and came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And this person was believed?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s381">I did not speak to the person, personally, but from the information which came back, they were all sent to the gas chambers of Treblinka.</span> <span id="s382">I would assume that some of the people got that information from the Polish railroad workers who were routing the trains in and out of Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So at this point there was full awareness of the slaughter that you were all in for.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s385">Now about ten days later, or two weeks later, the rest of the ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s386">And we knew what was going to happen, because big floodlights were installed around the ghetto by the Germans.</span> <span id="s387">We had done several things.</span> <span id="s388">By “we” I’m referring now to my mother, my sister and myself, because my father was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s389">We found out that there was a work force maintained by the German army to do field work on a farm for their vegetables and food to maintain a supply area for them.</span> <span id="s390">And they had people whom they took with them, and who lived with them overnight.</span> <span id="s391">So we prevailed, and my sister was hired by these people.</span> <span id="s392">And she was sent out on that location, and she avoided the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s393">We packed the necessities, what we would be able to carry, because we knew that we would not be able to get back to our houses.</span> <span id="s394">I packed a knapsack, and my mother packed a satchel to carry.</span> <span id="s395">And at about midnight, we had to go out to an appell place --to one central place --for deportation.</span> <span id="s396">That place was lit up like midday.</span> <span id="s397">And there were many people shot that night, who did not get fast enough to that place.</span> <span id="s398">When we got there, there was a group of Gestapo people lined up --maybe ten groups.</span> <span id="s399">And all the people were behind them, 10, 15 feet away.</span> <span id="s400">And that individual that they had to approach, a Gestapo man, would check the work industry he was involved in.</span> <span id="s401">Then they made the decision whether that person would stay, or would go to be shipped out.</span> <span id="s402">I had a work pass that I was working in the tannery where my father used to work.</span> <span id="s403">My mother didn’t have any work pass.</span> <span id="s404">We had to approach the Gestapo man one person at a time.</span> <span id="s405">And as my mother was pushed to approach a Gestapo man --they were in full military gear with machine guns hanging from their shoulders -- I noticed one Gestapo man who I had met before.</span> <span id="s406">And I will describe in a moment how I met him.</span> <span id="s407">I pulled my mother back, and pushed her forward to that Gestapo man and walked over with her --even though I was held back by a policeman --and he let her through.</span> <span id="s408">And I was right behind her with my working pass, and he let me through.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: How did you know that man?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Sometime after my father was sent to Auschwitz, which means sometime in the early summer of 1942, a young woman came to Radom, to our house, who was evidently related to my mother.</span> <span id="s411">My mother had never seen her, I had never seen her, but that girl’s mother was a cousin to my mother, or that girl’s grandmother was a cousin to my mother’s.</span> <span id="s412">She came to our house and told my mother that she came here from a small town, Ostrowiec, not far from Radom.</span> <span id="s413">She had a special permit, and she said that she came here to meet a German for whom she used to work in Ostrowiec -- to see him -- and she had notified that German to come and see her at our apartment.</span> <span id="s414">Well, my mother was very distressed, very annoyed.</span> <span id="s415">But before she could express her misgiving, there walked in a civilian who was the German.</span> <span id="s416">Only later did that relative of my mother’s tell her that that German was a Gestapo man in Ostrowiec, foe whom she worked for a couple years as a maid.</span> <span id="s417">And she came here evidently on some favor which she expected from him for some Jewish people in Ostrowiec.</span> <span id="s418">When she went back to Ostrowiec --whether she accomplished her chore or not, I don’t know --but through that German she sent some pillows or some bedding for us.</span> <span id="s419">And one day I got a call, and when I say a call, I don’t mean a telephone call, but I mean a call by being told to report to the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s420">And one of the policemen took me down to this Gestapo man’s quarters, where he lived, and he handed me the package which that relative sent for us.</span> <span id="s421">That’s the only time I met him.</span> <span id="s422">The next time I saw him was in the deportation line -- and took advantage of it.</span> <span id="s423">That deportation took place one night for part of the ghetto, and the following night the rest of the ghetto was deported.</span> <span id="s424">Again, the ones who were left were put into what we called later, a small ghetto, part of the ghetto, which we lived in before, but limited to three streets and about two blocks long.</span> <span id="s425">We were pushed in there.</span> <span id="s426">The following night the rest of the ghetto was liquidated, and there were evidently some rooms on the train left again, so they came back for the ones which were selected to remain the night before.</span> <span id="s427">As we were assembling, again I saw this German, and he just automatically took my mother and me and put us with the group who stayed.</span> <span id="s428">When he came into that little ghetto a couple days later, I made it a point, when I saw him walk in, to go over to thank him.</span> <span id="s429">I had a gold watch and gave it to him, which he took, and I thanked him for saving us.</span> <span id="s430">And he said, “Well when you have that many lives in your hands, what does one or two lives mean?”</span> <span id="s431">I don’t remember the man’s name.</span> <span id="s432">I never saw him after that.</span> <span id="s433">But I was told later that he evidently was lenient with some other Jews, and the Gestapo sent him to the Russian front and he never came back.</span> <span id="s434">The next action after that, and I might be missing some, was on January of 1943, on a Sunday, if I recall.</span> <span id="s435">At that time, in the little ghetto, there were about 3,000 Jews left.</span> <span id="s436">They took us all out, and then they segregated the ones to stay and the ones to go.</span> <span id="s437">Basically, the ones to stay was based on the premise that either they worked for some German activities which were acceptable to the Gestapo -- more acceptable than others -- or they worked on an activity, or they were involved some place that they had permits to go to Palestine -- if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s438">Now my sister at that time was back in the ghetto, because while she stayed with the army -- for maybe a month or so after the deportation -- the Gestapo insisted that those people be moved back into the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s439">After the deportation, the Germans had accumulated a group of Jewish people to clean out all of the houses of all the belongings.</span> <span id="s440">And they segregated the furniture and the clothing and whatever money they found, or whatever gold they found, they segregated everything.</span> <span id="s441">And sometime in the fall, they requested from the Jewish administration to send them some people to count all the loot and segregate it.</span> <span id="s442">From the ghetto they sent out three people.</span> <span id="s443">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s444">We counted in the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s445">And the Gestapo officer who was in charge of the ghetto, a sergeant or an enlisted man over here, would sit with us all the time to segregate all the monies and the various currencies.</span> <span id="s446">As we were sitting there, we overheard Lt. Schippers call the ghetto to tell them to register all the Jews who had any relatives in Palestine or who ever had been to Palestine.</span> <span id="s447">That was about a month, maybe, before that action.</span> <span id="s448">When we heard that, all three of us approached him one day, with the permission of the sergeant who was watching us, that we do not have any documentation that we were ever in Palestine, and we were not, but could he instruct the ghetto administrator to put us on that list --which he did.</span> <span id="s449">We did not know it, at that time, whether that list is a good list or a bad list.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: (Laughs) That was quite a risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: But we did get on that list, and we survived that selection.</span> <span id="s452">The others did not.</span> <span id="s453">The others were sent to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s454">I would imagine that at that time they deported maybe a thousand people, maybe more.</span> <span id="s455">The next action, I believe, was on Purim.</span> <span id="s456">I think it was 1943.</span> <span id="s457">They requested that all the intelligentsia which was left has to report to the gate one day.</span> <span id="s458">They meant the doctors and the lawyers and the Jewish leadership of the forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s459">They put them on trucks and the next thing we knew, the following morning they took them out to Szydlowiec, which is about 15 miles from Radom, put them all in a forest outside of Szydlowiec and shot em with machine guns.</span> <span id="s460">One survivor escaped and came back to the ghetto to tell that.</span> <span id="s461">There were some incidents in between.</span> <span id="s462">At one time in the little ghetto, everybody had to be out to work.</span> <span id="s463">My mother used to work at that time in the kitchen as a cook for the people who would come back after work.</span> <span id="s464">There were also some shops which were sewing uniforms for the Germans, which were connected to the ghetto, and that kitchen was providing food for them.</span> <span id="s465">And one day in the afternoon -- my mother was back from work -- they round up all the people who were in the little ghetto, stand ‘em up in one place, and Lt. Schippers, who was in charge of the ghetto, picked out every tenth one -- and shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s466">My mother was in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So your mother was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, she was not a tenth one, but she was in that group of 100-150.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: So there were a series of narrow escapes.</span> <span id="s470">You’re a religious man, did you have the feeling that there was some sort of protection?</span> <span id="s471">(Laughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No, I can remember that we were herded out once to be counted on a Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s473">That hard labor was in a square, and there was only one gate, because that square was fenced in.</span> <span id="s474">We lived in one room, my mother and my sister and I and an uncle, and my brother-in-law -- who is now my brother-in-law -- and his mother.</span> <span id="s475">So there were six of us.</span> <span id="s476">We lived in a room which was probably ten by fifteen, maybe ten by eighteen.</span> <span id="s477">From that room, to get to the gate was close to the farthest away.</span> <span id="s478">so by the time we were routed out and we got to the gate, we were one of the last to get through the gate.</span> <span id="s479">There was a fellow who was behind me maybe five feet.</span> <span id="s480">My mother and my sister and I passed the gate.</span> <span id="s481">He didn’t.</span> <span id="s482">It was a bullet stopped him from getting through the gate.</span> <span id="s483">So there were a lot of close escapes, but I don’t know if religion ever entered my thinking, was it a coincidence, or was it luck, or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And then eventually you were among those deported to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Well, let me tell you one more quick incident, and then I’ll tell you how we got into a camp.</span> <span id="s486">My brother-in-law -- and I assume that you’re going to be talking to him, or somebody’s going to be talking to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Who is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Jules Zaidenweber.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Is that Dora’s husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Dora’s my sister.</span> <span id="s491">His family, originally, came from Lublin, and the concentration camp Majdanek was right outside Lublin.</span> <span id="s492">He had a young cousin who escaped from Majdanek and came to the hard labor camp of the little ghetto dressed like a peasant.</span> <span id="s493">A young kid!</span> <span id="s494">He must have been at the time, maybe, 15, 16, 17 years old.</span> <span id="s495">Dressed like a Polish peasant, came to the ghetto, smuggles himself in, from Lublin to Radom, stayed with us for a few days, and decided that’s not for him.</span> <span id="s496">He has to have the freedom.</span> <span id="s497">He smuggled himself out one night.</span> <span id="s498">A day later his body was brought back to the ghetto with a bullet between his eyes.</span> <span id="s499">I believe it was the fall of 1943.</span> <span id="s500">The concept of a hard labor camp, evidently was not acceptable to the Germans, because we still wore civilian clothing with the armband, even though we did not have freedom of movement.</span> <span id="s501">There was a group of Jews who worked in the munitions factory which was located outside the ghetto, and the people lived there.</span> <span id="s502">So what they did was expand the area around the munitions factory and liquidated the little ghetto, that hard labor camp, and then transferred us all to Szkolna Street, which was a new camp developed with barracks, and so on.</span> <span id="s503">That camp was behind barbed wire, with watch towers, with SS guards armed all the time.</span> <span id="s504">And the transformation from the hard labor camp to a concentration camp was not just a transformation, it was a move from an urban type of environment to a barracks type of environment.</span> <span id="s505">We were basically not treated much different than before, except that we were much more closer supervised, much closer watched.</span> <span id="s506">Before, we were not counted every day.</span> <span id="s507">Here we were counted twice a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Now did you say that you were transported to a different area?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Within the city.</span> <span id="s510">And we stayed there until, I believe July of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Was this technically a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes, it was a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And was there a name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No name.</span> <span id="s515">It was an aussenkommando, a part of the Majdanek concentration camp -- a division, a branch.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Was it essentially a work camp, a labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: It was still a labor camp, yes.</span> <span id="s518">We stayed there until July, I believe, of 1944 -- when the Russians got close to the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s519">And then we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s520">We walked.</span> <span id="s521">It was hotter than hell, and we walked from Radom to Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s522">Took us three days, under the SS guards.</span> <span id="s523">There were still men, women, and young people and older people, maybe 3,000 of us who walked.</span> <span id="s524">The people who could not walk were put on wagons drawn by horses.</span> <span id="s525">I had an uncle -- my father’s brother-in-law was one of the people who could not walk.</span> <span id="s526">And he was shot that night, the first night.</span> <span id="s527">We walked for three days.</span> <span id="s528">Got to Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s529">And the women were separated from the men.</span> <span id="s530">The women were put, if I recall -- and when I say recall, that’s from hearsay -- into a jail, and we were put in a huge hall.</span> <span id="s531">We were maybe 2,500 men, in a huge hall without any sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s532">In the middle of the hall, we made a sanitary facility out of it!</span> <span id="s533">And we stayed there maybe for two or three days.</span> <span id="s534">Then we were put on cars and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s535">In Auschwitz, we were taken off the cars --cattle cars.</span> <span id="s536">There were 50 prisoners to a car and three guards.</span> <span id="s537">The guards were the width of the doors, separated with wooden planks.</span> <span id="s538">There were 25 prisoners on one side and 25 prisoners on the other side, and the three guards were in the middle.</span> <span id="s539">In Auschwitz we were taken off the cars and the women were separated from the men.</span> <span id="s540">The men went through a selection process.</span> <span id="s541">I assume now that it must have been Dr. Mengele with some other German officers who picked out the young and the old, segregated them, and the rest of us were loaded back on the train.</span> <span id="s542">The young and the old were -- from what I know now -- sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s543">They did the same thing, what I was told, with the women, except with each child, they just picked a woman to act as the child’s mother, and put them in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s544">I have to retrack now and tell you about another incident.</span> <span id="s545">After the deportation, maybe in the fall of 1942, I worked in a factory which made wooden tables for the army.</span> <span id="s546">The German who owned that factory was friendly with the German who was in the tanning factory where my father used to work.</span> <span id="s547">He came up to me one day to tell me that there’s a letter addressed to me in the tanning factory.</span> <span id="s548">So the Pole who was working for this guy -- the tanning factory was in another part of the city -- went over to that tanning factory and picked that letter up for me.</span> <span id="s549">The letter was from my father from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s550">It was addressed and sent, written and signed, to a worker who used to work in that factory and also was sent to Auschwitz, but it was my father’s handwriting.</span> <span id="s551">And it was my father’s style of writing, to tell us that he’s alive, to tell is that he is in Auschwitz, and to ask us whether we could send him some food.</span> <span id="s552">Well we didn’t have much for ourselves.</span> <span id="s553">I prevailed on that Pole in that factory where I worked to get a package together.</span> <span id="s554">He took it over to the actual name of the people to whom that letter was addressed -- to send it to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s555">And they did send a couple packages to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s556">So when I got to Auschwitz in July of 1944, the women were separated and kept in Auschwitz, We were put on the trains to be shipped out that night.</span> <span id="s557">And looking out the window from that car I saw somebody behind the barbed wires, maybe 50 feet away, from my hometown.</span> <span id="s558">So I called through the little window whether he knows whether my father is around some place.</span> <span id="s559">He says, yes, he’s right in that camp where he is.</span> <span id="s560">And he brought my father to the wire -- to the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s561">So I approached the SS guard from that train where my brother-in-law and I were.</span> <span id="s562">And I told him that that’s my father behind those wires and I haven’t seen him in three years, will he mind if I get out and talk to him?</span> <span id="s563">He said, yes, he would mind, but what he would let me do is “Go on the other side of the train, and I will watch you.</span> <span id="s564">Let your pants down so that the people think you go to the bathroom, and you can talk to him.”</span> <span id="s565">And we visited maybe for 10, 15 minutes that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: How old was your father at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: That was in 1944, and my father was 47 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What kind of shape was he in physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, it’s hard for me to say, but he looked all right.</span> <span id="s570">He went through a lot of stories of a different nature, which I found out later.</span> <span id="s571">I’ll relate to you some of the stories which he told me.</span> <span id="s572">We were shipped out from Auschwitz that same night, and my mother and my sister were kept in Auschwitz and went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s573">We were sent to a camp outside of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s574">The name of the camp was Vaihingen, which was an aussenkommando of Natzweiler.</span> <span id="s575">Natzweiler was a major camp, like Dachau or Auschwitz or Buchenwald, which was located some place in the French-German border.</span> <span id="s576">And that was a branch of that major camp.</span> <span id="s577">We stayed there till April 1945.</span> <span id="s578">Then as the French came close to that area, we were evacuated and shipped to Dachau.</span> <span id="s579">The transport from the camp to Dachau, which is probably around 250 miles, took about a week.</span> <span id="s580">.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: What kind of conditions prevailed in the first camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Vaihingen?</span> <span id="s583">It started out all right as a labor camp, but then after a while, they shipped a majority of the people out to another camp not far away --Unterrixingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: What do you remember of the physical setting of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s586">We did not have any crematoria or any gas chambers.</span> <span id="s587">The people who died were buried in mass graves of 100 to 200 to a grave, with lime in between.</span> <span id="s588">Sometimes during that time, we were hit with a typhoid epidemic, and hundreds died.</span> <span id="s589">The camp which they created, and sent some people out of this camp, the majority of them died, and the bodies were brought back.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Those who were sent there with you, were they all young men, able to work, physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: In good shape?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The majority were young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Useful to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s596">Older people -- and right now, at my age, I don’t know what ‘older” means anymore -- (chuckles).</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: I suppose that at this point you had no knowledge of what was happening to your sister.</span> <span id="s598">Was your mother still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I had no knowledge about anybody.</span> <span id="s600">My mother was still alive.</span> <span id="s601">My mother was with my sister.</span> <span id="s602">And from there in April we were sent to Dachau, and we stayed in Dachau for about a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: What kind of processing took place when you arrived at these camps.</span> <span id="s604">Were you tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No.</span> <span id="s606">The tattooing was only done in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s607">To the best of my knowledge, there was no other camp which tattooed people.</span> <span id="s608">When we got to Vaihingen, we were just put into the barracks.</span> <span id="s609">When we got to Dachau, we had to go through an entlausung process.</span> <span id="s610">It’s a de-licing process.</span> <span id="s611">We got there the beginning of April, I think.</span> <span id="s612">We had to sit naked outside, leave everything except our shoes and belts.</span> <span id="s613">And go into the shower.</span> <span id="s614">Come out from the shower and dunk the shoes and the belt in a certain solution.</span> <span id="s615">Then we were given clean prisoner outfits.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: At that point, I would guess that you knew something about the gassing chambers, and that going into the shower must have been quite fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Was it fearful?</span> <span id="s618">I’m not so sure.</span> <span id="s619">We were not necessarily much concerned about life or death.</span> <span id="s620">The biggest optimist probably was thinking in terms that, “I would like to survive Hitler by one hour.”</span> <span id="s621">But it was not a matter of “I’m going to survive, period.”</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Are you saying that you became pretty fatalistic -- took things as they came, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Sure, certainly.</span> <span id="s624">It was the most one could dream of, and I thought that I was pretty forward-looking, that that was not a matter of, “Am I going to die?”</span> <span id="s625">but “When am I going to die?”</span> <span id="s626">And I would like to out-live that empire by about an hour -- to see them fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So you must have been consciously aware of having felt tremendous anger at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Well we saw the German newspapers -- a few days late, but we saw the German newspapers, because some of the prisoners worked for the Germans --in their barracks.</span> <span id="s629">So we did get some newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: What was the camp population, other than Jews?</span> <span id="s631">Were there political prisoners?</span> <span id="s632">Were there gypsies?</span> <span id="s633">Homosexuals?</span> <span id="s634">Baptized Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: In Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: …to your knowledge.</span> <span id="s637">In any of the camps that you were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Well the other camps were strictly camps which were like a movement of the same people from one place to the next, so they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s639">Once we got to Dachau, there was a mixture of everything, of everybody.</span> <span id="s640">There were criminals, there were political prisoners, there were homosexuals, there were Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span> <span id="s641">There were prisoners who were put in there to put a fear in them, Germans whom the system put in for a “training period” so that they will get back in line.</span> <span id="s642">There were Poles.</span> <span id="s643">There were Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s644">Not any other of the Allied Forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Were these people treated with the same contempt that was shown Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A; I don’t know if I can answer that.</span> <span id="s647">I don’t necessarily know, because in the month which was spent in Dachau, we were mostly in an isolated barracks.</span> <span id="s648">We did not mingle with the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s649">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s650">All I know is when we were evacuated from Dachau, they evacuated the Jews only.</span> <span id="s651">They did not evacuate the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: To what extent were you aware of systematic killings at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: After the “action” in summer of 1942, I was constantly aware that the policy of the Germans -- not necessarily policy, because I did not know about the policy --that the behavior is to eliminate the Jews, completely eliminate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Now, you continued to work at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: In Dachau we did not work.</span> <span id="s656">We’d just sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And simply waited for your extermination?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I don’t know whether we waited for our extermination, or we just sat and did nothing -- except go out on the “apell” place twice a day in the morning and the evening to be counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: They weren’t keeping you alive to work then?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: In other camps they did.</span> <span id="s661">In Dachau, no.</span> <span id="s662">To the best of my knowledge, at that time the gas chamber in Dachau was discontinued, so that they did not indiscriminately gas people any more.</span> <span id="s663">We’re talking now about April, 1945.</span> <span id="s664">So why they kept the Jews alive?</span> <span id="s665">I don’t know, because when they evacuated us from Dachau, we were probably destined to be killed, but it was too late in the game for the Germans to be able to complete that process.</span> <span id="s666">They put us at that time on a passenger train.</span> <span id="s667">And for the first time, we got -- as we were put on the trains -- overcoats, old Czech Army overcoats.</span> <span id="s668">No belts, but whoever could scrounge a piece of string to make a belt of it, it was great.</span> <span id="s669">We got stocking caps and we got a Red Cross box of candy, maybe candy and some figs.</span> <span id="s670">We were evacuated a month before the camp was liberated.</span> <span id="s671">And we were taken south of Munich, south of Dachau to Austria.</span> <span id="s672">The rumor had it at the time, that we were taken to a camp near Innsbruck in Austria to be liquidated there, because the gas chamber in Dachau, the crematoria in Dachau was discontinued.</span> <span id="s673">Once we crossed the German-Austrian border, evidently the Gauleiter of that section of Austria refused permission to let the prisoners in.</span> <span id="s674">Gauleiter’s the same as a governor here.</span> <span id="s675">So we were unloaded from the trains in Scharnitz, on the Austrian side.</span> <span id="s676">And as we were unloaded from the train, we could hear the radio blaring that the freedom-fighting people had taken over Munich, and that Munich is not more under Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s677">The SS people did not take notice of that, they just herded us together and walked us for several miles to some barns for the night.</span> <span id="s678">That’s in the Alps, so it was cold and snowy.</span> <span id="s679">We spent the night over there.</span> <span id="s680">I don’t remember whether we got any food or not.</span> <span id="s681">And as we walked out there, whoever could not make that walk was just left lying in the snow.</span> <span id="s682">And the following morning we were walked back to the railroad depot, and we noticed that the people who fell by the wayside the night before were dead -- just froze to death.</span> <span id="s683">Took us back to Scharnitz, put us back on trains, and took us to the border of Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s684">And as we crossed the border, we were unloaded from the trains facing a very steep mountain -- like a sheer rock --with a stream in front of it.</span> <span id="s685">The captain of the SS instructed us to walk towards that stream.</span> <span id="s686">It was in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s687">And he started to shoot the machine gun.</span> <span id="s688">A very elegantly dressed woman in a fur coat came along and attracted his attention, got him away, and the rest of the SS circled us around and told us to sit down or lie down.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Who was this miraculous woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s691">She must have lived some place not far away.</span> <span id="s692">We laid down there until about midnight.</span> <span id="s693">We woke up and noticed that the guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s694">Our only thought was that our best chance is to go towards the front line, which meant that from there we had to walk north back to Munich.</span> <span id="s695">Broke up into small groups, and I was with a group of 50 of us, and we walked towards Munich.</span> <span id="s696">We walked about three, four miles away from that place where we were at.</span> <span id="s697">We were stopped by a sentry, and we were in front of a German officer.</span> <span id="s698">He knew who we were, because we wore prisoners’ uniforms.</span> <span id="s699">“Where are we going?”</span> <span id="s700">“We’re going back to Dachau.</span> <span id="s701">The SS abandoned us.’</span> <span id="s702">So there was a captain of the SS, drunk or semi-drunk, who instructed to some.</span> <span id="s703">“Take ‘em out and shoot ‘em.’</span> <span id="s704">The superior officer was a major of the German army, who said, “Who told that SS captain that he’s in charge of that unit?”</span> <span id="s705">and that he will give orders.</span> <span id="s706">He says, “You see that mountain out there?</span> <span id="s707">Climb up that mountain.</span> <span id="s708">Stay there for a couple days and the situation’s going to get cleared up for you.”</span> <span id="s709">And that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s710">We climbed up that mountain.</span> <span id="s711">We found a hay hut in the middle of the little plateau on that mountain.</span> <span id="s712">All 50 of us climbed in there.</span> <span id="s713">We had nothing to eat or drink.</span> <span id="s714">We were eating the snow.</span> <span id="s715">We had to keep very quiet because Germans were walking by back and forth -- military -- with hand grenades on their belts.</span> <span id="s716">All they had to do was throw in one hand grenade in that hut.</span> <span id="s717">We spent there the first night.</span> <span id="s718">The following day the artillery bombardment was right over our heads.</span> <span id="s719">I could hear those cannons going.</span> <span id="s720">Spent the next night.</span> <span id="s721">It became quiet the following morning.</span> <span id="s722">Another fellow and I climbed to the end of the mountain, to what they call the precipice and looked down.</span> <span id="s723">And we saw some soldiers in different uniforms speaking a language which I did not understand.</span> <span id="s724">The other fellow spoke a little English, so we knew that they were Americans or English.</span> <span id="s725">And we climbed down the mountain.</span> <span id="s726">And then they told us to walk -- to walk away from the front line.</span> <span id="s727">That was someplace between Mittenwald and Garmisch Partenkirchen.</span> <span id="s728">And on the way, we saw like an M.P. in little jeeps.</span> <span id="s729">The M.P. gave me what, at the time, was a very little Hershey bar -- a nickel Hershey bar.</span> <span id="s730">And I ate that.</span> <span id="s731">I was sick like a dog!</span> <span id="s732">Now let me bring you up quickly on one thing, and then I’ll answer your questions.</span> <span id="s733">I was liberated on May 1st.</span> <span id="s734">I had not heard about my father or my mother or my sister -- nothing.</span> <span id="s735">When we were evacuated from Dachau, a friend of mine, who spoke English, somehow or other escaped the evacuation.</span> <span id="s736">Well he stayed in Dachau.</span> <span id="s737">There was a Jewish chaplain with the American Army who evidently realized the need to accumulate the information of the survivors -- all survivors, not only Jews -- in one place.</span> <span id="s738">.</span> <span id="s739">and that place was Dachau.</span> <span id="s740">So about six weeks after, about the middle of June, we get information from my friend that he saw a list from Bergen-Belsen, that my mother and my sister survived.</span> <span id="s741">We --my brother-in-law and I --worked in an American mess hall -- kitchen.</span> <span id="s742">Not that we were cooks, but we cleaned and stocked the corners.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: This is where?</span> <span id="s744">In Garmisch?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: For how long a period?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: About four months -- five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: I’ll bet you learned English very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: No, I did not learn English, because the chef spoke German.</span> <span id="s750">An American, but he spoke German.</span> <span id="s751">So we went on the train, and went to Bergen-Belsen to fetch my mother and my sister, his wife.</span> <span id="s752">And by the time we got to Bergen-Belsen, they were moved to another place, because my sister, evidently contracted typhoid right before the liberation, and for treatment, they moved them to Diepholz, I believe.</span> <span id="s753">And we finally found them there and brought them back.</span> <span id="s754">About a month later, the same fellow whom I saw in Auschwitz, who fetched my father to the wires, came through Garmisch.</span> <span id="s755">And he told me that he was evacuated with my father from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s756">And they went to a camp which was a branch of Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s757">Oranienburg was also a master camp, like Buchenwald, Dachau and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s758">And when the war was coming to an end, that camp was evacuated on foot -- about 3,200 prisoners.</span> <span id="s759">And they walked all the way down to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s760">And out of the 3,200 prisoners who walked that road, only 800 arrived alive.</span> <span id="s761">And he buried my father himself.</span> <span id="s762">Well, our thinking at that time was completely skewed.</span> <span id="s763">It was different than a normal person will react.</span> <span id="s764">And we accepted that.</span> <span id="s765">And about two weeks later, there was a knock on the door where we stayed, and I opened the door and there was my father!</span> <span id="s766">My father was liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s767">He did get to Theresienstadt, and he was liberated by the Russians in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s768">An officer liberated with him went to work for the International Red Cross, and he was stationed on the Czech-Polish border to interview the prisoners who go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s769">A fellow I was liberated with, from Garmisch, went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s770">As he crossed that check-point, this fellow asked him, when he showed his paper where he was from Radom, whether he knew about me.</span> <span id="s771">He says, “Sure.</span> <span id="s772">He was liberated with me near Garmisch, and that’s his address in Garmisch.</span> <span id="s773">So my father’s friend went back to Theresienstadt the following day, gave my father my address.</span> <span id="s774">My father packed his stuff up, got on the train and came to Garmisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: How do you account for that story, that the man had buried your father?</span> <span id="s776">Simply a mistake?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Well there were so many people who got killed on that march, and we did not necessarily look the same as we look today.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So you were reunited.</span> <span id="s779">At that point you didn’t know yet, I suppose, about your mother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: My mother and my sister were fetched by my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s781">I told you that.</span> <span id="s782">So at that time, we were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Now, did you try to draw any conclusions about why these members of this one family survived when so many others did not?</span> <span id="s784">It doesn’t seem like pure chance.</span> <span id="s785">Do you suppose it had something to do with a mental attitude that was perhaps installed in you when you were young?</span> <span id="s786">I’m thinking of the strength with which you became a leader in school and spoke up, and the time you pushed your mother through, and support that you seemed to win from others, even from members of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s787">Do you suppose this could account for your survival and that of family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I am not a fatalist on one hand.</span> <span id="s789">I’m not a synagogue or religion-oriented Jew on the other.</span> <span id="s790">And when I say that I am a committed Jew, I am a committed Jew in a different way than a religious Jew is.</span> <span id="s791">I don’t know whether it has anything to do with determination, or leadership, or the ability to get your point across.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">Maybe the element of survival is so strong that, mixed with anything else, it takes precedence.</span> <span id="s794">While I have never been afraid to die, to this day, if I can do something to prolong it, I will try to do it.</span> <span id="s795">Like when I saw my father in Auschwitz, we did not talk about whether we are going to survive.</span> <span id="s796">We did not know how long the war is going to last.</span> <span id="s797">But the agreement which we had made, is that if we survive the war we will never go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s798">We’ll meet in Germany.</span> <span id="s799">So it was never a thought in mind to try to go back to Poland, because I knew that if my father survived, that’s not the place we’re going to meet.</span> <span id="s800">We’re going to meet in Germany.</span> <span id="s801">Because there was nothing for us to go back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: How do you feel about those who go back?</span> <span id="s803">Who believe in returning, to live in those countries that deported them and exterminated their relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: It’s hard for me to find an answer to that, because it’s a very comfortable way to live, with all its disadvantages.</span> <span id="s805">I believe that if you live in a country where you were born, where you know the pros and the cons, you know the anti-Semitism on the one hand, but the abilities on the other.</span> <span id="s806">You know what you have to cope with.</span> <span id="s807">You know the surroundings --the streets and the houses.</span> <span id="s808">It’s a very comfortable feeling.</span> <span id="s809">It’s very difficult to come to a strange place where you don’t know anybody, and you have to make a life on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: But you admitted that you were always an outsider in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: That’s fine.</span> <span id="s812">But it was still a comfort.</span> <span id="s813">Because we always had a maid who was Polish and not Jewish.</span> <span id="s814">There was always an element that I was better off than the guy next door.</span> <span id="s815">I don’t think it’s any different than the old people in this country who refuse to move away from the North Side.</span> <span id="s816">It’s comfortable.</span> <span id="s817">It’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: But their lives haven’t been threatened there to the same extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: But that’s past history.</span> <span id="s820">People forget fast.</span> <span id="s821">They want to be comfortable today.</span> <span id="s822">It hasn’t worked in Poland because I have spoken to some people who went back to Poland -- and got out very fast.</span> <span id="s823">Stayed in Poland for two-three-four months, maybe six months and then came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Well, I think it’s quite accurate that everyone has a need to return -- to trace their steps -- emotionally and physically.</span> <span id="s825">At some point.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I never felt that way.</span> <span id="s827">I always cut the past and look to the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Now, would you say that, for the most part, concentration camp survivors became concerned with success once they came to this country?</span> <span id="s829">Was that an issue for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I don’t know if I can answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Because it seems to me that money became an issue at some point.</span> <span id="s832">When you were quite young, money was connected with survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: With me?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: For all those within the ghetto walls.</span> <span id="s835">At times one had to purchase one’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I was never concerned about money -- when I was young, or today.</span> <span id="s837">Or when I was working towards success in this country.</span> <span id="s838">I was never concerned about money.</span> <span id="s839">That was not my main consideration.</span> <span id="s840">When I got off the ship in New York with the little I knew about the CPA, it was my thinking that whatever it takes, I’m going to become a CPA in this country -- but not from a monetary point of view.</span> <span id="s841">I cannot speak for the group as a whole, but in my particular instance, it was always that I’m going to do the best with the ability that I have, and whatever that “best” may be, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s842">I did not know the limitations then, I do not know the limitations now.</span> <span id="s843">But I’m going to take advantage of whatever I can accomplish with my abilities, without taking advantage of other people.</span> <span id="s844">I never take advantage of other people to blow my own horn, to push ‘em aside to get ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Going back to the concentration camp experience, you and others were living in conditions that were primitive.</span> <span id="s846">Were there instances in which one felt dehumanized, in which one had to think of oneself and disregard the needs of others?</span> <span id="s847">Did this become a reality for you?</span> <span id="s848">Self-preservation at all cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A; I don’t know if I can answer that properly.</span> <span id="s850">There is an element, probably, of self-preservation.</span> <span id="s851">And I have seen it happen.</span> <span id="s852">We used to get maybe two-thirds of a pound of bread a day, but instead of giving it two-thirds to a person, we would get a load of two pounds for three people to divide.</span> <span id="s853">And I have seen a father and two sons who would take a string and weigh the bread to make sure that everybody gets not more, not less than a third.</span> <span id="s854">And maybe that’s right.</span> <span id="s855">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s856">I’m not able to judge the behavior of people under that kind of circumstances.</span> <span id="s857">I was in the camp together with my brother-in-law and an uncle.</span> <span id="s858">And everything I could do to see them through, or to be with them all the time, I would try to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So the family connection was terribly important.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: And I understand the concept of the skin being closer than the shirt, but I don’t know where you draw a line.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t know where to draw the line today, and I certainly don’t know where to draw the line under the circumstances of forty years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Well, I think you mentioned not judging others, I think you referred to that.</span> <span id="s863">I guess that’s one way one survives emotionally.</span> <span id="s864">It’s not to become judgmental of others -- to accept the fact that we do the best we can under these horrible circumstances -- all of us do.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Some of us have more strength and more courage than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: I have seen friends of mine who couldn’t stand the pressure and would take cyanide --kill themselves -- in the camps.</span> <span id="s868">And cyanide was accessible because the type of work they did, there was cyanide with it.</span> <span id="s869">But it takes all kinds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Was there anything in your Jewish tradition -- in your upbringing as a Jew --which made survival in this camp experience easier for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span> <span id="s872">as a matter of fact, there were times when I questioned the whole concept of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s873">And I don’t know whether, if I would be faced with a similar situation, whether I would not again question that concept.</span> <span id="s874">Because I looked at it as, “Am I as a Jew, policeman of the moral values of the world?”</span> <span id="s875">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s876">I cannot answer that question.</span> <span id="s877">And when I tell you I’m a committed Jew, I am.</span> <span id="s878">I would be very disturbed--very disturbed -- I don’t know how far I would go, at the moment, because I was never put to that test -- if one of my children would intermarry.</span> <span id="s879">I might take a step which I might regret the rest of my life, but I might be willing to take such a step.</span> <span id="s880">And not because of the commitment as a Jew, but maybe because of having suffered as a Jew, I want to stand up.</span> <span id="s881">And not only under Hitler, but having suffered as a Jew even in Poland, before the war.</span> <span id="s882">I don’t want to lose, or to see lose, because of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s883">When I am opposed to intermarriage amongst the Jews, it is not because I think that the Jews have to survive as Jews, but if there is any moral value to survive as a people different than the others, then we don’t have the right to throw that away.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And that gives some meaning to your suffering, and your survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s886">Now I am not necessarily observant.</span> <span id="s887">But if I am at an organized gathering where they serve pork, I will refuse to eat it.</span> <span id="s888">And not from a religious commitment, but those people have to know that I am a Jew, and as a Jew, I do not eat pork.</span> <span id="s889">They cannot make an official function where they invite Jewish people, and serve pork.</span> <span id="s890">That might sound crazy, but that’s the way I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Now, would you say that this feeling, that preservation of the Jews as a distinct and separate people, has some meaning?</span> <span id="s892">I think you did out it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: It has a meaning to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And that you would like it to have meaning to your children.</span> <span id="s895">Do you feel this is any kind of burden for your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No.</span> <span id="s897">Because I always maintained with my children, that unlike the majority of the people of my generation, if they are going to reject it, they are going to reject it, not out of ignorance, but out of knowing what they are rejecting.</span> <span id="s898">So they went to Talmud Torah for ten years.</span> <span id="s899">They went to Israel a couple times.</span> <span id="s900">They were involved in Jewish activities and Jewish organizations, and if they want to reject it, that’s their privilege, but they know what they are rejecting.</span> <span id="s901">But they’re not going to reject it because they don’t know what it’s all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Have you always shared the experiences you had as a victim and as a survivor with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Not to the extent I shared it with you today.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: But to some extent, was that important?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: It probably was more important to them than to me.</span> <span id="s906">An incident of a couple, three weeks ago…my daughter is a lawyer on Wall Street in New York, in the tax department of a large law firm, and she went with a partner to a client who’s a German firm in New York.</span> <span id="s907">And after they left the law firm, in the middle of Wall Street, she tells that partner in the firm that she feels very uncomfortable in the presence of middle-aged German men.</span> <span id="s908">And he says, “Didn’t you hear the name of the individual who you were talking to?’</span> <span id="s909">She says, no.</span> <span id="s910">“His name is Von Ribbentrop.</span> <span id="s911">He is the son of the foreign minister of Hitler Germany, who was evidently a baby at the time, because he must be in his middle to late forties.</span> <span id="s912">And our daughter says that all her color drained from her face.</span> <span id="s913">She was speechless.</span> <span id="s914">Both of our children shlepped through Europe, the older ones, when they were in college.</span> <span id="s915">And the only reason they went to Germany is because my mother is buried in Germany.</span> <span id="s916">Otherwise they would not have gone to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: So they have all remained committed Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Do you believe in any Supreme Being -- at this point in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: If you’re talking to me in a physical sense, the answer is no.</span> <span id="s921">If you’re talking to me in an abstract sense -- strictly abstract -- as far as order and recurrence of the seasons, of the growing period or something -- in other words, there has to be some order.</span> <span id="s922">Whether it is controlled by a being, or whether it is controlled by nature, there’s some order in our environment, in our lives.</span> <span id="s923">But if you’re going to tell me we are all made in God’s image, I don’t necessarily know whether she is black or white.</span> <span id="s924">(chuckles)</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Your daughter would like that.</span> <span id="s926">(laughter) But of course your survival and your very existence is an affirmation of this life force, this force in the universe that you’re speaking of, is it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s928">That’s why I’m qualifying my response to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Do you believe that films and books about the Holocaust reflect the experience accurately?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: I told you before that I have not spoken to anybody as extensively about it as with you.</span> <span id="s931">I also mentioned before that I do not live in the past.</span> <span id="s932">I always live in the future.</span> <span id="s933">I have not read any books about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s934">I get too upset.</span> <span id="s935">I saw the movie, The Holocaust, which is the only movie I saw on T.V., and while certain portions of that movie were very true and to the point, and I thought that they would be helpful and understandable to the population as a whole, certain portions of that movie are a farce.</span> <span id="s936">And while I appreciate the fact that they have to sell to an audience, and they have to bring in some interesting points which deviate from the norm, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s937">Depending on which side of the table I sit, I would probably have to give you a different feeling about it.</span> <span id="s938">Overall, I think that I would have to accept it that The Holocaust film would probably be helpful and understandable by the outsiders.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Was it the heroism of the Jewish partisans that made you uncomfortable?</span> <span id="s940">Something about the Germans that you felt was invalid?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I felt invalid, for example, the wedding ceremony in the forest.</span> <span id="s942">I don’t remember in detail the movie any more.</span> <span id="s943">I was not concerned about the heroism of the Jewish partisans, but I was concerned that they did not necessarily reflect the enmity of the Right Wing partisans against the Jews.</span> <span id="s944">Who were betraying the Jews to the Germans because they would not let them in.</span> <span id="s945">I’m not necessarily sure that some of the portrayal of Theresienstadt is correct.</span> <span id="s946">I have no question that that orchestra was in existence, but not to the extent that they were showing.</span> <span id="s947">But, overall, I cannot judge those things from my personal viewpoint of view in comparing them to my experiences, because that’s unfair.</span> <span id="s948">I think I have to look at this from a point of view, “How’s this going to affect an audience which does not have the background which I have?”</span> <span id="s949">And overall I have to say that it’s probably going to make a good impression on the average audience.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Do you feel as if people in this society, for the most part, are willing to deal with the reality of what happened in World War II?</span> <span id="s951">Or do you think that we all experience massive denial syndromes?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I have no basis to make that statement.</span> <span id="s953">But I would think that the younger Jewish people as a whole, in the majority, is apt to reject the life in the past much more than our Christian neighbors, because I believe that the Christian people, on the overall, are interested to find out about the Jews whom they have never known well enough, and are interested to find out the trials and tribulations, so much of which has been shown in the press.</span> <span id="s954">The Jewish youngsters, on the other hand, are not necessarily interested to warm up old stuff which is history, to influence their thinking and their behavior at the present.</span> <span id="s955">I’ve no statistical backing to make that statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Well, it’s an interesting statement.</span> <span id="s957">And then, there’s the fear again, of being isolated because of who you are that I suppose increases the denial factor.</span> <span id="s958">You know, Elie Wiesel has written about coming to this country.</span> <span id="s959">And by the way, I was going to ask you, was there any question about going to Israel, or any other country?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: After the war?</span> <span id="s961">Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s962">I was very much of a Zionist idealist before the war.</span> <span id="s963">My father was in Palestine in 1935.</span> <span id="s964">We had a younger brother who died in ’34 as a young child.</span> <span id="s965">He was maybe six, seven years old.</span> <span id="s966">My father was in Palestine in 1935, and he went on the premise that maybe we would move to Palestine, because he always was a very active, and committed Zionist.</span> <span id="s967">He came back not to move.</span> <span id="s968">And when you look back now, the reason for not moving was at that time valid, right now it’s not.</span> <span id="s969">The major reason which he was giving at the time for not moving was that since both my sister and I were that much more advanced in school in Poland, if we would move to Palestine, we would have to take a set-back maybe for a couple years in our education.</span> <span id="s970">Maybe that’s not the whole truth at the time.</span> <span id="s971">Maybe part of the truth was also that his standard of living would have to decrease, or his earnings capacity would have to decrease, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s972">I have no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s973">Then, after 1948, Israel was certainly a light at the end of the tunnel, except that I had reached a stage where I was thinking in terms that in order to go to Israel, you have to be one of two people: either a capitalist, which I was not, or an idealist, which I was not any more, either.</span> <span id="s974">I had to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s975">I was not going to stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s976">And I was willing to go any place.</span> <span id="s977">And not until 1948, when this country enacted the law admitting 200,000 DPs without reference to points of origin, did I consider coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Where were you for those three years then?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: In Germany.</span> <span id="s980">Four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: In a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No, I lived in Garmisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And what did you do during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: I went to school for a bit.</span> <span id="s985">I worked.</span> <span id="s986">I taught a little accounting to some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: You learned German?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: I spoke German fluently before the war.</span> <span id="s989">In high school in Poland you had to learn a foreign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Okay, so that law was passed, and then you decided to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: The law was passed.</span> <span id="s992">My mother had died.</span> <span id="s993">And my father and I decided to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And your sister came at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: No, my sister and her husband came about a year-and-a-half later.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: What made you come to Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I did not have a choice in that matter.</span> <span id="s998">I registered with the International Refugee Organization at that time, and like with the Russians now, each community had to accept a certain number of DPs.</span> <span id="s999">And being Jewish, my registration was turned over to HIAS, and HIAS assigned me to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1000">I’d never heard of Minneapolis before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: And I gather you’ve maintained your strong association with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1003">I have.</span> <span id="s1004">I have been the president of the Minneapolis Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s1005">I have been on the Board of Directors of the Minneapolis Federation of the J.C.C. All the years around here, I’ve been active in Jewish causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Well, certainly, here, a very general question, but I will throw it out.</span> <span id="s1007">After your experience during the Holocaust, describe to me your general feeling about human nature, whether non-Jew or German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: If I came out with anything from that experience, I came out with the thought that you cannot hate a group as a group, because hate breeds hate.</span> <span id="s1009">I cannot say that every single German is bad, or every single Jew is good, because there were incidents of Germans as individuals, who were pretty good.</span> <span id="s1010">When there were two of them together, they were bad.</span> <span id="s1011">So even though I would not buy a German product, I would never own a German car -- my wife goes into a store, and if she likes something and it’s made in Germany, she will not buy it, no matter how much she likes it -- I cannot accept the concept of saying that all Germans are bad, that, for instance, that a German doesn’t belong with the Jewish experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And one more thing.</span> <span id="s1013">Elie Wiesel has written so movingly about the experience of coming here as a survivor, and feeling a wall that separated him from others who had not had the same experience.</span> <span id="s1014">He was not able to speak or write about it, he said, for ten years.</span> <span id="s1015">Did you have this sense of separation from others who had not lived through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I don’t know if I can answer you there.</span> <span id="s1017">I don’t know if I had time to give that consideration when I came here, because my first thought, when I came here, was to find a job.</span> <span id="s1018">I was met at the train depot in 1949, when I came here by the Jewish Family and Children’s Service -- a representative from that organization.</span> <span id="s1019">My father and I came here, and they gave us a check and put us up in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1020">My only thought was to do two things, (a) is to learn how to speak English, and (b) is to get a job so that I will not take charity.</span> <span id="s1021">I came here in June, so there were no places to learn English.</span> <span id="s1022">Whatever classes there were, they wouldn’t start until September.</span> <span id="s1023">I had to find as way to learn English by myself.</span> <span id="s1024">So by the time September came around, I was too advanced to take classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Well I did it in two different ways.</span> <span id="s1027">I got a job through the Jewish Family and Children’s Service, pressing pants, within a week or ten days after I came.</span> <span id="s1028">And never took a dime from anybody since then.</span> <span id="s1029">I was paid 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1030">It was a hot summer!</span> <span id="s1031">It was hotter than hell out there.</span> <span id="s1032">And with that big pressing machine it was maybe 160 degrees, instead of 100.</span> <span id="s1033">But I was young.</span> <span id="s1034">It didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1035">There used to be a cheap movie theatre downtown.</span> <span id="s1036">I don’t remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s1037">Around 5th and Hennepin, where I think they showed two features for 25 cents.</span> <span id="s1038">I would go to that movie
