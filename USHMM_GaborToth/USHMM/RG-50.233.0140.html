but one, the eldest child, died when I was born in 1927, from scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s28">So before war we were seven in all --- five children, three brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s29">Before the Revolution my father began to work at the age of eight years, when a little boy, when his mother died.</span> <span id="s30">I don’t know how to say it in English; it’s a long story to tell because you should know the history on the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s31">It was under Polish influence.</span> <span id="s32">It was an estate of the Pulitz (ph?)</span> <span id="s33">or the Polish Count; and the shtetl, the villages, were working for that estate, for the castle of the Pulitz.</span> <span id="s34">My father was taken to a merchant who bought cattle far distance, and they buy food.</span> <span id="s35">He was a cowboy; simply he was a cowboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Interviewer: Like he drove cattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Moise Weiner: Cattle from Warsaw to Ukraine, from Moldavia to that place and so on.</span> <span id="s38">So he was a cowboy; and before the Revolution he was a cowboy or the help of the merchant of the cattle.</span> <span id="s39">After the Revolution he had no profession; he was an unqualified worker.</span> <span id="s40">It was very hard for him to earn money for a living; to feed seven people, seven mouths.</span> <span id="s41">So we helped when we were boys; we sold papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Interviewer: Newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Moise Weiner: Yes, you know the song, “Bagelach Koch Par Terrosin” (ph?)</span> <span id="s44">?</span> <span id="s45">So it was boys (?)</span> <span id="s46">.</span> <span id="s47">My eldest sister worked at the plant.</span> <span id="s48">The main aim of our family, because my parents were illiterate people, true they knew Yiddish, but they went to the Cheder, and they went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s49">But in Russian they didn’t know the Russian language.</span> <span id="s50">They couldn’t write, couldn’t read.</span> <span id="s51">My father was 54, maybe 56, when he started to speak Russian, to read the newspaper; that’s all, to sign his name.</span> <span id="s52">Before the war he worked at market as a tax collector.</span> <span id="s53">That was his last job.</span> <span id="s54">I want to say that they spoiled us; the mother and father, especially my mother.</span> <span id="s55">That not obliging us; but simply it was a saying, “If I had a pen in my hand, I would … (?)</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">It was a very poor region.</span> <span id="s58">The people were very poor there; not a ghetto, but a slum.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Interviewer: Was it an agricultural region?</span> <span id="s60">Did people work farms or was it in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Moise Weiner: In the city, in the city, in the city.</span> <span id="s62">It’s an agricultural region, but the city had some plots.</span> <span id="s63">We survived in the great hunger of 1932.</span> <span id="s64">I was by death already in 1932.</span> <span id="s65">But we managed how to survive that hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Interviewer: That was a very bad time, I know.</span> <span id="s67">I studied about the famine in the Ukraine at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Moise Weiner: It was not an easy living.</span> <span id="s69">But the main aim of our family, of my brothers, to get an education; because it was the only way to make a good life, to get away from the Jewishness, from that Judaism that was, did not gave way to the social life surroundings because there was no Jewish social life.</span> <span id="s70">You couldn’t become an engineer studying Yiddish.</span> <span id="s71">You couldn’t become a doctor studying Yiddish.</span> <span id="s72">You could become a doctor, and engineer if you studied Russian or Ukrainian because there were universities and institutes, and the schools were in Russian or in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s73">I started at a Ukrainian school; I know the Ukrainian language.</span> <span id="s74">So it was like nail in our brains to get education.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Interviewer: Your parents encouraged you to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Moise Weiner: To study, yes, and the war delayed a bit.</span> <span id="s77">My elder brother got hired; he studied as an economist when he was 40, when he came after the war.</span> <span id="s78">I started by correspondence because I had to make a living, to work.</span> <span id="s79">As the Bible says, a boy who provides himself is not enough.</span> <span id="s80">So I never felt myself enough, to be enough, because I began to work.</span> <span id="s81">So everybody of us get high education.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Interviewer: How much older were … were you the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Moise Weiner: I was the youngest of the boys.</span> <span id="s84">My sister that was killed, her name was Yeva (ph?)</span> <span id="s85">.</span> <span id="s86">And my younger daughter who came with us now to the United States, I named her after my sister.</span> <span id="s87">She is Yeva.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Interviewer: How much older were your brothers than you were?</span> <span id="s89">Your older brothers and sisters, how much older were they: Moise Weiner: Well, my elder sister was ten years older than me.</span> <span id="s90">She was 24, and I was 14 when we left.</span> <span id="s91">My elder brother was six years older, and my second brother was three years older.</span> <span id="s92">Depart in 1941 and never get together again.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Interviewer: Your brothers, you were separated from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Moise Weiner: We were separated all our life.</span> <span id="s95">They were in the army.</span> <span id="s96">The second brother we didn’t know if he’s alive until 1947, because we had no information about him.</span> <span id="s97">He went away with the boys and perished.</span> <span id="s98">The elder brother found us, me and my sister.</span> <span id="s99">There was a special office in Buguruslan, in the creation office, and we gave our address there.</span> <span id="s100">He, from the army, made the inquiries, and they sent him our address, and he found us at the end of 1941.</span> <span id="s101">That brother couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s102">He couldn’t find him until 1947.</span> <span id="s103">We lived in separate, different town, cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Interviewer: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Moise Weiner: After the war, yes.</span> <span id="s106">My sister stayed in, there was such a town, Orsk in Orenburg Region.</span> <span id="s107">And she got married and get her work too, oculist (?)</span> <span id="s108">in Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s109">She lives now here, there, all her life there.</span> <span id="s110">I was a bit a tramp and changed many cities in my life.</span> <span id="s111">But most the second half of my life I lived in, with my wife and my children, in the center of Russia.</span> <span id="s112">It is not far from Volga, there’s such a town, Penza --- Saratov, Penza, Kuybyshev (Kuibyshev)/Samara --- that’s the triangle with Vyonetsk (ph?)</span> <span id="s113">.</span> <span id="s114">It is a place where practically without Jews because in that place, before the Revolution, Jews were not allowed to live.</span> <span id="s115">In Penza Region, the population of Penza Region is about one and a half million.</span> <span id="s116">They’re mostly Russians, a million and two hundred fifty thousand are Russians; the rest are Tartars and Mordova (Moldova, Mordva).</span> <span id="s117">The rest in official information is given ten thousands: that’s Georgians, Estonians, Syrians, Jews, and so on, Gypsies, and maybe it’s a thousand or two thousand Jews from that number.</span> <span id="s118">But most of them are assimilated Jews; no Jewish life at all.</span> <span id="s119">So I can say that I am an assimilated Jew in the Russian culture.</span> <span id="s120">I’m a Russian writer.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Interviewer: That’s what you did after the war?</span> <span id="s122">You became a writer?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Moise Weiner: I studied; I became a teacher.</span> <span id="s124">I studied at an Institute of Foreign Languages.</span> <span id="s125">I learned the English language, and I worked at school and then as an interpreter, a translator at the plant; and tried to become, it’s not so easy to become a writer in Russia.</span> <span id="s126">Well, I worked, I like to say for work; I worked to gain money to feed my family, to keep my family.</span> <span id="s127">Then I worked for myself at the table writing books.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Interviewer: For this, the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Moise Weiner: Well, it’s not the only; I’m an author of seven books, and I translated.</span> <span id="s130">When I was in the age of 56, I learned Yiddish myself, and I translated from Yiddish into Russian some novels of Jewish writers.</span> <span id="s131">And I had my own books, and I’m still a member of the Union of Russian Writers.</span> <span id="s132">I was a member from 1964, so it’s about 30 years.</span> <span id="s133">So we lived separate.</span> <span id="s134">My brother returned to Vinnytsya, my sister stayed in Octuvist (ph?)</span> <span id="s135">, Kazakhstan, and I lived in Russia.</span> <span id="s136">The last four years I lived not far from Moscow.</span> <span id="s137">I was ten years in refuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Interviewer: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Moise Weiner: I was refusenik.</span> <span id="s140">Ten years, they didn’t allow me to go.</span> <span id="s141">I appealed in 19… I showed you the photo when we forced, they are standing in 1982, I came to Vinnytsya.</span> <span id="s142">We met, all because I was a year in refuse, and I was waiting for permission to go.</span> <span id="s143">And we met.</span> <span id="s144">It was ’91 I appealed first to leave the country because I wanted to go away from there.</span> <span id="s145">I managed to get away only this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Interviewer: How long ago did you arrive in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Moise Weiner: Three months and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Interviewer: So you got here when?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Moise Weiner: In January, the 11th of January.</span> <span id="s150">See, the 11th is, how to say it, arakavua (ph?)</span> <span id="s151">, it’s such a number.</span> <span id="s152">The 11th of July in 1941 I left Vinnytsya, and in the 11th of January I left Russia too.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Interviewer: That’s right, symmetry.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Moise Weiner: I don’t remember what is the English word for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about Vinnytsya when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s156">What kind of town it was like?</span> <span id="s157">Were there a lot of Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">It was before the war, it was like Berdychiv (Bardichev, Berdichev, Berditchev, Berditchov, Berdyczow) that’s the Jewish town.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Interviewer: Very high Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span> <span id="s162">It was a Jewish town, mostly Jewish town, and I spoke Yiddish in my family.</span> <span id="s163">We were a Yiddish family.</span> <span id="s164">But in the street with my friends, it was a Jewish street, a Jewish region, a Jewish settlement, Jerusalemka (ph?)</span> <span id="s165">.</span> <span id="s166">It was a mixed language: Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian, not a pure language.</span> <span id="s167">At school I started Ukrainian; all of us, we started in a Ukrainian school.</span> <span id="s168">I think that it was about, maybe half of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s169">It was about maybe 45,000 of Jews in Vinnytsya before the war; and 36 of them were killed; 36,000 were killed, approximately.</span> <span id="s170">Nobody knows the exact number.</span> <span id="s171">But you see even after forty years after the war, when you have married and children, it recovered; it restored only to 10,000.</span> <span id="s172">It didn’t recover the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s173">The remains of that population left for Israel; most of them.</span> <span id="s174">The son of my elder brother is the last now who stays now in Vinnytsya, but he applied for …</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Interviewer: To leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Moise Weiner: To leave --- he wants to go to the United States, not to Israel.</span> <span id="s177">Well, so when he leaves, nobody of our relatives … Interviewer: The last of the relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Moise Weiner: Yeah, it’s the last of the relatives in Vinnytsya.</span> <span id="s179">But my sister is in Kazakhstan, and her son is in Leningrad; that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Interviewer: Do you remember any instances when you were growing up of anti-Semitism: Moise Weiner: In Vinnytsya?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Interviewer: In Vinnytsya.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Moise Weiner: Only, only, how to say, in the street maybe; but there was no state anti-Semitism before the war.</span> <span id="s183">You can call it, it’s not anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s184">There were many Jewish schools in Vinnytsya.</span> <span id="s185">There was even a college, a Jewish college.</span> <span id="s186">But they lost their students, not because of anti-Semitism, but because of the trends of assimilation; because the main trend of the Jewish life was to become assimilated.</span> <span id="s187">It was theoretically approved by Marxism, because there was no Israel before the war.</span> <span id="s188">The only way to become cultured, educated people was to become, so the Marxists said, and it was the politics of the state, because it was a Marxist state, to help the Jews to become assimilated in the surrounding culture, the Russian Ukraine.</span> <span id="s189">So it was not an act of anti-Semitism, but I would say quite contrary.</span> <span id="s190">It was the desire to help the Jews to get away from that life they led because they were not educated; they had no profession, no skill.</span> <span id="s191">They were mainly shopkeepers; not shopkeepers, but petty shopkeepers.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Interviewer: That’s bourgeois?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Moise Weiner: No, it’s not bourgeois.</span> <span id="s194">It’s you bought a chicken; our neighbor, she bought a chicken, alive.</span> <span id="s195">In our family we didn’t eat poultry from the shops.</span> <span id="s196">My mother used to go to the market to buy live chickens, and I, as the youngest, my duty was to go with them to the shochet; if you know what’s that.</span> <span id="s197">It was a special synagogue.</span> <span id="s198">The synagogue was demolished in 1936 or ’37, but not as an act of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s199">It was an act of religious; because not synagogues, but churches, Polish kosciols, they were closed and demolished, too.</span> <span id="s200">There is a special --- do you know what is kashrut?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Interviewer: Kosher, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Moise Weiner: Kosher, so if you want to have kosher poultry you have to go to a special man who killed with a razor; it was called shochet.</span> <span id="s203">He was in the neighborhood with the synagogue.</span> <span id="s204">But when the synagogue was demolished to the ground, his box was left; and I brought him the poultry, usually two chickens.</span> <span id="s205">But our neighbor, she bought a chicken.</span> <span id="s206">She cleared from the feathers and cut it in four pieces and went selling it to the neighbors.</span> <span id="s207">It was her living.</span> <span id="s208">So, is she petty bourgeois?</span> <span id="s209">This was the trade.</span> <span id="s210">In our house was a metal worker, I don’t know in English.</span> <span id="s211">The other was a kersak (ph?)</span> <span id="s212">; furs, hats and clothes from fur.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Interviewer: A furrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Moise Weiner: A furrier, artisans maybe.</span> <span id="s215">The second was a glass-maker, windows.</span> <span id="s216">He put glasses into windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Interviewer: These people all lived in your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Moise Weiner: On our street.</span> <span id="s219">It was such people.</span> <span id="s220">The most educated one in our street was an account.</span> <span id="s221">That was the intelligentsia of our street, that’s all.</span> <span id="s222">That was our street.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Interviewer: Do you remember what your street was called, the name of the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Moise Weiner: The name of the street was called Niznagrazdowska (ph?)</span> <span id="s225">.</span> <span id="s226">Now the street does not exist.</span> <span id="s227">I showed you --- no street.</span> <span id="s228">Shalom (Sholom, Sholem) Aleichem was the second.</span> <span id="s229">It does not exist now.</span> <span id="s230">A bit, three house on the second half maybe are left from Shalom Aleichem Street.</span> <span id="s231">That’s all; so, a very nice town, very green.</span> <span id="s232">A river, a very nice river, The Southern Bug (Buh).</span> <span id="s233">I had many friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Interviewer: Were most of your friends Jewish or were they …?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Moise Weiner: Jewish, Jewish.</span> <span id="s236">Most of them were killed.</span> <span id="s237">My best friend, his name was Reva Drakob (ph?)</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">He and his father, they stayed in the town, were taken for hard labor, and they worked for the Nazis not far from Kiev; dug in the earth, I don’t know exactly what.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Interviewer: Ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Moise Weiner: Ditches.</span> <span id="s242">And my friend, he was a boy with my age, maybe he was fifteen or sixteen already.</span> <span id="s243">He began to quarrel with the --- not the supervisor, but with kapo I don’t know what --- Ukrainians, policemen; and he was killed with a spade, my friend.</span> <span id="s244">And his father became mad seeing that.</span> <span id="s245">After the war I came to Vinnytsya, and they found the family, the mother; and she did not allow me to greet her husband, the father of my friend, because not to disturb him.</span> <span id="s246">One of my best friends, he has the same name as me, we were sitting the same desk in school seven years.</span> <span id="s247">Do you understand what’s friendship, if you are sitting seven years?</span> <span id="s248">He was killed during the war, and his mother, when she met me in the street, she began to beat me.</span> <span id="s249">She went into hysteria, she became hysterical; why he’s killed and you are alive.</span> <span id="s250">But she didn’t understand what she says, but she knew me from the boyhood.</span> <span id="s251">So most of my friends were killed during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Interviewer: Did you go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Moise Weiner: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Interviewer: You went to a public school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Moise Weiner: I went to --- the Jewish schools were public schools.</span> <span id="s256">They were not private schools.</span> <span id="s257">They were state schools, as the Ukrainians and Russians, but I told you that first, I wanted to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s258">But then my elder sister, she took me away from there because she wanted to make, not a career, but to make life better.</span> <span id="s259">You have to go to, not only me, but everybody decided.</span> <span id="s260">I went to, my brothers, me and my sister, we all went to Ukrainian schools; started in Ukrainian schools, it’s not public.</span> <span id="s261">But before the war there were three Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s262">But if in our class, in the seventh class, were maybe 40 pupils in one class; in Jewish school were only five.</span> <span id="s263">And one of my friends who went to the Jewish schools, he said that we are lucky because we are asked by the teacher maybe once in two weeks; and he had to prepare his lessons every day because they are only five pupils in the class.</span> <span id="s264">It was before the war, but maybe at the beginning of the war they are full.</span> <span id="s265">After the war, no Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s266">The main language in the streets was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Interviewer: Hebrew or Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Moise Weiner: No, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s269">Hebrew was not in favor; it’s loshn-koydesh (Lashon HaKodesh), it’s only for the prayers.</span> <span id="s270">But every day was Jewish, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s271">Therefore, Ukrainian or Jewish was the language.</span> <span id="s272">After the war, maybe 50 years, I had Jewish speech;

Ukrainian bread, that’s all we had with ourselves for three days.</span> <span id="s418">He told us for three days it would be enough for you.</span> <span id="s419">You would go somewhere.</span> <span id="s420">I don’t remember, I was a boy;

that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Interviewer: Your father threw you on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">He saved me my life; give me my life for the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Interviewer: As far as you knew, the train was just going to go to Kuybyshev; and that’s as far at it would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Interviewer: How long did it take you to get from Vinnytsya to Kuybyshev?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Moise Weiner: We didn’t get to Kuybyshev.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Interviewer: You never made it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Moise Weiner: We were bombed.</span> <span id="s455">Not far from Vinnytsya was a satcha (ph?)</span> <span id="s456">station of Sinivka (ph?)</span> <span id="s457">.</span> <span id="s458">We were bombed there, and then after that we met the sisters of my sister’s groom; they were in the army.</span> <span id="s459">And we stayed in the hospital with them, in a military hospital.</span> <span id="s460">And after that, they put us in an echelon of wounded; my sister and his two sisters, as medical sisters to help the wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Interviewer: That was going to the East?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Moise Weiner: To the East, yes; and we managed to go only 18 or 16 kilometers from that station.</span> <span id="s463">We met the German tanks, five tanks.</span> <span id="s464">They began to shell the locomotives, stopped him, set him the fire.</span> <span id="s465">We didn’t understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s466">We thought it was bombing, simply bombing.</span> <span id="s467">We didn’t catch it; the Germans are here already.</span> <span id="s468">So, but when we looked out, we saw five tanks approaching and shelling the echelon; and they shelled every, setting fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Interviewer: Was this train marked as a wounded train, like a Red Cross on it, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Moise Weiner: Do not remember.</span> <span id="s471">It was cars, like, not passenger cars, but we called them Japluski (ph?)</span> <span id="s472">.</span> <span id="s473">That’s for cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Interviewer: Cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Moise Weiner: Cattle car or for foods; not food, but car for products, produce --- freight.</span> <span id="s476">And there were shelves, mid-shelves, and the wounded were lying on the shelves and on the floor --- both sides.</span> <span id="s477">And we were helping them who was without in the head, with legs, and very hard wounded.</span> <span id="s478">And they set every car in fire; and who could run, they jumped out, and we ran away.</span> <span id="s479">And those who could not run, could not move, they perished in that fire.</span> <span id="s480">So, it was such an experience, yeah.</span> <span id="s481">So after that, we ran by foot, maybe 24 hours, running from ….</span> <span id="s482">Those tanks, they were running after us and tried to shell, how to say it, to kill you with the shell, the running soldiers.</span> <span id="s483">They were playing; the aim was like shooting.</span> <span id="s484">And we were running about 24 hours; don’t stop.</span> <span id="s485">After the war, I found that there was when we went to such a town, Uman, on the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s486">And after the war when I was writing that book about the war, I learned that the Germans surrounded three armies from that town.</span> <span id="s487">It was called the Uman cattle.</span> <span id="s488">They took like 100,000 soldiers and officers, only like prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s489">But we managed to get out from that loop.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Interviewer: From the trap?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Moise Weiner: From that trap; and we went out, not to the east, but to the south, southwest [was more likely southeast] to the railroad, such a town, Pervomays’k. And from there we caught a train; it was maybe weeks, (??)</span> <span id="s492">.</span> <span id="s493">So we never came to Kuybyshev.</span> <span id="s494">We came to Kuybyshev after two months, maybe, of moving; but they didn’t wait for us.</span> <span id="s495">So we went further to the Urals.</span> <span id="s496">We wanted to go to the middle Asia, most of them.</span> <span id="s497">Most of the echelons were directed to the middle Asia, but when we sprang out from the tanks running, I was in a shirt and the trousers, and my sister was in a thin summer dress.</span> <span id="s498">And that was all we had on us.</span> <span id="s499">And after two months, we were shabby and lousy, without money; and we decided to stop our running not far from Orenburg.</span> <span id="s500">And one of our sisters, a girl, she got a job in Orsk; and we lived 10 people in such a room.</span> <span id="s501">And there it was at the end of September ….</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Interviewer: Now Orsk is in the Urals?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Moise Weiner: Yes, it’s in the South Urals.</span> <span id="s504">It is on the river Ural.</span> <span id="s505">It is the frontier between Europe and Asia; so you can stay in Europe, cross the bridge, and you are in Asia.</span> <span id="s506">So I lived on two continents; it’s divided.</span> <span id="s507">That town is situated on both sides of that river, and that’s in Europe and in Asia.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Interviewer: When you arrived there, what did you do?</span> <span id="s509">Did they put you to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Moise Weiner: My sister got a job, and I found a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Interviewer: What was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Moise Weiner: My first job was a terrific one.</span> <span id="s513">I was a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Interviewer: You were about 14 at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Moise Weiner: Fourteen, yes.</span> <span id="s516">I was more than 14 because I was born in May and that was in September; and 14 and three, four months.</span> <span id="s517">I went to (don’t know what it is in English) tshicago (ph?)</span> <span id="s518">; what’s tshicago, how they call that cattle is killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Interviewer: How they kill cattle?</span> <span id="s520">A slaughterhouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Moise Weiner: Slaughterhouse, yes;

the hind part of a cow, frozen, with such a knife.</span> <span id="s525">I had to clear the meat from the bones, and it’s a great skill to put the knife between the bone and not the meat; but if you know if meat.</span> <span id="s526">You know that between the bone and meat is some layer …</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Interviewer: A membrane.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Moise Weiner: A membrane; and if you do not put your knife between the surface of the bone and that membrane, you will suffer a great deal because you will not cut … Interviewer: Hard to cut it.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Moise Weiner: Yes, hard to cut.</span> <span id="s530">I had not the skill to do it, and it was heavier than I myself and frozen.</span> <span id="s531">On the 10th day, I put the knife into the fingers, and I got blood infection.</span> <span id="s532">So it was blue, my hand.</span> <span id="s533">I went away from that.</span> <span id="s534">After when they healed my hand, I went to sewing --- not fabric --- it was enterprise, so … Interviewer: This is where they built sewing machines?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Moise Weiner: No, no.</span> <span id="s536">It’s where sewing uniform for the army --- women mostly; and I started.</span> <span id="s537">First I was an apprentice, and then when I was 15, I became master of the shift because the grown-up were called to the front.</span> <span id="s538">And I and three other boys were the gang that had to check regularly to repair the machines.</span> <span id="s539">So I was a qualified master at 16.</span> <span id="s540">At 16, I had the highest qualification, the eighth qualification for master.</span> <span id="s541">And there I worked all the war until 1945, until I was called to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Interviewer: And you were called into the army in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Interviewer: What time of year; do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Moise Weiner: It was after the war.</span> <span id="s546">I was 18 in May, and it was in June or July.</span> <span id="s547">In August I was called to Leninburg (ph?)</span> <span id="s548">[perhaps Leningrad].</span> <span id="s549">It was in August already.</span> <span id="s550">But I did not serve in the army.</span> <span id="s551">I was called to Lindacher (ph?)</span> <span id="s552">Academy, and I did not manage to get into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you were in, in Orsk; what it was like at that time during the war?</span> <span id="s554">Were there lots of hardship, was there much food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Moise Weiner: No; it is … if you know the history of Russia, maybe you know of the Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko.</span> <span id="s556">Taras Shevchenko was in exile in that town, last century.</span> <span id="s557">When he was in that town, he wrote about it.</span> <span id="s558">It is a town where nothing to hank (?)</span> <span id="s559">yourself.</span> <span id="s560">It’s Steppe.</span> <span id="s561">It was formed as a fortress the Russians used to expanding into the middle Asia.</span> <span id="s562">In Asia they used to form in the Steppe, fortresses.</span> <span id="s563">Orsk was at first a military fortress.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Interviewer: An outpost or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Moise Weiner: Outpost, it’s an outpost as you call it.</span> <span id="s566">It’s a hill --- the first.</span> <span id="s567">The outpost was built on a hill.</span> <span id="s568">It looks around the Steppe.</span> <span id="s569">Before the war, they found nickel.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Interviewer: Nickel, the metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Moise Weiner: Metal.</span> <span id="s572">And they built a very large plant there, nickel plant.</span> <span id="s573">And many enterprises from the Ukraine, Russia, were evacuated to that town.</span> <span id="s574">Most of them were military.</span> <span id="s575">Over the fence there was from Moscow, a plant.</span> <span id="s576">Boys were working.</span> <span id="s577">They made mines, yeah.</span> <span id="s578">We were sewing ammunition for garment (?)</span> <span id="s579">, and they were making mines.</span> <span id="s580">The others were making shells and so on.</span> <span id="s581">It was mostly plants, military plants, and three labor camps.</span> <span id="s582">It was gulag, one of the gulag places.</span> <span id="s583">They were mostly engaged, exploited, in building the houses.</span> <span id="s584">There was socialist town.</span> <span id="s585">They built the houses in that town; some schools, many hospitals, and that’s a slaughter house, and that’s all I suppose.</span> <span id="s586">Now it’s a very large industrial town.</span> <span id="s587">Food, food, there was no food.</span> <span id="s588">There was no food; the system was they had cards --- Interviewer: A ration card?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Moise Weiner: Ration card, yes.</span> <span id="s590">We got --- I got 500 grams of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Interviewer: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Moise Weiner: Every day, but it was not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Interviewer: Did you get anything else besides bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Moise Weiner: Yes, we used these cards only in the dining --- not restaurants, but they were called; not fabric, but had its own dining … Interviewer: Canteen or … Moise Weiner: Yes, and there we dined there.</span> <span id="s595">We had dinner there, and we had to give our cards there.</span> <span id="s596">And I had a garden with my sister; we raised potatoes.</span> <span id="s597">And your --- I don’t remember --- Wallace maybe; was not the ambassador to Russia, but he was a special envoy of Roosevelt in Russia.</span> <span id="s598">He called those gardens, vegetable gardens, victory gardens; because if not those gardens, it would be very hard to survive.</span> <span id="s599">So we had some supply of potatoes for the winter.</span> <span id="s600">That’s all I suppose what we had.</span> <span id="s601">But work, I worked; the shift was for the machines was 10 hours; one hour the break, one hour to change the shift.</span> <span id="s602">It was 12 hours; 24 hours were divided into two.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Interviewer: So some people worked in the day, and some people worked at night.</span> <span id="s604">Is that how it worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Moise Weiner: We changed; one week in the day and one week in the night.</span> <span id="s606">The shift began at eight o’clock in the morning and ended at eight o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s607">The night shift began at eight o’clock in the evening and ended at eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s608">But we, the mechanics, had to work much more because we were obliged to work some two, three hours to help our colleagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Interviewer: You all made sure the machines were running all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Moise Weiner: Yeah, because we had no supplies of details, of spare parts during the war; and the machines were out of work, most of them.</span> <span id="s611">So the usual working day for me was 14, 16 hours.</span> <span id="s612">And if that master who had to change me, if he fell ill, I was put, as they called it, that time on the war situation; had no right to leave the shop and could prolong three, four a week, round the clock work.</span> <span id="s613">Five minutes sleep was a happy change.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Interviewer: And you did this until the end of the war?</span> <span id="s615">This is where you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Moise Weiner: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Interviewer: I think that’s all the questions I have about your story.</span> <span id="s618">Can I ask you about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Moise Weiner: Yeah, I told you some things.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Interviewer: You’re right; let’s go back.</span> <span id="s621">Tell me where they were born and their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Moise Weiner: Yes, well I cannot say exactly where they were; I think they were born in Vakhnovka.</span> <span id="s623">They were married in Vakhnovka, in the same shtetl where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Interviewer: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Moise Weiner: I want you to explain me one thing, with the names.</span> <span id="s626">Nobody knows the full name, because when the Jews were given last names, what you call here, they were not given their real Jewish names, but depending on the place where they lived or to the Count to whom they belonged.</span> <span id="s627">In the Ukraine the names were distorted.</span> <span id="s628">So my brother is a Suar (ph?)</span> <span id="s629">; but in the Ukraine, it was distorted to Srue (ph?)</span> <span id="s630">.</span> <span id="s631">I saw even here in America, a man died, and his name’s Srue; not a Suar, but a Srue.</span> <span id="s632">It’s not a name; it’s something … Interviewer: It’s like a nickname or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Moise Weiner: It’s not a nickname; it’s like Bob, Robert and Bob.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Interviewer: Yeah, that would be a nickname.</span> <span id="s635">Like my name is Anthony; my real name is Anthony, but my nickname is Tony.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Moise Weiner: So my father’s father’s name, not my father, but my grandfather’s name; I only last year found it in the Bible.</span> <span id="s637">It is Issachar (Yissachar); Isischor (ph?)</span> <span id="s638">in English.</span> <span id="s639">But my father’s second name was --- he was Isaac; my father Sauschis (ph?)</span> <span id="s640">, not Issachar, but Sachar (ph?)</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">You have half a name.</span> <span id="s643">So what is the name of my mother?</span> <span id="s644">The real, I don’t know; I know she was called Machla.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Interviewer: Machla, and that was her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Moise Weiner: Her first name, and her maiden name was Sandler.</span> <span id="s647">And when she married, she became Weiner.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Interviewer: So your father’s --- he was Isaac Weiner?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Moise Weiner: Isaac Weiner, yes.</span> <span id="s650">Russian transcription of Machla is Maria.</span> <span id="s651">Well maybe we be transcribed as so, but we don’t know is it really so.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Interviewer: Machla looks fine to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Moise Weiner: Fine, yeah?</span> <span id="s654">Well, it’s Machla.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Interviewer: Do you remember the years that they were born, their birthdays?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Moise Weiner: Yes; the birthday I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Interviewer: But the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Moise Weiner: The year I tell you, it was ’86 for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Interviewer: 1886?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Moise Weiner: Yes; and ’92 for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Interviewer: Do you know when they were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Moise Weiner: Twelve, 1912.</span> <span id="s663">I remember quite well because my mother had in the house a picture, hand worked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Interviewer: Oh, needlepoint or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Moise Weiner: Yes, needlework, and the date was of their marriage, 1912.</span> <span id="s666">I remember it.</span> <span id="s667">I see it before my eyes now, even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Interviewer: I know we talked about what your father did; that he was a cowboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Moise Weiner: He was a cowboy in his younger… Then he was maybe a bit of merchant maybe, I don’t know; before the Revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Interviewer: Was your mother, was she just a housewife or did she …?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Moise Weiner: She was a housewife all her life, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s672">She had five children to keep, to bring up.</span> <span id="s673">She began her day at five in the morning and ended at two in the night.</span> <span id="s674">And she did nothing in the eyes of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Interviewer: I think most mothers get that, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s676">They do a lot, but nobody actually sees what they do, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s677">Was you family, your parents especially, were they very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Moise Weiner: Yes, my father was religious.</span> <span id="s679">I remember him to take me with himself to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s680">But when the synagogue was destroyed, he prayed at home.</span> <span id="s681">He had phylacteries, I remember, and the shawl.</span> <span id="s682">He was religious, yeah.</span> <span id="s683">My mother went to the synagogue too, but not every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Interviewer: Did your father go every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Moise Weiner: On the holidays, mostly, because you see the synagogue was destroyed in 1936 or ’37.</span> <span id="s686">I was a boy of nine or ten; I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s687">I remember only that the last effort of my father to keep to religion was enough.</span> <span id="s688">Before the war, he and his neighbor, there is such a Jewish holiday as Succos (Sukkos, Sicchos) in Yiddish, Sukkot (Succot); they tried to make a sukkah (siccha).</span> <span id="s689">It’s a tent maybe with greens and so forth.</span> <span id="s690">Then, when they were sitting in that sukkah, drinking wine, maybe, I don’t remember, a military man came and destroyed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Interviewer: He knocked it over?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Moise Weiner: Knocked it over, yes; and pulled them away from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Interviewer: Do you remember when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Moise Weiner: It was not long before the war.</span> <span id="s695">That was, I don’t remember, the last effort to; after that he stayed home, prayed only at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Interviewer: Did your father ever talk about World War I or the Revolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Moise Weiner: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Interviewer: Was he in the First World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Moise Weiner: He was not; but he was, two times, he was nearly killed.</span> <span id="s700">The first time --- maybe you know that during the Civil War there were many gangs, nationalistic gangs, that when they came to a Jewish shtetl, they made pogroms killing people.</span> <span id="s701">My father was young enough, and he took part in a band of self-defense, sammabaronika (?)</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">When one of the gangs of Petlura (Petliura, Petlyura ?)</span> <span id="s704">came, five people, and they were caught by the Petlurivtsa (?)</span> <span id="s705">; and they want them to be shot.</span> <span id="s706">And the same time my mother rushed, not to the rebbe, but to the Christian … Interviewer: Priest or … ?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Moise Weiner: Yeah, the priest, the Christian, the Pope.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Interviewer: The priest, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Moise Weiner: The priest, yeah, the priest, the priest, and asked him for help to save the life of her husband.</span> <span id="s710">When they were brought to the lawn, was very green grass.</span> <span id="s711">And the leader of that gang said, ‘it’s a pity to spoil such grass with Jewish blood;’ let us go further.</span> <span id="s712">And that saved them the life because the priest succeeded to come to the place and stopped the killing in the name of Christ.</span> <span id="s713">And they were set free.</span> <span id="s714">And my father, I remember, told that he was in such strength that his hands were bound, that he… Interviewer: Oh my gosh, he broke the bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Moise Weiner: He broke the bones.</span> <span id="s716">It was the first time.</span> <span id="s717">So it was the legends (?)</span> <span id="s718">of our family, this killing, the second killing … Was in their shtetl one of the --- I don’t know how to call it --- a soldier, a gangster.</span> <span id="s719">He rushed in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Interviewer: Into your parents’ house?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Moise Weiner: Yes, and began to beat --- the Cossacks had on a stick, leather ---</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Interviewer: A whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Moise Weiner: A whip, nagaika (nagayka, nagyka) in Russian.</span> <span id="s724">At the end he had a leaden bob; it can kill you.</span> <span id="s725">And she had a little child, a baby, on her hand; and he began to beat her.</span> <span id="s726">And she was saved only, she told me, that she pressed herself to the wall protecting the kid; and when he hit her, the bob couldn’t get at her, but on the wall.</span> <span id="s727">The bob struck the wall, but not the … And that saved her the life and the life of the child.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe it was my brother that died in 19.</span> <span id="s729">.</span> <span id="s730">(1927 ?)</span> <span id="s731">, maybe that’s what.</span> <span id="s732">That’s the experience of my parents in that war.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Interviewer: That was during the Civil War?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Moise Weiner: The Civil War, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Interviewer: Do you ever remember your father speaking, or your parents speaking about the Revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Moise Weiner: Yeah, why not?</span> <span id="s737">They did not make difference between the Civil War and the Revolution, because the Revolution was not on the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s738">There was no Revolution; there was only Civil War, because the Revolution was in Russia, and there they came to restore the Soviet power.</span> <span id="s739">And the Civil War there were many gangs, Makhno (Machno), Petlura, Teutoni (ph?)</span> <span id="s740">, Degrees (ph?)</span> <span id="s741">, and so on.</span> <span id="s742">They told many stories about --- there were stories only about the beating of Jews; bad, that’s all.</span> <span id="s743">And about the Germans; one of the faults of the Jews on the Ukraine was that they remembered the Germans of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Interviewer: From the first war?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Moise Weiner: From the first war.</span> <span id="s746">Are they not Hilmen (ph?)</span> <span id="s747">?</span> <span id="s748">They are Hilmen (ph?)</span> <span id="s749">.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Interviewer: Honorable people, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Moise Weiner: Honorable people; people like we are.</span> <span id="s752">That’s propaganda, and that was the mistake.</span> <span id="s753">If we knew really what is coming, but who knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Interviewer: Did most of the Jews in the Ukraine feel that way, that the Germans were relatively decent people, and that they wouldn’t do these things to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Moise Weiner: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s756">Well I think many of them who remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Interviewer: The older generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Moise Weiner: The older generation; the young knew.</span> <span id="s759">We read books.</span> <span id="s760">We knew films; we saw films about … Professor Mamlock was such a film.</span> <span id="s761">We read Vectaya’s (ph?)</span> <span id="s762">books, and so we knew --- the papers, the radio --- before the pact; before the pact between Molotov and Ribbentrop, the propaganda was against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s763">So, we were a bit educated in that field.</span> <span id="s764">We knew what Nazis meant.</span> <span id="s765">But older generation, ‘sota vitenhop’ (ph?)</span> <span id="s766">.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Interviewer: You said that your father, after the Revolution, he didn’t have, you know after the Civil War also, he was an unskilled laborer because he didn’t have, I guess, an industrial job before the war; so he didn’t really have a job after the war.</span> <span id="s768">But he worked as a tax collector?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Moise Weiner: No, he worked as a driver.</span> <span id="s770">He had horses at one time; you know, a belagula (ph?)</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">What is a belagula, in Yiddish, in Ukraine?</span> <span id="s773">It’s a driver, it’s not passengers you drive, but stones, bricks, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Interviewer: So he transported these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Moise Weiner: Transported, yeah.</span> <span id="s776">That was a long time his job until the mid of the thirties.</span> <span id="s777">Then he lost his horses, and he was … Interviewer: How did he lose his horses, do you remember?</span> <span id="s778">Did they die?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span> <span id="s780">One died, and the second he sold.</span> <span id="s781">He had two horses.</span> <span id="s782">Then he worked as a night watch …</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Interviewer: Night watchman?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Moise Weiner: Yeah.</span> <span id="s785">And the last years when he became a bit ill, he became in the market; it’s an open market, so a tax collector.</span> <span id="s786">And that was his last job.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Interviewer: There was a large open market in Vinnytsya?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Moise Weiner: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Interviewer: Two markets.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Moise Weiner: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Interviewer: One was near your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Moise Weiner: No, they were both not near.</span> <span id="s793">One, on this place, when we arrived to settle here; there was a little market here, but it was demolished by the authorities.</span> <span id="s794">But two big markets were on that end of the city, and the second, the best, were on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Interviewer: What did he collect taxes on?</span> <span id="s796">Was it on the things that people sold, or is that how he collected…?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Moise Weiner: No, for the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Interviewer: Oh, for the place.</span> <span id="s799">So he took fees for people to set up their booths?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Moise Weiner: Yeah, yeah; I remember that.</span> <span id="s801">If you come with a wagon of goods, you had to have a place; and you have to pay a ruble for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Interviewer: Did anybody in your family ever become Communists?</span> <span id="s803">Were they in the Komsomol or in the …?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Moise Weiner: In my family, my father and my mother, no.</span> <span id="s805">What’s about my brothers and sisters, we were all in Komsomol.</span> <span id="s806">My brothers during the war became Communists and my sister, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Interviewer: So they joined the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Moise Weiner: They joined the party.</span> <span id="s809">I never joined the party.</span> <span id="s810">I was, as we called, non-party Bolshevik; so we called it in Russia.</span> <span id="s811">I thought that three from us, it’s enough for the party.</span> <span id="s812">I’ll be free.</span> <span id="s813">I don’t like party discipline; so I told, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Interviewer: When we talked about before the Germans came and right before the war, can you tell me what you remember; and what you know about what happened to your parents after they put you on the train in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Moise Weiner: No.</span> <span id="s816">We tried to find out who saw them the last, and we have very vague idea.</span> <span id="s817">You see hope dies the last; so we hoped that they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Interviewer: You don’t know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Moise Weiner: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s820">I tried, you see, the whole my life I tried to understand what was my father had been doing between the time the Nazis came and his death; from day to death.</span> <span id="s821">I see they were put to work from the jail.</span> <span id="s822">But there is a book, exists such a book, the American author of John Hersey.</span> <span id="s823">He has written a book, The Wall, about the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s824">He has written that book using the Ringelblum papers.</span> <span id="s825">I only here in America, I managed to get that book, Ringelblum’s Diaries.</span> <span id="s826">My daughter made me a copy of it.</span> <span id="s827">Now I’m reading that.</span> <span id="s828">But that book of Hersey’s was written in 1950 or ’53, maybe.</span> <span id="s829">I didn’t know about it; I came across it only in 1983.</span> <span id="s830">And in that book I read everything I wanted to.</span> <span id="s831">It’s a book about the war and the ghetto, and what the Jews were doing from day to day from the beginning of the occupation.</span> <span id="s832">So that’s a great book from my point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Interviewer: So you don’t know what happened to your parents after they put you on the train---you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Moise Weiner: No, no.</span> <span id="s835">He told me maybe he will go to Rakhnovka, to the parents of my mother;

and he drank vodka.</span> <span id="s863">It was a horror for the Jews if a Jew at that time drank Vodka --- not much.</span> <span id="s864">But he was a builder painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Interviewer: He painted houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Moise Weiner: Houses; and when he came from work, he took a glass of vodka, maybe a little glass of vodka.</span> <span id="s867">It was a very terrible deed from the point of view of my mother.</span> <span id="s868">She survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Interviewer: His wife did?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Moise Weiner: Yes.</span> <span id="s871">I saw her after the war;
