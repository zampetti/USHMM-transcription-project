Sanithousen.</span> <span id="s67">I got a letter of confirmation from them that indeed my father did buy the raw materials from them.</span> <span id="s68">I got a confirmation.</span> <span id="s69">I wrote to Mr. Ferdinand Eberall and I got several letters from them confirming that my father indeed bought machinery before 1939 and I have the letters and I put into my narrative as the originals.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s71">Tell me...let's go back to the town.</span> <span id="s72">Tell me about your family.</span> <span id="s73">I would like to know about your parents and what they were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">Okay.</span> <span id="s76">We lived in a house which I saw 2 years ago.</span> <span id="s77">I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s78">It was my grandmother's house, but my father as the oldest...in the Jewish religion he was a Cohen.</span> <span id="s79">He got half of the house and we lived in that house.</span> <span id="s80">The other half…was occupied by my grandmother.</span> <span id="s81">Her name was GalekG‑A‑L‑E Kwhich is my maiden name.</span> <span id="s82">She had like a country store and you got the...you could buy anything from soup to nuts, there....everything.</span> <span id="s83">People used to come from...the farmers from the villages... Every Thursday was market day, and they came and bought all the stuff that they needed from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s84">She had a big bakery also.</span> <span id="s85">And everything was included there.</span> <span id="s86">And when I was there 2 years ago in Poland, I saw...I wanted to see the bakery and I found a man who worked there and unfortunately, they transferred...transformed it now to a big office.</span> <span id="s87">Okay.</span> <span id="s88">I am going back to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s89">We were 13 grandchildren and everything was around my grandmother's house.</span> <span id="s90">Everybody gathered there for holidays and it was a big thing to go to grandmother.</span> <span id="s91">Her name was Zelda Mottel Galek.</span> <span id="s92">OK.</span> <span id="s93">And everybody knew in the...in the village...in this little town...everybody knew Mrs. Galkowa.</span> <span id="s94">This is Polish.</span> <span id="s95">My grandfather wasn't then alive anymore and I never knew my grandmother...my grandfather.</span> <span id="s96">Uh...my...we were, as I said, we were very well # +f off.</span> <span id="s97">We had...the house had like three tiers...three floors and the bottom was the kitchen which 2 years ago when I was in Poland a whole family lived in the kitchen only and two more families lived on each floor.</span> <span id="s98">And, uh, we had...I had a very very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s99">I attended a school...the public school which was Polish.</span> <span id="s100">There were very few Jews.</span> <span id="s101">Very few Jews lived in that town...very few...and, uh, we had a synagogue in the town and my father was...he wasn't exactly religious.</span> <span id="s102">We didn't keep a kosher home or anything like that and most of our friends were some of the Jews, but mostly were the Poles.</span> <span id="s103">Really.</span> <span id="s104">Especially I was very friendly with the...with the children of the director of the school and I was there...we were the only ones from my family that attended school on Saturday...but the other Jews did not attend Saturday school because it was against their religion.</span> <span id="s105">So just to tell you 20 H that we were...we were very good, conscientious Jews but never observed kashrut or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: You had sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I had 3 sisters, 2 which perished in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s108">The third one still lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s109">She left just...a few months before the war broke out, she left for Israel.</span> <span id="s110">And I a periodically see her.</span> <span id="s111">I go to Israel.</span> <span id="s112">My parents, unfortunately, were murdered there in front of me, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s113">My 2 sisters perished in concentration camp which I thought before I die, I wanted to see that where it was, and I went 2 years ago.</span> <span id="s114">It was my daughter's 40th birthday, and I gave them a gift.</span> <span id="s115">I took the whole family, my daughter, my son‑in‑law, my grandson and myself.</span> <span id="s116">My husband already was disabled and he couldn't go.</span> <span id="s117">And, uh, we saw Oswiecim.</span> <span id="s118">Auschwitz, and we saw all the atrocities and it was very painful, very hard, but I am glad that we did take them, because I did want the children to know something about my youth, where I lived and what happened.</span> <span id="s119">So I was very glad that I could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Let's go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: I want to go back to your childhood still.</span> <span id="s123">You have described the town.</span> <span id="s124">You have described your family a bit.</span> <span id="s125">Tell me a bit about your mother.</span> <span id="s126">I have...I would like a picture of your mother and a picture of your father.</span> <span id="s127">What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s129">My mother was a very bright, very intelligent person.</span> <span id="s130">She was a hat designer when she met my father and then she gave it up.</span> <span id="s131">She was a very devoted mother and took very very good care of us children and she instilled in us the value of Judaism and even though we were not, you know, as I told you not kashrut and all that, but very conscientious Jews.</span> <span id="s132">And, uh, she was a very pleasant person, very well liked by everybody, and when I met people 2 years ago in Poland, they still remember her and they still remember her and they still remember Fela and they still remembered one woman who went together with my sister in Israel to school and they remember the whole family as a very loving, very caring family and especially also about my grandmother.</span> <span id="s133">They loved her.</span> <span id="s134">And I was...I had a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s135">I..</span> <span id="s136">.</span> <span id="s137">we...I belonged to the Zionist organization and we had, uh, uh...what is it called...an organization...a youth organization which worked solely for Israel.</span> <span id="s138">And I was very active in that, and as a matter of fact, as a product of that my sister went to Israel.</span> <span id="s139">She did not want to remain in Poland.</span> <span id="s140">She was a very devoted Zionist and she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s141">And my childhood was very, very happy.</span> <span id="s142">I was always very well dressed, very well taken care of and really living in opulence.</span> <span id="s143">We had maids.</span> <span id="s144">In the morning we got our first breakfast at 7:00 in the...in the bed.</span> <span id="s145">At 9 0'clock we had our breakfast before we left for I f ~g school and, uh, at about 2 O’clock we came back from school.</span> <span id="s146">We had our big dinner, went back afterwards from 3:00 to 6:00 to school again and I also had Hebrew after school and...uh...twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Was that unusual for girls at that time?</span> <span id="s148">For girls to learn Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: It was not in that town because most of the girls belonged to the youth organization and to the Zionist organization and we were all very much introduced to Hebrew.</span> <span id="s150">And I spoke very fluently Hebrew at one time.</span> <span id="s151">I still read and I understand pretty much, but with talking I have a little bit problem, but when I was in Israel, you know, you pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Let's stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s153">Okay.</span> <span id="s154">Pre‑war Poland.</span> <span id="s155">How did all of /this life change when the Germans came in?</span> <span id="s156">When did they come into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: OK.</span> <span id="s158">To my town, I wasn't there anymore because at certain point we moved to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: When did you move to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: The factory was still in Sochocin in Poland, but we moved.</span> <span id="s161">About 5 years before the war broke out we moved to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: To Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: To Warsaw.</span> <span id="s164">Yes.</span> <span id="s165">And we lived on Lesno 24 in Poland.</span> <span id="s166">It was a beautiful building and we loved Warsaw because my... my father was about three times a week in Warsaw doing business.</span> <span id="s167">People came from all over Poland and they came to trade in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s168">We had, uh...uh...some customers Tomaszow, in Krakow, in Radowicze (ph) and I remember certain, certain places where my father sold buttons to them, but all the selling was done in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s169">It was like a market, like a Chicago...you know...so...uh...and, as I said, I knew only really good things, beautiful things, and in Warsaw, we had a chance to . . .to go to theatres and concerts and we were exposed very much to the arts then in Warsaw, which we didn't have a chance in...in the little town.</span> <span id="s170">So my youth was a happy youth and...and...uh...it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s171">And then came the Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When did they come?</span> <span id="s173">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s175">I was about almost 19 years when I first started...when a we moved to Warsaw...I started college university...Warsaw Colleges University of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s176">Just registered when the war broke out in September.</span> <span id="s177">I remember like today my father had a very bad premonition that this war is going to be very bad.</span> <span id="s178">Well, in Poland if somebody was wealthy, had not only money, but had gold.</span> <span id="s179">Okay?</span> <span id="s180">Well, we had some gold.</span> <span id="s181">We had some gold dollars and lots of gold.</span> <span id="s182">He took us together and he said he felt that this is going to be a terrible war.</span> <span id="s183">He said g to us we will divide whatever we have.</span> <span id="s184">The money was no good anymore, but the gold and the...uh...whatever we have in jewelry, gold jewelry, we'll divide equally to everyone of [Page 11 you...of us...whoever...I remember these words...whoever can save themselves with what he has should do so and at that time, he really divided all the among all of us.</span> <span id="s185">Needless to say, it was a terrible moment because we knew from newspapers from before what the Germans are like.</span> <span id="s186">And shortly after, the war broke out when they took over Poland.</span> <span id="s187">After a little while they started organizing, put all the Jews in certain streets.</span> <span id="s188">It was, I remember, Zamenhof which was mostly Jewish, really, Malewki uh, there was another street I don't remember very well anymore, but we were all concentrated in these few streets...all the Jews were put in to wherever we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What were living conditions like in the ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: The conditions in the beginning, we thought, might be okay.</span> <span id="s191">But as we went on, we didn't have enough food; we didn't have enough water; we didn’t have enough of anything, and that's when the problems started.</span> <span id="s192">Sicknesses started to evolve because we didn't have enough of anything.</span> <span id="s193">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: We were living in one room.</span> <span id="s196">There were about 12 of us.</span> <span id="s197">We didn't have any beds.</span> <span id="s198">Whatever we could take was on the floor.</span> <span id="s199">Okay.</span> <span id="s200">Whatever we had.</span> <span id="s201">The few things that we could take along with us because you had to leave most of it, you had to leave where you where and just...just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You had been rounded up before you were taken to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Everybody was rounded up, and you know, I remember they used to take the male Jews to see if they were...what do you say...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Circumcised?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Circumcised.</span> <span id="s206">And by that they saw who was Jewish because most of the Poles...the Jews in Poland...were circumcised.</span> <span id="s207">And that's how they rounded us up.</span> <span id="s208">From wherever we lived we had to go to a certain point in Warsaw and they...they brought every...all the Jews to these few...uh...streets and then they put sort of...uh...like a barbed wire...we were having some things that you couldn't move around easily out...and 30 that's how it started.</span> <span id="s209">Well, this started around the end of right away as they came.</span> <span id="s210">And I lived in the ghetto until 41.</span> <span id="s211">At 41, it was really, really before the ghetto was set a fire it started to become real bad.</span> <span id="s212">People were murdered.</span> <span id="s213">People were just taken out for no reason at all and just killed, especially children were just thrown against the wall...just killed.</span> <span id="s214">Well, at one point they rounded us up all and they had lines you stay here you stay here you stay there.</span> <span id="s215">At that time we were already...the people started to get separated from their families.</span> <span id="s216">If somebody looked well to them enough to be transported to work, which I thought was work, was in one line.</span> <span id="s217">People were sickly looking...meekly looking, they went in another line.</span> <span id="s218">Elderly parents went in another line.</span> <span id="s219">The people that looked too sick to them, they just took care of them right away.</span> <span id="s220">Like my parents were, at that time, really very bad looking, and they just shot them right then and there.</span> <span id="s221">And not only my parents but a lot of them.</span> <span id="s222">I was in the line and I tried to run out to help but I was pushed back.</span> <span id="s223">You couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s224">My sisters were younger than I.</span> <span id="s225">They took them to, to a younger line.</span> <span id="s226">I was in the older line.</span> <span id="s227">However, somehow I got out of that line and I tried to hide.</span> <span id="s228">I got out of that line and I was able to get to a hiding place which I hide...I hid.</span> <span id="s229">That's how I got out.</span> <span id="s230">When the ghetto was set afire...</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: No.</span> <span id="s232">No.</span> <span id="s233">No.</span> <span id="s234">I don't want to go there yet.</span> <span id="s235">I want you to S 6 tell me about the hiding.</span> <span id="s236">How did you get to the hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I tell you now I..</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">I cannot explain to you how it happened, but there was another Jewish girl with me and we decided that we are not going to let ourselves being taken.</span> <span id="s240">The girl....I have a picture of her too.</span> <span id="s241">The girl was named Alla and, uh, we tried...we made up our minds we are not going to let ourselves be taken by the Germans, and as they shoved us aside we shoved ourselves further away and we got away from them.</span> <span id="s242">And we hid out a little bit for a few days.</span> <span id="s243">This was...all that happened shortly before the ghetto was set afire.</span> <span id="s244">They wanted really to exterminate the Jews.</span> <span id="s245">Whoever was left to set afire, and they couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s246">And we somehow got away from that line and got away from it.</span> <span id="s247">And when we got away from it and, we hid out a couple of days when they announced the ghetto is going to be set afire.</span> <span id="s248">And Alla and I were in that hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What hiding place?</span> <span id="s250">Describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: It was like a little alley between two houses.</span> <span id="s252">We somehow got in between that alley and stood there, waited until all the people were taken.</span> <span id="s253">You know they took everybody by...uh...uh…cars like they transport...transport animals, you know, trucks like...animal trucks.</span> <span id="s254">And everybody was pushed, shoved on the trucks...whoever was taken was supposed to be taken to Germany to work they said.</span> <span id="s255">But it wasn't to t~&gt; work unfortunately.</span> <span id="s256">It was the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Where were your sisters taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: And we were both still in that little alley.</span> <span id="s259">Well, when it got quiet, we just maneuvered around and we maneuvered around to a park where there was...uh...uh...we could stay there for a while, and we stood there not knowing what are we going to do next.</span> <span id="s260">Well, we stood there and we scrounged around for food wherever we could, because the Germans had the idea that time that nobody is left, and if somebody is left they couldn't get at them, and that's why they decided to set afire...also because there were a lot of Jews that were underground.</span> <span id="s261">We somehow got to these underground people.</span> <span id="s262">From that...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: From the park?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: From that park where we're there.</span> <span id="s265">After the Germans left, the underground people somehow came...came up from wherever they were...they were hiding in the underground and got hold of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What year are we?</span> <span id="s267">You were talking 19...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: This is all...this is...this is 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: You are still in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s271">Because we were...until 1941, we...this was the beginning of 1941.</span> <span id="s272">The ghetto was set afire in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And somehow this was all shortly before the ghetto was set afire.</span> <span id="s275">So from nowhere the people from underground showed up and they found the two of us and they took us.</span> <span id="s276">And they took us...when they...they took us to their underground where they were hiding and kept us.</span> <span id="s277">At that time 2 days later, the ghetto was set afire.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Hold it.</span> <span id="s279">I don't want to get there.</span> <span id="s280">I want you to describe for me please where they took you.</span> <span id="s281">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I don’t know where they took us.</span> <span id="s283">I don't even know where it was.</span> <span id="s284">It was somewhere around the ghetto and maybe it was in the ghetto, but wherever they came up from I have no idea.</span> <span id="s285">l Probably 1943.</span> <span id="s286">They were...they just there...like this Pole I found in Warsaw....from nowhere he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: They took you in a room?</span> <span id="s288">They took us...No.</span> <span id="s289">It was...it was like a cave.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s291">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: That was their underground hiding place.</span> <span id="s293">And the Germans knew that there was such places, but they couldn't lay hands on it, p ~ and therefore, they decided to put the ghetto on fire...to set the ghetto on fire to get rid of everybody which they did unfortunately.</span> <span id="s294">And that's how we got from the...from the ghetto with these people took us with their...through their caves to the Warsaw side which was called the Irish side....to the Irish side.</span> <span id="s295">That's the story how we got out from the, the two girls, myself and Alla, from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s296">Through these people.</span> <span id="s297">These were really martyrs and what happened to them later I have no idea.</span> <span id="s298">But that's how we got to the Irish side, and that's where the saga started with me.</span> <span id="s299">Somehow Alla and I got separated.</span> <span id="s300">She said she was married to a Polish guy, and she said she knows of somebody that could take care of her in Warsaw and that is the time where we got separated.</span> <span id="s301">And I was alone in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s302">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And she's married.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: That's how I got out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s306">Now the ghetto has not yet been destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: That comes 2 years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: The ghetto was destroyed in 41, when we went out.</span> <span id="s310">It was...the ghetto was set afire when we went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: It may have been 1943, but we can deal with that later.</span> <span id="s316">Let's talk about you.</span> <span id="s317">You are alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Your friend had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s321">This was after the ghetto was set afire, and we went...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: After the ghetto was set afire?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s326">I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s327">But I remembered, you know certain things stay in your mind, that we had a person that worked for my father I think his name was Nodrudtki.</span> <span id="s328">I remembered that he lived in Jeravia Street in Warsaw, and I thought maybe I should try to go there.</span> <span id="s329">And I went there and 3 o a p I found him and he took me in.</span> <span id="s330">He said, "I can't keep you long, but I will keep you awhile."</span> <span id="s331">That's how...this was my hiding place in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s332">Jeravia 24 or 22 Jeravia...20.</span> <span id="s333">I have it written down because I don't remember anymore the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Would you describe his house?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s336">When I was in Poland, I went to see it and that house stands.</span> <span id="s337">But it was demolished partially by the Germans.</span> <span id="s338">The funny part was also I met a lady who works...a Polish lady who works for the Polish Embassy in Washington, and I met her through a friend who works for the United States.</span> <span id="s339">Annie Core.</span> <span id="s340">And she had met her...she works now as a representative for the Polish people that work in the Embassy.</span> <span id="s341">She met...through her I met this Polish lady.</span> <span id="s342">She said, I lived near Jeravia 32 and I know where that house is.</span> <span id="s343">It was the funniest part, you know, after all those years.</span> <span id="s344">Anyway, when I went to Warsaw that house is still there, but it was demolished partially, 32 and I lived in an attic there with that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: While you were there, since this was when Warsaw was being...the ghetto was being destroyed, did you see that destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I could see the flames.</span> <span id="s347">Yes.</span> <span id="s348">From the Irish side, all you saw is flames, smoke.</span> <span id="s349">That's all you saw because it's very close.</span> <span id="s350">The streets from Jeravia, Unleshno (ph) and Zamenhova its now too, too far.</span> <span id="s351">So I could see what happened.</span> <span id="s352">When I went there, but then I was hiding and I couldn't get out anymore.</span> <span id="s353">I was always hiding in that...in that...on that attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Can we...before we moved into the hiding, I would like to take you back into Warsaw before you leave.</span> <span id="s355">You are...when you were in Warsaw, you were describing the terrible conditions and the difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Sickness, typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Where you aware at that point of any resistance being formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s360">What did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: All I knew that there is a resistance and they are fighting in the woods.</span> <span id="s362">There is a song which I don't have.</span> <span id="s363">It was in Jewish, that song, about the fighters the resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s364">I am sure somebody must have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: The song is well known and that is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So you knew about them.</span> <span id="s368">Did you know about any resistance being organized in the ghetto itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: No.</span> <span id="s370">No.</span> <span id="s371">Had no idea.</span> <span id="s372">You know, we were so involved in each other in the daily routine which was no routine.</span> <span id="s373">It just happened.</span> <span id="s374">From hour to hour we knew that an end was coming, we just didn't know when.</span> <span id="s375">O: What was the Jewish community leadership doing at that time?</span> <span id="s376">Did you know?</span> <span id="s377">Did you have any sense of a community organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No.</span> <span id="s379">I did not know any.</span> <span id="s380">Not at all.</span> <span id="s381">But I knew about the resistance group, and I knew that they are around Warsaw...in and around Warsaw, but I had no idea of any other things.</span> <span id="s382">But the conditions were terrible since we didn't have enough food, especially enough water, typhus came around, and when the Germans took us out, you know, everybody was emaciated already, and that’s why my parents got killed in front of me.</span> <span id="s383">They looked so bad that they thought, "Well, they're no good for us anymore."</span> <span id="s384">And lots of other people...and they just boom, boom, boom, and everybody went.</span> <span id="s385">And, as I said my two sisters were taken to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s386">They were put on a..</span> <span id="s387">.</span> <span id="s388">on a wagon on the trucks and Alla and I..</span> <span id="s389">.</span> <span id="s390">I was not with my sisters.</span> <span id="s391">I couldn't even be with them because I was older and they thought that I looked good enough to work, and they were the younger and with children and the children were taken away and evidently to camp right away.</span> <span id="s392">So that's how it was.</span> <span id="s393">When I was in Warsaw, this was all in 1941, beginning of 1941...March.</span> <span id="s394">And when I was hiding out, a few weeks was fine.</span> <span id="s395">I thought, "Well, we will see what happens."</span> <span id="s396">But one day they came into me to the attic...not only that...at the attic, I contracted whooping cough.</span> <span id="s397">You know what whopping cough is, and they got scared to death because with having the whooping cough, you cannot sit still.</span> <span id="s398">When somebody comes around, and hear I hark, hark, hark, they were afraid, and they thought they cannot keep me any longer.</span> <span id="s399">Okay?</span> <span id="s400">I have to find a way what to do.</span> <span id="s401">At that time, I was let go.</span> <span id="s402">At that time I had 20 dollar gold piece...a 20 dollar gold piece cause all the other jewelry and things, I already...I didn't have it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s404">What did you do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s406">What I did is when I tried to get the false papers I had to pay with something.</span> <span id="s407">Okay.</span> <span id="s408">And when I let...when they let me go, I had a 20 dollar gold piece, and I just didn't 37 know where to go.</span> <span id="s409">So when they let me go on the street, some 2 Germans...SS men I imagine...approached me, and they said, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s410">What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s411">Well, they finally find out that I am Jewish, you know, by interrogating me, and I knew well, I am caught anyway and I don't care what happens to me.</span> <span id="s412">But I had the 20 dollar gold piece and I told to the guys I said...I said to them, "Well, if you let me go, I have something that I could give you."</span> <span id="s413">And they said, "What."</span> <span id="s414">I said, I have a 20 dollar gold piece."</span> <span id="s415">Well, they took the gold piece and let me go.</span> <span id="s416">But I..</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">I still had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did you still have false papers on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: And still false papers on me, yes.</span> <span id="s421">Where do I go from there?</span> <span id="s422">That was the question.</span> <span id="s423">And it was almost curfew hour.</span> <span id="s424">The curfew was 9:00.</span> <span id="s425">Well, I wondered.</span> <span id="s426">I just wondered and I thought it doesn't matter to me if I get caught.</span> <span id="s427">If I get caught, I get caught; if I don't, I don't.</span> <span id="s428">Life was cheap.</span> <span id="s429">And I wandered, I wandered until the Wisla, River Wisla [NB: the Vistula], and I sat there and I was contemplating ... should I..</span> <span id="s430">.</span> <span id="s431">should I jump into the river and finish up with myself.</span> <span id="s432">I didn't know how to swim.</span> <span id="s433">But I thought suicide would be the best thing.</span> <span id="s434">I wouldn't fall into German hands.</span> <span id="s435">I would do it myself.</span> <span id="s436">And along came from nowhere this man, Jan Majetki, and he said, "You know, it's almost curfew hour.</span> <span id="s437">What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s438">And he started to interrogate me.</span> <span id="s439">Who are you?</span> <span id="s440">Where are you coming from?</span> <span id="s441">Well, he realized that I am Jewish and I couldn't hide anymore and I told him who I am.</span> <span id="s442">I showed him my false papers, that I had these 3 f false papers that I acquired with my money and some jewelry but I had no to go.</span> <span id="s443">He said, "Well, I am the Director of the Polish Camp."</span> <span id="s444">It was like a camp for the Poles that escaped from the German rules.</span> <span id="s445">I can take you in there for a little while.</span> <span id="s446">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s447">So he took me in there, and I think the street was Ulitza Sfientoieskaia (ph) .</span> <span id="s448">And he said I can give you a little room and you can stay there, but not for long because we are being, uh, the Germans know 5~ that we keep Jews there and they are after us every so often.</span> <span id="s449">So I said, "Well, whatever happens happens.</span> <span id="s450">If you can take me now, fine.</span> <span id="s451">I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s452">And I went with him.</span> <span id="s453">That's how I got to this Polish house.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Can you describe the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: This must have been...well, it was March.</span> <span id="s456">It must have been around the beginning of April or something like that because in June, I was…to Germany.</span> <span id="s457">Well, I stayed there until such time but every so often Germans came there and really tried to find whether they are Jews.</span> <span id="s458">But at one time it was so hot that he said, "Maria, I cannot keep you any longer.</span> <span id="s459">We have to part."</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: What was the house like?</span> <span id="s461">That is, where there many people there?</span> <span id="s462">Who was hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Only Poles.</span> <span id="s464">Most of the Poles and a few Jews which I didn't meet, but mostly Poles and it was a house, just a plain house, uh, they had some rooms.</span> <span id="s465">It was also very crowded.</span> <span id="s466">But I got special treatment from him for some reason or other.</span> <span id="s467">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s468">But I realized later why because he corresponded with me.</span> <span id="s469">He really liked me.</span> <span id="s470">Anyway, I got that room, No. 6, and I stayed there until it was so hot that he couldn't keep me anymore.</span> <span id="s471">He really had to...to get rid of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s472">I was the last one and he parted with me, and we kissed and he gave me that medal when he parted with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Will you show us the medal please and then tell us what it is.</span> <span id="s474">You have it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s476">I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Let's take it out and show it to the camera.</span> <span id="s478">We'll show it again later.</span> <span id="s479">And that is the medal.</span> <span id="s480">That is the holiest medal in Poland.</span> <span id="s481">Maka Holska Czestohovska.</span> <span id="s482">They were a few holy ladies, but the lady from Jan Batski, was the holiest of all.</span> <span id="s483">And this is the medal that he gave me when we parted and this is only, you know, the...the chain is not there anymore, but he kept it for me.</span> <span id="s484">He got this one from his brother who was a priest who also perished in the same camp where my sisters perished.</span> <span id="s485">This Jan Majeski for awhile was working in the underground, in the Polish underground for Poles, but then after the war he organized that camp for Poles that escaped from…Okay?</span> <span id="s486">And this is the medal that I kept.</span> <span id="s487">And he told me to promise him that I will keep that medal with me all the time and this will keep me alive.</span> <span id="s488">And needless to say, I really honestly kept that medal with me all the time until I gave it away to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s489">I kept it always with me.</span> <span id="s490">Not that I believed in it, but I promised him that I will keep it with me, and I did.</span> <span id="s491">Every night in Germany I looked at that medal and I thought how...how safe I am because I don't know with that medal or whatever, but I am safe, alive.</span> <span id="s492">Better safe I don't know, but alive.</span> <span id="s493">Anyway that was the time...when we parted, and he said we had to part, he took us all...not only me but a lot of other Poles to a church, and he said from there on, everybody is on their own, but he knew there is going to be a raid by the Germans to take the people to work the Germans.</span> <span id="s494">Well, needless to say, there was a raid and we were all taken to Germany and we were taken in cattle trains...by cattle trains to German, to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Describe the trip.</span> <span id="s496">Would you please?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: The trip was terrible.</span> <span id="s498">We were all crowded and, of course, I would never say that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s499">Alright?</span> <span id="s500">We were all Poles.</span> <span id="s501">I am sure there were a lot of Jews...which I was afraid to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s502">I kept to myself.</span> <span id="s503">But then on the way to Berlin, they asked, "Who speaks German?"</span> <span id="s504">And I y) /) volunteered, and I said I speak German, I speak Hoch Deutch , not Plat Deutch (ph).</span> <span id="s505">Hoch Deutch is the cultivated German.</span> <span id="s506">Plat Deutch, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s507">As such, I was chosen as the fuhrer, what is it?</span> <span id="s508">Not the manager, but the manager of the group to go to Germany, because I spoke German and the SS men, they spoke German.</span> <span id="s509">So they communicated with me.</span> <span id="s510">When they brought us all to German...to Berlin, I was told because I was the fuhrer, the manager, the leader.</span> <span id="s511">Fuhrer is the leader.</span> <span id="s512">I will have a choice of where I wanted to go to work tin Germany which I thought was a good idea.</span> <span id="s513">Okay?</span> <span id="s514">We came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s515">I don't even remember how it looked, but it was a mass of people, not only our group but lots of people, lots of people and lots of mostly Poles.</span> <span id="s516">And they said to me, "You have a choice to go either on a farm to an ammunition fabric or to hotels.</span> <span id="s517">I thought for myself to be safer it would be the best thing to go on a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Because I knew it'll be a lot hard work that I won't meet so many Poles.</span> <span id="s520">I was afraid to meet Poles.</span> <span id="s521">That was the idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And you still had the false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I still had my false papers as a Christian girl.</span> <span id="s524">Sure.</span> <span id="s525">As Maria Xowalcik.</span> <span id="s526">The middle name was Jadwiga.</span> <span id="s527">As such, I came to Germany as Maria Kowalcik.</span> <span id="s528">And I thought for my own sake, I probably would be safer to be away from everybody.</span> <span id="s529">And I thought on a farm, Poles would probably not likely go to a farm.</span> <span id="s530">They might want to go a hotel, to some offices, to any other place, but I thought for myself, I would rather go to a farm.</span> <span id="s531">First of all, I was emaciated.</span> <span id="s532">I was about 80, 90 pounds skin and bones when I came to Germany.</span> <span id="s533">Skin and bone.</span> <span id="s534">And as such I came to Germany.</span> <span id="s535">They told me where they are going to bring me, to Krushart, near Oslingen.</span> <span id="s536">It is a small farm that the man that owns the farm is paralyzed but he has a son‑in‑law by the name of Karl Beck and a daughter.</span> <span id="s537">She was just married to this Mr. Beck.</span> <span id="s538">And I was brought to Krunhart.</span> <span id="s539">That's how I came to Germany.</span> <span id="s540">Okay?</span> <span id="s541">I was a city girl.</span> <span id="s542">I never knew what work means because at home we were wealthy.</span> <span id="s543">We had maids, and we had everything.</span> <span id="s544">I never even knew how to boil a glass of water.</span> <span id="s545">Very spoiled...very...really very well taken care of, and I had no idea what a farm means...work on a farm.</span> <span id="s546">Anyway, but I adapted and I adjusted very well.</span> <span id="s547">I knew that that's the way it is.</span> <span id="s548">That's the way it's going to be.</span> <span id="s549">I better make the y ?</span> <span id="s550">4S best of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Describe the farm.</span> <span id="s552">Would you please?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s554">Was a very small farm.</span> <span id="s555">They had an Uncle Karl.</span> <span id="s556">I forget his last name.</span> <span id="s557">And Louise and Mr. Beck, and Mr. Sharf and myself.</span> <span id="s558">A very small farm.</span> <span id="s559">We had about 6 cows.</span> <span id="s560">We had chickens and pigs and all sorts of animals around the farm.</span> <span id="s561">Of course, I had to take care of everything.</span> <span id="s562">I had no idea how to milk cows, but when I came there, the nice thing was when I came to the farm, it was...it was June 16th or June 21.</span> <span id="s563">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s564">I think it was June 21.</span> <span id="s565">It was a nasty day; a rainy, nasty cold day and I had nothing with me, just what I had on, old clothes and my emaciated.</span> <span id="s566">Just skin and bones.</span> <span id="s567">But I had my presence always.</span> <span id="s568">On a farm, there is lots to eat.</span> <span id="s569">I better be careful eating, not to eat everything right away.</span> <span id="s570">I had the presence of mind to be careful of eating not to get sick.</span> <span id="s571">So the first thing I came there, it was cold and the woman, Mrs. Louisa Beck, she looked like a very terribly harsh woman, talk, big, but a real German woman, you know.</span> <span id="s572">And I thought oh, oh, this is not the place I should have gone.</span> <span id="s573">But she was very kind to me, very kind to me.</span> <span id="s574">Really motherly almost.</span> <span id="s575">She showed me to a room where it would be and it was very nice room, a very small room with just a bed and a bureau and me.</span> <span id="s576">But it was very nice.</span> <span id="s577">The nicest part of it was when I went to bed...you know we had feather beds in Germany...when I went to bed, the bed was warm.</span> <span id="s578">And I was wondering what happened.</span> <span id="s579">She had a warm bottle to warm up the bed, and I thought then she can't be that bad.</span> <span id="s580">If she did that, she must have heart.</span> <span id="s581">Of course, I was Polish.</span> <span id="s582">She didn't know that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s583">So then I thought maybe life won't be so bad.</span> <span id="s584">Anyway, that was the experience and she gave me milk and ham and bread, but I didn’t eat any.</span> <span id="s585">I just had some milk and some bread and butter.</span> <span id="s586">I was afraid to eat really, because I was hungry, emaciated and I thought...I had the presence of mind not to eat everything right away but just go slowly about it until I get used to food again.</span> <span id="s587">So then it really started.</span> <span id="s588">The next morning she tried to introduce me to everybody.</span> <span id="s589">She had a brother by the name Ernst who fought in the army and he was in Russia then.</span> <span id="s590">He had a little boy by the name of Fritz.</span> <span id="s591">He was then a baby about 2 or 3 months old, and she told me I had to take care of the baby which I was glad.</span> <span id="s592">And some other chores she told me that I had to do in the beginning which was fine.</span> <span id="s593">It wasn't too much, but then they got me into the real nitty gritty, the real farm work.</span> <span id="s594">She showed me how to milk cows.</span> <span id="s595">That was the worst part.</span> <span id="s596">Well, to milk the cows I remember for about a month my fingers were like this.</span> <span id="s597">I could not straighten them out.</span> <span id="s598">You had to use force to use what do you call the (ph), and my fingers were like this for about 2 to 3 months.</span> <span id="s599">I just couldn't straighten them out.</span> <span id="s600">But then slowly I knew how to do it, and it was...was fun.</span> <span id="s601">And I used to drink the milk directly from the cows.</span> <span id="s602">I milked them.</span> <span id="s603">I drank the milk.</span> <span id="s604">Anyway, I got very fat as you saw.</span> <span id="s605">After awhile, I was there about 2 months, I got very fat.</span> <span id="s606">I had at that time long hair and I braided them and put them up here as you see will see on the pictures.</span> <span id="s607">And, uh, then she taught me really what I had to do and it was hard work taking care of all the animals and get up in the morning about 5:30, go at night about 12:00 to bed and feed all the animals, take care of the chickens, of the ...of the pigs, whatever we had on the farm.</span> <span id="s608">And also I had to learn how to mow grass and the...what <t call="" cereal="" do="" english...the="" from="" grain="" in="" it.="" know="" make="" this="" uh...uh...the...uh...you="" what="" where="" you=""></t></span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Oh, you have to cut the cut these from the wheat?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes, what do you call the grain.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: You cut the grain with the…</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Not with a ...(ph), but with a..</span> <span id="s613">.</span> <span id="s614">the ...(ph) is too small.</span> <span id="s615">What do you call it?</span> <span id="s616">It was like this and a handle.</span> <span id="s617">I can't think of the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Sifted it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Not sifted.</span> <span id="s620">No, you had to cut it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: But you cut it with some kind of machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes and it wasn't a machine...was hand cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: It was a big handle.</span> <span id="s625">t</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Not a sickle.</span> <span id="s628">It was bigger than a sickle.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: We'll find the word later.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I can't think of the name.</span> <span id="s631">I know the name, but I can't think of it this minute.</span> <span id="s632">And we cut this mill in bundles.</span> <span id="s633">The wheat....the wheat...we cut the wheat and it had to be put in bundles and then the bundles were loaded on...on the...what do you call that...wagons with horses, and we had to bring it to the farm and store it.</span> <span id="s634">And then we had to...what do you call this when you get the grains out, you beat it.</span> <span id="s635">What do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You beat it with sticks.</span> <span id="s637">I don't know.</span> <span id="s638">I am not a farm person.</span> <span id="s639">And to separate the chaff...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: To separate the wheat, yes.</span> <span id="s641">That's how we did it, and then it was sifted.</span> <span id="s642">So that’s how we got the grains...the grains out.</span> <span id="s643">I can’t think of the name...the English name.</span> <span id="s644">I knew it.</span> <span id="s645">I think I wrote it my essay, but I can't think of the name now.</span> <span id="s646">Anyway, that's how we did it.</span> <span id="s647">And we had to mow grass for the cows for the winter to store hay for the winter and all that.</span> <span id="s648">All that had to be done.</span> <span id="s649">We had chickens.</span> <span id="s650">I had to gather the eggs and all that.</span> <span id="s651">It was a lot of work and I did most of the work because Louise, Mr. Beck was working in the ammunition factory during the day.</span> <span id="s652">He came only home at night.</span> <span id="s653">Mr….</span> <span id="s654">the owner was paralyzed.</span> <span id="s655">He couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s656">Louise had to take his daughter, and Mr. Beck's wife had to take care of the son, so I did mostly of the work, but Saturdays there came an uncle of theirs, Mr. Warl.</span> <span id="s657">He helped us out</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s659">Let's hold it we need to change the tape and then we'll come back.</span> <span id="s660">Okay Bonnie.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: The rest I have to do it here.</span> <span id="s663">I have to go to the bedroom.</span> <span id="s664">Just take care of him like a baby.</span> <span id="s665">I have to clean him up.</span> <span id="s666">I have a commode in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s667">I have a commode in the living room.</span> <span id="s668">I have a commode in the kitchen so I don't have to drag all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Let’s pick it back up.</span> <span id="s670">We are going back to ... and you have been doing farm work.</span> <span id="s671">Tell me... you started to me about the uncle who comes in on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: The uncle who came in on Saturday helped us out because I could do...most of the work was really on and on Mr. Beck and both of us could not handle all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: How big was the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s675">It was a very small farm...really very small farm.</span> <span id="s676">Pour of us could take care of it, but we all had to work hard.</span> <span id="s677">As I said her husband was home only in the evening.</span> <span id="s678">He left in the morning and came hone about 8:00 at night from the factory...from the ammunition factory there he worked for the SS.</span> <span id="s679">And in the evening there wasn’t much to do, but Sundays he helped us out.</span> <span id="s680">Sundays we worked very...I worked most of the day cause they went to church.</span> <span id="s681">First of all, I had to...I was Catholic...I had to change my religion.</span> <span id="s682">They were Seven Day Adventists and they sort of hinted to se to change the religious.</span> <span id="s683">I did change.</span> <span id="s684">I thought what the heck, it doesn't matter to me.</span> <span id="s685">So I was Protestant, you know, I went with them to church every Sunday and prayed with him or whatever it was, and there were meetings in the house, also, once a week which Mr….</span> <span id="s686">that owner who was paralyzed.</span> <span id="s687">He presided.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Let's pick it up and go back.</span> <span id="s689">You were posing as a Catholic Where had you learned your Catholicism to go to Church?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: You didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I didn't because I never went to church.</span> <span id="s693">I came to Germany and they said, well, you will be awhile with us.</span> <span id="s694">Why don't you change to our religion?</span> <span id="s695">And I know so little about Catholicism and the girls that were there...there were other Poles in the village.</span> <span id="s696">They were all Christians...really Poles.</span> <span id="s697">And I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s698">That's how they found out...they didn't know ‘til they found out.</span> <span id="s699">They suspected that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: How did they suspect?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Some other girls that were on other fare...they suspected, and I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s702">But we were very good friends because when they were talking about Catholicism or about the church, I knew very little about it.</span> <span id="s703">And that's...I think they got the idea that I..</span> <span id="s704">.</span> <span id="s705">that there is not quite right.</span> <span id="s706">And, uh, of course, I never said anything to them.</span> <span id="s707">I remained as Catholic, but I thought it would be a good idea if I changed to their religion.</span> <span id="s708">And I did change.</span> <span id="s709">And I went with them every Sunday to church, and I did all the things that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Did you have to go through conversion?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: No.</span> <span id="s712">Nothing.</span> <span id="s713">Because Mr….</span> <span id="s714">the President of that union...of that Seven Day Adventists, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s715">And everything was in his house.</span> <span id="s716">As a matter of fact, sometimes the ceremonies were in his house because he could not go to church and his daughter played the...not the piano...what is the other thingv?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: The organ?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: The organ.</span> <span id="s719">As a matter of fact, she started teaching the organ.</span> <span id="s720">And she played the organ and when the meetings were there, we went into that room and we had the meetings there.</span> <span id="s721">So I was very comfortable there instead of going to the Catholic Church, which I know nothing about.</span> <span id="s722">I thought it's a good idea that I did.</span> <span id="s723">And I was very glad that I did change.</span> <span id="s724">And they hinted to me...not that they almost like forced me to it...but I thought it was a good idea and I did it, and I was very glad that I did it because this way I did have to go with the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And you also didn't have to pretend.</span> <span id="s726">You knew a great deal about the Seventh Day Adventists.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s728">Yes.</span> <span id="s729">And the whole week I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s730">We had no live to get together.</span> <span id="s731">Only Sundays.</span> <span id="s732">And Sundays I went to church so I had very little connections with the Polish girls that were there.</span> <span id="s733">There were two girls...Polish girls...of which I have pictures.</span> <span id="s734">But we were very good friends and every body worked very hard.</span> <span id="s735">You really didn't have much time.</span> <span id="s736">One of the girls was very badly treated on her far.</span> <span id="s737">She couldn’t eat or sleep in the house.</span> <span id="s738">She had to sleep elsewhere near the stables, you know.</span> <span id="s739">But I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s740">I really had nice people.</span> <span id="s741">But, of course, knowing that I aw Christian, you now...but they were kind to me, really kind.</span> <span id="s742">I had no complaints about that.</span> <span id="s743">So I was there, I think it was about 2‑1/2 years...or 2 years when the liberation care in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Let's not get there yet.</span> <span id="s745">Zhen you were talking earlier, you talked about having to wear your 3 and you were taken to court one day about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s747">I was once...I became sick.</span> <span id="s748">Okay?</span> <span id="s749">And before the war, I had gall stone troubles, but then during the war somehow because of the meager diet and all that, I had no problems.</span> <span id="s750">But all of a sudden when I started to eat and eat well...probably fatty things.</span> <span id="s751">You know, butter of Whatever they have on the farm.</span> <span id="s752">You know we had pork.</span> <span id="s753">We did our own cold cuts and all that.</span> <span id="s754">And I ate all that and I like it and it was good.</span> <span id="s755">I got fat on it.</span> <span id="s756">And I felt fine, but all of a sudden I took ill.</span> <span id="s757">And evidently that...the gall stones occurred again because of all the fat, and the butter and the Bilk, I couldn't digest that very well and I got sick.</span> <span id="s758">So I had to go to the doctor and I just didn't get...I forgot.</span> <span id="s759">And several times also when I went to see the Polish girls, we didn't always wear the E.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: You had to wear your P.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s762">All the time.</span> <span id="s763">But neither one of us wore it all the time.</span> <span id="s764">Because it was a small village, but there was one police guy that lived in the village that had very bod...he didn't care very much for Dr. Hard and he sort of took it out on me.</span> <span id="s765">One time when I went out to wait for the bus to get to the doctor and he caught me without the P and needless to say, he really took advantage of me.</span> <span id="s766">He really beat me up well.</span> <span id="s767">I went back home.</span> <span id="s768">I didn't go to the doctor.</span> <span id="s769">I went back hone and I cried myself sick and I was very upset about it and talked to his.</span> <span id="s770">He said, "Why did you do that to her?</span> <span id="s771">She's such a good worker...and all that."</span> <span id="s772">Well, he said, "She has to wear a P anyway.</span> <span id="s773">I went to the doctor without the P at the time, and I went back to crying and I put the P back and I went to the doctor.</span> <span id="s774">And he...when he beat me up...he also put in a..</span> <span id="s775">.</span> <span id="s776">he sued me.</span> <span id="s777">He took me to the court that I as a Christian girl and I didn't wear the P.</span> <span id="s778">He took me to the court.</span> <span id="s779">And you know, there is in minority, if I have the original from the court...and I told the Judge the truth that I forgot the P but I got an attack of gall bladder and I had to rush to the doctor and in my rushing I forgot the P and went without it.</span> <span id="s780">And, I forgot his name...the policeman’s name, I don't remember anymore…and he beat me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Let's stay… You are telling the court?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: The court.</span> <span id="s783">What had happened.</span> <span id="s784">And the court believed me but the guy, the policeman was there...he said it was not true what I as saying and that I also said that he said...the policeman said when I got to court I'll probably have to pay some money as I punishment and he...the policeman said to me...said to the court that I said money doesn't mean anything to me...German money doesn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s785">It was a lie...and I said that to the court...the Judge.</span> <span id="s786">The Judge really believed me what I said, and he dismissed the policeman and, uh, however, they punished me with…But I told the Judge that I don't have any money.</span> <span id="s787">I was supposed to get paid 20…a month, but I never got paid.</span> <span id="s788">And I told the Judge I don't have any money, and he can do whatever he wants to with me.</span> <span id="s789">If he wants to put me to jail, let him put me to jail.</span> <span id="s790">But the Judge was very, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s791">He just gave me the punishment and he said whichever way I can pay I'll pay.</span> <span id="s792">And I brought the judgment back to Mr. Sharo and Mr. Sharp intervened and they made it to 15…so Mr. Sharv paid 15… I didn't pay anything.</span> <span id="s793">And the receipt is there.</span> <span id="s794">I have the original receipt.</span> <span id="s795">But the Judge was so nice to me.</span> <span id="s796">He was so sympathetic to me.</span> <span id="s797">What he did, he asked me to be the translator for the Poles when they come to Court.</span> <span id="s798">They don't know how to speak German.</span> <span id="s799">Would I be translating for them?</span> <span id="s800">At the end it was a good thing for me.</span> <span id="s801">I helped the judge with the Poles.</span> <span id="s802">I translated from Polish into German.</span> <span id="s803">So, the judge was very, very nice with me.</span> <span id="s804">He believed what I said and he accepted my testimony rather than the policeman's.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Did you stay working on the farm also while you did translations for the judge?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s807">Yes.</span> <span id="s808">I told them that whenever the judge wants me I would have to go and they were very pleased that I did that.</span> <span id="s809">And so...and I was pleased too.</span> <span id="s810">It got me away from the farm, and you know, a little to do...a little bit of something else.</span> <span id="s811">So that was...the end was pretty good in spite of everything, but I had a lot of scare cause I thought, God knows what will happen now.</span> <span id="s812">If they put me to jail, they'll really find out who I was.</span> <span id="s813">You know, they'll start interrogating me and all that, and I was scared to death, but it ended well, really for me.</span> <span id="s814">It ended very well.</span> <span id="s815">So that's how it was in the court.</span> <span id="s816">But I had a few frightening days and sleepless nights and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: What happened after the business court?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: After I had been to court?</span> <span id="s819">Well, I came back to the farm and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s820">And that policeman never bothered me again.</span> <span id="s821">Never bothered me again!</span> <span id="s822">And Mr. Sharb was very upset about it, you know, because he knows the guy and he says he shouldn't have done it to him...not only to me, but to him...that I was working for him and I was very good and never any problems with me.</span> <span id="s823">Why did he do that?</span> <span id="s824">Ho was just nasty...a very nasty man.</span> <span id="s825">He was very nasty to the other Polish girls.</span> <span id="s826">He really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What year did all this happen with the court and everything?</span> <span id="s828">What year did this happen?</span> <span id="s829">Where are we in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: This must have been in 1942 or 1943.</span> <span id="s831">Either year, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s832">It must have been 1942 or 1943...beginning of 1943.</span> <span id="s833">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s834">I have it written down, but I don't remember the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: How long did you stay on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I stayed on the farm until liberation…Until 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s838">Did anything else happen before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: No, I was just working and, uh, nothing special happened.</span> <span id="s840">I just feverishly read the newspapers; you know to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s841">Because they really did not know...this farmer did not know...I think people from the village knew what was really going on with the Jews.</span> <span id="s842">They really honestly did not know.</span> <span id="s843">Everything was kept in such a way that most of the people were not aware of it.</span> <span id="s844">And these people particularly had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s845">Really!</span> <span id="s846">So I stayed there...after the liberation, I stayed there about 2 more weeks longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s848">Don't jump quite so fast.</span> <span id="s849">What happened at liberation?</span> <span id="s850">How did you know there was liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: At liberation, the American soldiers came into the village and they asked me who are you and why are you here.</span> <span id="s852">Mainly, they asked do I know whether the men, that was the SS men...some Deutschmarks in the house, and if he has, where he has it.</span> <span id="s853">OK.</span> <span id="s854">And I have to tell you, I told them.</span> <span id="s855">And I told them...and I told the...the Americans I told them who I as...that I am a Christian girl on false papers.</span> <span id="s856">I took them aside and told them who I was...that I am really Jewish and I am looking now to get back to some place where there are Jews so that I could get to a community...a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s857">And they said we will try to find out for you where they are and where you can go...what you do.</span> <span id="s858">But the man, Mr. Bett, was very upset when they came in and looked him and they asked me if I know if he has something.</span> <span id="s859">He really didn't have any arms in the house and I told him and he didn't.</span> <span id="s860">But he got scared.</span> <span id="s861">The man got scared and he gave me his uniform.</span> <span id="s862">When they left...the American boys left, he said, "I am terribly afraid"...and gave me the uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: He had this SS uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Was he in the SS himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s867">And he was scared.</span> <span id="s868">He was hiding the uniform when they came in and I didn't think of the uniform at this time.</span> <span id="s869">They were looking mainly for arms.</span> <span id="s870">When they left, he came out to me and he said, "Maria, I have the uniform and I want you to burn it.</span> <span id="s871">I don't want anything left here that I was an SS man.</span> <span id="s872">OK?"</span> <span id="s873">He gave me the uniform and we had in the living room a pot belly stove.</span> <span id="s874">He gave me the uniform and he said, cut it up and burn it.</span> <span id="s875">I don't want to have it in the house.</span> <span id="s876">And so I did.</span> <span id="s877">And let me tell you that very tongue of false that came up was like a…to me.</span> <span id="s878">For all the things that I went through...that I saw my parents die, my sisters taken to the concentration camp and with all the misery that I lived through and all that, I thought, why me.</span> <span id="s879">Dear God, this is something that I can be thankful for...that I can do it.</span> <span id="s880">And that's how the sculpture came about.</span> <span id="s881">When I started school, my teacher, Rebecca, came and said to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Can we hold it there.</span> <span id="s883">Stay with this.</span> <span id="s884">We'll get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: And I burned that uniform and he was very happy about it.</span> <span id="s886">However, I found out the Americans told me in Stuttgart, there is a Jewish DP camp and they are forming now a community, a Jewish community, and where I can go and all that.</span> <span id="s887">I still, however, was afraid to leave the farm and I didn't tell the farmers who I was at all.</span> <span id="s888">I still stayed on 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s889">You know when you are under those circumstances; I was afraid what will happen if there is a retreat.</span> <span id="s890">If the Americans retreat, God forbid, and they find out who I was, you know.</span> <span id="s891">So I stayed on for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s892">I didn't tell them a thing.</span> <span id="s893">And after 2 weeks...in the meantime, I went to Stuttgart and I found out that there is indeed a Jewish community and there is form a DP camp...displaced person camp, and that I have a place to go now.</span> <span id="s894">I know where to go.</span> <span id="s895">And so I came back and I told them that I am ready to leave and who I as.</span> <span id="s896">Well, I still can see the face of these people.</span> <span id="s897">Was Mr. Beck, Mr. Beck and Mr. Sharp.</span> <span id="s898">They looked at me and said, Maria, it can't be.</span> <span id="s899">No Jewish girl would work like that."</span> <span id="s900">You know, they...they really didn't know.</span> <span id="s901">They never even saw a Jew before.</span> <span id="s902">They thought maybe Jews really have horns or whatever.</span> <span id="s903">They said, "Cannot be!</span> <span id="s904">I said, Yes, Mr. Beck, I am Jewish and I showed them the false papers then and I told then I am going to the DP camp.</span> <span id="s905">I ax going to live there, and well they were very surprised.</span> <span id="s906">They said, you can live here.</span> <span id="s907">You can be with us.</span> <span id="s908">And...uh, they just couldn't believe it...that I as Jewish.</span> <span id="s909">The first thing they said, it can't be true.</span> <span id="s910">A Jew would not work like this on a farm.</span> <span id="s911">I really worked hard and I worked...I worked well.</span> <span id="s912">I worked for me because I knew that this is it.</span> <span id="s913">I have to do what I have to do.</span> <span id="s914">You know!</span> <span id="s915">Anyway when we parted he gave me that knife.</span> <span id="s916">Mr. Beck...they all kissed ne and hugged me then.</span> <span id="s917">Even though...</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Hold the knife up.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: And he gave me that knife.</span> <span id="s920">And that knife I took.</span> <span id="s921">This knife here.</span> <span id="s922">And this is an old knife.</span> <span id="s923">He belonged to the SS, you know, and he took it from his mess and gave it to me as a remembrance.</span> <span id="s924">And I was really very grateful for him...for that, that he did that.</span> <span id="s925">I think this was a nice gesture after all.</span> <span id="s926">I mean if he had known if I was Jewish it wouldn't be that.</span> <span id="s927">But I showed his the papers and I showed his everything, and I told him everything, and they just could not believe it.</span> <span id="s928">They could not believe a minute of it, but that's how we parted.</span> <span id="s929">At parting, he gave me that knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Before you go on with your story, I would like to go back a minute and ask you...Mr. Beck was in the SS during all the years you were at the farm.</span> <span id="s931">What did he do as part of the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s933">I know he worked in the... You know, everything was very secretive.</span> <span id="s934">I know he worked in SS in a…in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s935">OK?</span> <span id="s936">He sometimes came hone...this I must tell you...case hone and he bring...drunk a little bit.</span> <span id="s937">What do you say in English?</span> <span id="s938">Inebriated?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s940">Inebriated.</span> <span id="s941">It's drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s943">And those nights when he came back like that I got terribly scared because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s944">You know every so often, he made advances and when he was home not quite sober, I got scared and I didn't go to bed then.</span> <span id="s945">I went to the bed until I knew he went to bed and he was asleep.</span> <span id="s946">And I did some work, whatever it was to do in the kitchen or whatever.</span> <span id="s947">Mrs. Beck used to say to me, "Maria, why don't you go to bed?"</span> <span id="s948">I said, oh, I have to do this, that and the other thing, and I made sure that he is asleep, and that is when I went to bed.</span> <span id="s949">I really was afraid; you know that he might assault me in some way.</span> <span id="s950">Because he…you know, he felt sometime like that, especially when he came back.</span> <span id="s951">You know, there was a young Polish girl who was older than he was and she was a hefty woman, talk and hefty as you will see on the picture, and he said this is a nice morsel, you know.</span> <span id="s952">And I really got seared, and rightly now.</span> <span id="s953">So these days were terrible days...nights for me really.</span> <span id="s954">I couldn't sleep well and I was always on the alert.</span> <span id="s955">But on the whole, they were nice to me as a Christian.</span> <span id="s956">They treated me well, and, uh, I was a hard worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: But you really didn't know much about his work in the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s959">Nothing He never spoke about it, and she had no idea.</span> <span id="s960">She had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: No idea of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: She knew he works in the munitions factory, but she didn't know a thing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: His wife, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: His wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Alright, let's cone back now.</span> <span id="s966">It's liberation.</span> <span id="s967">You have told them you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s968">You have been given and you are about to leave.</span> <span id="s969">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I went to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s971">OK?</span> <span id="s972">And it was a DP camp.</span> <span id="s973">We had a room.</span> <span id="s974">We were 7 girls and, uh, we are all in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: No, we'll don't want to get to the United States later.</span> <span id="s976">Stay in the camp now.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: We stayed in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Describe it.</span> <span id="s979">Please describe the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: The DP camp was very pleasant, very nice.</span> <span id="s981">We had nice rooms and food and, uh, pleasant surroundings.</span> <span id="s982">It was really very, very nice.</span> <span id="s983">And we were a group of 7 girls.</span> <span id="s984">One girl played piano and she used to give concerts for us and concerts for the DP camp and, uh, and, uh, the other...she was the oldest of us.</span> <span id="s985">And there was another girl...and, uh, all the girls we got along fine.</span> <span id="s986">We were in touch all the time afterwards.</span> <span id="s987">And it was really a nice time.</span> <span id="s988">In the camp we had a very nice time.</span> <span id="s989">But everyone of us tried to get in touch with families where we had...I set at that time already, you know, soldiers...Jewish soldiers used to come to the camp, and they used to visit with us, and I set a Jewish soldier by the name of…from Brooklyn and I told him that I had family in the United States.</span> <span id="s990">Uh...you know I was then a little girl.</span> <span id="s991">I didn't know...I knew it was a brother of my father.</span> <span id="s992">I knew his name.</span> <span id="s993">I didn't know where he lived, but I knew it was in the United States, and I knew in Buffalo...lived in Buffalo, but where and what, I didn't have no idea....that I have a sister in Israel, I told the Rabbi, and uh, would they be able to get in touch with anybody of them.</span> <span id="s994">I gave them description and all that, and, uh, the Rabbi that was at camp, he got in touch with my sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s995">He got the address where she lived and she wrote me a little note.</span> <span id="s996">She wrote the director of the camp and the director gave it to me.</span> <span id="s997">It was in Jewish written and so I got in touch with my sister.</span> <span id="s998">Then I wrote a letter to Buffalo to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s999">Somehow he found out about my uncle, and I got the address of my uncle.</span> <span id="s1000">I got in touch with my uncle.</span> <span id="s1001">I got in touch with my sister and, uh, that's how life started again.</span> <span id="s1002">I got in the Jewish community again and, uh, life became a little bit, you know, more civilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Did you go to work for…during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: I worked not directly for them.</span> <span id="s1005">I went to work for the Polish liaison officer and the Polish liaison officer...his name was Mr.....he came to our DP camp and...wait a minute, I am mixing up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: This was the Jewish DP camp.</span> <span id="s1008">Then while in the DP camp...or was it there I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1009">OK.</span> <span id="s1010">The was formed.</span> <span id="s1011">OK?</span> <span id="s1012">And my husband also lived in there as a Christian...as a Frenchman in Germany, and he was in German captivity as a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s1013">But he worked for the…and…was organized, and as such, he came to this camp.</span> <span id="s1014">He met us...all the girls of us in the meantime, the organized a Polish DP camp for Poles, and they needed somebody...a liaison, from one camp to the other...from the Jewish camp to the Polish camp.</span> <span id="s1015">And the Polish camp was Mr. Gotst, and I was the liaison officer for the Polish camp.</span> <span id="s1016">My husband worked for the Polish camp and as such, he came to check...he was an officer...messing officer, my husband.</span> <span id="s1017">A messing officer had to do with the food.</span> <span id="s1018">He came to check how the food was distributed in the Polish camp to the Poles.</span> <span id="s1019">That is how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1020">And, uh, there was my husband, and there was a Czechoslovakian Jew, and there was a rivalry between the two.</span> <span id="s1021">And these two took care of the Polish camp...of the distribution of the food for the Polish camp, and I was the liaison officer for that camp and that's how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1022">And we married.</span> <span id="s1023">He won out of the Czech.</span> <span id="s1024">Anyway, that's how we married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: So, and that's how it was...coming to Germany and the liberation and the marriage when my sister wanted us to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1027">Then I remembered I had an uncle in Australia.</span> <span id="s1028">I knew Melbourne.</span> <span id="s1029">I knew his name, and the American soldier…got in touch with him too.</span> <span id="s1030">He wanted us to cone to Australia.</span> <span id="s1031">My uncle, my father's brother, wanted us to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1032">And we chose the United States over all of it.</span> <span id="s1033">We thought...my husband wanted to start school...back to school.</span> <span id="s1034">I wanted to do something with myself.</span> <span id="s1035">In Israel at that time, you know, there was still not quite...so quite…I didn't want to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1036">It was too far.</span> <span id="s1037">We thought America for us…would be the best.</span> <span id="s1038">My parents‑in‑law, they lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s1039">They wanted us to cone to Paris and live with them, and we both didn't want to.</span> <span id="s1040">We wanted to live by ourselves and establish life in the United States.</span> <span id="s1041">And I wrote to my uncle and he sent us an affidavit and we came to Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1042">And in Buffalo, my husband...uh, I was pregnant at that time.</span> <span id="s1043">We lived...when my husband worked for the…underground...we lived in the…get to the United States.</span> <span id="s1044">So we stayed with the underground, until we could get to the United States.</span> <span id="s1045">But my father‑in‑law was a very prominent person en in Germany.</span> <span id="s1046">After the liberation, after France was liberated...You see I am jumping from one thing to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Let's stay with you.</span> <span id="s1048">I want to stay with you.</span> <span id="s1049">I am not interested in anything else, but you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: OK.</span> <span id="s1051">I wanted you...to tell how we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Don't worry about France.</span> <span id="s1053">Don't worry about anything else.</span> <span id="s1054">You came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Because my father‑in‑law helped us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: So we came to the United States, and we lived in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1058">I was pregnant at the time...6 months.</span> <span id="s1059">And, uh, we couldn't get...the Americans wouldn't let us on the ship anymore, because they were afraid I might give birth on the ship.</span> <span id="s1060">Anyway, we came by an American...by airplane...American transport for soldiers.</span> <span id="s1061">We came with that transport, just the two of us with some others.</span> <span id="s1062">And I gave birth in the United States.</span> <span id="s1063">But we didn't have any money even though we were living with my uncle.</span> <span id="s1064">The hospital was supposed to be $150.</span> <span id="s1065">And we didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s1066">We didn't want to take from _____.</span> <span id="s1067">My husband is French...German originality...lived in France, and he translated a book…helicopters, from French into English and he got $150 dollars for it.</span> <span id="s1068">So we paid the hospital for that.</span> <span id="s1069">So I was glad that my uncle didn't have to pay.</span> <span id="s1070">And so, then we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: You are here already.</span> <span id="s1072">Right?</span> <span id="s1073">You are in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1074">You have had the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1076">My husband translated the book and we paid the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Let's capsulate a little bit.</span> <span id="s1078">You were in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1079">How long did you live in Buffalo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: In Buffalo we stayed only a few months.</span> <span id="s1081">I came...I was...uh, I was almost 6 months pregnant so we stayed about a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: You have the baby.</span> <span id="s1083">What did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1085">My husband then got a job in...well, some friends of my father‑in‑law in New York...in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So with a newborn baby you moved to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No.</span> <span id="s1088">So he went to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1089">I stayed with the baby in Buffalo for awhile until he found a place for us to live.</span> <span id="s1090">That's when I joined him...in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1091">That's where he worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: What did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Well, my husband by trade...he is a chemical engineer and physicist.</span> <span id="s1094">But when we came to the United States...no...by trade now he is that, but when we came to the United States, he didn't have education like I did.</span> <span id="s1095">We had to do the education here.</span> <span id="s1096">So when we came to New Jersey, he started school and got his...he got his high school diploma...American high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1097">With that, he was accepted to Columbia University, and he was a year there, but we couldn't afford to pay so we had to move to New York in order to matriculate for him to go to CCNY, City College of New York.</span> <span id="s1098">So we did move to New York, New York State, to Astoria, which is in New York.</span> <span id="s1099">He got matriculated.</span> <span id="s1100">He went to school and got his degree in physics and chemistry.</span> <span id="s1101">As such, he got a job in New Jersey, and he was working then as a..</span> <span id="s1102">.</span> <span id="s1103">as a metallurgist...not in his field at all.</span> <span id="s1104">That's how we got to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: How many years did you live in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: In New York, we lived about...uh...I would say about 14 years, then we got transferred to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1107">We lived there a few years, and then he was transferred back to New Jersey, and we lived there from there on, we lived in New York...in Astoria, but he worked in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: How many children did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Only one daughter.</span> <span id="s1110">Her name is Faye, and she is a....a..</span> <span id="s1111">.</span> <span id="s1112">uh...landscape architect.</span> <span id="s1113">She has her own business with a partner and is doing very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: When did you come to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: To Washington we came and it was 8…My husband in the meantime contracted the disease of multiple sclerosis and he worked until he was completely disabled, until about 82 or 81, something like that.</span> <span id="s1116">Then my daughter insisted that we came to live...she lived then in Washington...that we come and live in Washington.</span> <span id="s1117">It would be easier for me and for her to see her father.</span> <span id="s1118">That's when we moved to Washington.</span> <span id="s1119">She lives in a..</span> <span id="s1120">.</span> <span id="s1121">in a..</span> <span id="s1122">.</span> <span id="s1123">isn't that something?</span> <span id="s1124">She lives in the Washington vicinity...</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: It doesn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1127">Something you know, you talk and forget about... She lives in Alexandria and she insisted on us coming to live near her which was a good idea because she helped me out a lot.</span> <span id="s1128">He was completely disabled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You've gone...you are going to school, and you have been doing sculpture?</span> <span id="s1130">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Ok.</span> <span id="s1132">After awhile I decided I have to do something.</span> <span id="s1133">I was taking care of my husband all the time.</span> <span id="s1134">I have to do something for myself and also for therapy.</span> <span id="s1135">And I decided to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1136">By the way, my husband graduated cum laude.</span> <span id="s1137">He went to night school and worked during the day, so it was tough for him.</span> <span id="s1138">Anyway, I decided to go back to school myself because my daughter was already grown up and on her own.</span> <span id="s1139">And I am taking up art.</span> <span id="s1140">I am taking up...not…but I worked towards a degree in art.</span> <span id="s1141">And, uh, I work...twice a week I work...twice a week I go to school, so I am a very busy...very busy lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Tell me about the sculpture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Ok.</span> <span id="s1144">The sculpture case about...I picked up sculpture in school.</span> <span id="s1145">The teacher that I had was very instrumental in that sculpture.</span> <span id="s1146">She said...you know, I never talked about my past until I did the sculpture.</span> <span id="s1147">I never even told my daughter about my past.</span> <span id="s1148">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1149">But Rebecca insisted...my teacher...that I tell a little bit about my past, and I did.</span> <span id="s1150">And she said, why don't you do something about it?"</span> <span id="s1151">I was taking then sculpture.</span> <span id="s1152">Why don't you do a sculpture about your experiences?</span> <span id="s1153">This way you will get it out of your system and you will be able to talk about it."</span> <span id="s1154">I said, "Well, I'll think about it."</span> <span id="s1155">And I did.</span> <span id="s1156">I did do a sculpture...a sculpture of the burning Nazi.</span> <span id="s1157">I told you that he asked me...this Nazi asked me to burn his uniform.</span> <span id="s1158">I thought this would be a good subject to do, and I did that burning Nazi...a sculpture of that.</span> <span id="s1159">And that's how the sculpture came about.</span> <span id="s1160">But really Rebecca was instrumental because I didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1161">I wouldn't do anything about it, and she is the one that really, really made me do it.</span> <span id="s1162">And I as very grateful for her, because since then I talk about it…because on May 4, I gave sort of a little interview for the Holocaust Museum with Susan.</span> <span id="s1163">And I told about the experiences and my daughter was present at that time and then she said, mommy, why didn't you ever tell me about it?"</span> <span id="s1164">I never did talk about it until I did this sculpture.</span> <span id="s1165">It really helped ne.</span> <span id="s1166">I can talk now freely, even though painful, but I talk about it, which is very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: That's very important.</span> <span id="s1168">And you've told us your story.</span> <span id="s1169">You have brought it up to date.</span> <span id="s1170">Maybe now that you are a bit more relaxed, I would like to take you back again.</span> <span id="s1171">OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1173">Yes, do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I would like to go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1175">You sort of felt you needed to get through the whole story, but there are some points that I would like to talk about.</span> <span id="s1176">Bet's go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1177">You have come from your small town to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1178">You are living 12 to a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1180">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: This is a very important time in the history of the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1183">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Would you describe...you've described the misery and the suffering, but can you describe to me what it was like for a Jew living under the Nazis at that point in tine?</span> <span id="s1185">Did you work, for instance?</span> <span id="s1186">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1188">We just lived aimlessly doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1189">You couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1190">You just have to be...you know, you were a slave.</span> <span id="s1191">You worked when they told you to work.</span> <span id="s1192">You did what they told you to do.</span> <span id="s1193">You could...you weren't yourself.</span> <span id="s1194">It was very inhuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: When you worked, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Anything they asked we.</span> <span id="s1197">And it was sometimes doing...sweeping.</span> <span id="s1198">Sometimes picking up some things...real manual work that didn't mean anything to you that you had to do because you were told to do that.</span> <span id="s1199">Clean up here.</span> <span id="s1200">Clean up some latrines and such things.</span> <span id="s1201">It was a terrible thing...a terrible time, but you had to do it.</span> <span id="s1202">You were asked to do it and you must do it.</span> <span id="s1203">You had to do it And, uh, you weren't yourself at all.</span> <span id="s1204">It was very inhuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: What kind of clothes did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1207">Very old clothing.</span> <span id="s1208">Very old clothing.</span> <span id="s1209">I had a ____sort of suit that I kept since I was interned as a slave girl, you know.</span> <span id="s1210">I had a black suit I remember was a skirt and a blouse which I wore to tatters cause I didn't have nothing else to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Did you wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1213">I can't explain to you how excited I was and how starved I was.</span> <span id="s1214">This is…it is unbelievable to explain unless you lived it through yourself, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: What did you have to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Well, a piece of bread...hard bread...a little bit of water, very scanty things...potato maybe.</span> <span id="s1217">Almost nothing really.</span> <span id="s1218">Just...just enough...just enough to be alive.</span> <span id="s1219">Water was rationed.</span> <span id="s1220">A little piece of bread was old.</span> <span id="s1221">It was good then to me because it was something I had in my stomach, but it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1222">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1223">Nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: How did you get the food?</span> <span id="s1225">Did you have ration cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No, it was just brought into the rows...whatever they rationed.</span> <span id="s1227">You say we called it rationed.</span> <span id="s1228">It was on a little plate, and whatever they brought in, that is what you ate.</span> <span id="s1229">It was very scanty...very...what should I tell you?</span> <span id="s1230">It was almost like nothing?</span> <span id="s1231">It was really a starvation diet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Who were the 12 people in the room with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: They were young girls.</span> <span id="s1234">One girl was . . . she was barely in her teens.</span> <span id="s1235">She is now since dead.</span> <span id="s1236">Dorina.</span> <span id="s1237">There was an older girl.</span> <span id="s1238">She is about now...she is about 80 years old.</span> <span id="s1239">She was the pianist and in spite of everything, she sit down at the piano and played.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Where did you get the piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: I don't know where she got the piano, but there was a piano in the room and she played.</span> <span id="s1242">I don't know where she got the piano.</span> <span id="s1243">And she used to entertain us with the piano.</span> <span id="s1244">I don't even recall how she got the piano, but she did play.</span> <span id="s1245">And she was very vivacious in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s1246">Sometimes she was so hungry, she…down at the piano and talked and talked how hungry she is and she played Chopin.</span> <span id="s1247">I mean she was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1248">She just passed away last year, and I was in touch with her all the years.</span> <span id="s1249">And most of the girls were younger than I was really.</span> <span id="s1250">I am going to be 69 in November.</span> <span id="s1251">The other girls, except she was now 80 years old...but she was the oldest of us.</span> <span id="s1252">And we had a glorious time together...the girls...in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s1253">We sang and we danced and made really the best that we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Do you remember any of the other girls.</span> <span id="s1255">Who else was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Well, there was Dorina; there was, there was Clara, uh I don't remember any others.</span> <span id="s1257">These are the girls that we were very close after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Where were your parents and your sister at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: My parents and my sister died when they were shot, I told you, in front of me when….</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: It's the order of events that was confused, so let's go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1262">OK.</span> <span id="s1263">When the Germans took everybody out of their homes...houses and rooms, we were all in lines.</span> <span id="s1264">There was this line younger...this line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: This was before you were taken into the ghetto itself?</span> <span id="s1266">The selection took place...</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: There was a selection at the ghetto line...in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s1268">Yes.</span> <span id="s1269">And my parents were meager looking, sickly looking, and they were shot immediately in front of me.</span> <span id="s1270">Now some other people, they looked healthier...they were taken to another line...sort of to work.</span> <span id="s1271">Whether they went to work I doubt very much because we have never seen or heard of them.</span> <span id="s1272">That was the time...that's how we got separated from my parents and my sisters.</span> <span id="s1273">That's the last time I saw them, was in the line...everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: How did you get from that line to this…</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I told you, it was...I don't remember exactly, but Aliia and I, the other girl, we strayed away from the line to sort of like a little alley, and we sort of both hid there, like stooped in the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: You are going…Now come and sit.</span> <span id="s1277">No.</span> <span id="s1278">What I want to do is try to get a sequence of events, because it is a bit confused.</span> <span id="s1279">OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: You have described being in the apartment with the girls in the Warsaw ghetto, but you have told me that the selection where your parents were killed that took place before you were taken to this apartment.</span> <span id="s1282">That doesn't make sense.</span> <span id="s1283">That's what I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: No.</span> <span id="s1285">No.</span> <span id="s1286">To what apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: You were in an apartment with 12 girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: The selection where your parents were killed...did this take place before you were taken in the apartment or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: The selection was when we were taken from the apartment to the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1292">That's what was confusing.</span> <span id="s1293">What I want to know is why were you living, if you remember, in an apartment with the girls and not in an apartment with your parents.</span> <span id="s1294">Do you remember why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: The girls where we lived...this is after my parents were 5X killed that we girls lived in the seven girls lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s1296">It was after my parents were killed.</span> <span id="s1297">Had nothing to do with the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1299">Don't worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: That was after...afterwards, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: The girls that lived in the apartment, we were then in the DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: We are talking about two different things and places.</span> <span id="s1304">I want to be in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1305">Who were you living with when you were in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: The Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: I lived with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: That was the confusion.</span> <span id="s1310">I had asked about Warsaw and then you were describing the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: No.</span> <span id="s1312">No.</span> <span id="s1313">No.</span> <span id="s1314">I then lived with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1316">So you were living in an apartment in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1318">With my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: With your parents and your sister.</span> <span id="s1320">What were your parents doing during this tine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1322">Nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s1323">It was like waiting for death or for the catp 0</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: What kind of papers did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Then?</span> <span id="s1326">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1327">Where as I. Uh, that was before…no, I had then already my false papers as a Christian girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1329">Alright, let's leave it.</span> <span id="s1330">It's not...it's not all that important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: It is important to see though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: It's a terrible time and you have to... you have to really remember the things in sequence and it's very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Well, it is because you were running around and trying to save your life and it's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1336">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: It's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1339">Yes.</span> <span id="s1340">I just know the terrible moment when my parents were killed.</span> <span id="s1341">(long, long, long pause) Anyway, we have to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1343">You have brought some pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1345">The pictures I brought...because I really wanted you to see the authentic thing...how it was and when it was.</span> <span id="s1346">I wonder what you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Let's start with the first two.</span> <span id="s1348">You have arranged them in order.</span> <span id="s1349">Would you hold these up please?</span> <span id="s1350">We are going to just…take a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes, because I wanted everybody...I wanted to have my whole family because they were part of the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Turn it around.</span> <span id="s1353">Alright you guys, will you please tell
