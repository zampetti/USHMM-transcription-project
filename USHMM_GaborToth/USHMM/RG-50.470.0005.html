clean the factory.</span> <span id="s8">After a while there was nothing to clean the factory so they brought us out to [Bierstraut]_______which meant that we were just pushing little carriages.</span> <span id="s9">These went that way with stones, but there was nothing to do really, inhale....</span> <span id="s10">and there was one older SS man who kept eh telling us news which we didn't want to believe.</span> <span id="s11">He and we were really afraid even to listen to him, we were a little afraid of him that he was probably a [jarcoette]___________.</span> <span id="s12">But he was telling us stories like eh we were _______young ________and such at the end which sounded strange.</span> <span id="s13">One morning around elevenish, they came after us to the factory and rushed us into the camp.</span> <span id="s14">And they gave their last soup and rushed us out from there and we were on the road.</span> <span id="s15">We were on the road, and that evening the [really fight

getting on that and they were just leaving us.</span> <span id="s26">And at that point, I said to my family and friends that I'm leaving them too.</span> <span id="s27">I don't let myself somewhere where they don't to go????</span> <span id="s28">They said I'm crazy, I must not do such a thing, but I just kept going along and eh ran right into the forest.</span> <span id="s29">But they couldn't resist following me and so about nine of us were together now away from the big group and went into nowhere; we had no idea where we go.</span> <span id="s30">But when we got to the other edge of this little forest we saw a rout, and on that road, army was moving, slowly.</span> <span id="s31">Like sickish-ly__________horse-drawn eh horse-drawn carriage and such.</span> <span id="s32">It was the German's, the back of the German's going back from the front.</span> <span id="s33">And of course, that's the reason we were on that other road not to be able to see them or not to be in their way.</span> <span id="s34">And so we didn't dare to go out there.</span> <span id="s35">We stayed in this road-side little forest and kept going into a little village and they stopped at the edge of this village and of course in the meantime, before getting there we got through fields.</span> <span id="s36">There we found some radishes and eh something was still thrown around there not picked up which we made good use of.</span> <span id="s37">That was something to eat, cause they forgot to give us anything to eat by then.</span> <span id="s38">Then we got to the edge of this village, then we started at this left house and we dared to and the guy looked us over and he said you can go up to the barns and at the barn above there the hay, we can stay.</span> <span id="s39">So we stayed.</span> <span id="s40">And for the day, for the for the night he came to the evening, around evening and he said we should go further in.</span> <span id="s41">And we went further in.</span>

even realize it was Good Friday so they were all cooking for this holiday.</span> <span id="s53">And there was potatoes and there was bread, real bread.</span> <span id="s54">And they were cutting a slice here and there and they said that we can not eat it here because our sister is waiting outside and wanted to give her, too.</span> <span id="s55">Don't forget we were two of us who spoke German who dared to go into the house and explain that we are hungry.</span> <span id="s56">We didn't need to express too much, they could see it on us.</span> <span id="s57">And then we went back to our present house and we were in the yard, and at two o'clock in the afternoon there were big noises.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Sigh......And eh a tank - kind of thing stopped in front of us.</span> <span id="s59">Evidently they were waiting for the whole line to come and they wanted to come into the village to get an enforce, not knowing what to expect.</span> <span id="s60">But we looked out on the gate and we saw that our landlord had divided pair of paints hanging out.</span> <span id="s61">That was the the only thing that he could put out for a _____________flag, evidently.</span> <span

started to speak English, the little English we knew and tell them who we are.</span> <span id="s67">So they looked at what they had leftovers and they had some from the breakfast ration and some

sure thing.</span> <span id="s76">We we were just not sure we were still with the German's and they they left and we were here with the German's.</span> <span id="s77">Of course the German's, they did not call us into the kitchenette.</span> <span id="s78">We had fresh potatoes to eat.</span> <span id="s79">She cooked a lot of potatoes and she was very surprised and in no time there was no potatoes

were eight of us smoking together and all of us saw the day light.</span> <span id="s94">During the day light, the broad day light all the stars were strong.</span> <span id="s95">We were hungry and weren't use to cigarettes anymore so months and months we hadn't seen one.</span> <span id="s96">See that was minute we realized that we were liberated.</span> <span id="s97">Soon after that the American group started to move on and we were left here and we had no idea whats happening to us now that they left and we stayed.</span> <span id="s98">So we tried to go after them and so we got on main street into the area where from other areas also some others who were hidden around came forward.</span> <span id="s99">So ah Moroccan, black guys, Russian girls, and it was an absolute holiday spirit with all these people laughing at not understanding what's happening to them.</span> <span id="s100">Free to go out and they had to speak to each other and the Moroccan come over and kiss our hands, our hands which were yellow from the {sow peta sword}_________________.</span> <span id="s101">Yes it was human again, humanity came.</span> <span id="s102">When we went back to the house, the peasants had on fresh potatoes cooked and invited us into the kitchen to have potatoes with them.</span> <span id="s103">In no time there were no potatoes left in this huge amount of potatoes just disappeared.</span> <span id="s104">All this hungry people seeing the first real thing was they probably always wished for, simple, good potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Inhale.....And the I think next day was when they came for us that we should go up to the mayor's house and there was a big room, a huge table set-up for all of us and everybody in this village had to bring a dish of food so that it was all poured together and that mixture we ate.</span> <span id="s106">It was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">It was really Easter kind of food.</span> <span id="s108">For us, probably for them tht was nothing, but eh something what they had to give and em they were not really giving with happy hearts.</span> <span id="s109">For them it was over and for us it will

chairs and tables.</span> <span id="s115">Of course no place to go to sleep, but on the side there was hay put down and for us it was marvelous.</span> <span id="s116">But to have to tell you something what probably you can not even understand.</span> <span id="s117">Outside on the in that garden there was a little outhouse, the size of normal two small children size.</span></p> <p><span

it first happened.</span> <span id="s119">It was just unbelievable that this is where we will have to use.</span> <span id="s120">From there in a week or so we were moved into a hotel.</span> <span id="s121">And that was already room, bed.</span> <span id="s122">Even a place to put something down I which was very sad I had nothing to put down yet but while living there we were accumulating.</span> <span id="s123">We started to sew dresses for ourselves.</span> <span id="s124">Started to feed in order to go out for milk because there was nothing enough for us.</span> <span id="s125">And of course seeing guests.</span> <span id="s126">The GI's came to visit with us the evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">They were nearby, they got their rest place for, uh, two

id="s129">Cough... The Russian were not allowed to mix with the Americans or other Americans were not to mix with them.</span> <span id="s130">Not with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">So we were the only ones they were allowed to mix.</span> <span id="s132">And boy we were happy that they were human beings to talk to and who could tell us what's happening around us.</span> <span id="s133">But of course, not everything was so easy.</span> <span id="s134">There were times when all of a sudden the American's troops went westward and we were scared that were probably pushed back.</span> <span

it.</span> <span id="s147">But nothing more than what they had to do.</span> <span id="s148">So like in this hotel where we lived.</span> <span id="s149">There was a family owning it they were to cook for us.</span> <span id="s150">They didn't.</span> <span id="s151">When we asked for something that we would like to have something, they couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s152">The once we mentioned that to a GI who went to the officer who was in charge and he asked us to what we need to what we wanted to make.</span> <span id="s153">And we said eggs and sugar and flour and they claimed that they have it only as much they are getting on their tickets.</span> <span id="s154">And they can not give us.</span> <span id="s155">So they deliver it for us.</span> <span id="s156">And then some of these people who where there in that resting place later, turned out to be able to get from the PX things what they needed,like handkerchiefs, like soup, and so we found one who came over to us on the poolside, all their stuff while the rest was frolicking in the water.</span> <span id="s157">And he said to us that he was Jewish and that he was taken from home when he son was probably three days old.</span> <span id="s158">He was allowed to go home to see him but right after then they shipped out.</span> <span id="s159">And since then he didn't have a Friday night.</span></p> <p><span

him that we still hope that he find somebody from our family who went back to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">So we just can not do that.</span> <span id="s170">But we stayed in correspondence

they go to Yugoslavia but they have to go through Hungary so let us go with them.</span> <span id="s177">And so we they allowed us to, so we went.</span> <span id="s178">In Prague the American embassy

id="s185">They knew that I was on my way home because my father was told by somebody who heard the [Matclauss] radio that I was on the list of the people alive.</span> <span id="s186">And when my father heard that he wanted to make some big festivity out of it, so he bought a half a pound of apricots for himself; that was his way of celebration because his only daughter is alive and comes back.</span> <span id="s187">And then I arrived, late one night with my aunt and uncle and then I went back to my father, who was half his size, and, awful happy to see me.</span> <span id="s188">And

some.</span> <span id="s193">But to go to Budapest meant that we were on a train which either had coal to heat it and make steam, or not.</span> <span id="s194">And we were [placed for standing] hours before we could go further.</span> <span id="s195">And the Russian soldiers came into the car, looked around, and who didn't look too old, they pulled out from the train, pushed them right under the
