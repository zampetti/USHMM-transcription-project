Krakow.</span> <span id="s46">In Bukia I had...my grandfather had...how you call it...a estate...a big estate.</span> <span id="s47">It was like a palace surrounded...with walls around...big high walls.</span> <span id="s48">He was a very rich man.</span> <span id="s49">Had his own bank.</span> <span id="s50">We had the filleair by us too.</span> <span id="s51">My late father had it ‘till

restrictions?</span> <span id="s55">Were you allowed to do banking business with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s56">Or only with Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: We had no restrictions.</span> <span id="s58">We could bank with anybody you wanted.</span> <span id="s59">Especially after the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So, did you go to religious school as well as to public

id="s66">Q: You were Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I was Bar Mitzvah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was there a large Jewish population in the town where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh yeah, there was a very large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s70">I wouldn’t remember the amount...five, six thousand Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And how much...how many people in the whole town?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: We had three synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: No.</span> <span id="s74">How many people were there, Jewish and non-Jewish were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I can’t...I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: But five or six thousand Jewish people is a sizeable number?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: It was a sizeable number, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: As you were growing up do you remember any anti-Semitic experiences that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Oh yeah the anti-Semitics in Poland was easier.</span> <span id="s80">As a matter of fact in school we had a group of Jewish boys with me always and if the kids used to call us Zidje, or...Zidje means Jew...or any other inflammable words against Jews...so we used to beat them up.</span> <span id="s81">And I used to get beaten for it later on from the Director of the school.</span> <span id="s82">They see me beating up other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: You got it both ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Got it both ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Do you remember your father talking about anti-Semitic experiences connected with his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No.</span> <span id="s87">Because we didn’t...we did very little business with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s88">Only we bought from the Polish people like lumber, standing lumber, or cut lumber.</span> <span id="s89">Export was to Holland and we dealt only with the Dutch people.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Very little with the Christian people.</span> <span id="s92">Matter of fact, one time right after the First World War, we had a partnership with the Christian...one family...very prominent family in the town...Christian.</span> <span id="s93">So we didn’t feel so much anti-Semitism by us.</span> <span id="s94">But between the kids and the priests used to say the Jews killed Jesus and matter of fact I just heard over here in Bradenton is a priest what still says it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I hope somebody is talking to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Christian...Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: They don’t give up easily so they?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No they don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: You said earlier that you had started law school and then you had to stop.</span> <span id="s100">What were the circumstances that made you stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: The war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Then I couldn’t go to school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And the Germans overran Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Overran Poland, yea...1939.</span> <span id="s106">What was it August?</span> <span id="s107">August I think...end of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Can you remember...can you tell me about that...what happened that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: The Germans...First of all...before the Germans run over the Polish army, we had the lumber mills close to the Czechoslovakian border...so the Polish army took over...we had to get out and the Polish army took over our lumber mills and they settled there to protect Poland.</span> <span id="s110">They didn’t stay too long.</span> <span id="s111">It was two weeks I think before...two weeks, or three weeks before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s112">So we stopped working at that time and I came home from the lumber mills.</span> <span id="s113">It was a tough day.</span> <span id="s114">We had two cars, so we...it was already sick soldiers and things like that...so I had a van from the city and my late father had a van from the city that we could go all over and transport the sick to the hospitals...army hospitals and things like that.</span> <span id="s115">So we used to travel by car.</span> <span id="s116">One car I drove and the other my late father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Are you saying that they took over your father’s business, they just took it away from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s119">The Polish army didn’t take it away.</span> <span id="s120">They just came in and settled themselves there to protect.</span> <span id="s121">So no use to run the business any more because the soldiers around you and everything so you couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s122">There was a hundred workers and we had to let them go.</span> <span id="s123">So we used to run them and then when the war broke out for real, so we loaded up the cars and the horse with the big buggy with the whole family...my grandmother and other uncles from Nowy-Sacz came around and we traveled towards the Russian...Russian Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s124">So because of my armband, I was driving the horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s125">I could always pass any post.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Check post?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Check post...we could pass by any check post.</span> <span id="s128">They seen the band they didn’t look anything, just “Go ahead, go head.”</span> <span id="s129">So we came to Samber and the Germans run us over.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: The Germans what?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Run...caught...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Overran you?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Overran us.</span> <span id="s134">And we stopped there and...and, we stopped there, we slept over two nights I think, and we started back home because there was no use to go further...because the Germans.</span> <span id="s135">We didn’t know that the Russians would come there.</span> <span id="s136">If we would know, we wouldn’t have moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: How far from home were you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh, this was far...I don’t know...it was three hundred miles, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Was there a lot of confusion, people?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: There was confusion all over, all over.</span> <span id="s141">Right away, the next day, matter of fact, the Germans gave us...soon they came in they gave orders, all the Jews should report on the market, on the market place and they need to work and have brooms and shovels with them and things.</span> <span id="s142">We didn’t go...the day after we started back with the cars and the horses and traveled back.</span> <span id="s143">We stopped over a couple days on the road.</span> <span id="s144">We settled in a couple places on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: At that time, at that time can you remember whether people like yourselves were aware of what the Germans were planning to do with the Jews?</span> <span id="s146">Did you have any idea that they were going to kill all those Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No.</span> <span id="s148">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s149">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s150">Matter of fact, the car was stopped on one corner and the German soldiers were going...an officer came over, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s151">Whose car is it?”</span> <span id="s152">So he wanted to take away the car so he gave us a note, “You report there and then give the car.”</span> <span id="s153">We we went...we packed up and we had the car for a day then we get the permission to go on further home with the car.</span> <span id="s154">So we got the permission from the Germans to go home.</span> <span id="s155">One German came by, an officer said, “You Jews are supposed to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s156">Not over here.</span> <span id="s157">You will go to Palestine one day.”</span> <span id="s158">That was the whole thing, right away...but nobody had any idea what they had in mind to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So you weren’t too frightened going back in the direction of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: We all were frightened.</span> <span id="s161">We were frightened.</span> <span id="s162">We didn’t know what’s going to be.</span> <span id="s163">But we went...we went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: How long did it take you to get back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: About three days...we went home.</span> <span id="s166">We came home.</span> <span id="s167">Right away somebody told them...we hid the cars and somebody told them that we had one car.</span> <span id="s168">Then they wanted to take it so...we have an American Whippet, you wouldn’t remember...so one wire from the battery was connected to the motor, we took away</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So they couldn’t drive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: The Germans couldn’t drive it.</span> <span id="s171">The biggest mechanics, they looked at it, they couldn’t get it to run...I wouldn’t tell them.</span> <span id="s172">So they made holes in the cylinders...each cylinder...they killed the car and they gave it back to us.</span> <span id="s173">But we sold it for nothing, the cars later on.</span> <span id="s174">We got almost nothing for it...it was a wonderful car.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Then we start already...they always starving.</span> <span id="s177">You had to go to work...down the streets...sweep the streets and things like that.</span> <span id="s178">And they organized a Federation...a Jewish Federation, like the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s179">Was the Jewish “Judenrat.”</span> <span id="s180">Judenrat means Jewish...like Jewish Federation.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: But you were allowed to live in your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yeah, meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: We were living rather...we had a home in the back of the road.</span> <span id="s185">We were allowed all the way to live there.</span> <span id="s186">Other people had to move.</span> <span id="s187">When they were near, close to the main road or something, they had to get out from there and move somewhere else.</span> <span id="s188">After a certain time.</span> <span id="s189">What did you ask me?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Not for everybody.</span> <span id="s192">We managed.</span> <span id="s193">We had a lot of acquaintances.</span> <span id="s194">And we still had...as a matter of fact, the first year...what was it...the first three quarters of a year I did run one lumber mill for the Germans.</span> <span id="s195">And because we get acquainted with the German, how you call it...”le schnitzen” how is it...forest...top forestman.</span> <span id="s196">How you call them over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Forest ranger?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Forest ranger.</span> <span id="s199">Yes, ranger, but he was officer...high officer.</span> <span id="s200">And he brought in a company to cut the lumber and he got some...a lot of money from it, too...the forest ranger...the German.</span> <span id="s201">And we did the run, I did the run.</span> <span id="s202">I runned the mill.</span> <span id="s203">One day, I get a very good beating from that...I didn’t cover some boards and things like that...it was snowing, the rain and it got wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And he literally beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: He literally beat my guts out but I survived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: By this time it was 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: 1940, yeah.</span> <span id="s208">It was a very cold winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: And after the beating did you go back to the lumber mill?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: The mill closed anyway after that and they took away the lumber from it.</span> <span id="s211">We closed up and we managed to take home about enough lumber to last us for two or three years.</span> <span id="s212">But we didn’t use it all, we had to move.</span> <span id="s213">But we had enough lumber to use for firewood.</span> <span id="s214">Was no stove...electric stuff like that.</span> <span id="s215">Just some wood or coal you used to burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Even in the good days you didn’t have electricity?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s218">Was not...didn’t come yet to Poland so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Electrification is a big project?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Big project, that’s why.</span> <span id="s221">We had electricity at home, but they cut this off too after...the Germans came in they cut the electricity off every Jewish home.</span> <span id="s222">They didn’t give it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: And they could do that selectively?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Selectively, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So it sounds like things started getting worse and worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh yeah, getting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s227">And there were selections to go with...pick on...young fellows...the young men to work other sections of the country and...and they vanished.</span> <span id="s228">These young fellows vanished always.</span> <span id="s229">If they went, they never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What did people think became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: We never knew.</span> <span id="s232">Never knew what happened.</span> <span id="s233">But one day my father...the Jewish community got the order for another fifteen young fellows, so my father took them to the...and he was acquainted with the “arbeits dienst fuhrer.”</span> <span id="s234">Arbeits dienst fuhrer is the head of the...commander...working commander.</span> <span id="s235">The head of the working commander.</span> <span id="s236">And he got plenty of force and things like that for himself, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Plenty of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Force, or different gifts...so my late father took the young boys, and it was a little shul what nobody knew it...somewhere close by, and my father took the boys to the shul there and said, ‘Let me daven first,” and they prayed and he said, “You stay here and I will come back for you.”</span> <span id="s239">And he went and brought the young fellows home.</span> <span id="s240">He didn’t let them go to the work.</span> <span id="s241">And was a few times like that.</span> <span id="s242">He never let them loose...the fellows to go to the Germans.</span> <span id="s243">We had the lumber...standing lumber in another place.</span> <span id="s244">My younger brother was in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Hiding in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s247">He wasn’t hiding.</span> <span id="s248">But there was a Jewish family living there.</span> <span id="s249">And he stayed there and he used to sell...he sold there, he demanded some lumber too for firewood...firewood.</span> <span id="s250">So he used to sell, like how you call it by...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: The Cord, Cord wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Cord wood.</span> <span id="s253">So he used to sell it and one folk deutsch came and he told that he bought it and later he said that he cheated him and they took him to jail.</span> <span id="s254">But my father, late father had some acquaintances in the “arbeits dienst fuhrer” and they pulled him out in a few days from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s255">He was at the Gestapo and the Gestapo was a Haman.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Say the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Haman.</span> <span id="s258">His name was Haman.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Hayman?</span> <span id="s260">.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No not Hayman, Haman.</span> <span id="s262">The Bible.</span> <span id="s263">They call Haman.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Haman, the biblical Haman you know...Esther.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Oh, Haman.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: So...my late father somehow took him out from there.</span> <span id="s268">Was a tough thing, but he took him out...took him home.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were your parents becoming alarmed?</span> <span id="s270">Were they thinking of maybe they should leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: They couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: They couldn’t at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: They couldn’t.</span> <span id="s274">At that point you couldn’t leave nowhere.</span> <span id="s275">We should have stayed in Sambor.</span> <span id="s276">And the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s277">Then we could have gone to Russia.</span> <span id="s278">But we didn’t know what’s happened.</span> <span id="s279">We didn’t know the Germans in 1941 would cross over to Russia.</span> <span id="s280">I mean that the Russians would come to Sambor.</span> <span id="s281">Because there was waterway.</span> <span id="s282">The Sun, and they stopped...they backed up...the Germans backed up to that waterway and the Russians came by.</span> <span id="s283">Matter of fact I wanted to cross over to the Russians...we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s284">My younger brother and me in 1939 we went back there to cross over to Russia and we couldn’t cross over.</span> <span id="s285">Was...the borders were very guarded.</span> <span id="s286">A lot of people were killed on that border.</span> <span id="s287">They wanted to run back to Russia.</span> <span id="s288">So we came home, too, later on.</span> <span id="s289">Our parents didn’t know what happened to us.</span> <span id="s290">We were about two weeks away, and didn’t know where we are.</span> <span id="s291">And they were glad to see us.</span> <span id="s292">That was 1940, and 1941 was another very hard winter and we couldn’t manage anymore the lumber mill because they took it away from us.</span> <span id="s293">So what shall I tell you.</span> <span id="s294">In 1941...it will be a month, a little bit more than a month from now...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: May of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: May, yeah.</span> <span id="s297">May of 1941...matter of fact before that the police, Polish police, was looking for my father.</span> <span id="s298">They wanted to stop him.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What was the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: The reason was.</span> <span id="s301">.</span> <span id="s302">officer from the Polish police and he was working with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s303">And when were in the...we run away from the Germans, that police officer came to my father on the road, I don’t how he found him and things like that.</span> <span id="s304">He said, “ He has so many children, he has no bread, he has nothing.”</span> <span id="s305">My father wouldn’t help him.</span> <span id="s306">So he gave his half what we had, exactly half.</span> <span id="s307">We didn’t have too much.</span> <span id="s308">I always managed to find somebody in every city we came...to find somebody to take me to the bakeries and sell it to me.</span> <span id="s309">We had bread, we had other things.</span> <span id="s310">We bought even gasoline for the cars on the black market.</span> <span id="s311">We bought it on the black market.</span> <span id="s312">Money was no objection.</span> <span id="s313">So he gave it to him.</span> <span id="s314">Because my late father was so kind to him...after that, he paid him back with that...he was looking for him...to...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: No sense of gratitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No sense of gratitude.</span> <span id="s317">Matter of fact, was another gratitude my late father did for another Polish gentleman.</span> <span id="s318">He supposedly, I don’t know why...I can’t remember now why he needed it...he said...he gave on to the records tax thing or something like that...that he bought from us lumber, just before the war and he sold it.</span> <span id="s319">He was a fine gentleman though...and my late father helped him out with it.</span> <span id="s320">He asked my father, but helping him out we went over books, records from our lumber mill and the lumber sales he tore up in pieces.</span> <span id="s321">He tore it up and burned it...shouldn’t be any records.</span> <span id="s322">So the same guy from the lumber...the officer from the woods...how you call it, the forester, the officer came by and questioned and took him somewhere to the police and questioned him for hours.</span> <span id="s323">I don’t know, I was in the lumber mill at that time and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s324">I had to go home...and I walked, because we didn’t have any transportation...I walked almost 20 kilometers.</span> <span id="s325">I walked home.</span> <span id="s326">And I came home was a police-S.S. man sitting with a gun watching the whole family and I had to sit and I found out that my father is interrogated by that officer.</span> <span id="s327">He made him black and blue.</span> <span id="s328">My father couldn’t sit for three months.</span> <span id="s329">So he beat him up.</span> <span id="s330">Said he doesn’t know, he hasn’t got the records.</span> <span id="s331">He did sell him...he hasn’t got the records...this is in the war, things got lost and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And that’s why they were beating him?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: They were beating him up.</span> <span id="s334">He couldn’t sit for three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: That’s pretty bad.</span> <span id="s336">So things were gradually getting worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: And the selections were still going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Selections...from time to time, they picked up this guy, this guy, this guy...Jewish guys and Polish guys too.</span> <span id="s340">It was a terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: But there weren’t any mass transports at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No, no, not that point was no...we didn’t know any of that mass transports.</span> <span id="s343">But the...May in 1941...mine...a few times my late father, as I said, he hid from the police, he knew.</span> <span id="s344">Somebody told him the police were looking for him.</span> <span id="s345">So he was hiding in the village somewhere by Jewish families and things like that.</span> <span id="s346">But that day they have ordered from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s347">The Haman himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: His name was really Haman?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Haman.</span> <span id="s350">He said he will do better than Haman in the Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: It’s an incredible coincidence of names.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: An incredible coincidence of names.</span> <span id="s353">And that was 27 days of Svirah that means counting the days from Pesach to Savuoth...it’s 27 days.</span> <span id="s354">He came and he ordered, Haman ordered from my late father, not my late father, from the Jewish Council...the Jewish Council, 35 people, young people, and they should be sent to him to Nowy Sacz.</span> <span id="s355">So they couldn’t collect...they collect some 10 people, 12 people and they send them.</span> <span id="s356">Couldn’t collect all of them.</span> <span id="s357">So he came to town and ordered all...the whole Judenrat.</span> <span id="s358">The Judenrat mean the Federation, everybody to be at the office and he is coming.</span> <span id="s359">He came with three other guys.</span> <span id="s360">And selected ten people.</span> <span id="s361">Between them my father.</span> <span id="s362">And my father, before he left, he said...and we asked him not to go, we begged him not to go, to hide...he said, “If I not going, if I wouldn’t go, the whole city will burn.”</span> <span id="s363">So he said, “I have to go, or the whole city will burn.</span> <span id="s364">I have to go.”</span> <span id="s365">But he told me, nearby where the Judenrat was, was a Jewish doctor and I was working as a helper to him, as an assistant by that Jewish doctor...and the windows from that office...it was near a park.</span> <span id="s366">That was the park over here, the Judenrat was here, the doctor was over here and I could look out to the park whenever I wanted.</span> <span id="s367">So I looked out and I see ten people walking in one row towards the park and between them my late father.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Elias.</span> <span id="s370">And they start shooting...one after the other.</span> <span id="s371">My late father was the third man.</span> <span id="s372">I see him, he turned around, he said something.</span> <span id="s373">But later on came out, he said, “I will give you everything...whatever you want from the city, let the people live.”</span> <span id="s374">Then Haman said...laughed and said, “I will take it myself,” and shot him in the stomach first and then shot him in the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: And you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I saw this yeah.</span> <span id="s377">And was a friend of mine from school in the big business...all the prominent people, big businessmen...we have been as a matter of fact at the trial of that Haman.</span> <span id="s378">So I seen that and they left so I run out and my aunt was living in the back somewhere on the side of the street and my aunt was living...we were living over by here and my aunt was living here...and just to go around so I stepped in my aunt’s and I said, “They killed him.”</span> <span id="s379">Then I went with the back road home and we knew what’s happened.</span> <span id="s380">So we knew that my late father was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Were you allowed to claim the bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: We claimed the bodies, yes.</span> <span id="s383">As a matter of fact, we didn’t claim the bodies, they ordered it.</span> <span id="s384">That was...the guys, Jewish, like “droski” you know that means taxi drivers, not taxi drivers but horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s385">They ordered to take him up to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s386">Next day we went to cemetery and buried them.</span> <span id="s387">My late mother wouldn’t go with me...women didn’t go to the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Your older brothers and sisters weren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: My older brother was away, sisters were at home.</span> <span id="s390">But older brother was away that day.</span> <span id="s391">He runned away somewhere.</span> <span id="s392">He knew something happened.</span> <span id="s393">He runned away and came back a few days later.</span> <span id="s394">And we buried him.</span> <span id="s395">After that, the summer they said they are going to ship us out of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: And they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: They did.</span> <span id="s398">And by August, they shipped us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Is this still 1941 or 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah, that was 1941.</span> <span id="s401">They shipped us out.</span> <span id="s402">And they were already starting the liquidation of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s405">Just to go somewhere else to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: So describe what it was like when they took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: See they ordered us in front in front of the Judenrat of the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s408">In front of it was a big street...as a matter of fact, they moved from that place, the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s409">We used to be near the park, they moved on the back street, was a big street there and they had to move, not to be near a main crossway.</span> <span id="s410">So they ordered us, everybody to line up in front of the streets and Haman came and ordered everybody should empty out their pockets, their money and everything.</span> <span id="s411">Any money, any jewelry, anything to put down in front of them, on the road.</span> <span id="s412">Then he collected everything.</span> <span id="s413">Thirty-six of us people stayed behind to work on the young people.</span> <span id="s414">And me and my two brothers, we stayed behind.</span> <span id="s415">There was a lumber mill about one-mile out of the city and to work there in the lumber mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did you decide this?</span> <span id="s417">Or did you volunteer for it?</span> <span id="s418">How did you get to stay behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: We volunteered for it.</span> <span id="s420">See, they selected maybe somebody should be left in the city or something.</span> <span id="s421">We didn’t know what to do, so the Jewish, the Judenrat made a list from people to...which stayed behind and we were included.</span> <span id="s422">So we stayed behind to work and then a few used to work in the lumber mill, about a dozen of us we used to go every day, every morning to the railroad station and load railroad cars...lumber on the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s423">So what could I say.</span> <span id="s424">One day we were working on the railroad track and the other, the rest of the people they took to Nowy Sacz and they were staying a few days on the outside.</span> <span id="s425">They didn’t have where to live, just outside in the park, I don’t know where they were...in the Jewish section.</span> <span id="s426">They stayed outside and then they loaded up everybody in the cattle cars and took them away.</span> <span id="s427">But we were...I was working on the railroad station, all of a sudden I see the train coming and loaded with people.</span> <span id="s428">And one train, in one car, my late sister looked out through the window and screamed, “Help us, help us.”</span> <span id="s429">They were choking, it was heat...hot, was nothing to drink, was nowhere...everything was done in the railroad car.</span> <span id="s430">You must know that, somebody must have told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: No bathroom facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No bathroom facilities, nothing.</span> <span id="s433">“Help us, help us.”</span> <span id="s434">I..</span> <span id="s435">.</span> <span id="s436">my brothers and me, we decided...we had some money...hidden and somebody brought this to us to the work and we decided to send one guy, a Polish guy...to follow them where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: To follow the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Follow the train.</span> <span id="s439">He followed the train to Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: How did he follow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: How you follow it?</span> <span id="s442">He followed how the train went, he followed it right straight after that.</span> <span id="s443">He asked people, you know, how to come.</span> <span id="s444">They followed to Belsen.</span> <span id="s445">He went to Belsen.</span> <span id="s446">He couldn’t go further.</span> <span id="s447">He went, was still a Judenrat there, in Belsen.</span> <span id="s448">He went into Judenrat and asked them, “What’s happened to that train.”</span> <span id="s449">He said, “Don’t go in there and don’t ask questions.</span> <span id="s450">Go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Which was the first real clue that really bad things were happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Really bad things were happening.</span> <span id="s453">We couldn’t do nothing more.</span> <span id="s454">We couldn’t help.</span> <span id="s455">We didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s456">Nobody, they didn’t come back and said they were killed or something.</span> <span id="s457">Tha’s gate nobody is allowed to come in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How far was Belsen from where these people were, from where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: It was in east Poland.</span> <span id="s460">Belsen was east Poland and we were in west Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Quite a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Quite a distance.</span> <span id="s463">Cost a nice amount of money to find this...and after a couple months working in the lumber mills, we went to Nowy Sacz and we cleaned up Nowy Sacz ghetto.</span> <span id="s464">The people...after the people left the train...everything.</span> <span id="s465">Everything went from over there.</span> <span id="s466">All the people from Nowy Sacz too, went.</span> <span id="s467">And they were all in one...one or two trains.</span> <span id="s468">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s469">And we worked there.</span> <span id="s470">We cleaned out, we tore down some houses that were shacks and things like that...Jewish section, poor neighborhoods and things like that.</span> <span id="s471">One day Haman come in and picked ten people to meet him at the woods over there with, was a Jewish policeman with us.</span> <span id="s472">He told the Jewish policeman, “You meet me over there, there with these people.”</span> <span id="s473">And we didn’t know what for we going, what we are going for.</span> <span id="s474">And we went and they told them to...in the back was across the road was the woods and we had to stay in the woods until they would call us.</span> <span id="s475">But we have seen what’s happening in there.</span> <span id="s476">Behind the road was about 12 or something people what they caught.</span> <span id="s477">Between them was one Jewish woman with a young child.</span> <span id="s478">They had to undress, nude.</span> <span id="s479">They had already the grave already.</span> <span id="s480">And they had to line up in front of the grave and they shot one after the other.</span> <span id="s481">The child run over to mother and grabbed her like that so they saved a bullet and shot the mother with the child with one bullet.</span> <span id="s482">And we had to bury them after that.</span> <span id="s483">Cover them with sand.</span> <span id="s484">It was terrible to watch...terrible.</span> <span id="s485">They were running like animals, faster, faster, faster, faster.</span> <span id="s486">And one wasn’t so fast, so they buried him alive.</span> <span id="s487">We had to pour the sand over him, alive cause he didn’t work so fast.</span> <span id="s488">It was my brother and me was there.</span> <span id="s489">From there we went to Tarnow, and Tarnow so... It was already 1942 in...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: What month in 1942?</span> <span id="s491">What time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: It was in spring.</span> <span

You never knew when your turn might come?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Never knew nothing.</span> <span id="s497">We worked...we were in the...at the, in the working ghettos.</span> <span id="s498">Two ghettos, one for old people who couldn’t work, one for the people what worked.</span> <span id="s499">And you couldn’t go across always.</span> <span id="s500">Sometimes you could if you had a Jewish policeman friend staying the gate you could cross over.</span> <span id="s501">If you didn’t have it, you couldn’t cross over.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: The people in these ghettos were from all over Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">AL From all over Poland.</span> <span id="s504">From all around the town of Jaslov, the town of Krasow, all over, they brought them in there.</span> <span id="s505">End of 1942, they liquidated the ghetto and the, another few hundred stayed behind.</span> <span id="s506">We cleaned up...not all of it.</span> <span id="s507">We cleaned up a little bit up the ghetto.</span> <span id="s508">Clothes we had to sort it out, separate into separate...because the old clothes...another camp called Szebnia, that is not far from Jaslov, that’s all eastern...not eastern, southern middle Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: So that was really your first time in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yeah, we had been in a camp before in the first city but later on, we weren’t at home...we work...we were in a camp.</span> <span id="s511">In the first city when we were working for the lumber mill, we were in a camp.</span> <span id="s512">Szebnia was a camp with over there 20,000 Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s513">And they were all killed, one by one and burned on the stake.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: The Russians were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: The Russians were killed and burned on the stake.</span> <span id="s516">The fire and smell of the human bodies, you could smell it for miles and miles...terrible.</span> <span id="s517">Stink.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: These were all people who were all prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s520">They were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s521">They killed them off.</span> <span id="s522">Now, when we came, half of us went to camp.</span> <span id="s523">The other half went to the woods, to the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: What was the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Szebnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Oh that was still Szebnia?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Szebnia.</span> <span id="s528">And they picked the young and strongest fifteen people between, I was there...to go to the woods with the people.</span> <span id="s529">We didn’t know what, why we were going for.</span> <span id="s530">But they lined up all these people, nude.</span> <span id="s531">The half of the group, and were staying...we had to stay on the side...they shot them all.</span> <span id="s532">Who was shot, who wasn’t and we had to throw them on the fire.</span> <span id="s533">Have you ever stayed near a fire, near a building what burns close by, you couldn’t stay there...too hot.</span> <span id="s534">We had to go very close to throw two people, one by the legs, one by the arms and throw them over on the top.</span> <span id="s535">The fire was so high, 20 feet high, and we had to throw everybody.</span> <span id="s536">You had to work so fast, that’s one thing...fast.</span> <span id="s537">We were crying and carrying, crying and carrying and throwing, we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s538">One guy didn’t work fast enough, they three him up...alive.</span> <span id="s539">And we came back broken.</span> <span id="s540">It was such an experience, I don’t wish to a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Something you can really never put out of your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: No.</span> <span id="s543">It’s terrible.</span> <span id="s544">Just to stay in front of that fire and throw up people on top of the pile.</span> <span id="s545">People, children that didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">(Pause) What I tell you, the name of the commander was Grzymek and his his partner was John.</span> <span id="s547">His first name was John.</span> <span id="s548">I don’t know what the other name.</span> <span id="s549">And they used to kill like flies.</span> <span id="s550">And one young fellow, just...I don’t know how it came out, if he told him something to work faster or something in the camp.</span> <span id="s551">So he said, :I will live to see you dead anyway,” to that commander.</span> <span id="s552">So he went and hung him on his hands and the back and his hands and he was hanging all day until they went out of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Arms went out of the sockets?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Arms went out of the sockets.</span> <span id="s555">The guy was screaming half a day, so that you have to stuff your ears with cotton to not to be able to hear.</span> <span id="s556">We couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s557">Nobody could help anything.</span> <span id="s558">And two days later, in the evening, he hanged him by the neck.</span> <span id="s559">And we all have to stay and watch it.</span> <span id="s560">The whole thing took till late at night.</span> <span id="s561">We had to stay and watch it.</span> <span id="s562">And two days later.</span> <span id="s563">He killed a woman with a young girl...I don’t know if he wanted to rape that girl or what.</span> <span id="s564">And they were hugging each other and they killed them.</span> <span id="s565">I could tell you stories...I don’t know...it is indescribable, you can’t describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: I can see where just emotionally it would be very hard to survive.</span> <span id="s567">How did you survive physically?</span> <span id="s568">Were you given food or enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No, we weren’t given food so much.</span> <span id="s570">We managed somehow.</span> <span id="s571">We ate...wasn’t too much to eat anyway.</span> <span id="s572">Whatever they gave us was very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: You lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: We lost weight, sure.</span> <span id="s575">And, then, in the fall, already it was cold, they shipped us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s576">We are traveling three days to Auschwitz in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s577">Same story, no food, no water, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: People died in the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s580">People breaking out from the trains.</span> <span id="s581">Knocking with their fists out with the boards and they jump from the trains and break their hands...their legs and hands...they used to...jumping out.</span> <span id="s582">Horrible stories...horrible to see it.</span> <span id="s583">We looked out through that hole he broke out and we seeing him screaming and broke and after that they shot him right from the train.</span> <span id="s584">They shot him.</span> <span id="s585">We came to Auschwitz on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s586">Mengele came around and all the...I don’t know how many...forty, fifty S.S. men.</span> <span id="s587">And we had to jump from the car, “Fast, fast, fast.</span> <span id="s588">Jump from the car.</span> <span id="s589">In line.</span> <span id="s590">Five in line, five in line, five in line.”</span> <span id="s591">So my two brothers and two other guys, young fellows, we got together in one line and we going right and the other left.</span> <span id="s592">Right and left, right and left.</span> <span id="s593">You twins, and you what.</span> <span id="s594">He was asking if you’re twins and...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: He was interested in those experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: In those experiments.</span> <span id="s597">And we got to Birkenau...</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: You didn’t stay in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Birkenau and Auschwitz is one camp.</span> <span id="s600">But Birkenau was a transit place.</span> <span id="s601">Auschwitz was permanent.</span> <span id="s602">Birkenau was the ovens.</span> <span id="s603">And Auschwitz, that was already standing, the people didn’t work.</span> <span id="s604">And these people built the chimneys.</span> <span id="s605">People from Auschwitz built the chimneys, built the...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Built their own crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Own crematorium.</span> <span id="s608">And matter of fact, they told us Himmler came a few times around to look how it’s built.</span> <span id="s609">So, I got in and we were...first two days we didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s610">Just...first of all we had to undress, nude.</span> <span id="s611">And go through entlausung...that’s lice...to clean...</span></p> <p><span

suits.</span> <span id="s616">And they gave us barracks, where to stay.</span> <span id="s617">Then came around.</span> <span id="s618">They picked some, I don’t know how many, 20, 30 people to work in the ovens...because these people worked before...were already tired.</span> <span id="s619">They were already dried out and they threw them into the ovens.</span> <span id="s620">So every time another transport...new peoples came in.</span> <span id="s621">So they picked me.</span> <span id="s622">But I was lucky.</span> <span id="s623">I had a friend, what knew me since childhood.</span> <span id="s624">He was there before me, in concentration camp from 1940.</span> <span id="s625">He got there in 1940.</span> <span id="s626">And he got in, through a..</span> <span id="s627">.</span>

officers and everything else.</span> <span id="s630">And he got acquainted with the officers and he got friendly with them.</span> <span id="s631">And I said, “You got to do something.</span> <span id="s632">I got to get out from the ovens.”</span> <span id="s633">So he...I was working there two weeks...and he got arranged with a group going to Buna, not far away from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s634">To Buna, a labors camp, over there so...he got me in that group with my older brother...to go to Buna.</span> <span id="s635">And my younger brother, somehow he didn’t pass the inspection to go there.</span> <span id="s636">He stayed behind.</span> <span id="s637">They didn’t let him go and later on they sent him to coal mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did he survive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: He survived until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s640">Then he was killed.</span> <span id="s641">He couldn’t walk anymore.</span> <span id="s642">That we will come to later...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">So we got separated.</span> <span id="s644">But my older brother went with me.</span> <span id="s645">We got to Buna.</span> <span id="s646">In the beginning we worked on the...one officer used to take us, one or two would take us on the railroad tracks to shovel coal or shovel dirt or something like that.</span> <span id="s647">It was winter,

wasn’t working for the outside, I was inside.</span> <span id="s655">So he invited me to inside and gave me thread and needle and I mended.</span> <span id="s656">And he gave me a bowl of his soup, noodles and everything.</span> <span id="s657">I got fatter, a little bit fatter.</span> <span id="s658">And I asked him, my brother was outside, said, “Could I give a little bit to my brother?”</span> <span id="s659">Said, “Okay, go ahead.</span> <span id="s660">Give it to him.”</span> <span id="s661">I gave it to my brother, a little bit...we got acquainted.</span> <span id="s662">You know, that little soup made the difference from day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Between living and dying.</span> <span id="s664">And then each day you would mend gloves?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: A few days only.</span> <span id="s666">That wasn’t...it didn’t take too long, it wasn’t too long because later on I got a different job as a carpenter...and the commando, carpenter commando and we put up scaffolds for workers to be able to stand to work, to...how you call it, to solder metals together, things like that.</span> <span id="s667">I forgot how

the stockings...heavy noodle soup, that was my savior.</span> <span id="s677">And I had it until almost the end of the...staying in the...until 1945.</span> <span id="s678">But was very hard.</span> <span id="s679">The work was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s680">I had a group of five people.</span> <span id="s681">And I was the head of the group.</span> <span id="s682">And I would never

a mistake because it was close by.</span> <span id="s818">That was December, Christmas.</span> <span id="s819">January 18, they ordered us all to march.</span> <span id="s820">That was a death march.</span> <span id="s821">The snow was snowing.</span> <span id="s822">Two feet of snow, 18 inches on the ground...we had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: And you probably didn’t have

<span id="s827">So you make yourself walk...doesn’t matter how.</span> <span id="s828">You crawled and you walked.</span> <span id="s829">You walked to the railroad station, was named Gliwitz, about 20 kilometers.</span> <span id="s830">The whole night we walked.</span> <span id="s831">And early morning, they ringed around us, full of soldiers, and we waited.</span> <span id="s832">For that they had railroad track...railroad cars.</span> <span id="s833">For their own soldiers they didn’t have cars to move them.</span> <span id="s834">For us they had the cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Hitler was crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Was crazy.</span> <span id="s837">And what’s his name...Eichmann was another crazy.</span> <span id="s838">And they moved us.</span> <span

these cars.</span> <span id="s843">Used to huddle together to keep warm, or we sat down on the dead people.</span> <span id="s844">We were sitting on the dead frozen people.</span> <span id="s845">Sometimes when we passed, we went...it took us eight days to go to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s846">They went in a circle to miss the Russians or the others to be able to get to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s847">We went through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s848">From Poland going south to Czechoslovakia, then going west towards Germany.</span> <span id="s849">Instead to go straight to Germany, you had to circle...it took eight days.</span> <span id="s850">And sometimes you were lucky, the Czechoslovakian people were very nice, used to stay on the bridges from the railroad and and throw the rolls and the bread to the open cars.</span> <span id="s851">You were lucky, you caught the one roll.</span> <span id="s852">You unlucky, you unlucky.</span> <span id="s853">But we still divided between ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Shared one with the other.</span> <span id="s856">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s857">We came to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s858">In Buchenwald was...I forgot her name.</span> <span id="s859">She used to make lampshades.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: From human skin?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: From human skin with tattoos...anybody had...she looked everybody over.</span> <span id="s862">He has no tattoos.</span> <span id="s863">He had tattoos, he was

Auschwitz had the numbers over here.</span> <span id="s867">Other camps had the numbers on the pocket over here with the label.</span> <span id="s868">We had it on the pocket, but on the arm too.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Only Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Only Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s872">That’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Only Auschwitz did.</span> <span id="s874">We came to Buchenwald...at Buchenwald the conditions were dirty, so dirty, so terrible is not to describe.</span> <span id="s875">We were working on carrying stones and we had to climb a steep hill to bring stones from the bottom up the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Was there a point to that, or was that just to give you something to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Just to give something to do, was no point to it at all.</span> <span id="s878">And there was no food, just a little slice of bread.</span> <span id="s879">Food amounted to four ounces of bread in the morning.</span> <span id="s880">In Auschwitz was the same thing.</span> <span id="s881">That’s a quarter of a pound.</span> <span id="s882">A pound bread was sliced in four sections.</span> <span id="s883">And then who was lucky got the biggest, who was not lucky was the smallest section.</span> <span id="s884">We had to look at it how the bread comes out.</span> <span id="s885">And we had a small slice of salami, a very thin slice and a little thin slice of margarine.</span> <span id="s886">At noon, and a cup of coffee, black coffee with worms in everything what’s there what the kettle didn’t wash it off from the night before you had it in the coffee.</span> <span id="s887">But I drink too much coffee.</span> <span id="s888">My brother used to drink too much coffee and his legs swell up.</span> <span id="s889">But he was lucky too, he almost went to Auschwitz...shipped him there, almost.</span> <span id="s890">They were looking for...he was in the clinic with swollen legs.</span> <span id="s891">He couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s892">But he walked.</span> <span id="s893">And, so that was the food.</span> <span id="s894">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s895">And lunch time, was little water with something floating around in it and the same was in the evening, water and floating, something floating...</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: The only real solid food you got was bread at breakfast?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: The bread at breakfast, that’s all.</span> <span id="s898">So after a couple weeks or three weeks, we been in Buchenwald, they shipped us to Ordruff.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: By this time it’s February?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: This is somewhere in February.</span> <span id="s901">In Ordruff, there was a camp and they were working on underground tunnels for airplanes to hide in the mountains.</span> <span id="s902">In case bombardment, the airplanes could hide in big holes.</span> <span id="s903">We used to work there...</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Tremendous holes?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Tremendous holes.</span> <span id="s906">And we used...we had to support it with lumber.</span> <span id="s907">With things.</span> <span id="s908">It was very heavy work.</span> <span id="s909">Sometimes we didn’t walk out there.</span> <span id="s910">After eight days we walked out.</span> <span id="s911">On the eighth day we slept there on the ground.</span> <span id="s912">That was the life.</span> <span id="s913">They had to watch us all the time.</span> <span id="s914">And we had to work there.</span> <span id="s915">So, and one thing, fate...my younger brother was working the coal mines.</span> <span id="s916">He came to Ordruff and we met together in Ordruff.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: It must have been an incredible reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Incredible.</span> <span id="s919">We were crying.</span> <span id="s920">And we were so lucky.</span> <span id="s921">But one day, he didn’t go to work...with his commando.</span> <span id="s922">Because he stayed in another cabin and we stayed in another...barracks they called them.</span> <span id="s923">And he didn’t go to work that day.</span> <span id="s924">They took him to another camp.</span> <span id="s925">We were separated again.</span> <span id="s926">But every morning he came to work the same place we have seen him coming to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: It must be hard to identify people wearing the uniforms, and looking so ill and so dirty and unkempt?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: But we identified.</span> <span id="s929">We knew each other.</span> <span id="s930">And we had to wash.</span> <span id="s931">We washed every day.</span> <span id="s932">Every day in the morning, in evening, because otherwise the lice would eat you up...the lice was terrible.</span> <span id="s933">The lice would eat you us.</span> <span id="s934">And I, till the end (knock wood) I’m telling you, I didn’t...we didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s935">In Ordruff the food was less than we used to have.</span> <span id="s936">But I wanted to tell you about my brother first.</span> <span id="s937">The 29th of March my younger brother slipped us a note.</span> <span id="s938">Just passed by me and my brother.</span> <span id="s939">We were working on the ditches.</span> <span id="s940">And slipped us a note, “We will soon be liberated.</span> <span id="s941">Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s942">We will soon be liberated.”</span> <span id="s943">The unlucky thing was that he wasn’t with us.</span> <span id="s944">He was at another camp.</span> <span id="s945">We couldn’t find him again.</span> <span id="s946">Food was bad so we used to go out and catch frogs.</span> <span id="s947">We had a little stove and a little pot.</span> <span id="s948">We used to cook the frogs.</span> <span id="s949">Clean them up and we used to eat...bitter...as you could describe.</span> <span id="s950">Just to have a little bit something.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Of meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Of meat.</span> <span id="s953">Frogs...where you don’t eat, you eat especially the legs only...</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: You ate everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: We ate everything.</span> <span id="s956">And that was bitter.</span> <span id="s957">And this way we survived.</span> <span id="s958">We ate grass.</span> <span id="s959">We stayed near a little field.</span> <span id="s960">We run to the grass and pick the grass.</span> <span id="s961">We ate the grass.</span> <span id="s962">We knew which is good for you...to sustain you.</span> <span id="s963">Not every grass would sustain you, or poison you.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Or make you sick...diarrhea?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: So, I had not once diarrhea in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: You did not have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: I did have it, not once.</span> <span id="s968">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: More than once?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s971">More than once.</span> <span id="s972">You were running with full pants to the camp from work.</span> <span id="s973">That’s terrible.</span> <span id="s974">The feeling...you’re falling...you’re dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: It’s so degrading?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Degrading.</span> <span id="s977">So April, the 3rd...I’m coming to that now.</span> <span id="s978">April the 3rd, we’re marching again.</span> <span id="s979">That was the real death march.</span> <span id="s980">We got, everyone got one bread and something, I don’t remember...salami or a little margarine.</span> <span id="s981">That one bread was what most important...a whole bread.</span> <span id="s982">Each one who got to go march...that one bread...</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: But you didn’t know how long it has to last you?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: We ate it right away.</span> <span id="s985">And we started march on the road...walking, the road.</span> <span id="s986">See here a car...bombed.</span> <span id="s987">Here a car shut up, burned.</span> <span id="s988">And we see the end is coming.</span> <span id="s989">We are five in a row.</span> <span id="s990">I was in the other end and we come near the woods.</span> <span id="s991">It is getting dark, so I said in Polish”(words missing in original transcription)” I pushed him out from the other end...they are running through the woods and I after them and the S.S. start to shoot but it was dark already and they couldn’t hit anybody and we went, walked through the woods, we run through the woods.</span> <span id="s992">And they had dogs too.</span> <span id="s993">But they wouldn’t go with the dogs through the woods.</span> <span id="s994">They were afraid to go to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Thank God.</span> <span id="s997">So we are five of us then, we find another one and we were hiding in the woods for eight days.</span> <span id="s998">They had, in the woods, they had such bunkers to hide from planes and bombs...so we hid in these bunkers.</span> <span id="s999">We walked back to the place where we worked.</span> <span id="s1000">Through it at night, only at night.</span> <span id="s1001">In the meantime we found, in this place, there was a cabin...a suit, a jacket, a pair of pants and things.</span> <span id="s1002">We changed, we put on.</span> <span id="s1003">We found a pair of scissors.</span> <span id="s1004">We cut through the middle, the hair...to be able...on the sides, they left us hair and in the middle, we didn’t have any hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: So the people wouldn’t know you were prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: So cut the hair even...all even out and they start to grow back again.</span> <span id="s1007">And we couldn’t find any food, so we ate the grass around in the woods.</span> <span id="s1008">We ate whatever we can.</span> <span id="s1009">But we are hungry, we are hungry.</span> <span id="s1010">On April 11th, early in the morning, we crawled out from the woods, we found a cabin, was potatoes and milk and was something else...I don’t remember...was there rice or something.</span> <span id="s1011">I said, “Fellows don’t touch anything.</span> <span id="s1012">You have sore stomachs...let me just cook a few potatoes and eat first the warm potatoes.”</span> <span id="s1013">We made a little chimney...the chimney was there, was a stove and the pots was there...everything.</span> <span id="s1014">So we cook a few potatoes.</span> <span id="s1015">And the S.S. Fernichtungstrupe noticed from the chimney, smoke...so they went to investigate and they caught us there.</span> <span id="s1016">But we were already in civilian dresses...in suits...civilian dress.</span> <span id="s1017">And two of our guys, we were six...two of our guys went to investigate somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1018">And they were pretty far away.</span> <span id="s1019">They caught us and the other guys were walking with the road towards us and the S.S. men noticed them, they called out...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">TAPE TWO Tape two does not continue the sentence, but does continue in context.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: But, I said...everybody didn’t speak German...none of the guys didn’t speak German...I said, “I will speak German---with a broken German.”</span> <span id="s1022">I spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s1023">And, I will tell them, “We were workers.</span> <span id="s1024">People did...people left us, and they told us we should wait here.</span> <span id="s1025">They will come back, and we are going to work again.”</span> <span id="s1026">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1027">They believed us.</span> <span id="s1028">But, they didn’t leave us there.</span> <span id="s1029">They took the milk.</span> <span id="s1030">They took the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1031">They took everything with them up the hill.</span> <span id="s1032">Up a hill, there, was the village.</span> <span id="s1033">We didn’t go to the village.</span> <span id="s1034">We went all around, but not to the village.</span> <span id="s1035">So, we went to the village...they took us up to the village...in the same time, they caught another S.S. man, S.S. Fanichtungstruben...that is Liquidation Troop...caught a Russian guy in the striped suit, and they brought him up to the village.</span> <span id="s1036">Right away, they shot him.</span> <span id="s1037">We had to bury him.</span> <span id="s1038">They say, “Now, it is our finish.</span> <span id="s1039">We are finished.”</span> <span id="s1040">But, they let us sit.</span> <span id="s1041">It was a village.</span> <span id="s1042">In the middle of the village was a bar.</span> <span id="s1043">We used to...bierhaus, they call it in German...a bar...a big...a big hall.</span> <span id="s1044">That’s a hall...like in...they used to...meetings there and things like that.</span> <span id="s1045">And, was it...the sun was shining...southern side, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1046">We were sitting...there was a bench—a long bench on that wall and we were sitting.</span> <span id="s1047">That was from somewhere nine o’clock in the morning and we sit...ten and eleven...and thank God, they don’t do nothing to us.</span> <span id="s1048">Twelve.</span> <span id="s1049">Twelve-thirty.</span> <span id="s1050">All of a sudden we see a jeep coming up with American officer, with a priest—a German priest—dolmetscher—and they should give up the village.</span> <span id="s1051">Otherwise, the village will be leveled.</span> <span id="s1052">So, what they do, they...a few S.S. men—they were young fellows.</span> <span id="s1053">I don’t know if they were nineteen or twenty years old.</span> <span id="s1054">They were young fellows.</span> <span id="s1055">The few S.S. men took that jeep and the American and the priest and they run away with them, with the jeep.</span> <span id="s1056">We have seen they are running away.</span> <span id="s1057">We were still sitting.</span> <span id="s1058">And, all of a sudden, I said, “Why don’t we go across the street and see what is there in the house.</span> <span id="s1059">What’s there.”</span> <span id="s1060">I don’t know, like something pulled me.</span> <span id="s1061">I can’t describe it.</span> <span id="s1062">We should get away from that spot where we were sitting.</span> <span id="s1063">A power...I don’t know what the power was.</span> <span id="s1064">And, we walked in near a door that is about...what...about twenty or thirty yards from us was that wall where we were sitting.</span> <span id="s1065">Cannonball went straight on that spot where we were sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: That’s incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: That cannonball smashed the whole wall and we ran in the house.</span> <span id="s1068">We opened up already the door and we ran in the house and we hid, because we weren’t sure that somewhere...I don’t know...was chickens, or were inside there in a little room...or garbage...I don’t know where we hid there, but it didn’t fall.</span> <span id="s1069">Another cannonball didn’t fall.</span> <span id="s1070">And, we fell asleep there.</span> <span id="s1071">All of a sudden, at night, we hear walking, walking soldiers.</span> <span id="s1072">Some American, Americans are here, and then we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1073">Forty-four years ago before yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Thank God you survived.</span> <span id="s1075">What was...did you celebrate?</span> <span id="s1076">Was there...did you have...what did you do to celebrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: We were numb.</span> <span id="s1078">We looked...I had family in Detroit, so we found a guy from Detroit, knew my family in Detroit.</span> <span id="s1079">As a matter of fact, he worked for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Did you speak English also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No.</span> <span id="s1082">No, he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1083">A Polish guy.</span> <span id="s1084">From Hamtramek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: I know where it is, yes.</span> <span id="s1086">There is a whole Polish community .</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: A whole Polish community.</span> <span id="s1088">A Polish guy.</span> <span id="s1089">Because my uncles had, in Hamtramek, stores, and they used to do business.</span> <span id="s1090">So, they knew...he wrote right away to Detroit to get in touch with us.</span> <span id="s1091">And, they got in touch with us, through Joint Jewish Committee Distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Joint Distribution Committee or somewhere, they got in touch with us, after we settled in a city in Mossbruck, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1094">Mossbruck, yah.</span> <span id="s1095">That’s near Munich.</span> <span id="s1096">Because, why Mossbruck?</span> <span id="s1097">In Mossbruck was a camp there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: How did you get from where you were to that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Oh, just a

uniform.</span> <span id="s1110">They were like police, investigating the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1111">The German officers, soldiers, and everything.</span> <span id="s1112">They had a big camp.</span> <span id="s1113">They gave up.</span> <span id="s1114">And that camp...no, that was in Mossbruck, already.</span> <span id="s1115">In that camp was a lot of people what...they were

id="s1279">And he is top fencer for his age in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1281">Did you move here to Sarasota after you retired, or did you work here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: No, I was robbed many times and I have a bullet in my knee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q; You were robbed many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1285">In New York.</span> <span id="s1286">We had an antique store, too.</span> <span id="s1287">Antique store.</span> <span id="s1288">interior decorating and antiques.</span> <span id="s1289">And, whatever you see, that’s all my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: New York is not a good place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: So, I said, that’s enough.</span> <span id="s1292">And, we used to come here to Warm Mineral Springs, because I used to...my spine...my back was hurting me, and no doctor could help me.</span> <span id="s1293">No chiropractor, nothing.</span> <span id="s1294">I used to go to Europe to mud baths, and things.</span> <span id="s1295">They couldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s1296">So, I went here to Warm Mineral Springs in Sarasota--in Venice, and that helped me.</span> <span id="s1297">So, we used to go to shul.</span> <span id="s1298">Every Friday, I used to load up my car and go to the Temple over here.</span> <span id="s1299">At that time was Konovitch the Rabbi and I liked it.</span> <span id="s1300">The community was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Temple Beth Sholom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Temple Beth Sholom, yeah.</span> <span id="s1303">And, I liked it, and we decided--we had been out to L.A. too, because my daughter moved to L.A., the same--almost the same time--a year earlier.</span> <span id="s1304">So, we decided on Sarasota, and Warm Mineral Springs helped my spine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: So, it was logical to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: It was logical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Do you still go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: I still go there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: What is your

late...in the forties...late forties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: So, I am glad that you...you wanted to add something that I think is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Please go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: We were invited from Germany to come to the trial to Buchen, and we came.</span> <span id="s1321">The trial was going on already months, and there were other fellows from the same city.</span> <span id="s1322">Not from our city, from the second city, where Haman used to use them as guinea pigs and they used to homosexually assault them.</span> <span id="s1323">But, I was a witness, and he was sitting, he and others.</span> <span id="s1324">He gave out another fourteen of his helpers.</span> <span id="s1325">You see, how he found...they found him.</span> <span id="s1326">When he was killing...that day when he killed my late father...he went to the other city, to Nowy Sacz, where it is written there.</span> <span id="s1327">He went and he walked from one house to the other, killing people, with his staff.</span> <span id="s1328">And, between his staff, was his brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1329">And, the brother-in-law said, “I don’t want any more killings, and I don’t want to go killing any more.”</span> <span id="s1330">He said, “You side with the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1331">He said, “I don’t side with the Jews, but I don’t want any more killings.”</span> <span id="s1332">So, he pulled out his gun and he killed him.</span> <span id="s1333">Shot him.</span> <span id="s1334">So, from that brother-in-law he had two nephews, and the nephews knew...he had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1335">You know, Jewish money.</span> <span id="s1336">So, the nephews didn’t have so much, because they killed the father, and they didn’t have what to live so much, so they came to him, he should help them out with something that they should be able to live.</span> <span id="s1337">So, he refused.</span> <span id="s1338">So, the nephews went to the authorities, and told them, “That is Haman, and that is him over there.”</span> <span id="s1339">He was working as a mailman in a small town.</span> <span id="s1340">Nobody knew what he was or what.</span> <span id="s1341">He worked.</span> <span id="s1342">So, they caught him.</span> <span id="s1343">They put him in jail.</span> <span id="s1344">Maybe, three or four times, he tried to knock his brains out against the wall, like he used to take the children by the head...by the feet and knock against the tree.</span> <span id="s1345">So, he wanted to knock his brains out, too.</span> <span id="s1346">But he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1347">In the end, they covered with blankets the walls, he shouldn’t be able to kill himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: They padded the cell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: They padded the walls.</span> <span id="s1350">So, when I came to the trial...after the trial, he said he only killed Communists.</span> <span id="s1351">So, after that trial, he got life imprisonment, and the others got three years, five years, six years, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: They didn’t kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: No.</span> <span id="s1354">They did not kill him.</span> <span id="s1355">He got life in prison.</span> <span id="s1356">So, he got life imprisonment.</span> <span id="s1357">He killed himself.</span> <span id="s1358">They helped him to kill himself.</span> <span id="s1359">I presume they helped him, because otherwise how could he kill himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: He hanged...</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: He tried to hang himself.</span> <span id="s1362">He tried everything.</span> <span id="s1363">He couldn’t...at that time, before the trial finished, he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1364">After he got the judgement, so he killed himself.</span> <span id="s1365">I don’t know how he killed himself, but he did... we got notice from the government that Haman doesn’t live any more.</span> <span id="s1366">He is...he killed himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: I am sure you were not unhappy to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: No, but he tried many times to kill himself.</span> <span id="s1369">So that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: You testified at the trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I testified at the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Thank you very much...</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: So many things...you know, you go over later...you remind yourself—you missed this, you missed that.</span> <span id="s1374">My story is not just for two hours or for three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: No, it was for years and years...</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: No, just to tell it, has to take days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: And, you can’t tell it everything like you would like to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Mr. Brodman, I think you have done an admirable job of telling your story very well in a brief period of time, and I want to thank you very much for your contribution to the National Council of Jewish Women’s Holocaust Project.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
