Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: I’m interviewing Fred Baron on January 13, 1983 for the Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas’ Holocaust Oral history Project.</span> <span id="s5">We’re taping this interview in Mr. Baron’s home in Golden Valley, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s6">I know that I can dispense with the formality and just address you as “Fred.”</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: That sounds much better.</span> <span id="s8">Thank you .</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: We’re going to discuss your Holocaust experience as a survivor and I thought maybe we could start by your telling us where you were born, what country and the name of the town, and a little something about your immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born in Vienna, Austria, and when the Germans marched into my home town, I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s11">My immediate family consisted of my parents and a younger sister, and grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins and so-forth.</span> <span id="s12">We were, I would say, a middle-class home.</span> <span id="s13">My parents had a store in Vienna and I was going to a realschule, which is the equivalent of a technically-oriented high school here.</span> <span id="s14">I was promptly kicked out of school and that really ended my formal education at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: What were the names of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father’s name was Edward, my mother’s name Helen, and my sister’s name is Gertrude.</span> <span id="s17">She by the way, is the only one who is alive today besides myself.</span> <span id="s18">She survived the war in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What was it like growing up in Vienna before the Nazis came, as far as your being Jewish goes?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Well, I must admit that my family was not particularly Jewish-oriented, although we did, of course, attend synagogues in the case of the High Holidays and other occasions.</span> <span id="s21">And by going to school, it was mandatory to attend synagogues.</span> <span id="s22">Once a week, we also had Jewish and Hebrew education in public school.</span> <span id="s23">You see, Austria was a Catholic country, there was no division between church and state and we had religious education, the same as Catholics and Protestants had.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: In other words, they would provide a Jewish religious training in public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And that was where you received your Jewish religious training.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s28">This, by the way, was part of the tremendous resentment that started to grow up in Austria – this setting aside certain religious minorities from the rest of the students at certain times during school.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: So did you, as a young boy, feel any of this anti-Semitism in any kind of way?</span> <span id="s30">Was it subtle?</span> <span id="s31">Was it overt at times?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: It was both subtle and overt.</span> <span id="s33">I remember I went to school, and one of my first days, I had a tremendous fight with another student.</span> <span id="s34">We were thrashing at each other, and the others were looking at it, and it ended in a draw, and we became the best of friends, very close friends.</span> <span id="s35">He was an outspoken Austrian nationalist, and anti-Semitic, and yet we personally became very close – until the time that Hitler marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: How did you maintain a friendship and reconcile that difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A; I guess every Nazi has to have one Jew that is different, and that he can truly say, “Some of my best friends are Jews.’</span> <span id="s38">Maybe this is where the saying originated.</span> <span id="s39">I don’t know about his feelings, but we were close together, and we felt very comfortable with each other – until the political situation became such that his parents or somebody put their foot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Growing up.</span> <span id="s41">Did it matter to you whether your friends were Jewish or gentile?</span> <span id="s42">Were most of your friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Most of my friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s44">To be honest with you, I was more comfortable with Jews.</span> <span id="s45">Although we were thoroughly assimilated, I must say, in the case of all the kids in that science school, they were born in Austria and spoke German and felt and looked just like anybody else, but there was something that made us stick close together and be closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Now most Austrian Jews did not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s47">The Austrians spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: German, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And that was really the only language that was spoken in your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You said your parents were not really religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My father was really an agnostic.</span> <span id="s53">My mother came from a more orthodox family, but she was not observant any more.</span> <span id="s54">I don’t really recall whether we were formal members of a synagogue or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What kind of an extended family did you have?</span> <span id="s56">Were they mostly in Austria?</span> <span id="s57">In the Vienna area?</span> <span id="s58">Or did you have relatives in other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Most of my relatives lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s60">One uncle lived in a suburb outside of Vienna, and a few cousins lived in Czechoslovakia, and one in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: I’ve never been to Vienna but Vienna is a world famous city of culture.</span> <span id="s62">A beautiful city.</span> <span id="s63">Did you enjoy growing up in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">I believe I had a good youth, and I enjoyed my life there.</span> <span id="s66">I really enjoyed all the cultural and educational things that a city like Vienna had to offer.</span> <span id="s67">I went to concerts.</span> <span id="s68">I went to opera.</span> <span id="s69">And my parents sent us to camps in summertime and we, again, were treated to some of the things that Austrians were famous for.</span> <span id="s70">I think that I had a wonderful youth up to that point.</span> <span id="s71">And Vienna – I hope you will get a chance to see it once – it is still a very beautiful city.</span> <span id="s72">I was back there a few years ago, and it felt just as if I had just left it a few months prior to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: When did you or your family first start to become aware – or concerned – about the rise of Nazism in Germany?</span> <span id="s74">Did you see that?</span> <span id="s75">Did your family see that?</span> <span id="s76">Did you perceive that, as a young boy, as a threat?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I think it began, probably, in the middle ‘30s.</span> <span id="s78">My parents, of course, were much more aware of that than I, myself, and my sister, although I must say that the youth was much more politically aware at that early stage.</span> <span id="s79">They were much more cognizant of political things happening in Austria and in surrounding countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s80">Europe was a powder keg from centuries back.</span> <span id="s81">Even small children were aware that life is not always peaceful.</span> <span id="s82">The first thing we learned in school was the military history, the wars, and the rebellions and the constant occupations.</span> <span id="s83">And the government itself was not stable.</span> <span id="s84">There were rebellions.</span> <span id="s85">There was a socialist uprising, then there was a nationalist, a Nazi uprising soon after.</span> <span id="s86">And people – politicians – got killed.</span> <span id="s87">There was a tremendous amount of political journals and newspapers that represented every shade of political affiliation and extremism.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was it possible for Austrian Jews to become involved in Austrian politics, or was that basically inadvisable considering the anti-Semitism that was always a part of Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">I don’t know how “advisable” it was, but many Jews were active in politics in Austria, usually Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s91">My father considered himself a Social Democrat as well, and whatever little affiliation we had, we had with that particular party.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What does Social Democrat mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: In Austria, of course, it was the Sozial Demokrat.</span> <span id="s94">It was a kind of Bund-system that was socially oriented towards the more liberal trend, similar to here, what some left wing parts of the Democratic party seem to stand for.</span> <span id="s95">And yet, at the same time, it was thoroughly a party of democracy.</span> <span id="s96">It was against any kind of authoritarian influence.</span> <span id="s97">It was against the emperors and the fuehrers, and it was clashing constantly with the rising national tide.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: That rising national tide – do you think it gained a lot of strength from what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s99">Or did the two just kind of come about together?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, of course, Austrians and Germans were of the same basic stock, basic language, and for practical reasons, it was one country.</span> <span id="s101">Politically, it was separated, and my father often said, “It would be best for both countries if they would be united.’</span> <span id="s102">However the nationalists used this as part of their propaganda to try to achieve their first enlargement of German nationalism.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: So when did your family start to feel threatened?</span> <span id="s104">Where did you hear about the Nuremberg Laws?</span> <span id="s105">where did you hear about Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s106">Did you hear about those things when they occurred?</span> <span id="s107">Was that information available, when it happened, to you in Austria at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well the Germans marched into Austria in March, 1938.</span> <span id="s109">Kristallnacht as it is called, was November 10, 1938, well after the Germans marched into Austria, and it was experienced in Austria at least as much as in Germany proper.</span> <span id="s110">As a matter of fact, I was at the age of 15 on November 10, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What happened that night to you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I was hauled out.</span> <span id="s113">We lived in an apartment building, and I went downstairs to see whether it was safe to go out or look for a relative.</span> <span id="s114">I don’t know what reason brought me downstairs, into the building.</span> <span id="s115">And a lieutenant saw me and caught me, and took me to one of these make-shift jails.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: It was essentially a neighbor in your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Right.</span> <span id="s118">I had never seen him before, and I don’t think he had seen me before.</span> <span id="s119">I believe we had, already, yellow badges at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Once the Germans marched into Austria, all of the restrictions placed on Jews, viv-a-vis the Nuremberg Laws, were placed on the Austrians as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes, within a very, very short time, and much harsher, because what evolved in Germany over a period of five years, since 1933, happened within a matter of weeks in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So you were taken to a make-shift jail that evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: My mother came (laughs) and waved some kind of Hungarian document into the face of the SA.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What was the SA?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: A German paramilitary organization that brought Hitler to power – in Germany – and, of course, were emulated in Austria itself.</span> <span id="s128">The two major names were SA, Sturmbatalion, and SS, which was a different organization, subdivided into many different divisions.</span> <span id="s129">My mother managed to free me.</span> <span id="s130">After a few hours I was released and that was the end.</span> <span id="s131">One thousand people, from what I understand, were sent to Dachau and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s132">These were the two major concentration camps existing at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: From that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: From that one night.</span> <span id="s135">Of course thousands were sent in there before and kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And your father had a store?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: A store.</span> <span id="s138">It was closed down right after the Germans marched in.</span> <span id="s139">We lost our livelihood and pretty soon I was forced to go to a soup kitchen and bring home the only meal.</span> <span id="s140">Pretty soon we lost everything we had.</span> <span id="s141">Of course, bank accounts were closed.</span> <span id="s142">People lost their jobs.</span> <span id="s143">Jews were not allowed to practice as professionals.</span> <span id="s144">We were penniless.</span> <span id="s145">After losing everything else we had, we were forced to take in other Jewish tenants, share our apartment with others.</span> <span id="s146">We were just limited to one room.</span> <span id="s147">And my father saw his family going really down the drain.</span> <span id="s148">He became very sick.</span> <span id="s149">He had some health problems before, and his doctor emigrated.</span> <span id="s150">And he became very sick.</span> <span id="s151">He didn’t get any treatment and soon died.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: There was no treatment available to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: There was not only no treatment, there were no practitioners, because the Jewish physicians were not allowed to practice, and non-Jewish physicians were not allowed to treat a Jew.</span> <span id="s154">So he was sent to the only one Jewish hospital where you could get treatment at.</span> <span id="s155">It was just impossible to get through.</span> <span id="s156">For practical purposes, there was no medical treatment available to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: When did your father die, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: He died in 1939, which was after my sister was fortunate enough to leave the country with a children’s transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How was it decided that your sister was going to leave?</span> <span id="s160">Was it a decision by the family, or your sister?</span> <span id="s161">What were the circumstances of her leaving?</span> <span id="s162">How was it that she left and you didn’t and your mother didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: My father had friends in England, and they were all trying to help us get out, but it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s164">England, just like America or any other country, made tremendous difficulties for Jews to emigrate.</span> <span id="s165">The only exception they made was for a few Jewish children.</span> <span id="s166">And these friends of my father’s made it possible for my sister to join one of the children’s transports.</span> <span id="s167">She left just a short time before the war broke out in Europe in 1939 to go to England.</span> <span id="s168">She was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s169">And of course my parents felt very sad about sending her away to a strange country.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Who took care of her in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: She came to a school, to a family of a school superintendent in a small town, and knew in that first year people that my father knew, and in whose home he once stayed.</span> <span id="s172">My father used to travel quite extensively in Europe before.</span> <span id="s173">She spent the war years in England, working in the country, and apparently quite under difficult circumstances as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So she went to England in 1939.</span> <span id="s175">What happened after 1939 to you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: In 1939, September 1st, the war broke out in Poland and after a few weeks – it didn’t last long – they started to send Jews to Poland.</span> <span id="s177">There were no camps set up yet, but they took the Jewish population of many cities and sent them in small areas – restricted areas -- ghettos.</span> <span id="s178">And then they took Jewish people from Austria and Germany and brought them with very little possessions, took them on trains, and dumped them in the middle of these ghettos.</span> <span id="s179">And many of our friends were taken this way.</span> <span id="s180">It was the forerunner of the real concentration camps – extermination camps – that followed, but it was certainly an extreme measure, and people tried to escape that by all means.</span> <span id="s181">We were trying to hide, by hiding one night here and one night there with non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: In Vienna, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Was it you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Me and my mother, yes.</span> <span id="s186">And it made it very difficult for the people that were hiding us, too, because there were very strict measures, so anybody hiding a Jew was subject to I don’t know what, terrible measures the Germans concocted.</span> <span id="s187">So to ask even a close friend to hide you for a night or two was not an easy thing to do.</span> <span id="s188">And not for the gentile people, either.</span> <span id="s189">We couldn’t do this very long.</span> <span id="s190">We realized that.</span> <span id="s191">It was a nerve-wracking experience.</span> <span id="s192">Then, we tried to hide in Jewish apartments where the people were already deported, and slept one night here and one night there.</span> <span id="s193">For a while, I was legalized again, because I went to work at Hermann Dvillenberg, one of the railroad stations in Vienna.</span> <span id="s194">I worked carrying pig-iron on my shoulders, and as such, was given a certain amount of security for myself and my mother so we could stay for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you have to wear the yellow Star of David on your coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Even while you were working?</span> <span id="s198">All the time you had to wear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s200">We could not go to any public building, or to any parks.</span> <span id="s201">We could not go to a library or movie.</span> <span id="s202">We were not allowed to ride on public transportation except under certain conditions, and then only on the rear platform.</span> <span id="s203">And we could not go into a store, except one hour a day.</span> <span id="s204">We were not allowed to, if you would have had money, to buy many things, because they were just not sold to Jews.</span> <span id="s205">Even food items were restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Fred, did you feel, during this time, that the Nazis basically took over, and the Austrians became partners with the Germans?</span> <span id="s207">Did you feel that the everyday person, the common person, believed the Nazi propaganda about the Jews?</span> <span id="s208">Do you think that there was this peer-pressure to accept it or go along with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Unfortunately, Austria – particularly Vienna – had a history of long, deep-seated anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s210">And it did not take long, and didn’t take much, for German propaganda to take effect in Austria.</span> <span id="s211">I believe that the Austrians, who always had sort of a minority complex in general, tried to out-do the Germans in anything they could – especially within the area of relationships with Jews.</span> <span id="s212">And the proof of that is that in my subsequent stay in concentration camps, whenever we saw Austrian guards – we heard it from their slight dialect – nine out of ten were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s213">I don’t want to go into sociological reasons for that, but this was still unfortunately a fact.</span> <span id="s214">And German propaganda was extremely skilled and effective.</span> <span id="s215">It was beyond and above everything that had ever been done, to my knowledge, in Austria – and in Europe.</span> <span id="s216">And as history showed, it was effective wherever it was used.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So for a time you were going from place to place looking for shelter and a place to stay.</span> <span id="s218">And then you had some security, working for a while.</span> <span id="s219">How long did that last, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: It lasted until the Fall of 1941.</span> <span id="s221">Quite a while, as you can see.</span> <span id="s222">The German extermination policy really got running.</span> <span id="s223">The transports to the east were ever-increasing, and on a much more brutal scale, and it was much more difficult to escape.</span> <span id="s224">Our job security was gone.</span> <span id="s225">And needless to say, I’ve never mentioned this, but my mother and I – and before he died – my father – we tried to leave the country, go to any place possible, but without any success.</span> <span id="s226">And in wartime, it is very difficult to travel in the country.</span> <span id="s227">Any Jew traveling in a country was tantamount to being shot or taken to a transport to the east right away, although at that time we didn’t know what that entailed.</span> <span id="s228">So, my mother and I figured that there was only one country that we could possibly reach, and it was Hungary.</span> <span id="s229">It was still, at that time, fairly independent.</span> <span id="s230">Although dominated by German policies and within the realm of Hitler’s policies, it afforded some measure of security.</span> <span id="s231">So we went over the border at night, and found at least a temporary refuge there.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What did you do in Hungary?</span> <span id="s233">How did you get by?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It so happened that I was trying to get a legal documentation so that we would get food stamps, and traveled with a girl, a relative of my mother’s, to a little town in the country where, supposedly, somebody with connections was able to give us the necessary papers so that we could obtain food and things.</span> <span id="s235">And it just so happened that there was some crime committed in the little town and as soon as they saw a stranger, they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s236">So I ended up in jail in a little town together with some gypsies and petty thieves, for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s237">(Laughs) After being there for a while, I was taken before a Hungarian judge who spoke to me very nicely and then told me that I was put in jail because I was suspected of being connected with some kind of crime committed.</span> <span id="s238">But of course, if it turned out that I was innocent, nothing would happen to me.</span> <span id="s239">All they would do is to send me back to Austria.</span> <span id="s240">So when I heard that, I didn’t feel so good.</span> <span id="s241">I tried to explain to the judge what that meant for me, that I just left Austria and went to Hungary because I wanted to save my life, and being sent back there was just like a death sentence.</span> <span id="s242">I had some papers with me that depicted my father as an officer in the Austria-Hungarian Army.</span> <span id="s243">I tried to explain to the good judge that he lost his life in Vienna now, and was a volunteer in the First World War, and to send me back to death, to Austria, would just be a terrible crime.</span> <span id="s244">He didn’t do any commitment himself, but he sent me back to jail.</span> <span id="s245">After a couple of weeks, I was called to the office, and somehow given papers that I was dismissed from jail, and with that I could go to the police station and get my regular food tickets and whatever, and I was a legal resident of Hungary.</span> <span id="s246">That lasted a couple of months.</span> <span id="s247">But then somehow they got hold of my mother and put her in a camp in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You say “they”.</span> <span id="s249">Who was “they?”</span> <span id="s250">Who put your mother in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Hungarian police, because we both, of course, entered the country without papers and without any legal documents, passport and what-not, and were illegal residents.</span> <span id="s252">So the Hungarian authorities put her in jail, and told her they would deport her unless I would also appear on the scene.</span> <span id="s253">And that forced me to join her.</span> <span id="s254">And I was incarcerated from that time on, from December, 1941, until 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So actually you went back to jail again.</span> <span id="s256">Into that Hungarian jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: It was not really a jail.</span> <span id="s258">First we were in a jail-type surrounding.</span> <span id="s259">Then we were sent to an internment camp in the northeastern part of Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Now was this still by the Hungarian authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes, that was run by Hungarian authorities, and it was, of course, much more humane than the camps that we encountered later on.</span> <span id="s262">As I said, Hungary was a semi-independent country.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: There was a point, though, that you were separated from your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">As a matter of fact, I was separated right in the camp.</span> <span id="s266">For a while we stayed in a family camp where there were separate buildings for men and women, and I saw my mother from time to time.</span> <span id="s267">But later all the male Jews were sent to a penal camp near the Slovakian border.</span> <span id="s268">And my mother was released to some relatives, just before a very anti-Semitic regime took over in Hungary.</span> <span id="s269">And this regime, forced upon the Hungarians by the Germans, asked for German protection, and brought in German SS and completed the occupation by German forces.</span> <span id="s270">My mother, again, was put in a camp.</span> <span id="s271">It was just a matter of a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Spring, 1944, which was a time that was extremely crucial for Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And so was this the point in time when, really, the Hungarian Jews were put into the hands of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Right.</span> <span id="s276">The German SS took over the various camps, and right away started to transport the Jews to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Is that what happened to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Maybe you can tell us a little bit about what you remember about where you were, when you were deported by the Nazis to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s280">And where your mother was.</span> <span id="s281">The circumstances of your deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s283">My mother, as I said, was at that time, just freed and lived with some relatives in Hungary.</span> <span id="s284">I was very happy of course, that she was freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And you were allowed to have, I take it, some contact with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: We received a few letters, once in a while.</span> <span id="s287">I remember I received even a package containing some necessary clothing, even a cake.</span> <span id="s288">And that really was the last and only thing that I received from my mother, or heard from her.</span> <span id="s289">Things became increasingly difficult.</span> <span id="s290">The German SS – German guards – took over the camps, and we were subjected to some very cruel treatment.</span> <span id="s291">Conditions were similar to what we encountered later on in German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s292">We were constantly in front of machine guns, and one day we were marched to a small railroad station, maybe eight or ten hours away, and arrived there all worn out, and saw on the railroad station, a long fright train assembled.</span> <span id="s293">We also saw the local population – the local Jewish ghettos or Jewish communities – assembled, women, men, and children.</span> <span id="s294">And we were forced, together with them, forced into these railroad cars, 100 to 120, maybe 130 in one car, like sardines, without any food or, more importantly, without any water.</span> <span id="s295">And these cars were sealed, and without any sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s296">We stood there for maybe half-a-day before even moving.</span> <span id="s297">And then finally began a slow trip to nowhere, because nobody told us where we were going.</span> <span id="s298">We were living just in a hell on wheels.</span> <span id="s299">And there were children in our car, and old people.</span> <span id="s300">And people died, got sick, and some went insane.</span> <span id="s301">It was just an absolute, indescribable hell.</span> <span id="s302">I really don’t know, anymore, as to how many days and nights we were in that living hell.</span> <span id="s303">But when finally the train stopped, they tore open the railroad cars, and we were blinded by light, because our eyes were just not used to light any more.</span> <span id="s304">And we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s305">We stood there just like cramped sardines, and we saw funny-looking characters with striped pajamas-like uniforms, with gray and while stripes and matching caps – with great big sticks in their hands, and they were screaming and yelling in all languages.</span> <span id="s306">We didn’t really know what they wanted us to do, but they wanted us to jump out of the cars.</span> <span id="s307">So those that were still able to, jumped out, got off the platform.</span> <span id="s308">We saw that we were in the middle of a huge railroad station.</span> <span id="s309">There were similar cargos and similar trains arriving at other points too.</span> <span id="s310">I looked around and I saw that all around us are nothing but barracks and barbed wire and machine gun towers and in the distance I saw what looked like a huge factory with black smoke coming out of chimneys.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Smoke stacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Smoke stacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s314">When in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: That was in June.</span> <span id="s316">It was a beautiful day.</span> <span id="s317">There was sunshine.</span> <span id="s318">It was just a lovely day, I remember, because we were marched later on through a meadow that was filled with yellow flowers, and I heard birds singing.</span> <span id="s319">And one of the fellows next to me just turned and walked straight into the yellow, into the meadow.</span> <span id="s320">And the guards that went with us, the guards with guns, they cried out to him, “Stop!”</span> <span id="s321">But he either didn’t hear or he didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s322">He just kept slowly marching into the meadow.</span> <span id="s323">And then one of the guards, he must have gone to one of the machine gun towers, and they opened up the machine guns and the man fell down dead.</span> <span id="s324">Then an SS guard pointed to two fellows.</span> <span id="s325">They had to go out and drag him back and put him back in column.</span> <span id="s326">And that, I didn’t know at that time, was my reception to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: You didn’t know where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s329">Even Auschwitz wouldn’t have meant anything to me.</span> <span id="s330">I’d never heard of the name before in my life, and nobody else did there.</span> <span id="s331">It was such a well kept secret – at least from the area.</span> <span id="s332">You must not forget that I was in jail all this time.</span> <span id="s333">I was not really reading the latest news and all we heard is some rumors from people that came into our camp, who were admitted, but we were cut off from the society.</span> <span id="s334">And from what I understand, even the civil population, Jewish, had practically no knowledge of the events taking place in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Do you remember what else happened to you that first day there?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Well I had my first selection.</span> <span id="s337">We were first separated, men and women, and asked to form roes of fives.</span> <span id="s338">And then we were slowly marched in one direction.</span> <span id="s339">And that’s the first time I noticed that peculiar smell in the air, and also a fine dust, or something, subduing the light.</span> <span id="s340">The sunshine was not as bright.</span> <span id="s341">There was something in the air.</span> <span id="s342">And also a weird smell, which I couldn’t explain.</span> <span id="s343">Anyway, we were marched in one direction, and all of a sudden I found myself in front of a very elegantly dressed German officer.</span> <span id="s344">He was wearing boots and white gloves, and he carried a riding whip in his hands.</span> <span id="s345">And with the whip he was pointing either left or right, left or right, as each prisoner – that’s what we were – was marched in front of him.</span> <span id="s346">And whichever direction he pointed, the guards pushed that person either left or right.</span> <span id="s347">And then we again had to form rows of five.</span> <span id="s348">And eventually they were marched into another part of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Do you remember which direction you were told to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I do not remember whether it was left or right, no.</span> <span id="s351">I remember that I was with all the stronger people, and the younger and the older ones were sent to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: How old were you that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I was 21 years old.</span> <span id="s354">And probably in pretty good shape, compared to some of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And then you said you were put back into rows, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Then we were marched into another part of the camp and taken to a barracks where we had to undress and throw away all belongings except our shoes and a belt, I remember.</span> <span id="s357">And we were chased through a cold shower.</span> <span id="s358">By that time it must have been around midnight and we stood shivering in the night air there until we were dry and formed lines in rows of five.</span> <span id="s359">And then we were marched to another barracks and then we were handed some of these prisoner uniforms, a jacket, pants and a sort of a beanie.</span> <span id="s360">And I think every second or third person got, also, a metal canister, or a dish.</span> <span id="s361">A spoon we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s362">And that was the extent of my possessions.</span> <span id="s363">We didn’t really know what happened yet.</span> <span id="s364">We were absolutely numb.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: And that was your first day.</span> <span id="s366">Eventually you began to know what this place really was.</span> <span id="s367">How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: We of course met a lot of prisoners who had been there, some of them, for months, and we talked to them.</span> <span id="s369">And we found out what happened to the people who were sent in the other direction.</span> <span id="s370">They went straight to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s371">I found out what the great black smoke was that was coming out from the chimneys.</span> <span id="s372">I talked to people who had lived there for months, some of them years.</span> <span id="s373">And I also met some people who refused to believe.</span> <span id="s374">I mean, they would walk by the pits where they were burning people.</span> <span id="s375">There was such a tremendous number of transports coming in, and the gas chambers could not keep up with the number of Jews arriving, so they were burning them outside in huge pits.</span> <span id="s376">And some of the smaller children were thrown in there alive.</span> <span id="s377">And they could hear the screams – day and night.</span> <span id="s378">And I talked to people who lived there for months, and they would not believe what was going on a hundred, 200, 500 feet away from them.</span> <span id="s379">The human mind can just take that much and then it just loses all capacity to function, closes up and refuses to accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What did they have you do there?</span> <span id="s381">Do you think you were obviously saved at that point in time because you were young and you were strong and you were capable of doing some work?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, we knew that we were selected for work in one of their slave camps.</span> <span id="s383">That much we found out.</span> <span id="s384">But there were, of course, many, many satellite camps in Auschwitz proper.</span> <span id="s385">Many people went to work in the main camp in Auschwitz, too.</span> <span id="s386">The best thing, from what I could gather, was to get into one of the transports and leave the area as far away as possible, to try and go to some of the other slave labor camps, which is what happened to me.</span> <span id="s387">After a couple weeks, I was sent to Silesia – Little Silesia, a small town called Duerndhow, belonging to the administrative entity of the Grossrosen concentration camps.</span> <span id="s388">There was a small town textile factory.</span> <span id="s389">It was closed up, and the machinery was dumped into the yard.</span> <span id="s390">The Germans built great big bunks in all the factory buildings and made room for 1,000 prisoners to be housed there.</span> <span id="s391">And the area was encircled with barbed wire, and machine gun towers were built around, and presto, one concentration camp for a thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What did they make you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I was working in street building.</span> <span id="s394">We were building roads, winding roads, in preparation for German fortifications.</span> <span id="s395">They were preparing lines against the Russians.</span> <span id="s396">So we were enlarging the roads, and widening them, making them stronger, so that the Germans could bring in heavy equipment, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: If we could go back to Auschwitz for just a couple of moments, do you know, or do you recall any of the German officers that you know?</span> <span id="s398">Did you ever come to know who some of them were by name?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No.</span> <span id="s400">Not once.</span> <span id="s401">As a matter of fact, the only one I got to know was a kapo, a non-Jewish kapo, which means the leader of prisoners and prisoner units, who told us that, “You have arrived at the ‘Hell on Earth’,” he says.</span> <span id="s402">“Nobody in his wildest dreams would have imagined that such a place exists,” he says, “but you have arrived at it.</span> <span id="s403">I have been,” he says, “in prison since 1938.”</span> <span id="s404">I know he was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s405">He had a hard weatherbeaten face, and he told us, “You have survived the first selection.’</span> <span id="s406">And he gave us basic concepts on how to stay alive.</span> <span id="s407">He says, “Don’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s408">Don’t trust your best friend.</span> <span id="s409">Look out for yourself.</span> <span id="s410">Be selfish to the point of obscenity,” he says.</span> <span id="s411">“You don’t let your guard down for a second.</span> <span id="s412">Just be aware of one thing.</span> <span id="s413">Try and stay alive from one minute to the other one.</span> <span id="s414">And never let your guard down.</span> <span id="s415">Never try to relax.</span> <span id="s416">Always try to find out where the nearest guards are and what they are doing.</span> <span id="s417">Don’t volunteer for anything.</span> <span id="s418">If you get sick,” he says, “you might as well forget it.</span> <span id="s419">There is no worse place than to go to the sick compound.</span> <span id="s420">You get less food and no treatment, and you will be a goner on no time,” he says.</span> <span id="s421">“Keep your strength up.</span> <span id="s422">Work as little as you can.</span> <span id="s423">Walk a fine balance between not working and working hard enough so as not to arouse the suspicion of the guards.</span> <span id="s424">Conserve your strength,’ and so forth.</span> <span id="s425">He gave us some basic advice as to how to stay alive from day to day.</span> <span id="s426">But of course we didn’t work anywhere there, and we had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s427">We got chased out into the yard during the day, and during the night we had to stay in the barracks.</span> <span id="s428">It was a terrible existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Did you have any idea how big Auschwitz was?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: It was gigantic.</span> <span id="s431">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s432">I didn’t have any concept of how many thousands of people were housed there, but I saw, in some areas when we were marched from one side to the other, from one camp to the other, I saw rows and rows of barracks, as far as the eye could see.</span> <span id="s433">And they were subdivided within several sections by double strings of electric, barbed wire, and we saw nothing but suicides, and terrible things happening, but this is probably a place that nobody can envision unless you have seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: There were people from all over Europe in your barracks?</span> <span id="s435">Or were there mostly the people you came with?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: There were Hungarians in this particular barracks, but we soon saw that there were some Polish Jews, and a great number of Greeks, as well as Hungarians.</span> <span id="s437">And then there were many Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s438">And when I arrived in Auschwitz, there were some French left yet, and some German Jews, so it was really a conglomeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Either in Auschwitz or when they sent you to work in that slave camp, what did they feed you during the day, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I remember very well, because the food was the only thing that kept us alive, and it was the only thing that had any interest to us.</span> <span id="s441">In the morning we received – we called it coffee – black water.</span> <span id="s442">And usually there was so little time to even go and fight your way for some of the faucets or go to the latrines.</span> <span id="s443">You had to stand in line for that coffee.</span> <span id="s444">I don’t know at what time we got up.</span> <span id="s445">It was around 4 or 4:30, maybe 5 in the morning.</span> <span id="s446">No later than that.</span> <span id="s447">And then we left the camp probably around 6 in the morning and worked till noon.</span> <span id="s448">Then we had a half-an-hour lunch.</span> <span id="s449">We got a bowl of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: For lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: For lunch, yes.</span> <span id="s452">That was brought out to our place of work.</span> <span id="s453">In the evening, when we were done with our work we were marching back into the camp.</span> <span id="s454">We received another bowl of either vegetable or soup, a little piece of bread, and sometimes a small piece of margarine or a little sugar or a honey substitute, or maybe some kind of sausage, tiny little pieces.</span> <span id="s455">And that was the meal for the day.</span> <span id="s456">We had to do heavy physical labor with that all day long.</span> <span id="s457">And sanitary conditions were non-existent.</span> <span id="s458">We slept in three or four tiers of bunks – beds – one close to the other one, with no air.</span> <span id="s459">There were no sanitary facilities except that we could go to in the brilliant daytime.</span> <span id="s460">And suicides happened every day, every night,</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: How did people commit suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Usually by hanging at night.</span> <span id="s463">Except the first day, I remember one fellow tried to throw himself in front of a German truck, and the truck managed to stop just before, it just hit his arm and broke his arm.</span> <span id="s464">And that poor fellow, he was first taken to the hospital compound within our little camp.</span> <span id="s465">We had some doctors, of course, most of them inmates.</span> <span id="s466">And they had a very simple type of operating facilities.</span> <span id="s467">They were setting his arm, put a very big cast on it, put a sling on it.</span> <span id="s468">And then the SS made him carry huge stones – boulders – from one end of the yard to the other one, with his broken arm.</span> <span id="s469">Then in the evening, some other SS guards came, and he was put on trial and sentenced to I don’t know how many beatings.</span> <span id="s470">And he was beaten to a pulp .</span> <span id="s471">Whenever he fainted, he was revived with cold water.</span> <span id="s472">And then he was stuck into a barrel – with cold water – and so that he wouldn’t slip under water, they put a board in front of his neck and one behind to keep him upright, so he wouldn’t fall down.</span> <span id="s473">And that way, he was put under a dripping downspout, or something.</span> <span id="s474">It must have been raining, and it was dripping on him, and they put him right underneath it.</span> <span id="s475">Of course in the morning he was dead.</span> <span id="s476">So that was the first suicide in the new camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: That was the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: That was the first day, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You didn’t stay in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I stayed in that camp for several months.</span> <span id="s481">Then I was sent to other camps in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s482">I remember one camp consisted only of tents, where we were sleeping on the ground.</span> <span id="s483">We had simple army tents where about four or six people stayed in one tent.</span> <span id="s484">And then we were sent to Grossrosen proper for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Where was Grossrosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Near Breslau, in Germany.</span> <span id="s487">As a matter of fact, we were working very closely within German population centers.</span> <span id="s488">Sometimes we were working right in small German towns.</span> <span id="s489">And the German population got terribly accustomed to seeing long rows of prisoners working right within their communities.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t like to have anybody tell me that the German population did not know what was going on, because I could see thousands and thousands of them every day!</span> <span id="s491">And they in turn could see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: They knew who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s494">(Laughs) We couldn’t be mistaken for anybody else.</span> <span id="s495">We were, by that time, walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s496">We had our hair shorn, and only one strip of hair in the center.</span> <span id="s497">We had these blue and while striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s498">And we were guarded by heavily armed SS as if we would be the most precious possession that the world would have to offer.</span> <span id="s499">I don’t know how the Germans reconciled our existence with what they were hearing from their own leaders, but they couldn’t help but feeling sorry for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: You do remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s502">I also remember the guards, and I could never understand how some of the guards who were basically normal, loving fathers and husbands – I can understand German, and I could see how they reacted when they got visitors, when their wives and their families came to see them.</span> <span id="s503">They were concerned husbands, and from all appearances, normal human beings, and when it came towards their prisoners, they became absolute animals!</span> <span id="s504">But how they could transform from one minute to the other and back, and treat these slaves the way they did, and yet show so much love and respect – in some cases, concern – for their families, is something that I could never figure out, and I have thought about that, many, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And even then, at the time that it happened, you thought about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">I marveled about it!</span> <span id="s508">It’s one of the few things that entered my mind outside of the one thing that I kept in mind to keep my guard up, and only preoccupy myself with the one task of staying alive from one minute to the other.</span> <span id="s509">If you lived in the past, or let your attention wander, you didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s510">As a matter of fact, I don’t think I ever thought of my home, or my background, or my parents – never!</span> <span id="s511">I never dreamt.</span> <span id="s512">At night, as soon as I hit the sack, I was asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Do you think it was something that you did consciously, or did you think that there was just this instinct that you had that you realized, this is what you had to do to survive, and you didn’t have to give it much thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, most of it, I am sure, was subconsciously, but I did have one desire that I know, and that is to see this country defeated.</span> <span id="s515">To see this kind of injustice revenged.</span> <span id="s516">This is what basically kept me alive.</span> <span id="s517">I never had any illusions we would ever survive the war, but I wanted to see the point when Germany was defeated.</span> <span id="s518">I think, if anything, that this kept me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Did you hear rumors?</span> <span id="s520">We’re talking about late 1944, or early 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Oh sure, we heard rumors.</span> <span id="s522">And what’s more, for a while we even had German papers smuggled into the camp.</span> <span id="s523">It’s a long story, and I don’t know whether I want to go into this, but since I was one of the few speaking German, they brought me some of the papers, and I had to read and translate them.</span> <span id="s524">But I knew Hungarian, and the others spoke more-or-less Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So you knew about the Allied war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Did you know that they had invaded France?</span> <span id="s528">You knew about those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: We heard about that.</span> <span id="s530">And the more Germans, they by all appearances, lost the war, the worse our treatment got.</span> <span id="s531">This was one thing that I couldn’t figure out, either.</span> <span id="s532">The German guards, sadistic, specially trained, sub-human people, who volunteered, in most instances, for that job, became more and more vicious, if anything, as they saw their own end nearing.</span> <span id="s533">Only towards the very end of the war when even these dregs of humanity were sent to the war, they brought in old people who were no longer able to be sent to the front, or severely wounded recruits, and so forth.</span> <span id="s534">These, of course.</span> <span id="s535">Showed much more humanity.</span> <span id="s536">I must say that I have seen some signs of basic humanity and compassion on the part of guards, as well, but they were very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So you were in Breslau, in Germany, and what time of the war was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: This was until December, 1944.</span> <span id="s539">We could hear, already, the rumblings of the approaching Russian armies.</span> <span id="s540">We could hear the guns firing, and we saw transports being marched by our own camps, from concentration labor camps – slave labor camps – further east.</span> <span id="s541">They were evacuated and marched west.</span> <span id="s542">So we knew our time was come too.</span> <span id="s543">And pretty soon we were also evacuated.</span> <span id="s544">We were marched on foot to Czechoslovakia, over the mountains.</span> <span id="s545">That was in 1945 – end of January, beginning of February.</span> <span id="s546">We were marched into Czechoslovakia, and there we were put into open railroad cars, without provisions.</span> <span id="s547">It was cold, snowing, I remember.</span> <span id="s548">And a sympathetic commander kept us alive by giving us hot water from the engine.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: A German?</span> <span id="s550">A Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah, he was apparently in charge of this particular train.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What about the march itself?</span> <span id="s553">Do you remember how long a march it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I don’t know how long it was.</span> <span id="s555">I know everybody that stayed behind was shot, and we learned to sleep while walking, and do whatever “business” we had to do, while walking.</span> <span id="s556">We had to keep walking, until we reached whatever destination that was.</span> <span id="s557">One night we stayed in a cement factory, and in order to stay warm, we saw torn cement bags laying around, and we wrapped ourselves in the cement bags.</span> <span id="s558">We were soon covered with cement, from head to toe.</span> <span id="s559">We were breathing the cement dust.</span> <span id="s560">It wasn’t doing much to keep us warm.</span> <span id="s561">We spent one night there.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And eventually got to this destination, and you were put in these open railroad cars, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: From there we were taken way across Germany.</span> <span id="s564">Across Dresden and Leipzig.</span> <span id="s565">We saw Leipzig after a heavy American saturation bombing, and I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s566">We crossed that city on the railroad at night.</span> <span id="s567">We saw, still, the fires burning, and some sections of the city were absolutely devastated.</span> <span id="s568">There were only fire walls standing.</span> <span id="s569">And we were standing and freezing in these open railroad cars, and I remember that was one time when I wasn’t cold or hungry.</span> <span id="s570">And pretty soon we saw German refugees – civilians.</span> <span id="s571">Soon we saw them all the time in huge droves, coming from the east and going west.</span> <span id="s572">And pretty soon we saw another phenomenom.</span> <span id="s573">We saw similar transports of German civilians going east from the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: They were caught in the squeeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: They were retreating from the Allies.</span> <span id="s576">It wasn’t hard to figure out that Germany was being compressed, and the Allied armies were victorious.</span> <span id="s577">And when I realized that, that was the best medicine.</span> <span id="s578">That was the highlight of our trip.</span> <span id="s579">Of course we didn’t know whether they’d understand, but it was a wonderful feeling for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Where did they eventually take you on that train?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: They took us to Bergen-Belsen, which was a concentration camp, labor camp, not far from Kassel, in north central Germany.</span> <span id="s582">The conditions were atrocious.</span> <span id="s583">It was overcrowded.</span> <span id="s584">There was hardly any food given out.</span> <span id="s585">Water was non-existent anymore.</span> <span id="s586">It was absolutely a nightmare of a different sort.</span> <span id="s587">We were not so much hounded by the guards, or worked to death.</span> <span id="s588">We were starved to death that time.</span> <span id="s589">And the death toll was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s590">People died in droves.</span> <span id="s591">There we saw, not only Jews, but Russians, Polish, former POWs, and Frenchmen and Dutch again.</span> <span id="s592">It was a truly international meeting ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: What did the Nazis do?</span> <span id="s594">How did they administer the camp?</span> <span id="s595">What happened to all the people that were dying?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: They were put in huge mountains.</span> <span id="s597">First they were put in mass graves, but then people didn’t have the strength to do that, and there were so many, so they were put like cordwood at every corner of the barracks.</span> <span id="s598">Regular mountains appeared.</span> <span id="s599">And I remember, just before liberation, every able body – every “able” body – every person alive in the camp had to line up, and four of us had to drag one body, into prepared mass graves on the outskirts of the camp.</span> <span id="s600">Four dying people were dragging one dead.</span> <span id="s601">And then if the people dragging them died themselves, they were picked up by others.</span> <span id="s602">And that went on for three days, and I believe for three nights.</span> <span id="s603">I’m not sure about that.</span> <span id="s604">But of course it only made a dent.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: It sounds like it was a place where people were just sent to die.</span> <span id="s606">There was no activity there?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: There was no activity.</span> <span id="s608">There was nobody going off for work anymore – except once they sent me on a trip to Stettin, in the southeast corner of Germany, where we were supposed to build fortifications against the Russians.</span> <span id="s609">Again I had to go through a selection, and mind you, at that time I was one of the stronger ones again, and I was taken on that trip.</span> <span id="s610">Of course, without food, without nourishment again, the same kind of torture, when we got to Stettin, we were more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s611">We were asked to leave the train, and we were inspected by the military commander of this area, and he took one good look at us and told the SS to load us back to the train and send us back where we came from.</span> <span id="s612">He refused to keep us there.</span> <span id="s613">There, too, it was under heavy bombardment again, at that time, by the Russians.</span> <span id="s614">We were sent back in the same train, on the same trip back to Bergen-Belsen where only a small number was alive when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Do you remember how many went on the trip and how many came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, I don’t remember the number, but I know there were many, many cars, and each car had probably 100 or so.</span> <span id="s617">And in our car not many were alive when we arrived back in Belsen.</span> <span id="s618">That was a very bad trip.</span> <span id="s619">And when we came back it was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: I don’t know if there are other things that you want to talk about Belsen.</span> <span id="s621">You were in Belsen when you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I was liberated in Belsen, yes.</span> <span id="s623">And I was in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s624">I was no longer able to walk.</span> <span id="s625">But I remember that I saw a British armored car with English soldiers in it, and the German officer being kept, and troops patrolling, inspecting the camp.</span> <span id="s626">The German officer, apparently, told the English officer that there was all kinds of disease in this camp, which was true.</span> <span id="s627">People were dying.</span> <span id="s628">And the British were very cautious in marching in, but that day we received the first CARE package through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s629">And I remember getting a can of milk, among others, and some hardtack.</span> <span id="s630">And I was clutching that can of milk, condensed milk, in my hand, and I went to look for a can opener, so I went outside and I sat in the mud, in the rain, the slime there, among some dead, and I found a rusty nail, and I tried to punch a hole into the can, and I didn’t have the strength.</span> <span id="s631">I took a pebble, but the trouble is the pebble was, to me, like a rock.</span> <span id="s632">I tried to punch a hole and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s633">I was sitting there with the can, and I realized I didn’t have the strength even to open a can of milk.</span> <span id="s634">And I saw I was liberated, the Germans were defeated, and all around me people were dying and dead.</span> <span id="s635">And it was just like a reaction.</span> <span id="s636">I really broke down.</span> <span id="s637">That was the first time in my life that I started to cry.</span> <span id="s638">And then I remember a British soldier came up to me and asked me what am I doing here.</span> <span id="s639">And I was showing him, I was trying to punch a hole in that can.</span> <span id="s640">And then I remembered my sister who went to England, and I remembered the city she went to and I asked the soldier whether he knew anybody in his outfit that was from that area, so I could send a message to my sister.</span> <span id="s641">And he looked at me so surprised, and he says, “Don’t go away.</span> <span id="s642">I’ll be right back.”</span> <span id="s643">And sure enough, he came back a few minutes later with a nurse and a British officer, and the nurse was telling me that she was from Newton, from Bedford, and she was going back on furlough within a couple of weeks and she was taking down my sister’s name and the people’s name that I remembered, but that was as far as I could make it out.</span> <span id="s644">And she said she was going to try to contact them.</span> <span id="s645">And the officer said that he was a physician, and he took away that can of milk from me, and he picked me up, and he carried me to the nearest barracks, and made a clear space for me in one of these filthy bunk beds, and told me that I shouldn’t touch any food.</span> <span id="s646">I shouldn’t eat or drink anything except what he was gonna bring.</span> <span id="s647">And he came back with a huge can of zwieback and hardtack – you know, toast, dry toast – and a maybe five-gallon can of English tea.</span> <span id="s648">And he says, “That’s all you’re gonna drink or eat if you want to stay alive.</span> <span id="s649">Don’t move away from here and I’ll come and see you every day.”</span> <span id="s650">And he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s653">He was a physician, actually a medical student, from London.</span> <span id="s654">I had his name before, and I even tried to contact him once, through my sister, but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s655">He was supposed to be dropped on Holland with British parachutists, but then this whole campaign misfired, and instead of dropping him into Holland, they dropped these medical students and physicians into Belsen and other camps to try and help us.</span> <span id="s656">And he really saved my life.</span> <span id="s657">I don’t think I would be here now.</span> <span id="s658">I stayed there five days, and he came to see me every day.</span> <span id="s659">And he taught me how to walk, he took me by the arm and helped me to walk.</span> <span id="s660">And when the British decided to raze the camp I was able to more-or-less function on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Where did they take you?</span> <span id="s662">Where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Then the British found out they couldn’t clean up the camp, so they brought in bulldozers and leveled all the barracks.</span> <span id="s664">Of course, first they brought in the German prisoners – the SS – and they had to take all the bodies and dump them into mass graves, clean up the dead.</span> <span id="s665">And then they brought in the bulldozers and poured gasoline over, and set the camp on fire.</span> <span id="s666">And I came into a nearby German hospital where I was treated very well by the German physicians and the nurses.</span> <span id="s667">And after a few weeks, the Swedish Red Cross official came by and took down names of former inmates who were in bad physical shape, to be taken to Sweden.</span> <span id="s668">He asked each one their nationality, and when I said “Austrian,” he says, “I’m sorry, next one.”</span> <span id="s669">I say, “Why don’t you wanna take me?”</span> <span id="s670">He said he cannot take Germans or Austrians.</span> <span id="s671">I says, “How can you do that?</span> <span id="s672">I was not put into all this mess because I am German or Austrian!</span> <span id="s673">I am no more German,” I says, “than anybody else1 I am Jewish!</span> <span id="s674">Why don’t you accept the German Jews or Austrian Jews?’</span> <span id="s675">and apparently that somehow sank in and he put me on the list anyway and a day later I was put on the ambulance train and sent to Bremen and then by ambulance boat to Sweden.</span> <span id="s676">And in Sweden I recuperated.</span> <span id="s677">It took me about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Were you in Stockholm?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: First I was in other cities and later on I ended up in Stockholm where I had major surgery, and recuperated to the point where I could find a comfortable job.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: In Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: And you were there until 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: I was there ‘til 1947, right.</span> <span id="s686">Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: And then how do you go about making your decisions?</span> <span id="s688">What you were going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Well, one thing I wanted to do, it was leave Europe behind me.</span> <span id="s690">I had no intention of going back to Austria.</span> <span id="s691">And the question was of trying to go, to reach Israel or some other place.</span> <span id="s692">I was still not fully physically recuperated, and I felt that I would need quite a bit of medical attention.</span> <span id="s693">Furthermore, I was in no position to help the emerging State of Israel to any substantial effect.</span> <span id="s694">I thought this was not going to be a good place for me.</span> <span id="s695">I received a letter from some friends who tried to help us come to America – before the war broke out – and due to the very stringent American immigration laws, we were unable to do so.</span> <span id="s696">But at that time, these friends of mine told me that they would be happy to help me to come to the to the United States.</span> <span id="s697">And I had nothing to lose in Europe, so I decided to see what the United States were like.</span> <span id="s698">I arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s699">Stayed in the east for about half a year.</span> <span id="s700">And I must say, I couldn’t get used to the eastern United States, anywhere.</span> <span id="s701">I didn’t care for it very much.</span> <span id="s702">I was on the verge of going back to Sweden, as a matter of fact, and somebody told me, “Well, what you see here is really not the United States.</span> <span id="s703">There’s more to it than what you have seen.”</span> <span id="s704">And so I decided that I was gonna ask the HIAS, the Hebrew immigrant Aid Society, to send me to some city outside the east.</span> <span id="s705">They gave me a choice of either going to, I think, St. Louis or Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s706">I read of Scandinavians here, and I figured that if they would be able to stand it, maybe I could too.</span> <span id="s707">So this is the only reason I came to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s708">And basically I have lived here ever since, and I love it.</span> <span id="s709">I didn’t expect the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Your sister is here now too, isn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A; My sister lives in Kiryat Shmonah, Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: What about the rest of your family, your extended family?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A; I am the only one alive, except for my sister.</span> <span id="s714">My mother, I found out, also arrived in Auschwitz, shortly after I did, on a different transport.</span> <span id="s715">Killed in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s716">And my grandparents and uncles and cousins all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Fred, I know you’re a person who has felt it important to talk about your experiences many times, and maybe before a lot of other survivors felt they were able to.</span> <span id="s718">I know that you’ve been talking about your experience for quite a few years.</span> <span id="s719">Can you tell us more about why you feel the way you do about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Well this has come about, really, quite recently, I would say, maybe three, four years ago.</span> <span id="s721">Prior to that, I really hardly ever talked about anything like this.</span> <span id="s722">I even avoided talking to my own children about it.</span> <span id="s723">I didn’t think there was too much good to be had.</span> <span id="s724">But lately I have felt there is an absolute need to perpetuate the experiences that I and people in my same background have had in Europe, and to try and pass on this type of experience by word of mouth to the next generation, so that we all could learn from mistakes that were made.</span> <span id="s725">We must learn from mistakes that were made because God only knows what will happen if we don’t.</span> <span id="s726">Both Jews and non-Jews must be made aware of how low a people can sink.</span> <span id="s727">And I feel very strongly about it, because after all Germany is not a backward country.</span> <span id="s728">It is what we call a civilized country that has given us so many great minds and people outstanding in arts and science and the endeavor of human life, and yet has sunk so low.</span> <span id="s729">And one has to keep working, by all means, trying to raise the level of consciousness and awareness and humaneness, if you will, of the entire world by any means possible.</span> <span id="s730">So I am trying to do, in my own little way, what little I can find I can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: One last question, then.</span> <span id="s732">I know some survivors have said, or have felt, that there was no rhyme or reason to their survival.</span> <span id="s733">It sounds as if you have given some thought to the reasons why you’ve survived.</span> <span id="s734">Do you feel that you knew that you were going to survive?</span> <span id="s735">And others would not?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I really did not.</span> <span id="s737">I never consciously believed that I was going to be able to survive.</span> <span id="s738">And I don’t know why I did and others did not.</span> <span id="s739">I came across so many gifted and from all signs valuable people who I felt had so much more to offer than I did.</span> <span id="s740">And they died in terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s741">I somehow survived.</span> <span id="s742">I am not as presumptuous as to think that I was chosen for anything that I did or didn’t do, or that I was somehow taken for some specific reason.</span> <span id="s743">I do not believe that.</span> <span id="s744">I think 99% was chance, luck, and possibly physical condition.</span> <span id="s745">I cannot for the life of me, imagine why some people died and others lived, that there was a rhyme or reason behind this.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Is there something else that you feel that you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well, it is, of course, difficult to compress some experiences here in a few minutes or hours, but I hope that I have been able to convey, maybe, to the best of my ability, some of the impressions that I have now, after that many years.</span> <span id="s748">And if there is any value to it, if there is anything that another generation can learn from that, I think that I have done well.</span></p> <p><span
