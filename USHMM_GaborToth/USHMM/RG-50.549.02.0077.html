tell me on tape, we’ll record, your -- your name and your place and date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: This is Fred Wohl, actually Frederick Richard Wohl.</span> <span id="s21">I was born on June 7th, 1914 in Baden-Baden, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And I’m also interested in knowing y -- your name, Wohl, is that a -- a German name, a Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: That’s a -- a -- it -- it’s an o-original.</span> <span id="s24">My family, far as I know, never changed their last name, and I know my grandfather -- really my great-grandfather supposed to have come from Hungary, but I don’t know enough about that, only that they told my father that he’s coming from Hungarian horse thieves, that’s about all.</span> <span id="s25">My grandmother came from Poland.</span> <span id="s26">My -- that’s on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s27">On my mother’s side, her grandfather, I think, had a flour mill in the German state of Hesse, and they were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s28">My grandmother became a widow before I was born, and she -- a -- a -- her brother-in-law, Joseph Berliner, took care of her affairs in various ways.</span> <span id="s29">And I remember him as a very, very stern man, who however, when it was needed, came through.</span> <span id="s30">My parents were married in 1908, and with the dowry that my mother got, my father bought the pharmacy in Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s31">This was a Grand Duke’s court pharmacy and one of the requirements was that the owner would visit the castle every year, in high hat and o-outfit, just as a courtesy, leave his card there, and to continue to be the pharmacist of the court.</span> <span id="s32">That even continued after the German revolution, as long as the Grand Duchess Louise was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So it ha -- it was a business with a great history to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s35">The pharmacy building was from the 15th century, and is still unchanged, mostly, from the outside at least.</span> <span id="s36">Although when my father decided to get central heating, they dug up underneath the store and found buckets of Roman coins and Roman cups and things, which he gave to the museum in Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s37">He had kept one -- one glass, but that’s -- was lost in the -- naturally, during the -- in the war.</span> <span id="s38">His name is no longer at the museum in Baden-Baden.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was your father’s full name and his date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: His name is Julius Wohl, and his birth was the eighth of June, what’s the -- must have been ’89?</span> <span id="s41">Something like that, I’m not --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: A-And your mother’s full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My mother’s full name was Gisela Littman, and she was nine years younger than my father.</span> <span id="s44">Her birthday was August 24th.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I think my father’s was ’81, and hers was ’89.</span> <span id="s47">1881 and 1889, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s49">And you were one of three children, two sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: [indecipherable] actually, my mother had five children and three survived.</span> <span id="s51">When -- that was a time when babies didn’t have too much a chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s52">Even so, she had her children at a hospital in Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s53">He -- ma -- she first had a son, who did not survive, and then after my youngest sister, she had another baby girl that was born dead, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And what was the -- what were the names of your two sisters, and what was the birth order?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: My older sister Ilsa, who became Mrs. Ilsa Burns was born f -- second of September, 1915, and Margaret was born the second of September -- no, she was 1915, Ilsa was 1912, the older one.</span> <span id="s56">And none of them are alive any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: So you were the baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, I was in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Ah, so -- ah, 1914, of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s61">And Ilsa died on the island of Majorca.</span> <span id="s62">She had cancer, never told us, but she had been smoking and drinking all her life.</span> <span id="s63">Not excessive drinking, but years ago, quite a bit.</span> <span id="s64">Her favorite was Uta, a-and she died.</span> <span id="s65">I don’t remember the years of either one.</span> <span id="s66">Margaret got sick and she had to have a brain surgery, which she had in New Jersey, where she owned a little house, and unfortunately she never recovered properly and my daughters looked after her and took her to a place in Arizona, where they both lived.</span> <span id="s67">And she -- she died there.</span> <span id="s68">She died about five years ago, I would say.</span> <span id="s69">So I say, I’m -- I’m no good on these dates, but I remember that it happened, and that was pretty sad, but she didn’t realize that, she was at a point where she was happy with her life.</span> <span id="s70">Even so, she wasn’t all there.</span> <span id="s71">That’s the family.</span> <span id="s72">And my first wife, Lillian Eisenberg, was born in March six.</span> <span id="s73">She was six years younger than I am, that must have been ’20 - 1920.</span> <span id="s74">And we had two daughters.</span> <span id="s75">We had a good marriage, but then she got sick and she had to be on dialysis for two and a half years, after which she -- she died here in -- in Washington.</span> <span id="s76">And I was alone for a little while, then I got married to Evelyn Mitzner, on June 26, 11 years ago.</span> <span id="s77">We had known Evelyn and Ernie Mitzner for many years, and Ernie was a good friend of -- to me, and he died from -- what’s it?</span> <span id="s78">Sugar.</span> <span id="s79">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Oh, diabetes?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Diabetes.</span> <span id="s82">The -- he was an amazing guy.</span> <span id="s83">He first lost one leg, then he wa -- lost another leg, and then he lost a couple of fingers, and finally he ha -- his heart give up.</span> <span id="s84">But he enjoyed life in spite of his disability.</span> <span id="s85">They had a nice house in Annapolis, and we went together on weekends.</span> <span id="s86">They had a weekend home in West Virginia, and we went on vacations together.</span> <span id="s87">And so, after a year and a few months of being alone, I married Evelyn and sold my house.</span> <span id="s88">And we are pretty happy to -- happy together, but in April 2003, she had unexpected bleeding in her brain, and she -- she had blain sur -- brain surgery, and she -- fortunately -- she is still in recovery actually, but she is doing br -- amazingly well, which makes me quite happy.</span> <span id="s89">One month after that, for no reason whatsoever, I got sick.</span> <span id="s90">In May, 2003.</span> <span id="s91">And at the Suburban Hospital they operated my -- my -- what is it?</span> <span id="s92">My belludder -- underbelly.</span> <span id="s93">I -- they told me afterwards it may have had to do with a hernia that I had been operated on about 40 years earlier.</span> <span id="s94">And they put things in order, but after they had closed me up, they had to open me up again to make sure everything was working.</span> <span id="s95">And this separ -- second opening damaged my heart.</span> <span id="s96">So I was pretty sick since May of 2003.</span> <span id="s97">I was then in and out of hospital and recovery places, and I’m now home with my wife, but we had to decide that this home is too big and too difficult to keep for us, and in the next two months, we’ll be moving to the hired residence on Connecticut Avenue, where we have a two bedroom and two bath apartment.</span> <span id="s98">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Well, I’d like to go back to the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And -- and have you tell me more about your childhood in Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s102">What do you remember about your extended family then?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, my -- my father and my mother were prominent citizens of Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s104">He was naturally the owner of the [German] which is not a drugstore like here, it’s a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s105">A-And he was a honorary commander of the first [indecipherable] organization.</span> <span id="s106">He was also member of the democratic party, and my mother liked to be the society woman.</span> <span id="s107">She -- they -- they went to theater and concerts regularly and especially as long as we lived in the city, she had tea hours after lunch with friends from the theater or from the concert.</span> <span id="s108">People like the general director of the orchestra would come and have a cup of coffee and actors with whom my mother got friendly.</span> <span id="s109">Let’s see, one who would be prominent became Mrs. d’Albert, the composer d’Albert.</span> <span id="s110">She was his last of six or seven wives and he was a man who for each of his wives wrote an opera.</span> <span id="s111">And she was -- Hilda d’Albert was stubborn.</span> <span id="s112">She wouldn’t get divorced, so there was no opera after the one he had written for her.</span> <span id="s113">And he died wa -- when I went to -- back to Germany the first time, d’Albert was -- she was living in a pensionne and I tried to see her, but without result.</span> <span id="s114">She had a headache.</span> <span id="s115">So it was quite a shock for my parents when the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s116">They were not known as Jews, because only my father had a little bit of religion, my mother didn’t.</span> <span id="s117">And we children, we had a frau -- fräulein, and whenever the fräulein changed, they took us to their church, wa -- if they went to church Sundays, and in general we had no -- no religion.</span> <span id="s118">And only after the Nazi were her -- Nazis were here, I became definitely aware of what I was, and that both -- both my parents were Jewish, and I was trying to find a -- I had a membership card from the Jewish sports club, but I couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s119">I’m slow, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s120">Have to think.</span> <span id="s121">Now, what next?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Did you have any extended family that were cl-close to you in Baden-Baden?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: There was my father’s brother lived there.</span> <span id="s124">He was a -- in a bank.</span> <span id="s125">And afterwards he was in the -- in a factory of [indecipherable] after works -- I worked.</span> <span id="s126">He was -- had an interesting story because when the Nazis took the Jews from Baden-Baden and brought them to south of France to a camp, I don’t remember the name, but then towards the end of the war, he was packed on a train to get to the -- to the ovens.</span> <span id="s127">And he got sick on the train and they threw him off in Avignon, in France, where he, who had never learned two words of a foreign language, he acquired some French and worked there -- and English, I guess too -- worked there with the American -- the authorities who came up the Rhone Valley and eventually he made his way back to Baden-Baden, where they -- he became police chief and had a -- I think for 10 years he was that, and then he retired and everybody was happy with their Jewish police chief.</span> <span id="s128">But he had never been married before, so then he first got married to a lady who had a nice apartment, which was one of the attractions, but after they were married, the authorities came and said this apartment is too big for you, you have to divide it up.</span> <span id="s129">Do you want to keep the part with the kitchen, or the part with the bathroom?</span> <span id="s130">She selected the part with the kitchen, because there was a hotel nearby where my uncle was friendly with the owner, and where they could always go to take a bath.</span> <span id="s131">That lady died, and he remarried, a woman whom he had met a few years earlier on his vacations.</span> <span id="s132">He had the nice custom of going on a vacation alone.</span> <span id="s133">And he told us afterwards, yes, it was ca -- she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s134">He met her in -- on vacation, a la -- a woman with -- from Vienna who had three daughters, and I met her in Baden-Baden just before my uncle died and I visited her once afterwards, but I don’t know whether she is still alive.</span> <span id="s135">She had a big disappointment because there’s a regulation that younger women who marry an older person could not inherit his pension.</span> <span id="s136">They would have to be -- have been married for at least 10 years and they were not.</span> <span id="s137">My cousin, who lives in Essen, Germany, tried to help her but there was no -- no way.</span> <span id="s138">She had a nervous breakdown, but then it seems her daughters could take care of her.</span> <span id="s139">And I no -- not in touch with any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: If I go back to your childhood, you would, as a boy, not think of yourself as Jewish at all, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, that’s right.</span> <span id="s142">We didn’t now it.</span> <span id="s143">My sisters didn’t know it, and it came as a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s145">Would there be any way in which you would observe Jewish holidays or any religious services at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No, my -- my father would go once a year to synagogue, and I don’t remember whether I ever went with him.</span> <span id="s147">My first recollection actually of a Jewish services was when I lived on Cyprus and that was pretty late.</span> <span id="s148">But I made up for it to some extent by learning things, studying a little bit.</span> <span id="s149">When I -- when -- after I had lost my job in Germany, and stayed with my parents in Frankfurt for a few weeks, there was a man who was traveling around [indecipherable] a-around Germany collecting money for a rabbinical school he wanted to start in Lichtenst -- Lichtenstein.</span> <span id="s150">He was probably a crook, but was very interesting man.</span> <span id="s151">He traveled with a companion.</span> <span id="s152">He sa -- he said he was his cousin.</span> <span id="s153">And he got sick and I visited him in his pensionne -- hotel where I was -- I lived.</span> <span id="s154">And that is where I recall first to get the first impression of the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s155">He taught me that in contrast to all other religions, Jews can talk directly to their God, and that the basis is -- of their religion really, 10 commandments.</span> <span id="s156">And I’ve never forgotten it, I should have -- I should be gr-grateful to him.</span> <span id="s157">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: How --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: He left the country just before the Nazis tried to catch him, and a -- I -- I wished I had his name or anything, but I was never in touch with him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: How old were you when your life began to change as a result of the Nazis gaining power?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: 19 -- I was 20, ’14 [indecipherable] Nazis came.</span> <span id="s162">I was working the industry of -- in the office of [indecipherable], a company that made bicycle lamps and hydraulic lifts for automobiles, and electric switches, hot switches.</span> <span id="s163">I started working there in ’32.</span> <span id="s164">’32 was a year of change for me anyhow -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frederick Wohl.</span> <span id="s166">This is tape number one, side B. And we’ll continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: You were telling me about the time when your life changed as the Nazis gained power.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Right.</span> <span id="s170">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: That apprenticeship you were doing in 1932, would that have been regarded by your parents as a compromise?</span> <span id="s172">Would they have wanted you to have been a pharmacist?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s174">But that’s the only thing I could get.</span> <span id="s175">You see, I -- as I say, I go -- I matriculate -- I got the [indecipherable] in 30 -- March ’32.</span> <span id="s176">I left the same day for Switzerland, where we had an exchange program [indecipherable] family, and we were due a few more weeks.</span> <span id="s177">So I stayed in Nyon, at town on the lake o-of [indecipherable] of Lake Leman, and went around the neighborhood on bicycle with a friend who was a son of that family.</span> <span id="s178">We went, for example, through Geneva and listened to a session of the League of Nations Council, which for us was very interesting to wa -- to see these people in the -- some [indecipherable] there was a [indecipherable] the British prime minister, and Von Bulow was the German representative.</span> <span id="s179">And from France, I think it was Brionne, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s180">They had caricatures at that time, all over Geneva with the -- the caricatures of Chamberlain, Brionne and Straserman, who was a German foreign minister.</span> <span id="s181">I met in Geneva also, some acquaintances of my parents, just by chance, and told them that I had to go back to Germany soon, but I had no job and if there’s anything they could think of to help me.</span> <span id="s182">So when my time was over with the Prin [indecipherable] P-r-i-n, I went by train back to Basel, where we also had friends, and there two boys and I, we did a bit of roaming around the mountains in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s183">Then just one day before I would have to come -- go back to Germany, I got an phone call that there was a farm in -- north of Revai on the Lake of Geneva, and the owner was ready to take me on as apprentice as -- to learn about farming, if I was interested.</span> <span id="s184">I exchanged my ticket, instead of going north, I went back south to the lake and that man’s son f -- received me in Revai.</span> <span id="s185">The place where I spend, must have been about four months is a -- was call -- the farm was called Eau de ville and everybody spoke French, which was naturally the purpose, I should learn French.</span> <span id="s186">And it was at times difficult, but I had, in the early morning, to go and clean the pig sty.</span> <span id="s187">I had afterwards to clean the cow sty, or the cattle sty, and then the s -- [indecipherable] the couple of horses, after which we got breakfast that consisted of -- what’s that Italian maize?</span> <span id="s188">Anyhow, it’s something I had never eaten before, and very weak coffee with lot of milk.</span> <span id="s189">I also learned in that place to eat cheese.</span> <span id="s190">I never before had eaten cheese.</span> <span id="s191">And I worked hard.</span> <span id="s192">I also had to go up on trees for cherries and for peaches, I think it was.</span> <span id="s193">And during these few weeks on the farm, I grew about two and a half inches, and I became real -- taller.</span> <span id="s194">Before, I had been one of the shortest and weakest in my class at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: And that was your 18th year?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And did you learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I ha -- yes.</span> <span id="s199">I learned French, and after a few weeks the owner sent me on an [indecipherable] meadow with a shepherds and a dozen heads of cattle and one horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: This was to a mountain pasture?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yeah, and the mountain, I know -- I think it was called the Pleardes.</span> <span id="s202">There was a -- an electric rail going up there to a couple of hotels and a hut that belonged to the -- th-the owner of the -- of the farm, and who had to supply milk to these hotels, and who would ca -- have to carry it up on his back?</span> <span id="s203">Me.</span> <span id="s204">Was interesting because you had to be careful not to be chased by some steer, or -- even though the meadows were separated by -- thank you.</span> <span id="s205">These are things I don’t thing I -- I wrote if e-every -- anywhere.</span> <span id="s206">I -- I don’t know whether it’s right to go in all the detail with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: I think it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: In -- the Swiss national holiday, is 11th of August, and for this holiday we built a big stack of wood on the ar-arm -- on the meadow, and put fire to it in the evening.</span> <span id="s211">And all around the lake you could see fires from sta -- from these, that’s how they celebrated the holiday.</span> <span id="s212">And after that I went to one of the hotels for --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: -- to eat and drink as much as you wanted.</span> <span id="s215">I -- then, shortly after that, my father found me a job as apprentice in that Schillay-Bruksela company.</span> <span id="s216">And I left, not before the owner of the one hotel had told me how much he appreciated the fact that when I was in the kitchen in the morning, bringing him -- them their milk, and he came in, I would stand up.</span> <span id="s217">And for that he gave me a pipe.</span> <span id="s218">I started smoking a pipe then.</span> <span id="s219">Also the owner of the farm gave me a very nice certificate.</span> <span id="s220">Something happened during that time also, that I wasn’t aware of.</span> <span id="s221">The son of the owner had a girlfriend, and one day he told me, I think, two weeks they are getting married.</span> <span id="s222">I wrote my parents and send a telegram of congratulations and the day of the wedding I put a s-suit on after my work and waited to be called, to the meal or whatever there was.</span> <span id="s223">Nobody called.</span> <span id="s224">When I finally went down, they were just about finishing, and I realized what had happened -- [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Yes, the -- the Swiss family’s son’s marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s227">When I came down to dinner they were just about finished, and I realized what had happened.</span> <span id="s228">The bride was highly pregnant, and I found that it si -- was a kind of marriage where the father of the groom had to force him to get married.</span> <span id="s229">And father and son didn’t get along too well.</span> <span id="s230">But as I left the farm, I got a very nice certificate from him, which I still have, it’s in here somewhere, from the farm.</span> <span id="s231">I went right to a town, Hollenberg, in the Black Forest, where the Schillay-Bruksela company had their factory, and I became a apprentice in their office, starting with how to open letters without reading them, and go through all the departments of the office, within two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: I wanted to make sure I understood where that was in Germany.</span> <span id="s233">It’s in the Black Forest --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What is the nearest large city?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: There is, on the one -- it’s on the Black Forest, the railway, and on the one side is Offenburg in the Rhine -- on the side where the Rhine is.</span> <span id="s237">On the other side there is Constance, on the Lake of Constance.</span> <span id="s238">That’s about in the middle -- in the middle of mountains.</span> <span id="s239">It’s a nice pl -- located place, and I spent there first the two apprentice years, and then a year, I think, yeah, as employee until they were forced to let me go.</span> <span id="s240">During that time the -- that company advised me to the take the te -- the examination as commercial -- oh, what do you do, what would you call that?</span> <span id="s241">Commercial assistance, which was given by the Chamber of Commerce, of Freyburg.</span> <span id="s242">They had their letters come through hide -- to Offenburg there, and there was -- they’re testing various things that had to do with the commercial, life, like adding and being able to multiply in your head, and you had to write a composition.</span> <span id="s243">I remember there was only of -- of five different titles, there was only one that had nothing to do with the Nazis that I could select, and on each -- for each kind of lesson, there were three people who examined you, and always one was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s244">But only one of the whole lot made a nasty remark to me.</span> <span id="s245">And well, couldn’t be helped.</span> <span id="s246">But my -- I was lucky, because during that period, there had been some political upheaval, and nobody was allowed to wear his uniform.</span> <span id="s247">Otherwise I would have been the only civilian, I guess, and m-may not have been able to take that test.</span> <span id="s248">It was the most difficult examination I took ever, but it was useful.</span> <span id="s249">I -- I don’t know whether I still have the certificate, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: When you mentioned the nasty remark being made --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: -- wa -- do you remember what was said?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No, he wa -- he was surprised that a Jew was allowed to take the examination.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Would that be the first time you remember an anti-Semitic remark?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s256">I mean it -- at the office already, you came in in the morning, you didn’t say good morning, you said heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s257">And it was 1934, the Nazis had been in -- had -- they had been in power for a year, and Mr. Schillay, of Schillay-Bruksela complained about that remark afterwards, but it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s258">You see, Bruksela is a Jewish partner, and Schillay was a -- my uncle’s friend, so -- because they both were -- I had been in school with the Jewish partner’s daughter, and so I was -- they accepted me as apprentice, but during ’35, the Na-Nazi trade union insisted that I be dismissed.</span> <span id="s259">This is a payroll [indecipherable] in that place and they would tell -- t-tell them, if that Jews doesn’t leave, you can’t dismiss any other seasonal employees.</span> <span id="s260">So I was out, I got notice for the end of December, ’35.</span> <span id="s261">But the beginning of December I went skiing in the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s262">I had been skiing and walking around by myself ever since the Nazis started, and I liked it.</span> <span id="s263">Naturally there came things, but I went to a lake up in the mountains of the Black Forest, where I used to swim after wi -- going up there, which was a few hours walk, I came there, there was a sign on the lake, no Jews allowed.</span> <span id="s264">Nobody there, but that sign.</span> <span id="s265">And then, to get back in the beginning of December ’34, I went skiing and I fell and broke my thumb, here.</span> <span id="s266">Can still see it.</span> <span id="s267">And I couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s268">So they let me go earlier and I -- I moved to Frankfurt with my parents, tried to find something to do there, which was impossible.</span> <span id="s269">I would have had a -- had to have a permit to work, and the authorities wouldn’t give me one.</span> <span id="s270">So I decided to leave Germany and go to Athens, Greece, where my sister was already.</span> <span id="s271">I left -- I found somebody in the Frankfurt passport office who believed that I was an student of archaeology, going to Athens to study.</span> <span id="s272">I found out afterwards that if I went there, the police of -- for foreigners in Greece was already informed that this guy is not a student, he’s a refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Do you remember having discussions a-around this time with your parents about family plans and what should be done, or would your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: -- not discussed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: We -- my father was still working.</span> <span id="s277">After he had left -- had lost the pharmacy, he worked as -- in public relations for two factory -- pharmaceutical factories, where he went to the universities, and told the students about the products of these companies, they should prescribe it when they became doctors and so -- so he was reasonably happy, and nobody believed at that time that the Nazi power would last, see?</span> <span id="s278">So I left, and one year later we let my parents come.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Were you aware of others leaving Germany?</span> <span id="s280">Did -- did other comparable, well-to-do families leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: The y-younger people tried to leave.</span> <span id="s282">The older people didn’t believe that it lasted, or they cook -- they took their money and went to what was then still Palestine and lived on their money as long as they could.</span> <span id="s283">After the war, probably went back.</span> <span id="s284">But -- and so I went to Athens, and I had a typewriter and I had a [indecipherable], and we -- I found work in Athens.</span> <span id="s285">I took my typewriter from one office to the other, made [indecipherable] correspondence in English, French and German.</span> <span id="s286">Sometimes people who didn’t know either of these languages, or very little, they had to trust that I would write what they said, and it worked out all right for three years in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Now, which of your sisters was in Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Ilsa, the older one.</span> <span id="s289">My younger sister had gone on a farm.</span> <span id="s290">She had joined the Jewish organization to eventually go to Israel.</span> <span id="s291">And my mother’s uncle, Joseph Berliner, helped her to get a -- a job, and she worked there until the -- that organization had to evacuate and they took the young people to Denmark.</span> <span id="s292">On the way from that farm to Denmark, my sister Margaret found herself a husband, Irwin.</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">What was his last name, darn it?</span> <span id="s295">Irwin -- and they got married.</span> <span id="s296">They were both in Denmark, and then the organization, the -- what was it [indecipherable] is that it, the name?</span> <span id="s297">And they took them to England, and the both of them worked on a farm in Devonshire, where my -- where they had a little boy.</span> <span id="s298">And they still had intended to go to Israel, but eventually his mother convinced them to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s299">But that was after the war.</span> <span id="s300">Now, in Athens, I had a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s301">I was at the age where I didn’t think about tomorrow or the next day.</span> <span id="s302">I was able to have a good income, and I learned the Greek language in no time because I had learned ancient Greek at the -- at the high school.</span> <span id="s303">[indecipherable] tickets to the theater, and there was another one who had just come from Turkey, that was shortly -- actually only 10 years after the exchange of population between Turkey and Greece.</span> <span id="s304">And I fortunately could help him quite a bit.</span> <span id="s305">Then the important jobs I had there, one was only in a technical office, the engineer spoke well German and French and imported whole electrical works from Europe.</span> <span id="s306">Some parts from Germany, some from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s307">And I did the correspondence and kept the books for three years.</span> <span id="s308">We -- the owner was reasonably friendly, at a distance, and once he warned me -- I got too friendly with an associate of his who was in the same office, and when that associate separated himself, then I heard from my boss that I should watch out, not tell him anything, so on.</span> <span id="s309">That associate had been a officer in the -- in the Marine of the Greek fleet, and he at one time invited me, which was interesting, to his home for dinner.</span> <span id="s310">Which -- it was a big honor, because for one thing, the man was not married, he lived with his parents and his sister.</span> <span id="s311">And the father was a Greek priest.</span> <span id="s312">So, the men were eating on the table, and the women were serving the food.</span> <span id="s313">And after -- after dinner, they started singing and all si -- singing and dancing around the table.</span> <span id="s314">This was one thing -- something new for me.</span> <span id="s315">But the -- as I say, my boss was not happy about me being too friendly with the -- this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And you were able to bring your parents to Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: One year after I arrived, my father lost his job.</span> <span id="s318">They made a law in Germany, where about five or six pe -- Jews were doing that kind of work, but that was no longer allowed, so my parents took a vacation to Italy, where my sister Ilsa met them, and they -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s320">This is an interview with Frederick Wohl, conducted by Margaret West, on February the 13th, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland.</span> <span id="s321">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Frederick Wohl on November the 20 -- 22nd, 1989.</span> <span id="s322">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s323">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s324">We were talking about your parents and your bringing them to Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">My father had been able to secure the representation of the [indecipherable] in Greece.</span> <span id="s327">They were pretty nice to him, realizing what was happening, and he had met friends there.</span> <span id="s328">So, for one year after leaving Germany, they paid him a salary, and we rented an apartment in the center of Athens, where my mother kept house, and my sister Ilsa and I lived there with my parents.</span> <span id="s329">Naturally, I only saw them for breakfast, because I worked late, and I, most days, went out after that.</span> <span id="s330">And my father went around trying to get some industrialists to undertake to work with that company who -- whom he represented, but nothing came of it.</span> <span id="s331">He was the only one in the family who actually got a permit to stay in Greece, and to work in Greece.</span> <span id="s332">My sister never got a work permit, and I never got a proper work permit, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Why was your father granted the permit?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: He was employed, see, by a foreign company, yet.</span> <span id="s335">I always had to be on the outlook for agents of the police department trying to catch me at work.</span> <span id="s336">Th-They did a couple of times and brought me into the police center, but friends, young lawyers already, usually found the soft spot and I was released, with the exception of the very last time.</span> <span id="s337">My work in Athens also encompassed long hours of work at a newspaper distributing agency where I went at about four or five o’clock in the afternoon and usually stayed til eight or nine.</span> <span id="s338">What had happened is that I was given the name of the owner of the empo -- of that agency.</span> <span id="s339">The name of the agency was Spiro Svengalis, and the general manager owner was Janus Anagnostopoulos.</span> <span id="s340">Anagnostopoulos saw me in his office and after asking who had recommended me -- was a -- the man who supplied them their paper stock, he was satisfied and took me, without anything further, to the basement.</span> <span id="s341">There was a big office, and we had to talk in French because Anagnostopoulos only knew a few words of French and I didn’t know enough Greek at that time.</span> <span id="s342">Behind the desk in that office was sitting a young German with not one but two party signs on his jacket, and he told me, in French, that he had to leave for the Fatherland right away, and here is the book in the works, and good-bye.</span> <span id="s343">He never found out that I was German, and he took the German embassy all s -- all these years to realize who I was.</span> <span id="s344">The agency imported German newspapers as a sideline, and French and British and Czech and Swiss newspapers.</span> <span id="s345">That was a department of foreign press, which I was certainly in charge of.</span> <span id="s346">And I didn't change anything much, but a number of German residents in Athens were subscribing to German newpaper -- Nazi newspapers and after looking through the books, I sent a young man who was employed there to go and collect for the monthly rent, or three monthly rent, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s347">Anyhow, he came back and said every one of his guys had a receipt.</span> <span id="s348">So my British [indecipherable] had gone off with quite a bit of money.</span> <span id="s349">I figured out it was about a hundred thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s350">And I had to go to Anagnostopoulos after a few days working there and telling him look, there a hundred thousand dollars missing.</span> <span id="s351">And fortunately he took it all right, and advanced money to my department.</span> <span id="s352">And he was otherwise satisfied at that time.</span> <span id="s353">A few months later he called me at the engineering office, I had to come immediately.</span> <span id="s354">So I went over to -- to his office, and he was up -- very upset.</span> <span id="s355">The censor, the government censor had called and told him that the one German newspaper had publish -- had published an article about the Greek Crown Prince having an affair with a lady in Athens, and that naturally should not be distributed.</span> <span id="s356">But we had distributed said paper already.</span> <span id="s357">We only got 20 or 25 copies, was another import office for foreign newspaper, they got more -- got more offices.</span> <span id="s358">So what to do?</span> <span id="s359">I took a taxi and went from one newspaper kiosk to the other, and bought 25 copies of that particular newspaper, I cut the top off, and could s -- prove that well, we had not distributed it, and we were in the clear.</span> <span id="s360">The owner of the other office ended up on an island for a few months, and I had from then on the additional job to look through the various papers and make sure that nothing was written about the Greek royal family.</span> <span id="s361">Anagnostopoulos had the idea to start an illustrated weekly in Athens ak -- on the type of paper that was [indecipherable] very nice weeklies that the newspapers had on Sundays in Europe.</span> <span id="s362">He got lists and he ordered the machinery.</span> <span id="s363">Money was no problem with him, but the instructions were in German, which he didn’t understand and I didn’t know enough Greek mechanical words to put it in Greek, so I translated it into French.</span> <span id="s364">When the machinery came, and was put in the free harbor before import.</span> <span id="s365">When -- when we left Greece it was still there, I don’t know whether -- what ever happened to it.</span> <span id="s366">But at the end of ’40 -- of ’39 --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: -- things in Greece went bad for us.</span> <span id="s369">It seems the German embassy found out who was working there, and who -- who was sent -- looking through the papers, and Anagnostopoulos couldn’t do anything any more to keep me.</span> <span id="s370">So the police told us, you have to leave Greece, or we take you back to Germany.</span> <span id="s371">So then, t-to show them how serious they were, they put me not in jail, but -- but into a police office, where I stayed three or four days, after which we could make them realize that while my father and my sister were working to find where to go, I should be doing that too, and not stay in the police wh -- thing.</span> <span id="s372">We went from one consulate and embassy to another, and nothing happened til the consul of Paraguay said yes, he could -- we could go to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s373">But when we inquired at the American Express about traveling there, they told us that country doesn’t have the power to give you a visa.</span> <span id="s374">You have to go to Italy, to the general consul, and forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Now, you were able to use your mother’s connection with a former foreign secretary of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah, now --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: -- Weimar Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: -- during that time, when things got real bad, we were trying other kinds of visits and this and such.</span> <span id="s379">Now, my father had been a Mason for all these years.</span> <span id="s380">In Athens he went to attend Masonic meetings of a Freemason’s Lodge that [indecipherable] in German.</span> <span id="s381">And at a big dinner there that was given in honor of a British duke, he happened to sit next to a young fellow who -- with whom he started talking and he -- that fellow was a secretary to the British ambassador.</span> <span id="s382">They got friendly and that young fellow, he took my daughter skiing, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: -- that was before -- before things got so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: That was your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: But when -- when things got real bad, my father got to him and asked for help, one -- one Mason to another.</span> <span id="s387">And the man got him an audience with the ambassador, the ki -- British ambassador, who listened to the story and i-immediately started investigating the family.</span> <span id="s388">Now, my mother had a third or fourth cousin whose name was --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: I think it was R-Rathenow, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Rathenow, Walter Rathenow.</span> <span id="s391">And he had been German foreign minister in the first Republican government after the first World War.</span> <span id="s392">And he had been murdered in 1920 th -- two or ’23.</span> <span id="s393">His -- his brother, Emile Rathenow was a big industrialist in Germany, but that Walter Rathenow, there was some connection to my mother, and the British f -- office for -- that investigated people found that out and the ambassador told my father, well you -- you can go wherever you want in the British area, but we had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: What -- what was the reason that the -- that connection would --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: That we were -- we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: -- you know, persuade the British to give support?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: They were -- we were pressured to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: And we tried everybody and everything, and this was about the last, because you couldn’t just go into the British embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s401">It would be because as members of that family --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: -- you were in opposition to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We were as -- we were certainly British protected persons, all four, and he asked us, well where -- what did you go -- where would you go to?</span> <span id="s405">The closest place to Greece was the island of Cyprus, which was British, and we thought we make arrangements and go there.</span> <span id="s406">But the governor of Cyprus wanted each person to show 1,000 pounds sterling.</span> <span id="s407">4,000 pounds sterling we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s408">So the British ambassador, again, he managed to get this fee on th -- this guarantee reduced to 1,000 pounds for the whole family, but we didn’t have 1,000 pounds.</span> <span id="s409">So I talked to anapel -- Anagnostopoulos in the newspaper distributing office and asked him for help.</span> <span id="s410">And he said well, he would lend me 500 pounds, provided I could get the other 500 from somebody else.</span> <span id="s411">And he even talked to the engineer, the engineering office, got him to also lend me wa -- 500 pounds.</span> <span id="s412">So see we -- we are -- were all right to go to Cyprus, and after six months, I send them their money back.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Now were you welcomed on the island of Cyprus?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Not really, but we were refugees, like there were a few hundred other refugees there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And there was a Jewish community that had been there from 1905.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well, they -- it was not really a community, was a couple of families, who lived all over the island, who had came together for the high holidays.</span> <span id="s417">[indecipherable] with one family who had big orange and grapefruit groves in Famagusta.</span> <span id="s418">There was a physician who was the center of the Jewish community, actually, who owned a Torah, and where they had their high holiday services, and where I went with my father to services.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: What was your -- your own, and your family’s state of mind at this time?</span> <span id="s420">Were you becoming more despondent?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: We were -- we were very nervous til we were in Cyprus, and my -- we first had very little money to get established, but my sister got an -- a job in an attorney’s office from two brothers, and I got an correspondent thing in an import office, for one pound sterling a week.</span> <span id="s422">So we got along and on the day Italy entered the war, there was a note on my typewriter, we do not employ enemy aliens, good-bye.</span> <span id="s423">My next job was with two refugees from Vienna who had had some money invested in a sausage factory in Cyprus, where they made good sausages, even after the earlier owners, this man, had left, he had showed them how to do it, but none of these two knew the right languages.</span> <span id="s424">So I came -- I was useful to them, selling their sausages in a little store.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Now your parents, I think, were embarrassed by your work, selling sausages.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah, we had rented a small house on the outskirts of Nicosia.</span> <span id="s427">Nicosia is the capital of Cyprus.</span> <span id="s428">They didn’t -- they never came in to the sausage factory, the sausage store, but they liked the sausage when I brought it home.</span> <span id="s429">I met through this, naturally, quite a few people, refugees in Cyprus, and was able to make myself useful here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Now, it would seem that you, from the time you were 18 and worked on the farm in Switzerland, that you were being forced to assume adult responsibilities --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: To [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Well, much m -- at a much younger age --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: -- than would have been the case were it not for the Nazi power.</span> <span id="s435">But at what stage do you think you were becoming the leader and decision maker, as compared to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, we did that together, but there was no way out.</span> <span id="s437">See, we were thrown into Greece, we were thrown into Cyprus, and from Cyprus we were thrown into East Africa eventually.</span> <span id="s438">There was not much choice.</span> <span id="s439">The same I came here, I happened to get into an insurance office as a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s440">I learned the insurance business, and that was it, I didn’t have any choice, but I came to like it.</span> <span id="s441">I decided that if I sell anyone insurance, once he has it he was better off than he had been before I sold it to him.</span> <span id="s442">And so I came to like my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Did you -- did you consider other options in terms of a country where you would build your life?</span> <span id="s444">I mean, did you think of --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: -- Israel, or returning to Germany after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, I -- no, I did not.</span> <span id="s448">And my parents were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s449">And the only thing I -- I wanted to become a CPA, but at that time the rules were so strict in the district -- I think they still are, that a young man had to become apprenticed to another CPA and wouldn’t make any money during that time.</span> <span id="s450">On the contrary, some of [indecipherable] required a payment.</span> <span id="s451">So that was out.</span> <span id="s452">So I went to the university to eventually get a degree -- not that I needed it by that time, but I just wanted to get it and I le -- learned the insurance business, and started selling.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s454">Let me go back.</span> <span id="s455">We -- we are jumping --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: -- from Cyprus to United States, but in fact your -- your time spent in --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: In Cyprus?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: -- in East Africa is covered in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Which [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: -- is covered in the earlier videotaped interview done in 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: But when the war ended in -- the second World War ended in 1945 --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: How -- what did you do immediately after the war, and what --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: -- what arrangements had to be made for coming to the States?</span> <span id="s468">A: I tried to get another affidavit.</span> <span id="s469">You see, a very distant relative again, named Edgar Berliner lived in Canada and afterwards in California, and he, when the Nazis came, made arrangements for a group of young people to come to Canada to start a farm of some kind.</span> <span id="s470">He -- he was pretty wealthy and to his surprise, by the time he was developing that plan, I was the only one left to go.</span> <span id="s471">And naturally that -- that plan was out.</span> <span id="s472">We kept corresponding, and he was helpful to me.</span> <span id="s473">He sometimes sent me small amounts of money.</span> <span id="s474">Very small.</span> <span id="s475">He -- I only learned that he was a millionaire -- I -- I learned -- learned that later.</span> <span id="s476">And he -- when I was in Athens he gave me an affidavit to come here, but by the time these papers arrived, we were already thrown out of Greece, and they sent the papers on to Cyprus -- no, to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s477">And there were quite a few refugees in Cyprus in the same situation, that they had the papers, but the American consul was in Cairo and he wasn’t anxious to have any Jews come to America.</span> <span id="s478">He didn’t -- even if a couple of hundred people ready to come, he wouldn’t come to Cyprus to see them and interview them.</span> <span id="s479">So that was out and my affidavit eventually was -- was out of -- it wa -- had a limit, a time limit.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frederick Wohl.</span> <span id="s482">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: -- refugees to come.</span> <span id="s484">It was expressed after the conference of Evia, and the only family I know who came to America at that time was the personal physician of the Crown Prince of Greece, a Dr. Miller, I think, with whom my father afterwards was in touch in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: When you came to the United States -- you’ve told me a little about your decision, but I wonder if you’d tell me more about the -- about your parents and their discussions about where they would go after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: My parents did not know where to go after the war.</span> <span id="s487">After I had left Tanganyika, they made arrangements to be taken back to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s488">And since my father could not find any employment on Cyprus, they insisted to come to the States.</span> <span id="s489">And my sister and I signed a affidavits for them, they came over and we had a tough time to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s490">At that time my parents stayed in the States first in Mount Vernon, New York, and then here in Washington, but nothing worked out for my father, and they returned in 1950 to Tanganyika, where my father got a job as -- at the pharmacy of an Indian in -- I think in Yoringa, I don’t remember the [indecipherable] where they stayed until my father’s health deteriorated, and the doctor told him he had to get out of the tropics.</span> <span id="s491">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: I want to -- I -- please tell me about your voyage to the United States when you came, and what it was like on board ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s494">I s -- I still have the ticket from the British shipping line, I thi -- from Dar Es Salaam to the first port in the United States.</span> <span id="s495">The trip took about two months, and was very interesting.</span> <span id="s496">The only limit for me was that I didn’t have any money to enjoy the stops at the various places.</span> <span id="s497">They boat arrived in Dar Es Salaam while I was in bed with a malaria attack.</span> <span id="s498">I looked out of the window of the hotel and when I saw the boat coming in, I really got well very fast and packed up and got aboard.</span> <span id="s499">It was a Kaiser ship that allowed about 20 passengers to come on board, and the cabins and so were not very luxurious, but I was glad to be on my way.</span> <span id="s500">The boat stopped first in Durban, South Africa, where one of the passengers had acquaintances and they took us to one of the South African National Parks, which was an interesting experience, and while we were looking over the mountains and had left the windows of the car open, a bunch of monkeys got in the car, and ate the fruits that we had brought for our lunch.</span> <span id="s501">The other memory I have of Durban is that I called my mother’s great-uncle, Joseph Wilde, in Johannesburg and told him that the boat was slow and I could come and visit him, but he was not interested.</span> <span id="s502">He sent me some money instead and I have never been in touch with him again.</span> <span id="s503">I tried to obtain his address afterwards, even through the Jewish congrega -- Jewish organizations in Johannesburg, without result.</span> <span id="s504">The next stop of the boat was Cape Town where we stopped a few days also, and I inspected the town.</span> <span id="s505">The weather was not good enough to go up the Cape Town mountain, the cape mountain, which was unfortunate, and actually th-the only memory of Cape Town I have is that when you went in the mo -- to the movies there, the ticket included an ice cream or a cookie, or a piece of cake, which they offered to you during the running of the movie, through a salesperson.</span> <span id="s506">From Cape Town, the boat went to -- hold it a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: We’ll ignore the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s509">The next stop was a harbor in what is now Namibia, southwest Africa, which was a real godforsaken place, all sand, with the exception of a couple of breweries and the railroad station.</span> <span id="s510">In this place they had a crew of workers who did nothing else but keep the railroad -- the rails clean of desert sand, because there was a constant wind, and there was nothing to keep the sand away from the rails.</span> <span id="s511">We stopped there only for a short while and from then on, went across the ocean to Trinidad.</span> <span id="s512">In Trinidad the boat could not -- we -- we could not go ashore because they had a general strike, and after a couple of days the boat went on to Bermuda.</span> <span id="s513">In Bermuda I had my last bad malaria attack, on the second day there.</span> <span id="s514">I had to take to bed, and for the rest of the stop in Bermuda, I was in bed.</span> <span id="s515">What I remember of Bermuda is the fact that the lunch in the restaurants there cost as much as a whole day in a hotel in Dar Es Salaam, which made a difference to my pocket.</span> <span id="s516">The boat then went onto New Brunswick, to Saint John.</span> <span id="s517">And we stopped then after a couple of days, the shipping line decided that they were going to stay there much longer than anticipated, and we should make our arrangements to get to the States by alls else.</span> <span id="s518">I took my last money for a ticket to New York, and took off.</span> <span id="s519">I was -- til then, actually always on my -- I had in mind that coming from where I came from, and going across the frontiers, somebody would stop me and have a ser -- and search, whether I brought any diamonds with me.</span> <span id="s520">But I didn’t.</span> <span id="s521">Maybe I wasn’t smart enough, but I was anxious to get to the States without any trouble, and met my sister Margaret and her husband at the -- what’s the station in New York?</span> <span id="s522">At the railroad station in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Grand Central?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: No, the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Penn.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Penn.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Penn Station, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Penn Station.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: I had never met my brother-in-law, it was interesting fellow with whom, however, I did not get too well acquainted over the short time that I saw th -- him.</span> <span id="s531">My sister and her husband at that time were working as a couple in an old age place in Mount Vernon, New York, where the owner lady made room for me for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s532">I was surprised at the kind of work they did, but got used to the fact that any work here in the States was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: I have lots of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: I want you to tell me more about the meeting with your sister.</span> <span id="s536">It must have been very emotional.</span> <span id="s537">Did she know you?</span> <span id="s538">Did you know her at once?</span> <span id="s539">Had she changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: She know -- yes, we knew -- we know each other, but there was no time to be emotional, anything.</span> <span id="s541">Was a crowd of people and we got from one train to the other and then to -- took the train to Mount Vernon, sat there looking at each other and realized that we were not as young as we used to be, but there’s nothing exciting otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s543">And what luggage did you have with you that you’d been carrying then?</span> <span id="s544">You’d presumably brought a -- a few personal possessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: I -- I don’t re -- don’t really recall.</span> <span id="s546">It couldn’t have been much.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: No diamonds.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It couldn’t have been much.</span> <span id="s549">I didn’t even have a winter coat, and it was December, or no, the end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And I assume that the malaria meant you were really in very poor health?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s552">A-As I say, ma -- that was my last malaria attack, in Bermuda, and after that I took two -- twice I went through the medications for malaria.</span> <span id="s553">I should remember the name, it sta -- it started with A, but I don’t.</span> <span id="s554">In Mount Vernon I -- I didn’t sit around long.</span> <span id="s555">I went to New York and got scared by the traffic.</span> <span id="s556">I got -- couple of times I got marooned in the middle of a street, and I had to learn to dodge automobiles.</span> <span id="s557">I hadn't seen so many automobiles in a lifetime.</span> <span id="s558">And I spent time in the big stores, just lo-looking what was going on there.</span> <span id="s559">And decided to visit Washington.</span> <span id="s560">I, at that time, was of the opinion that the man who had given me the affidavit, and who lived in Hollywood wanted me to come over there, but I got a letter telling me more or less that if I found something to do in the east, we would meet early enough.</span> <span id="s561">I had never met the man, his name was Edgar Berliner.</span> <span id="s562">So the day I got that letter, I took the train to Washington, where I had an address of an attorney, I found out he’s quite a prominent attorney, to -- with whom to get in contact.</span> <span id="s563">He was -- his wife was the sister of the man who had given me the affidavit.</span> <span id="s564">And this was a time where Washington was crowded with people working on the war effort, and if it hadn’t been for that recommendation, I would never have been able to get a room in a hotel.</span> <span id="s565">But they were nice to me, I had dinner there, and the lady, Louise King, took me around Washington by car and to Mount Vernon and to the cemet -- cemetery, and to a concert, and showed me the -- where the museums were, and I was on my own for a couple of days, during which I found an employment agency, and applied for jobs.</span> <span id="s566">The man sent me immediately to two places where -- where peoples were -- were asked for and in both places I evidently made a good enough impression that he afterwards told me I could select which one.</span> <span id="s567">And I did not.</span> <span id="s568">I went that evening to have dinner with the Kings, and told them what had been happening.</span> <span id="s569">When -- Milton went to the phone and came back and he said his brother’s insurance agency al-also needed a bookkeeper or accountant, and gave me the address, I should go there the next day.</span> <span id="s570">Naturally, that was a place to go.</span> <span id="s571">Even so the pay, as I afterwards found out, was very low for American purposes.</span> <span id="s572">But being recommended, I went.</span> <span id="s573">I found a room on 16th Street, 1827 16th Street, and I rented it, then went back to New York and got my stuff and started working a f -- a few days in December.</span> <span id="s574">It was an insurance agency and there were -- it was interesting for me because the bookkeeper, an old lady, had kept her records for the past couple of years at least, on pieces of paper and I had to put it together to be accepted by an -- a CPA.</span> <span id="s575">I forgot to mention that before being accepted by these people as employee, they sent me to their CPA for an interview, and I ga -- I was friendly with this CPA for quite a number of years.</span> <span id="s576">He was a -- an older man who was the head of the CPA organization in Washington.</span> <span id="s577">Not only that, he was a director of the Franklin Accounting School, where both his sons -- is -- both his son-in-laws had been put through accounting before they could marry his daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: At that time you would be planning or hoping to train as a CPA?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s580">I had no intention to do something else but accounting and naturally to write -- to find out how to become a CPA, especially after the experience in Africa, where I was unable to stay, to some extent also, because they wanted a -- what they in England called a chartered accountant for the diamond mine.</span> <span id="s581">I also registered in the university in Washington.</span> <span id="s582">It took a -- I went from one university to the other because this was a time where all of the students were studying under the -- what they call the war.</span> <span id="s583">They didn’t pay there.</span> <span id="s584">I was the only paying student in American University and that university was favorable for me because the man who took care of foreign students was a former German and he was helpful to me in my studies for the years I was at the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So every local college was -- university was full of G.I. bills?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: G.I. [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s587">I mean, they were not interested in a paying student, but this man, Professor Correlle, was happy to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And that was at American University?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: At American University.</span> <span id="s590">At that time the university had classes in some half fallen down buildings on F Street in northwest Washington.</span> <span id="s591">And I naturally registered for evening classes, where they had interesting lecturers who came to the most part from government and really knew their -- knew what they had to teach.</span> <span id="s592">Especially interesting was one course on income tax, which was a course more or less on income tax avoiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: How f -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: But that took awhile -- took awhile to get to that.</span> <span id="s595">The other thing I did after arriving and getting settled, I registered at Arthur Murray’s, because I didn’t know anybody and thought well, at least I could dance, I might meet some people there and at least get a little bit more social.</span> <span id="s596">Because all I knew to talk about was my stay in Africa, and who was interested in that?</span> <span id="s597">People were only interested in the news with Walter Winchell.</span> <span id="s598">The other thing I did, after a few days I found that the Jewish Center was only a couple of blocks from my room, and I went there and found a few other young men who had come from Germany, and got introduced to them, and we had a -- had a circle of friends from there, with whom we got together.</span> <span id="s599">We had a poker round and I attended some social functions at the Jewish Center on 16th Street.</span> <span id="s600">Through the friends, I got into a Jewish thr -- a circle of young women of marriageable age, who were ready to party.</span> <span id="s601">We had hayrides, and every few months a wedding, which was new to me all, and I realized that I had to be careful, because it was time to keep a distance from these young ladies, until I -- unless I would be serious.</span> <span id="s602">Having nothing but a job, naturally to think of getting settled down in a marriage was tough.</span> <span id="s603">In 1948, I attended a dance in, I’d say, a Jewish Community Center, and met my future wife.</span> <span id="s604">It was [indecipherable] my friends were all there and after the dance I took Lillian to a bar just to talk and have a drink and afterwards walked her home, which took hours, because she lived in a women’s building on the other side of the Potomac.</span> <span id="s605">And naturally, we walked there, and afterwards I walked back at night, for hours again, to 16 Street.</span> <span id="s606">And I dated this young lady every -- whenever I could.</span> <span id="s607">She made sure that I on our dates, spend whatever money I had so that I couldn’t date anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Was it love at first sight, do you think?</span> <span id="s609">Do you remem --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: I wondered if you were taken with her as soon as you saw her, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s615">This is an interview with Frederick Wohl, conducted by Margaret West, on February the 17th, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland.</span> <span id="s616">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Frederick Wohl on November the 22nd, 1989.</span> <span id="s617">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s618">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: -- to go back to my work, I walked every morning from my residence to the office, stopped for a cup of -- for breakfast at a little Greek restaurant and it was tough to make ends meet with the pay I received at that time, which was originally quoted as 50 dollars a week, but m -- no, it was quoted as 200 a month, 200 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s620">Now -- no, was 50 dollars a week, but when it came to payday, I was corrected, it was less because of Social Security and health insurance, and as I say, I -- after a few months, asked for a raise.</span> <span id="s621">I got a small raise, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s622">But they mainly said, why don’t you go and sell insurance?</span> <span id="s623">And I took a course in insurance that was given by the Aetna Insurance Company, a correspondence course, and got a license to sell insurance in the District of Columbia.</span> <span id="s624">I remember the first insurance I sold was on [indecipherable] a lady in the rooming house where I stayed had been given by one of her admirers.</span> <span id="s625">I was rather timid at that time -- time.</span> <span id="s626">I couldn’t talk about anything interesting to people, because -- as I say again, who was interested in -- in Africa, or in Cyprus?</span> <span id="s627">I had nothing much to say about America, only that I was glad to be there and it was interesting and I was going to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: What about your bond with Lillian?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: That we -- I -- we continued to date and in 1948, October 31st, my friend Bernie Friedberg got married to his wife Charlotte.</span> <span id="s630">And that night, on the -- on the way home to her place, I popped the question and got accepted, which got me so excited that after I had left her, on my home, I got violently seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: On your long walk?</span> <span id="s632">On your long walk back?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Ho-How old were you both then?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I was about 35 -- 30 -- yeah, 34 and a half, and she was six years younger.</span> <span id="s636">I remember she had given me her age, I think wa -- one year younger than she actually was.</span> <span id="s637">I met, during the -- that time, her sister and brother-in-law, who lived in Washington, and who were very hospitable, and as I assumed, they were glad that Lillian had a boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Tell me about her family and background and religion and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: And they were -- they were Jewish, not -- not too religious, and the m-mother lived in New York, the father just died about that time, I never met him.</span> <span id="s640">And it took awhile til I met her mother, who lived in a -- a suburb of New York, west New York, in a small apartment.</span> <span id="s641">It was all, naturally, a new experience for me, even the driving in somebody el -- with somebody else to -- to New York, at a time when there was n-no superhighway.</span> <span id="s642">And it took nearly a day to get where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s643">My parents, in the meantime, had arrived in the States, and they were not very happy with my getting engaged.</span> <span id="s644">My parents, to some extent I think, had expected I -- I would make a good living in America and that I would be able to take care of them.</span> <span id="s645">Seeing that that was not going to be the case, our relationship after my marriage was a little bit estranged, and they made arrangements to go back to Africa.</span> <span id="s646">My sister and her husband were still in Tanganyika, and they indicated that there was work for my father and they would be standing by them.</span> <span id="s647">They left New York a few weeks after the birth of my first daughter, that was Jackie.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Tell me the full name of -- well, this is a good time to tell me the full name of both of your daughters and their dates of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: It’s Jacqueline Diane Wohl, who is by now Tinney, but she uses her maiden name professionally, she’s an attorney with her own office.</span> <span id="s650">My younger daughter is Valerie Ann Wohl, who is single after a very short marriage.</span> <span id="s651">And who also uses her maiden name.</span> <span id="s652">She is a physician.</span> <span id="s653">Both my daughters live in Tucson, Arizona.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And what was the -- what -- what were their birthdates, or approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: What’s your birthdate, Jackie?</span> <span id="s656">It’s 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A2: June 26th.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A2: June 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: June 26, and June 27 is when m-my second wedding.</span> <span id="s661">And Valerie’s birthday is March 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A2: May --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A2: May 17th, 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: May 17th, yeah, ’52.</span> <span id="s666">Going back to the time of the engagement, I found that not only was I not making much money at that time, but also Lillian, who worked for the Navy as an clerk, had not much of an income, but also had some debt, which she kept secret from me and paid off during the first month of our marriage.</span> <span id="s667">We see how --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So how did you find out about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Afterwards.</span> <span id="s670">I think that that was mainly her bridal outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: I wondered to what extent you shared values in life and whether that was part of the reason for your getting along well together?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Getting who?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Well, I’m interested in knowing whether you had shared values in the way you approached life, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No.</span> <span id="s675">I had, during my travels always fallen into some kind of existence which was interesting and where I enjoyed life to -- naturally to a limited extent, whatever, but I don’t recall that I was ever, let’s say, unhappy with what I was doing.</span> <span id="s676">And getting into the accounting and insurance in Washington was no exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You sound resilient and optimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Oh yeah, I -- I did a study about insurance, but I took a first life insurance course with the -- an agent of the Penn Life, and even sold a couple of life insurance policies.</span> <span id="s679">I don’t know whether they’re still in force, because at that time a commission was only continued by the company for 10 years, and the commission was paid to the office I wait -- I worked for.</span> <span id="s680">I learned a few [indecipherable] if -- if my selling insurance is concerned, and had let a -- Bill had [indecipherable] with my name and made sure that whatever insurance I sold was going to be my business.</span> <span id="s681">It can’t be done any more today.</span> <span id="s682">I found that out by experience, but I eventually built up a nice book of business in spite of the fact that I just could not go and do any cold calls, as they called, for -- to buy -- to sell insurance, unless I had a recommendation or referral.</span> <span id="s683">I was not courageous enough to get in and talk, besides the fact that I didn’t need any -- didn’t know enough insurance -- of insurance, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: But you -- you enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s686">I had developed the kind of philosophy that if I sell you insurance, when I leave you’re better off than you were when I came in, and that kept me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Where did you live after your marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: My brother-in-law managed to get us an apartment in Arlington at North Taft Street.</span> <span id="s689">It was a small apartment without air conditioning, so if we wanted, we kept doors and windows open, not only for our apartment, but the other apartment on the same floor.</span> <span id="s690">We’d got friendly with these people, which was a good thing because they had a car, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s691">I took the bus every morning from Arlington Boulevard into town.</span> <span id="s692">And Washington suburbs at that time were still such a friendly surrounding that sometimes even people would stop and pick me up, gave me a ride into the city.</span> <span id="s693">You couldn’t do that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And that’s where the girls would go to school, in Arlington?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s696">[indecipherable] we lived not too long in Arlington.</span> <span id="s697">Oh, let me go back to our wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: This is -- is -- somewhere I have a picture of the wedding party, which was my mother-in-law, a nephew of hers who was a policeman in Washington, my sister-in-law and brother-in-law and their little daughter Andrea, and Margo was -- I think Margo was there, yes.</span> <span id="s700">My parents and my brother-in-law, with their little boy, and a girlfriend of Lillian’s and how I met who was the second rabbi I had talked to about getting married.</span> <span id="s701">The first rabbi, whose name I won’t mention, was too business-like for me at the interview, and Rabbi Metz was very understanding of the fact that I was not very religious, neither was, actually, Lillian.</span> <span id="s702">And we -- we got married in his study, in his home.</span> <span id="s703">And I was so little knowledge about, at that time, that without thinking of anything I invited the rabbi for dinner, for the wedding dinner, and naturally he didn’t come.</span> <span id="s704">Another guest at the dinner was cousin Joe.</span> <span id="s705">That was a distant relative, and if I -- I should remember his full name, because he was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Sanders?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Sanders?</span> <span id="s709">Joe Sanders?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yeah, Joe Sanders.</span> <span id="s711">Joe Sanders was also married into the Berliner family, and was an important man in that family.</span> <span id="s712">You see, there was one Berliner who invented the Gramophone record and he was not a poor man.</span> <span id="s713">His brother, Joseph, started the Gramophone company in Germany, and he had been helpful to us after the Nazis had started.</span> <span id="s714">And when Emile Berliner, the inventor died, his widow kept an apar -- had an apartment in the hote -- in a hotel here, and kept the family together.</span> <span id="s715">It was a b -- a big family because they had brought over about 90 people from Europe and I was not one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: When did those people come?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Was it early in the 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yeah, in 1935 - 19 thir -- see, the Nazis started in ’33, and whoever had foresight -- and very few had, actually, would get out, or whoever had relatives, and I met quite a few of these fellow relatives, but they all [indecipherable] clear for me, that I was not one of that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Because they were a very jealous crowd of each other.</span> <span id="s722">They are jealous of each other, see, and I was an outsider who had arrived later, after the war.</span> <span id="s723">And even so, I had arrived with the help of the -- of one of the Berliners.</span> <span id="s724">The rest were very -- were very nice, but distant.</span> <span id="s725">Only the ones who were about my age, the young -- young, we were friendly to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Well, you had some family help, but it sounds very much as if you built your own life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s728">I -- I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s729">Once I had found out that I had to ask for a raise, and that without being pushed, nobody in America would think to increase your pay, and I wasn’t used to that.</span> <span id="s730">But I kept going and we had, as I say, we had a nice wedding, with a limited number of people, and moved to an apartment in Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: How do you -- how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: After [indecipherable] moved, we lived in Virginia for awhile, and after Jackie was born, we moved to Maryland, to Kaywood Garden.</span> <span id="s733">Was a small apartment and when the second girl arrived, we had a -- we got a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s734">And we stayed quite a few years in Kaywood.</span> <span id="s735">From there also I took the bus into town to my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: I wanted to ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: -- and interrupt to ask, you had done all that traveling --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: -- which you did out of necessity, Greece, Cyprus --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s742">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: -- Dar Es Salaam.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: But how do you look back on those early years of marriage?</span> <span id="s746">It sounds as if your wedding was very joyful, and that must have been a very happy stage in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well that, yes, it was, with exception of the strained relations to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: But did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: But that --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: -- did that feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: -- we had a good -- pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: -- and -- did that relationship heal with time?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s754">Wonderf -- when my parents decided to go back to Africa, because my sister and her husband promised to more or less take care of them there, things improved.</span> <span id="s755">And so later on there were times when we had to support not only my parents, but also my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s756">And living in Kaywood was not very luxurious, but the children had decent schools.</span> <span id="s757">Did they have schools?</span> <span id="s758">Yeah.</span> <span id="s759">And we made ends meet and actually enjoyed life as well as we could.</span> <span id="s760">We joined the Jewish community there, and they -- they fa -- more or less fished me out to become active, first as a secretary of a men’s club, then as president of the men’s club, and then as president of the congregation 1959 and ’60.</span> <span id="s761">During that time this group built a synagogue and sold the synagogue because p-people moved in other directions.</span> <span id="s762">They built a second synagogue and I stayed member there, now about 55 years that I’ve been a member of that congregation.</span> <span id="s763">But we have to go back to the start.</span> <span id="s764">There came one day when I asked for a raise, and they just said, well, sell insurance, you’ll make commissions.</span> <span id="s765">And I went back -- no, I had met a man who was working for the Group Health association in their office, and he needed -- he was working as chief accountant for Group Health association, which was starting at that time in downtown Washington, and he had an opening.</span> <span id="s766">But they -- the only way I could get in there was through an employment agency.</span> <span id="s767">I went back to the agency I knew, and through them got an appointment to Group Health, and I told my employer s-sorry, I can make more money there, and I did.</span> <span id="s768">But I kept my insurance business, which was tiny, with the pe -- the people who had been working, and kept in touch with it, so that way I worked for -- as assistant chief accountant for Group Health, for a little bit over a year.</span> <span id="s769">Was interesting work because we had -- I -- I found that the physicians had to be idealists, who started Group Health.</span> <span id="s770">I saw it from the paychecks, which were -- which I had to make out.</span> <span id="s771">And on the other hand, the treasurer was a man from Trinidad who, after seeing my history, for months wouldn’t talk to me, because I had been heading a black workforce, and he was black.</span> <span id="s772">But eventually he got over it and we got quite friendly.</span> <span id="s773">He is -- became a CPA in Arlington afterwards.</span> <span id="s774">After about one year, the accountant for Wolfe and Cohen, the Insurance agency where I had been, called me and asked why I had left.</span> <span id="s775">I told him, it’s just a matter of finances, and that I had been married, and -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: -- continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frederick Wohl.</span> <span id="s777">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: He asked me to come to his office, the accountant of the insurance agency, and we were talking.</span> <span id="s779">I had been friendly with him while I was working there, and he asked me under what conditions I would go back there.</span> <span id="s780">I was surprised, even though I’d kept friendly with the owners, I had been to their offices to attend to my insurance business every now and then.</span> <span id="s781">I asked for a quite healthy salary and for time to build up my own business, and to my surprise, they accepted it.</span> <span id="s782">And I went back, and I had some good years there.</span> <span id="s783">I learned more about the insurance business and I got registered as agent in Maryland, which was an interesting experience, because the person who ti -- who supervised the examination in Baltimore had what you would call an open hand, and was disappointed when I just shook his hand when I left.</span> <span id="s784">But I got my Maryland license, and worked pretty hard.</span> <span id="s785">We lived in Kaywood, on the lookout for eventually finding a house.</span> <span id="s786">And I had during that time been in contact with an attorney who took care of claims to the German government.</span> <span id="s787">This is -- this was of great help to me because the first payment I got for them was used when -- to seriously look after a house.</span> <span id="s788">And we lived from, I guess it must have been ’42 - ’43 - ’53, in Silver Spring [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Mr. Wohl, tell me what it would have been for.</span> <span id="s790">Would it have been for your pharmacy business, the reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: No, that reparations had only to do with me personally.</span> <span id="s792">It was my interruption of studies, it was my unable to be -- to find work, and it was afterwards a kind of German Social Security.</span> <span id="s793">The -- ma-many refugees got payment from Germany, and nobody would talk about it til it was an actual fact, because there was the mentality that if I tell somebody else and he does the same kind of application that I have done, maybe it would influence my a-application.</span> <span id="s794">But I found out that I did no worse and no better than other refugees, and I got a -- a rent from age -- I think it was age 65, from Germany, which helped us quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: And what -- what percentage of refugees do you think received this support?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Whoever could get it an-and found the right channels.</span> <span id="s797">You see, I -- I happened to get to a -- through some people i-in the States, through an attorney in Frankfurt who was pretty active in that, and who afterwards received the first nine months of my pension, which was his contract.</span> <span id="s798">And I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s799">I was an optimist.</span> <span id="s800">I thought, I’ll live longer than all these people, and I’m s -- I’m still surprised that this actually happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: As a f -- as parents, did you think it was important to give your daughters any kind of religious upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did you go to -- oh, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: You see, we belonged to the -- in Mount Rainier to the congregation.</span> <span id="s805">My wife was that religious and I got that way, too, that we attended Friday night services, and sometimes Saturday.</span> <span id="s806">We went to the high holidays, and as I said I took office in the congregation, and enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s807">I was not very knowledgeable in religious things, but I had the help of our first permanent rabbi -- oh no, the second permanent rabbi, who was brought in from Europe.</span> <span id="s808">He was from Vienna and he had been a rabbi for the British army in Frankfurt before they brou -- took him here.</span> <span id="s809">He and his wife were very great friends, and I was the one who had to interview this rabbi for his job, and we stayed friends even after he had left Washington, and he was kind of a father figure for me.</span> <span id="s810">Rabbi Weinberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Did you observe -- did you -- any dietary rules in your home --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: -- o-or would it just be going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: -- on the high holidays.</span> <span id="s815">My wife family had kept a kosher home, so we started out with that in mind, but we are quite liberal by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And what about your daughters, in turn?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: My daughters went to relig -- to the religious school, and to the congregation and were confirmed, and they have much more religion than I ever had.</span> <span id="s818">Jackie and her family, even though her husband is not Jewish, b-belong to a congregation in Arizona, in Tucson, where on the high holidays, she usually plays the violin at the services.</span> <span id="s819">And my younger daughter, also re -- at l -- goes at least to high holiday services.</span> <span id="s820">But they know where they come from and where they belong, to a much greater extent than I did.</span> <span id="s821">And my late wife would have been very happy to see how her grandchildren got a real Jewish upbringing.</span> <span id="s822">They ma -- Jackie has two daughters, my other daughter is alone.</span> <span id="s823">Well, where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, how was it that both of them have settled in Arizona?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Well, Jackie got friendly with a young man eventually, who was working in a government committee in Washington and who came from Phoenix.</span> <span id="s826">They decided to get married and moved to Tucson, where he went back to university.</span> <span id="s827">And Jackie got her law degree here from the American University, and she passed the necessary examinations in Arizona, and that was it.</span> <span id="s828">Why my younger daughter, for her practical year in the medical study, went to where her sister lived, and stayed there afterwards.</span> <span id="s829">Fortunately they are friendly with each other, and my younger -- younger daughter enjoys her nieces, which is good.</span> <span id="s830">So they are both on their own, and after end of their studies, did not need any support from us.</span> <span id="s831">So we could live a little bit more comfortable.</span> <span id="s832">And we had the nice circle of friends from the old -- friends from the po -- poker round.</span> <span id="s833">There are only two brothers left -- no, two brothers and one more, yeah, there are three of the-them left with whom I am in contact, and the one on whose wedding we got engaged, is still a very dear friend, even with my second wife.</span> <span id="s834">My business went all right til it got too big for the agency I was working with, and they were unhappy.</span> <span id="s835">I had an assistant in their accounting department and now automation came in and I helped them to get automated to some extent, and they -- we had long discussions about computers, because it was too -- too difficult and while I was on my first visit to my parents in Germany, they decided on a computer system.</span> <span id="s836">When I came, I naturally had to agree with it, and [indecipherable] it to some extent, so that I could live, that I could continue.</span> <span id="s837">But they then refused to give me help in the work, because the computers did the work, and as a result, I didn’t have enough time for my own insurance business, and I had to consider leaving.</span> <span id="s838">I left and went with a life insurance agency who looked to it that I got a decent up -- decent education in life insurance, which was important to me, it was important for them because it -- life insurance company then paid part of my salary, for the first couple of years.</span> <span id="s839">I, from then on, put more emphasis in life insurance, which was difficult for me, cause I did not have the right connections, and eventually only -- only sold life insurance.</span> <span id="s840">But I kept --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s842">What do you mean you didn’t have the right connections?</span> <span id="s843">Other people would come to the business with some [indecipherable] connection --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: I si -- I see where big companies have their insurance agents who not only do their life insurance nowadays, but also take care of -- in -- advise on investments, which I tried to do at one time, but that year the stock market went down and I gave up on that type of advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: You chose the wrong time.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s847">I see today from my stepson, who is in the life insurance business, how the agents go on -- go after big accounts, not small homeowners.</span> <span id="s848">The homeowners have to look out for themselves to find an agent, unless somebody just happens to call them.</span> <span id="s849">And that helped me, to a certain extent, that couple of attorneys who were in the real estate settlement business, would call me whenever somebody bought a house and did not bring an insurance connection to the settlement.</span> <span id="s850">They would pick up the phone and give me the name and address, and say oh, I had a customer.</span> <span id="s851">That were -- they were very good friends and without them I would not have made a success the way I did.</span> <span id="s852">Naturally, after selling these people their fire insurance for their new home, I would at least try to sell them life insurance also, to cover their mortgage, or automobile insurance, or whatever.</span> <span id="s853">And I had over 400 accounts, and I had my own little office in Silver Spring, which also has a story because after leaving Wolfe and Cohen, I went to that life agency, and doing their accounts, I found that they were drawing too much money from the business, and I had warned them, but they continued.</span> <span id="s854">And after three years, I think, they were unable to keep me because they didn’t have money for my salary, and I had to look around what to do.</span> <span id="s855">One of the lawyers with whom I was friendly, had to have an office in Silver Spring, because for settlements in Montgomery county, there had to be an office in Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s856">So he -- he and an associate had rented an office in the Perpetual Building, which was very seldom used.</span> <span id="s857">They would come there for an hour for a settlement and then -- otherwise that place was empty, and I got it, as a helper, I paid -- I -- I worked there, first without paying a penny rent, or t -- even telephone.</span> <span id="s858">It cost -- it was no additional charge for them, but afterwards I insisted, and my business grew that I had to take a part time help, and when that was -- when it was too much for this, I associated with an agency in Washington, who were well known, and where I had a contract for 10 years, which was satisfactory, but the owner of that agency was not a very stable character, as I found out after years, and in my -- at the end of the eighth year of my contract, he went out of business, and I had to take my accounts somewhere else.</span> <span id="s859">I associated with another agency in Silver spr -- no, here in Rockville, and got a three year contract.</span> <span id="s860">I was older at that time, and I didn’t think any further.</span> <span id="s861">After three years, they took my general insurance business over, and I was left with the life insurance alone, which was fine with me.</span> <span id="s862">And I worked til the beginning of ninet -- of 2003, in the later years from home.</span> <span id="s863">In two -- when my wife got sick in April 2003, I stopped, and that was the end of my professional life.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: You know, I’d like to have you comment -- and I don’t know what your thoughts are, but on the impact you think there was on your life and thinking of your wartime experiences.</span> <span id="s865">Obviously there was a profound impact on career, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: My -- my first wife actually was not too much interested in it.</span> <span id="s867">She was interested in the children’s education.</span> <span id="s868">She realized I had to go out in the evenings, visiting customers.</span> <span id="s869">And thank God she made a good job of the education of my daughters.</span> <span id="s870">We got along well, naturally had our little differences now and then, but we were married for 42 years.</span> <span id="s871">She became sick, she had to go on dialysis for two and a half years, and died, unexpected, but naturally on dial -- dialysis people -- you have -- you have to expect something.</span> <span id="s872">But two and a half years was not expected.</span> <span id="s873">There are people who are on dialysis much longer.</span> <span id="s874">It was a sad time, because i -- the two of us, after the daughters were married, had been able to trav -- do quite a bit of traveling, and even when she was on dialysis, we traveled to Germany, we traveled to Bermuda, we traveled to Aruba, where she could get treatment.</span> <span id="s875">You had to make arrangements for the treatment, but we enjoyed life as well as we could, and we had a lot of pleasure, actually, from our daughters, whom we visited at least once a year, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Did you get involved in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: From the beginning of living in the Kaywood Garden in Mount Rainier, I joined the democratic party, which helped me in business, and I became in Silver Spring, precinct chairman and did as much or as little as I could for -- i-in party work, but at least I was connected, and met people.</span> <span id="s878">I kept busy with that, and with the congrega -- the Jewish congregation and with B’nai B’rith, and especially with the Masonic Lodge.</span> <span id="s879">My father had helped me to get into the lodge here in Washington and I’ve been there now 55 years, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: With -- with Freemasons, what are the -- are there people of every religious faith there?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: The Masonic Lodge is open to everybody who has some kind of religion, but the Catholic church is unfriendly, let’s say.</span> <span id="s882">There were Catholics in there.</span> <span id="s883">There are lodge -- lodges -- by now, I belong to two Masonic Lodges, one in the district and one in Maryland.</span> <span id="s884">And there are lodges who are [indecipherable] Jewish, but in general anybody who is accepted, and you have to go through ritual and examinations, is acceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s886">My question about politics was really -- I was wondering whether you felt that there was a link between your wish to be involved and your experience in Nazi Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I -- I remember having a written -- a little article in Germany that was published in a [indecipherable] as a -- a letter from -- where I told them that oh, Nazis may be big in the cities, but the general population was quite democratic.</span> <span id="s888">Naturally I was wrong, but I remember that.</span> <span id="s889">And I wasn’t active politically in Germany, no, because before leaving, I was part of a Jewish sports club in Frankfurt for the few d -- short time I was in Frankfurt, but that was about all.</span> <span id="s890">The -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s892">This is an interview with Frederick Wohl, conducted by Margaret West, on February the 17th, 2004, in Bethesda, Maryland.</span> <span id="s893">This interview is part of the United

<p><span id="s896">A: What do you mean, family history?</span> <span id="s897">We -- we lived a -- a pretty quiet life.</span> <span id="s898">[indecipherable] after we had moved to Silver Spring, where one of the aims was to give the children the best possible schools, and to live in a neighborhood where they could make friends, which was successful.</span> <span id="s899">There naturally was always the fact that I had to go and visit customers and my wife was left to educate the children, or to -- to direct their lives.</span> <span id="s900">There are many things that happened in my
