Minneapolis on June 16, 1983.</span> <span id="s5">Please tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name if it is different</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: My full name is Hinda Kibort.</span> <span id="s7">The Jewish name is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: When and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I was born in Kovno, Lithuania, on April 4, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: What were your parents’, grandparents’ and great-grandparents’ names and where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My parents were both born in Latvia.</span> <span id="s12">And my grandparents’ names were Leib Danzig and Rachel Danzig.</span> <span id="s13">The other grandparents were deceased, so I really didn’t know them, but their family name was Berman.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And do you know where your great-grandparents were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I imagine they’re all from the same area which, at that time, was part of the Russian Czarist empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My father was Charles Danziger and my mother was Ganya Berman Danziger.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What kind of work did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father was a designer.</span> <span id="s20">He worked in a big shoe factory and he was a shoe designer.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What languages were spoken at your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: As my parents came from Riga, they spoke fluently not only Yiddish, but also Russian and German.</span> <span id="s23">And as it happened, in Lithuania when I was growing up, we spoke German as children; and then later on we switched more to Yiddish but I grew up almost tri-lingual, because as soon as I started school, or I had interaction on the outside, I also learned to speak Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Speaking of school, did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span> <span id="s25">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Up until the year 1933, I attended school in a German private school in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s27">But at that time, there was no formal Jewish education except for one hour of religion studies during the week which included some biblical story time, or some other studies that were geared to children.</span> <span id="s28">But after 1933, I entered a Hebrew high school.</span> <span id="s29">All the subjects were taught in Hebrew, and simultaneously we had to learn also Lithuanian, so this was almost like a bi-lingual school.</span> <span id="s30">And there, of course, we studied intensively Jewish history, Chumash, which means the Torah.</span> <span id="s31">We read directly from the Torah -- from the five books of Moses.</span> <span id="s32">And there, of course, I received a total Jewish background.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What events were you aware of from the mid 1930’s to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: In 1933, I was still in a German school, and my teachers were mostly imports from Germany.</span> <span id="s35">At that time they were either recalled or wanted to go back into Hitler Germany.</span> <span id="s36">There was a lot of tension starting from January, 1933, on, and by April the Jewish parents who had children in that school boycotted the school and all five of us who were in that same class were taken out, and there was a choice to be made by the parents whether we should finish our education in the public or private school.</span> <span id="s37">All these five parents opted for a private school.</span> <span id="s38">We had an excellent Hebrew school in Lithuania, in my second hometown of Siauliai.</span> <span id="s39">And as we stopped going to school about April -- spring break -- we had intensive training in the Hebrew subjects, and in fall we started the next grade, fully aware that we would have a little harder time, but then we continued with all the subjects being taught in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s40">It was a secular school.</span> <span id="s41">It was not a religious school.</span> <span id="s42">And as you asked before, religious subjects were taught as part of Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Was your family secular or religious in practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I have not really known too many families in Lithuania that were so totally assimilated as to not have any religious ties to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s45">I know of very few, maybe only a couple of households, for instance, that didn’t keep kosher, that did not have any Jewish traditions in their home about holidays and so on.</span> <span id="s46">The only Jewish faith that I was familiar with was the orthodox line, because we did not have any reform Jews in Lithuania as well as in other eastern European countries, I’m sure, and the conservative movement was totally unknown to us, so everybody really was orthodox and we lived by orthodox tradition.</span> <span id="s47">My father was not particularly religious, even though we did not do on the outside, for instance, things that are not done on the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s48">He would never smoke outside or offend any other Jew by doing something that is not “proper.”</span> <span id="s49">But at home we were a little more lax.</span> <span id="s50">We never rode on Shabbat, but then on the other hand, there was no public transportation in that town of 45,000 or so.</span> <span id="s51">Wherever anybody wanted to go, we always had to go on foot anyway.</span> <span id="s52">Our standard of living was such that there were only two, three private cars in the whole town that we knew of.</span> <span id="s53">Horse and buggy transportation was the thing of the day, so it was really not very hard to keep all these rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How about communications?</span> <span id="s55">Were there newspapers?</span> <span id="s56">Radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: We had marvelous Jewish educational materials all around.</span> <span id="s58">We had newspapers, the Zionist-leanings and then also the Yiddish newspapers that were more leftist, that did not espouse any Zionist ideas in their writing.</span> <span id="s59">We had several papers, really.</span> <span id="s60">We did not have our own Yiddish radio station.</span> <span id="s61">That was, I think, fairly new.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you know about “news?”</span> <span id="s63">About things that were happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: We knew, of course.</span> <span id="s65">We had radios, we had the papers, and we were very involved politically --the Jewish community -- because even in the Hebrew high school that I attended, we were very familiar with all the Zionist factions at the time, and there were really many fights, even among us kids.</span> <span id="s66">Our principal was more of the Paole Zion, the leftist group.</span> <span id="s67">There were some who were Revisionists, which were the Jabotinsky group, the one that Begin’s government is now, you know, more Rightist.</span> <span id="s68">And we had, really, quite a few heated arguments among ourselves, and so on.</span> <span id="s69">We were quite aware of things like that.</span> <span id="s70">We also had many books and circulation library.</span> <span id="s71">We had also, aside from this Jewish school that I attended -- that Hebrew high school -- we had another religious, more religious, middle school.</span> <span id="s72">We had a middle school in Yiddish -- not in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s73">We had a theater group.</span> <span id="s74">There were quite a few Jewish activities aside from regular cultural activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did you and your family have any contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Not as close friends -- as we would say today that you invite somebody to your house, or you’re very close with them.</span> <span id="s77">I did as a child when I attended the German school.</span> <span id="s78">And my mother was quite friendly with the parents of the girlfriend that I was very close with -- that was a German girl.</span> <span id="s79">Also, some of the teachers used to come to the house.</span> <span id="s80">Mother was friendly with them.</span> <span id="s81">But as a rule, the Jews were not very much a part of the general society in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s82">We were so little assimilated that I know maybe of only two homes where Lithuanian was spoken within the family.</span> <span id="s83">Usually people spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s84">And if they tended to speak another language, it was either Russian or German, but never Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s85">We were totally not integrated.</span> <span id="s86">It was very much unlike in western Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q Before the outbreak of the war, did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s89">I was only eleven years old when I was taken out of that particular school and at that time, we had already heard all these slogans, and all these things the way they happened even in Germany -- about the Jews and about “you so-and-so and such-and-such” and you were not allowed to participate in sports activities in that school at the time.</span> <span id="s90">Of course we were aware of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Let’s go back to you were taken out of school.</span> <span id="s92">Were all the Jewish children taken out of that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: As far as I know, in my class there were the five of us, and all the parents decided that on the same time, after spring break, that that will be it.</span> <span id="s94">We will not be exposed to this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s95">And of course they totally boycotted.</span> <span id="s96">We knew what was going on in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What kind of things were going on in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: For instance you started to hear the same slogans as they started to do in Germany about “race relations.”</span> <span id="s99">We knew that we are sort of always being pushed aside.</span> <span id="s100">The students were not discouraged.</span> <span id="s101">The ones that are anti-Semite normally were not discouraged, not to hurt somebody’s feelings and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s102">We could feel that!</span> <span id="s103">And as I said, during school there were some activities and so on.</span> <span id="s104">And most, of course, it was the parents’ idea that we should not support the German school.</span> <span id="s105">That was very logical.</span> <span id="s106">Also we had people who came from Germany in the ‘30s.</span> <span id="s107">There were several who had either family ties or otherwise tried to escape out of Germany and landed in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s108">So we knew more than that.</span> <span id="s109">I had a girlfriend who came from Berlin, and when I was in tenth grade, she joined the same Hebrew high school.</span> <span id="s110">And from her, of course, we knew what was happening in Germany on a direct basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What were the kind of things that she related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I know that they were quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s113">They had had, I think, a wholesale fur business in Berlin.</span> <span id="s114">The father’s business was taken away.</span> <span id="s115">She did not elaborate.</span> <span id="s116">I really don’t know the circumstances -- the way he died -- but I know they came without the father.</span> <span id="s117">They were three daughters and the mother.</span> <span id="s118">She told us how they had to leave their apartment and they had to give up the business and how hard it was, and they finally found that they could leave because they had cousins in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s119">Then they came to live in Lithuania, and the mother reestablished herself with her family, but the father did not come from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Did you have relatives living outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Only in Latvia.</span> <span id="s122">And those family members I barely knew.</span> <span id="s123">I only visited there a couple of times -- into Latvia -- because travel was very expensive for us, and my parents had their priorities.</span> <span id="s124">My father lived in a salary and we all attended private schools.</span> <span id="s125">There were three children in our family.</span> <span id="s126">And it was very expensive to travel even though both countries were very small.</span> <span id="s127">For instance, a visa cost so much per person.</span> <span id="s128">You had to pay for all these things aside from the passport and stuff.</span> <span id="s129">Up till the age of fifteen, children could travel on the parent’s passport and visa, so up until the age of fifteen, I was twice with my family in Latvia -- in Riga.</span> <span id="s130">Otherwise, I just didn’t know them unless they came and visited sometimes in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Do you know what became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I know exactly.</span> <span id="s133">I refigured before.</span> <span id="s134">There were 28 people in the immediate family -- aside from my mother -- that was lost because of Hitler -- who were killed.</span> <span id="s135">Both my grandparents, uncles and aunts and first cousins, they did not survive.</span> <span id="s136">I have only one uncle who is still alive.</span> <span id="s137">He came out of the Soviet Union several years ago and he lives now in Israel.</span> <span id="s138">He had lost a wife and two very beautiful children.</span> <span id="s139">He has remarried after the war, and there is one daughter who is with him now in Israel, and his second wife and his new daughter whom I don’t even know yet, because they got here after our last visit to Israel.</span> <span id="s140">And I have one cousin alive who is now in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What age were you at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I was nineteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: (Sighs) May I go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s145">Because it was not directly that we got the Germans into Lithuania in 1941, but we had an interim year that sealed our fate even harsher than it normally would have been, because in 1939, after Hitler and Stalin signed the non-aggression pact, I think the Russians were so lulled into security.</span> <span id="s146">They tore a part of Poland into their orbit, and parts are still, you know, under the Soviet rule.</span> <span id="s147">And I think that by 1940 -- in summer, 1940 -- they felt still so secure, that they decided to come over and take over the whole three Baltic states, because they wanted more outlet to the Baltic sea.</span> <span id="s148">They had only Leningrad on the northern part.</span> <span id="s149">And just very suddenly in June, 1940 the Russians marched into Lithuania.</span> <span id="s150">It was a revolution, a bloodless revolution in the country.</span> <span id="s151">The Lithuanian government was overthrown.</span> <span id="s152">There was a total change in the regime.</span> <span id="s153">I had just graduated the year before.</span> <span id="s154">I was in my first year at the University, and I remember that immediately our education changed.</span> <span id="s155">The whole system changed.</span> <span id="s156">They converted high schools into ten-year high schools to advance so many graduates.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t know why they did that.</span> <span id="s158">At the university, they imported many Russian professors specifically to teach the history of Communism and of the Bolshevik party.</span> <span id="s159">The government was taken over within a week or so.</span> <span id="s160">Our president at that time escaped to the United States.</span> <span id="s161">He later died here in the ‘50s.</span> <span id="s162">And the government was taken over by a wholly prepared ministry, secretaries of the different departments, who actually came in from the Soviet Union all ready.</span> <span id="s163">They were Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s164">Of course the military brass was arrested.</span> <span id="s165">It was sort of an upside-down affair, for the ones that were on the bottom came out on the top -- in the social status.</span> <span id="s166">There were immediately some “undesirable elements”, like all the landowners and all the military people and all the industrialists, as big or as small as they were and Jews, who were mostly in business -- but also in my hometown we had this great, big shoe factory, and the owner was a Jew who lived in the United States most of the year, but he employed very many Jewish workers, so in Siauliai we had quite a Jewish proletariat as such.</span> <span id="s167">One of the interesting things was also --and as a very young person with very liberal views, and as a Jew, who had been persecuted already at the time -- it was a very interesting feeling when we went to see how they opened the prisons, and they let all these arrested Communists out of the prison, because under the Lithuanians, the Communist party was forbidden, and any activities were punishable.</span> <span id="s168">So I remember standing there with other people, and some who had family members there, and Jews and non-Jews came with bouquets of flowers and they were sort of welcomed back into society, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">The thing is that they brought in many functionaries from the Soviet Union, and also picked up all these Jewish workers and other workers and drew them into organizational work.</span> <span id="s170">They established unions.</span> <span id="s171">They established all kinds of things that we didn’t have before.</span> <span id="s172">And quite a few Jews were active within the government.</span> <span id="s173">This was to our disadvantage later on, because when the Germans came in a year later, they were welcomed as the liberators.</span> <span id="s174">And according even to the Germans -- and they didn’t need any much encouragement -- the Lithuanians too, felt that all their troubles came because of the Jews.</span> <span id="s175">So the treatment was very harsh.</span> <span id="s176">I only want to mention that my first experience with people being sent in freight cars out of their homes in the middle of the night was under the Soviets.</span> <span id="s177">When I went to the University, I was away from home.</span> <span id="s178">I was in the city of Vilnius, Vilna.</span> <span id="s179">The town is only maybe half-an-hour away from the Soviet border -- and I remember the girlfriend that I roomed with, her parents were taken out in early June, in the middle of the night, the parents and one sister that she had.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: June of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s182">Just a week before the Germans came in, actually.</span> <span id="s183">This went on for a whole year, all these selections and all these “undesirable elements” who were being shipped out, but the actual shipping out, not arrests, but really removal of these people from Lithuania went on the last couple of weeks before the Germans came in, which was June, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">And then I saw people on trains.</span> <span id="s185">We went out in the afternoon, my friend and I and other students, and here were trains for miles and miles on so many tracks.</span> <span id="s186">And everybody asked for some warm clothing.</span> <span id="s187">They knew they were being shipped someplace into Siberia, they didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s188">The next day the trains were gone.</span> <span id="s189">It was by pure chance that my girlfriend, when she asked me to go back home to our hometown to check and see what could be rescued for her of family things that were left behind, that I happened to be in Siauliai at home when the war started, because school had let out and I had decided to work during the summer and didn’t want to go home right away, but I did it for my friend and it was lucky because I was home.</span> <span id="s190">My brother who attended the University in Kovno came back too, because school had let out.</span> <span id="s191">So our family, including my little sister who was then in the tenth grade, was together on that particular Sunday.</span> <span id="s192">I believe it was June 16, 1941.</span> <span id="s193">And the Germans marched in.</span> <span id="s194">It was just very simple.</span> <span id="s195">It was about three hours by truck from the German border that we lived.</span> <span id="s196">And we could see wounded coming, and trucks going, and a lot of motion and noise and bombardments.</span> <span id="s197">It came very suddenly.</span> <span id="s198">And this is how the war started for us -- not until 1941.</span> <span id="s199">But the harsh treatment, this disadvantage that we had, was revealed right away when the Germans came in, because the Lithuanians cooperated, not only freely, but so willingly.</span> <span id="s200">There were times later on that I actually went for help to Germans against the Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Maybe you want to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well, I could.</span> <span id="s203">(Sigh) When the Germans came in, within a week, they had taken over.</span> <span id="s204">There were a few days in the very beginning where our whole family tried to leave the city, but as I said, we didn’t have any transportation.</span> <span id="s205">So we had to do it on foot, and it was just like you see in all the documentaries, with the little bag, whatever you had, a change of clothing and stuff, just walking along highways, and jumping into ditches because the German planes were strafing, coming down very low, and people were killed on the roads, and all this whole terror in the beginning during the war.</span> <span id="s206">But we did not go very far, because the German tanks overtook us very fast.</span> <span id="s207">And the next day we returned home.</span> <span id="s208">We found everything still the way it was.</span> <span id="s209">We lived in an apartment, and at that time we were grateful that the whole family, at least, was together, even though both my brother and I didn’t have any clothing or any possessions, because we left it all in our respective dorms or rooms where we lived.</span> <span id="s210">We just came home for the weekend!</span></p> <p><span id="s211">And the Germans had this policy that was all over.</span> <span id="s212">Whenever they took over a country, whenever they came into a new place, after the Wehrmacht (the army) left, the SS came in right away.</span> <span id="s213">And they were in charge of mopping-up operations, including the “Jewish question.”</span> <span id="s214">So when the SS came in, their policy was to first of all, disrupt the Jewish community life.</span> <span id="s215">And for that, all the men were arrested about July 1, within a couple of weeks after they came in.</span> <span id="s216">And they established all the offices, the Gestapo, and the district commissariat, the military government and all these offices.</span> <span id="s217">They arrested all the Jewish men.</span> <span id="s218">They came in the middle of the night, and they came with the Lithuanians, who knew exactly where people lived.</span> <span id="s219">They arrested my father.</span> <span id="s220">And it became very dangerous from day-to-day to be outside.</span> <span id="s221">We had to wear our yellow stars.</span> <span id="s222">We had to walk in the gutters.</span> <span id="s223">We were not allowed on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s224">Everybody could command us to do whatever they wanted on the street, whether they knew us or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">There were such outrageous humiliations.</span> <span id="s226">For instance they would make you hop around in the middle of the street, or made you lie down and step on you, or they spit on you, or they tore at beards of some more devout men who wore beards and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s227">And there was always an audience around to laugh.</span> <span id="s228">All these kinds of things went on, and it was real dangerous to be outside.</span> <span id="s229">And there was an official status that was given us under the name of “untermenschen” -- sub-humans, So we really had no recourse to any law, to any government protection or anything like that.</span> <span id="s230">When my father was arrested, I found out very soon after that there was only one way, unless one had an awful lot of money for bribes.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t know any other means where people had access to the Gestapo or to any German officers, that they could free somebody.</span> <span id="s232">The main thing that I heard, though, was that if somebody was absolutely necessary to run a business, that this person was requested to be returned out of jail.</span> <span id="s233">For instance, let’s say there was a Jewish owner of a string or a rope factory, or something like this, I remember, and they couldn’t run it without him, because he was the one knowledgeable person in the place, so he really was released.</span> <span id="s234">When I found that out, I tried to get my father out.</span> <span id="s235">I went to that factory, which was being taken over at that time already by the German military, and the director of this factory was a Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s236">They put a Lithuanian in.</span> <span id="s237">I went to his office and I introduced myself, and he really harassed me terribly, because I said I wanted to ask if my father could be released for these and these reasons, and he said, “How do I know that you are the daughter?’</span> <span id="s238">And I said, “I have a passport to prove it” -- we carried internal passports in Europe for I.D. -- so then he said, “How do I know that this is a valid passport?”</span> <span id="s239">And I said, “This is a Soviet passport.’</span> <span id="s240">Well that’s all I had to say, because then he said, this he doesn’t recognize.</span> <span id="s241">I could feel that he was just being very difficult.</span> <span id="s242">Then I said -- I hadn’t been used to being a non-human at the time yet -- “Do I as a Jew don’t have any rights to be treated like a human being?”</span> <span id="s243">And he said, “Jews are not human beings.”</span> <span id="s244">It went on into this kind of a conversation.</span> <span id="s245">He got very mad and he jumped up and he threw over a carafe of water.</span> <span id="s246">There was a lot of noise, and he bodily kicked me out of the room.</span> <span id="s247">He kicked me!</span> <span id="s248">He grabbed me by the neck and he threw me out, and he told whoever it was in the hall not to ever let me in again and so on.</span> <span id="s249">I thought at the time that my father was doomed.</span> <span id="s250">I came home.</span> <span id="s251">My mother sat in the room with several friends whose husbands had been arrested, too.</span> <span id="s252">And I said, “I am going to denounce that man.</span> <span id="s253">I’m going to denounce the police.</span> <span id="s254">I mean, he had no right to behave like that!”</span> <span id="s255">I had not realized the whole situation.</span> <span id="s256">So I went out and wanted to go directly to the Germans.</span> <span id="s257">I am fluent, and not only fluent, but I speak like a German with no accent.</span> <span id="s258">So I ended up in front of the military government offices.</span> <span id="s259">There were a couple of soldiers on the street, and I just went up to them, and I said I would like to talk to somebody about this Lithuanian, the way he treated me and so on.</span> <span id="s260">They said, “Well you have to go to the Lithuanian police with that.”</span> <span id="s261">So I said, “No way,” because, you know, they would arrest me, on top of everything else.</span> <span id="s262">So he said, in German, “Little Fraulein, maybe we can help you.”</span> <span id="s263">Just out of the blue.</span> <span id="s264">And one of them took me -- a few houses further on was the Gestapo, and in my mind, I didn’t even know what I was doing -- but I went with him there.</span> <span id="s265">He said, “ This girl has to be let in, because she comes from the military government, so just let her in.”</span> <span id="s266">There were several Jews outside waiting in line and they had some kind of slips to show that they had an appointment to see the head of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s267">I really didn’t know who was in charge with the prisons, or who was in charge of my father’s release, but anyway, I waited.</span> <span id="s268">I waited till about four o’clock and the guard changed and nobody let me in, and I didn’t have a slip.</span> <span id="s269">So when the guard was walking forth and back by the door -- it must have been late in the afternoon, around five o’clock already -- I sort of went and opened the door and went in.</span> <span id="s270">Right away this guard comes with a rifle.</span> <span id="s271">I looked inside -- it was like a split-level entry hall -- and above, a few steps inside, there stood a stocky man with grey hair.</span> <span id="s272">I heard the people address him as “Herr Commandant.”</span> <span id="s273">This was the title that I knew was on letters when people wrote for their husbands to be released and so on, that they addressed it to Herr Commandant.</span> <span id="s274">I didn’t know that it was something with the Gestapo at the time.</span> <span id="s275">So I heard that he was called that, so I said, “Herr Commandant, may I have a few minutes?”</span> <span id="s276">And he heard I spoke German and he told the guard, “Just let’s hear what it’s all about.’</span> <span id="s277">He said, ‘ You know, I’m very busy and I’m leaving town and I have no time to see you.’</span> <span id="s278">I actually begged for five minutes.</span> <span id="s279">Then he looked at me, and he said, “Okay, come on.’</span> <span id="s280">I went into an office, and here I felt that I had an opportunity to say more than about this Lithuanian, because if he is the commandant, I better talk about my dad in general.</span> <span id="s281">I told him what it was all about, that I went to that factory, and how I was mistreated.</span> <span id="s282">This man sat there and he looked at me and said, “Why do you cry?</span> <span id="s283">Don’t cry, you’re so young and your life is in front of you.</span> <span id="s284">You have so much ahead of you.</span> <span id="s285">And you know something?</span> <span id="s286">Your father will be released.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">I had a piece of paper with me that I had sort of written on as a petition, that I carried around, I thought, in case I can present it to somebody.</span> <span id="s288">He said, “Do you have some petition here that I could sign?’</span> <span id="s289">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s290">I gave him the paper, he left the room for a few minutes, and later on I sort of analyzed what happened.</span> <span id="s291">Apparently he went to check some records, because everybody kept records, and I think he must have found that my father was still there, because within the first few days after all these arrests, about several hundred a day were taken out and shot.</span> <span id="s292">Outside of town they had big trenches.</span> <span id="s293">You never knew from one day to another who was killed already.</span> <span id="s294">So when he came back into the office, he wrote with a red pen that I will never forget, “Danziger ist Zulassen.”</span> <span id="s295">That means, “Danziger is to be released.”</span> <span id="s296">And he said, ‘Go home and tell your mother that your father is coming.’</span> <span id="s297">I thanked him profusely.</span> <span id="s298">He said, “Don’t thank me.</span> <span id="s299">I did it only because you spoke so nicely to me,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s300">I ran in one breath and I came home, and I just shouted that Papa is coming home tomorrow!</span> <span id="s301">You should have seen all these women.</span> <span id="s302">They put me on a chair, and one brought me water, and one stroked me.</span> <span id="s303">They thought I was out of my mind, that something happened to me.</span> <span id="s304">They were so afraid when I ran out of the house originally.</span> <span id="s305">And my father came home the next day.</span> <span id="s306">This man, this commandant of the Gestapo, his name was Krause.</span> <span id="s307">He really and truly went to Riga the next day, and under his auspices, I believe the week after, 30,000 Jews were killed, and among them almost my whole family.</span> <span id="s308">All my relatives who lived in Riga, and they’re all dead.</span> <span id="s309">My grandparents, my uncles and aunts, all their spouses, and all my first cousins, many cousins of my parents.</span> <span id="s310">In all there was a big involved family there on both sides who has not survived.</span> <span id="s311">So sometimes when I am asked if there wasn’t even one German who did me a good deed or something, or have I ever encountered one who was a “good” person, I always cite this as an example.</span> <span id="s312">The same German, the same Gestapo head who released my father, on the other hand killed a whole family.</span> <span id="s313">I have learned during all these years later on in being a prisoner, that some Germans felt very proprietary towards the Jews that worked for this particular group, for him.</span> <span id="s314">And they would be called, “Mein Juden -- my Jews.”</span> <span id="s315">So sometimes if somebody would want to call you away, another guard would come and say, “Come with me and do something else there” -- lets say on the airport or on trenches or whatever you were working -- he would say, “This is my Jew, you cannot have him.</span> <span id="s316">He has to work here with me,” He felt very proprietary towards that particular Jew.</span> <span id="s317">I think this is what came about with the SS too, because I had maybe a personal contact with him at that moment, and maybe he felt lenient.</span> <span id="s318">My father was released, but on the other hand, just the next day, we had the thing in Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So did your life change economically and socially, then, after the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s321">We in Lithuania -- I’m sure, maybe, even in other countries -- for us the change was very fast, because we did not have the period like the German Jews had from ’33 till the war broke out in ’39 for some adjustments, even though terrible, but step by step adjustments.</span> <span id="s322">That we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s323">For us it was, one day we were human, the next day we’re sub-human, and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Were you contained in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, in September of that year, all the Jews had to leave their homes, apartments, all dwellings, and we were enclosed in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">So many thousands had already been killed, most of the men who were arrested had not returned, and also others in the towns around, so we had an influx of some who had escaped from shootings, from massacres, some who had packed up and sort of traveled, maybe they had a horse and buggy some place in a small town and had come into town, so I think that eventually we had a couple of thousand Jews in the Achaulen ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: In what year was that, month and year?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: That was by September, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I have to qualify here.</span> <span id="s331">In Lithuanian the town is called Siauliai.</span> <span id="s332">In Russian it is Shavlee.</span> <span id="s333">And in German it is Stetchaulen.</span> <span id="s334">But because we were in the ghetto under the Germans, it sort of comes smoother if I would say the Ghetto Achaulen.</span> <span id="s335">By the way, in Yiddish, it’s called Siauvil -- altogether different.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s337">And what was your knowledge of the outside world?</span> <span id="s338">Other ghettos?</span> <span id="s339">Mass killings or concentration camps at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Our life in the ghetto had a certain routine.</span> <span id="s341">There were things we had to do.</span> <span id="s342">The slogan in general was -- as later we found out in the concentration camp on top of the gate “Arbeit Macht Frei.”</span> <span id="s343">“Work will set you free.”</span> <span id="s344">Which was, of course, very ironic.</span> <span id="s345">They wanted us to believe that as long as we could work -- that we were strong and useful to the economy -- that we would survive.</span> <span id="s346">If you’re not useful, that was it.</span> <span id="s347">So in the ghetto everybody had to go to work except children under the age of twelve and elderly, in the very beginning, who stayed in because they actually couldn’t just walk so far or work so hard, and so on.</span> <span id="s348">We were forbidden certain things; newspapers, radio and this kind of stuff was really forbidden, as well as cultural activities.</span> <span id="s349">In our ghetto we didn’t have any -- officially -- but people brought in many books, and they were circulated, and in different languages.</span> <span id="s350">We had plenty to read.</span> <span id="s351">We also had a couple of radios.</span> <span id="s352">I know of one that was a sort of clandestine radio and we could hear the BBC very easily by short-wave.</span> <span id="s353">We knew exactly what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Also there were many groups who worked on the outside, outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s355">We had to line up in the morning and under guard be walking to some place of work and then come back late at night.</span> <span id="s356">And on the outside we heard from the Germans.</span> <span id="s357">We could pick it up.</span> <span id="s358">Without even asking, we could overhear.</span> <span id="s359">It wasn’t that we were not aware.</span> <span id="s360">We were very much aware of what was going on with the war, and with the war it was very bad for us, because the Germans proceeded very fast.</span> <span id="s361">They had very little resistance in the beginning, especially ’41, the winter of ’41-’42, they progressed very deep into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s362">We had no school in the ghetto, but there were people who stayed on, and some who were older and didn’t go out to work, who still tried to keep the kids together when the rest went out to work.</span> <span id="s363">In the ghetto we did not live in barracks.</span> <span id="s364">We lived families together, but sometimes two families to a room, but at least we were not separated.</span> <span id="s365">So there were little huts, little homes, and sometimes two or three families would share a room and a kitchen or something like this together.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Was there work in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: In the ghetto, later on -- during the winter of ’41 and even in ’42 -- they established some kind of workshops where they made earmuffs for the army, for instance, or did alterations.</span> <span id="s368">Sewing rooms in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s369">But mostly people went out to work in the morning, and then they came back at night, with guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Was there any talk among people there -- your family or you and your friends -- about possibly trying to escape from the ghetto or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: As far as I know, not really.</span> <span id="s372">There were a few who escaped.</span> <span id="s373">Most of them were caught.</span> <span id="s374">There was no way that we had contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s375">You cannot escape, you cannot survive as a human being without any contact.</span> <span id="s376">You need food, or shelter, or something, and that could not be had.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So then what were people saying in the ghetto, and what did they expect to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: (Sighs) We did not know what will happen in the long run.</span> <span id="s379">We only knew that we had to survive, and that was the only hope that we had from the very beginning, was that the war should not last too long, and that we, eventually, should be liberated.</span> <span id="s380">We did not know about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s381">We actually did not know.</span> <span id="s382">We could not make plans, let’s say, for a month in advance.</span> <span id="s383">You asked if people didn’t escape.</span> <span id="s384">We did not know what would happen, but we heard from some who escaped that they were caught, for instance.</span> <span id="s385">We had no contact with the outside as far as friends who came to help, who came to do things.</span> <span id="s386">There were, eventually, established some black marketing things, where we could exchange on the outside for clothing or jewelry or whatever people had that the Lithuanians wanted, that we could exchange for food.</span> <span id="s387">But this was extremely dangerous, because every time a column came back from work, we were all searched.</span> <span id="s388">And they looked into bags, and they looked into the pockets.</span> <span id="s389">By 1943, the searches were even more frequent, and it got harder and harder to being anything in, even though, in general, in the ghetto there were some who had, let’s say, food supplies brought in en masse.</span> <span id="s390">You could buy it in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s391">There were some who risked their lives, maybe, as a business proposition, and did this, but in general, if an individual wanted to bring something in it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s392">And as I said, by 1943, with the fall of Stalingrad, when the Germans started to feel they were beaten back, when the war turned, we could feel a terrible tension in the ghetto, even from the guards, or from the Germans that we worked with on the outside.</span> <span id="s393">And there was one case in June of ’43 where a baker had left in the morning for work and had come back and they found some bread and a few cigarettes in his pocket, and he was hanged publicly.</span> <span id="s394">It was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s395">There was a little orchard within the ghetto, this public place.</span> <span id="s396">And the commissar, whose name was Gewecke, closed off the ghetto on a Sunday and Jews within the ghetto had to build a gallows and a Jew had to hang him, and we were all driven out by the guards and we had to stand around and watch this man being hanged.</span> <span id="s397">There were several people who had access to this Gewecke, including my now-husband, who worked in a shop under the auspices of this “commissar.”</span> <span id="s398">There were several Jews who worked there, and he knew him personally, because he had to hang drapes at his house.</span> <span id="s399">He was called sometimes even for personal reasons to the house of this man.</span> <span id="s400">Certain delegations of the ghetto -- the ghetto-head, the leader of the ghetto -- and all kinds of other officers that worked in the ghetto -- Jews -- went to ask for his life, to spare his life and so on, and he said no!</span> <span id="s401">He wanted to make a showcase out of it.</span> <span id="s402">And I want you to know that in 1969, this man was brought to trial in Germany at one of the Nazi trials, and my husband was contacted to come as a witness.</span> <span id="s403">And we went.</span> <span id="s404">I went with him.</span> <span id="s405">There was a trial in Lubeck.</span> <span id="s406">And in that trial, no witness could prove that under his auspices, or his orders, all these diverse Jews were killed in the beginning and through the years in Lithuania, because that was his office, his orders.</span> <span id="s407">But he was tried because he did not rescind the order for this particular Jewish baker -- it was in his power to let him live, and he did not do it -- for this he got four years of hard labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What were the dates and circumstances of your deportation from the ghetto?</span> <span id="s409">How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: So in 1943, when we felt all this tension going on, we knew that something horrible is going to happen in the ghetto, that this was already sort of in the air.</span> <span id="s411">And on November 5, 1943, our ghetto was enclosed.</span> <span id="s412">The SS had brought in, not the regular SS that was there all the time, but some Romanian and Ukrainian SS.</span> <span id="s413">This was a policy.</span> <span id="s414">If there was some kind of massacre or something going on, they usually did not let the native SS work with this population, but they took, for instance, Lithuanian SS, who cooperated with them willingly, and brought them into Poland, because I have talked later to Polish former prisoners, and they said, “Oh, we had Lithuanian guards,’ whereas we had these Romanian and Ukrainian guards in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s415">So on that particular day, the ghetto was closed off very early in the morning and we were told that everybody has to go out to work.</span> <span id="s416">Our family was at that time, all five of us, employed in a factory where my father worked, and that was adjacent to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s417">We could see through the window what was happening.</span> <span id="s418">And this was the day where they took everybody out who stayed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">When we came back after work, we were a totally childless society!</span> <span id="s420">All the children were taken away.</span> <span id="s421">All the elderly were taken out.</span> <span id="s422">There were only a few who escaped or had maybe wandered off and were not found in one or the other huts.</span> <span id="s423">That was a tremendous, traumatic experience for everybody in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s424">We turned to things, like, different séances were performed.</span> <span id="s425">People looked for answers.</span> <span id="s426">Everybody’s faith was absolutely shattered!</span> <span id="s427">You can imagine parents coming home to nothing.</span> <span id="s428">There were a couple of kids that I know of whose parents probably had the presence of mind to either drug them or do something that the kids were totally asleep and were not crying out during all these searches, and they had survived.</span> <span id="s429">And I know that a few were taken out later to some Lithuanian families or were given -- I don’t know what the procedure was at the time -- and they gave them there for safety.</span> <span id="s430">I know of one particular one, because after the war, a friend of mine who came back from the Soviet Union, had found her little niece whose parents -- her sister and brother-in-law -- had perished.</span> <span id="s431">So she got that little girl back.</span> <span id="s432">When I escaped with a group of ten through this underground work that we did, I took that little child with me and got her out of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s433">But there were very few!</span> <span id="s434">And in Lithuania we really had a very hard time with relations on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So now what happened then with the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: After that the population, of course, was much smaller in our ghetto, and it was made smaller.</span> <span id="s437">The barbed wire was changed around, and we were very much afraid that we will not be able to live, to be liberated by the Russians, who were already advancing at that time.</span> <span id="s438">The day when we came back after work, and found that the ghetto was totally empty -- when all these people started to look for some omens and turned to the heaven, literally, to look for some signs -- we heard for the first time the word Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s439">And we didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s440">So much so that there was a rumor in the ghetto that these children and also some of the leadership in the ghetto that were taken out that day were taken to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s441">That was our hope, because in German, Switzerland is called “Die Schweitz.”</span> <span id="s442">When we heard “Auschwitz.’</span> <span id="s443">We didn’t know that name, we translated it sort-of as if somebody misunderstood the word “Schweitz.”</span> <span id="s444">We had hoped that all these trains that day were going into Switzerland and maybe these children would be taken as hostages, because we heard different rumors constantly.</span> <span id="s445">Of course it turned out that they were taken to Auschwitz, which we found out after the war.</span> <span id="s446">That was really the first exposure of people being taken out, and we just didn’t know if we would ever see them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">After November, ’43, the Russians really started to proceed west.</span> <span id="s448">And by June, July, they were pretty close to the Baltic already, and the Germans were being beaten back.</span> <span id="s449">We even heard sometimes, from very far away, that there is something advancing, some cannon fire or something in the air.</span> <span id="s450">We really hoped that they will not have enough transportation, because we knew that they had a hard time with trains and all this.</span> <span id="s451">But to our misfortune, in the middle of July, on the 16th, I believe, in 1944, there were trains assembled in our railroad station.</span> <span id="s452">The ghetto was closed off.</span> <span id="s453">Everybody could take only whatever they could carry, even some food we were told to take along for a couple of days, and we were put on the train, and we were taken to the camp of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s454">So the whole ghetto of Achaulen ended up in Stutthof to begin with, and there was the first time that our family was separated -- all the families -- because the men were taken to one side of the camp and the women to another.</span> <span id="s455">I suppose that the procedure of being checked in was similar in all the camps.</span> <span id="s456">Records were kept meticulously in the camps by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">After my father and brother were taken away from us, my mother and sister stayed together.</span> <span id="s458">It was a very traumatic checking-in process.</span> <span id="s459">We had to undress.</span> <span id="s460">We came to a building where we had to proceed, let’s say, like from one room to the next.</span> <span id="s461">I have some slides of it I use when I present something on World War II or on camps -- a reel of slides that our family took in 1974 when we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s462">We took our children sort of on a pilgrimage to show them where we were in Germany, and also the camp of Dachau that is now a museum.</span> <span id="s463">My husband was in Dachau as well as my father, my brother.</span> <span id="s464">All these men that were separated from us, most of them were later taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s465">So that’s where we took our kids.</span> <span id="s466">On the slides there is one of the barracks in the death camp part of the camp, and I can relate to it, because we went through the same procedure except that, for us, the next room was a shower room instead of a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s467">But I want to explain further.</span> <span id="s468">The first room that we got into -- (sigh) -- there were guards around, men and women, SS guards.</span> <span id="s469">In the middle was a table, and there was an SS man in a white coat.</span> <span id="s470">We came in batches of several women.</span> <span id="s471">We had to take our clothes off before we went in, and we were totally naked.</span> <span id="s472">My mother and sister, of course, we held on together.</span> <span id="s473">I cannot even describe now the feeling, how you feel in a situation like this.</span> <span id="s474">We were searched.</span> <span id="s475">Totally from our hair, they went through our hair, they made us stand spread -eagle.</span> <span id="s476">I also want to mention that before we left the ghetto, in our family, we cut out little pictures from snapshots, so every one of us would have the faces of the rest of the family members, and that was just put in a tiny little piece of paper, and we kept it all the time.</span> <span id="s477">When we had to stand spread-eagle like this, and spread out our fingers and all these things, even we lost our little photographs.</span> <span id="s478">They looked through the hair, they looked into the mouth, they looked in the ear, and then we had to lie down.</span> <span id="s479">They looked into every orifice of the body, right in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s480">Perhaps not knowing from one second to another what will happen, and because we were so in total shock, we did live through it.</span> <span id="s481">Then from this room we were rushed -- everything went very fast -- we were rushed through a room that said above the door, “Schauerbad,” which means “shower room.”</span> <span id="s482">As I said, in the slides of when we went through Dachau, we saw that these were gas chambers, but for us, when we went through, there was really water trickling through the ceiling.</span> <span id="s483">It wasn’t a real “bathroom” or something, but there were little openings in the ceiling and water was coming through.</span> <span id="s484">The shower was very superficial.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">“Schauerbad.</span> <span id="s486">“ I learned later, was always on top of the gas chambers, because you can imagine if a train with all these wretched people, tired and hungry and living among dead for the last few days in the trains, when they came and they were promised a bath and food on the other side of the room or some barracks or something, they were eager to go into the rooms, and that was the purpose of it.</span> <span id="s487">So over every gas chamber you will find it says, “Schauerbad.”</span> <span id="s488">We, in our ignorance of course, we didn’t know what it was, but for us luckily it was a shower room.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">And afterwards we came to the next room and there were piles of clothing, of rags really, on the floor.</span> <span id="s490">It wasn’t even dignified enough that some guard or some worker or some supervisor would issue you something to wear.</span> <span id="s491">You had to grab it.</span> <span id="s492">One got a skirt and a blouse and a dress and this and that.</span> <span id="s493">We had to exchange among ourselves.</span> <span id="s494">The same thing with the shoes that were lined up outside of those barracks.</span> <span id="s495">Some had big men’s shoes as long as size 14 and some little high-heeled pumps or something that was absolutely unusable, and I ended up with a pair like that, with brown suede pumps with high heels.</span> <span id="s496">It took me hours to find a rock that I could break off the heels with, so at least I could walk, because this marching was forever, and you had to stand in lines, and you had to really stand on roll calls all the time, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">So anyway, after this, we went into registration.</span> <span id="s498">They took the records of everything about you, from the country you came from, all the vital statistics, your profession, your scholastic background, everything was taken down.</span> <span id="s499">Then in Stutthof we got black numbers on a white piece of cloth that had to be sewn on the sleeve.</span> <span id="s500">In Auschwitz, as you know, they had the numbers tattooed into the forearm -- inside the forearm -- but in Stutthof, we had numbers that we had to sew on.</span> <span id="s501">My mother and sister and I had it in the 54,000s I believe, when we came into Stutthof.</span> <span id="s502">They were three consecutive numbers.</span> <span id="s503">Stutthof was located on the sea by the city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk and very much in the news, but at that time, before the Germans came in, it was called a free city.</span> <span id="s504">Then the Germans took over and through my lifetime even, this was called the Polish Corridor.</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">it belonged at one time either to Germany or to Poland – this whole area.</span> <span id="s507">We knew that we were close to the sea, because the sand was pure white sand when you sat outside or stood in line or whatever.</span> <span id="s508">Sometimes when we put our hands into the sand, we could pull out hair -- braids -- anything that had fallen into it, it was such very soft sand.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What was you and your family’s expectation about the meaning of deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: The way we figured was that we knew that the Russians were close to Lithuania, and we had figured out that they perhaps would use us for some work, because we could not get it into our heads -- I personally have never even discussed with my parents -- that we will never see each other.</span> <span id="s511">We hoped that we would see each other even when we’re separated from my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s512">I want to explain.</span> <span id="s513">I have thought about it very often, and I try to analyze things a lot and I am asked so many questions that I really have to come to grips with so many things.</span> <span id="s514">When I was in the camp and at the age of from 19 to 23 when I was a prisoner during those years, my view on the whole thing and my hope about life and my wishes about seeing my brother and my father were so totally different from what my mother must have experienced.</span> <span id="s515">And I can only relate to that -- to her horror which was probably even greater -- because now I’m a mother and grandmother and I understand these feelings better than I could then.</span> <span id="s516">So for myself I had the hope.</span> <span id="s517">My mother had never expressed the fear that we will never get together again.</span> <span id="s518">She always kept the hope up.</span> <span id="s519">My sister and I were lucky that for the time that we were together, we had each other to think about.</span> <span id="s520">It was, I think, easier to survive if you didn’t have to be all alone and not have anybody to worry about.</span> <span id="s521">I think it made it easier if you had somebody to worry about.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What was the means of transportation to the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They were cattle trains.</span> <span id="s524">We had no bathroom facilities, no latrine facilities on it.</span> <span id="s525">There was a pail on one side that was usually quite full, very soon.</span> <span id="s526">We were very crowded in the trains.</span> <span id="s527">The stench and the lack of water and the fear -- the whole experience was just beyond explanation.</span> <span id="s528">At one time, when we were out in open country, the guard opened the door, I remember.</span> <span id="s529">We could sit on the side and let our feet down even, and got some fresh air.</span> <span id="s530">We tried to keep our spirits up.</span> <span id="s531">We tried even to sing or do something to enjoy whatever we saw going by in this open country, but then of course they would close it off very fast, and we were all enclosed inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What was the approximate day and time and year of your arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It took very long till they loaded, and so they usually started early in the morning and we left sometime during the day, and we came to the camp later in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s534">It was still light.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: 1944 in July.</span> <span id="s537">As a matter of fact, after a few days being in camp, on July the 29th, I think, was the assassination attempt on Hitler.</span> <span id="s538">And that was a terrible few days that we had right then and there, because they were so furious, and all their hatred and everything -- there were so many killings and beatings in the camp at that time -- their rage was sort of poured out on all us prisoners</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Who were your barrack-mates, and where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: (Sigh) As we came on the train with members of our ghetto, quite a few ended up in the barracks together, because if we stood in lines for any registration or something, we sort of proceeded among friends.</span> <span id="s541">We tried to be in groups together.</span> <span id="s542">So I ended up with quite a few acquaintances.</span> <span id="s543">I also found people from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s544">We had Hungarian women and German women, somebody from Czechoslovakia, somebody from Belgium, from any country, you name it and they were there.</span> <span id="s545">Some single, some mothers and daughters.</span> <span id="s546">Children were not there.</span> <span id="s547">Even if people came from certain ghettos at that time, from communities where there were still families together with children, the children were taken away right away, and then again, men and women were separated in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s548">So children were not around at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What kind of people were they, from what countries were they from?</span> <span id="s550">Were they all Jewish?</span> <span id="s551">Were there other kinds of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I have never been with anybody in any barracks or on any work group that were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What kind of work were you doing in camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: In the camp we stayed only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s555">And then later, as prisoners of Stutthof, we were taken to outside work camps.</span> <span id="s556">This is how it worked.</span> <span id="s557">There were several things that were done in the camp, like sorting clothes, or having all kinds of alterations departments, or cleaning departments, or people who ran the camp – prisoners.</span> <span id="s558">They were kept inside.</span> <span id="s559">But the real work was done in outside work camps, so whole groups were transported out to areas where they were needed.</span> <span id="s560">A few weeks after we were in Stutthof, 1,100 women were taken out -- my mother and sister luckily together with me -- and we were taken again, by boats and trains, deeper into Germany, south and west of the camp.</span> <span id="s561">We ended up in some barracks, and we had to dig anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s562">We had guards with us.</span> <span id="s563">In those barracks they had latrines, they were prepared for this group of workers.</span> <span id="s564">We were marched for miles!</span> <span id="s565">And we had to dig.</span> <span id="s566">Those anti-tank ditches are very deep and they are V-shaped.</span> <span id="s567">They went like a V-shaped ditch for miles and miles through very flat country.</span> <span id="s568">The Germans had the idea that Russian tanks would come and fall nose-in into those ditches, and will not be able to come up again because of the shape of that ditch.</span> <span id="s569">This was a defense line.</span> <span id="s570">So we worked in the front lines, waiting for the approach of tanks which never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">But once we were done in this area, our group was split up.</span> <span id="s572">Then 400 of us were taken by train again deeper inside Germany, and we ended up in an open field in tents, 50 women to a tent.</span> <span id="s573">This camp didn’t even have a latrine that gave you any privacy at all.</span> <span id="s574">And that camp didn’t have any water -- for drinking or washing or anything.</span> <span id="s575">We got there about the end of September, beginning of October, 1944.</span> <span id="s576">The weather was still passable.</span> <span id="s577">There was still some sunshine.</span> <span id="s578">The climate in general in that area is much like here in Minnesota except that the fall there is a little longer and rainier, and the snow comes maybe by November.</span> <span id="s579">In that camp the conditions were so rough that it is unbelievable to me today how we really survived it, as people and as women, especially.</span> <span id="s580">There was no sanitary help at all.</span> <span id="s581">We didn’t have, as I said, even a covered latrine.</span> <span id="s582">As a matter of fact, at night, after the last roll-call -- it was called in the camps ‘appell” for the last roll-call -- once you were inside the tent and you wanted to go to the latrine area, you had to step out and call a guard who would escort you to this little area.</span> <span id="s583">It was all out in the open, and he would stand by you while you were crouching down, and he would escort you back.</span> <span id="s584">This was part of our lifestyle there We were covered with lice.</span> <span id="s585">We became very sick and weak.</span> <span id="s586">We had no means of even washing.</span> <span id="s587">Also the tents did not have any wood so we could heat a tiny little oven that was a heating stove that was put in the middle of the tent with a pipe sticking out through the top.</span> <span id="s588">It was not bigger than a big marmalade can or something, on three legs.</span> <span id="s589">If we had the wood, it could be heated, but we didn’t even have that.</span> <span id="s590">It was so terrible that I honestly don’t know today, knowing what would happen, if I could survive that.</span> <span id="s591">We stayed in that camp, again, till about the middle of December when we stopped working, because by that time the snow was very deep and we worked with pickaxes and shovels by hand.</span> <span id="s592">So we couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s593">It was all frozen.</span> <span id="s594">Then they made a selection in that camp, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">The age group was from about 16 till about 40 or maybe 45, who were really the work force that had still survived up until that time, because the children had been taken away, and the elderly were gone, and this was the strong element, really, that could still be used.</span> <span id="s596">My mother was selected out of the selection.</span> <span id="s597">She was 45.</span> <span id="s598">They probably figured out that if and when the camp will be closed down and people will be marched out, that the sick and the “elderly” quote-unquote, will not be able to march.</span> <span id="s599">We had already again a notion that the camp will be closed down very soon.</span> <span id="s600">We could hear when we slept on the floor that in the east someplace there was a lot of rumbling going on, and we knew that the Russians were close.</span> <span id="s601">On January 20, 1945, they closed the camp down and about 300 were marched out and 96 were left behind.</span> <span id="s602">That was the whole camp.</span> <span id="s603">The camp leader knew that we were daughters, and he gave us a choice to either be evacuated and leave mother behind, or we could stay with her.</span> <span id="s604">Of course we decided to stay.</span> <span id="s605">Whatsoever will be done to her, we would stay with her.</span> <span id="s606">I lost a very dear friend at that time -- taken away, she and her mother -- that was one of my old friends that I had been to the university with.</span> <span id="s607">She had been a medical student.</span> <span id="s608">Her mother was a chemist.</span> <span id="s609">I owe a lot to her mother, because when we were in this last camp, my mother worked in the kitchen for a while, and Frau Schmidt, my friend’s mother, was one of five that worked in a group together.</span> <span id="s610">We worked five as a unit, and in my group was my friend Thea, her mother, Frau Schmidt, my sister and I, which makes four, and a fifth was a young woman from Belgium.</span> <span id="s611">Frau Schmidt taught us to survive -- really -- because many times I think we would have gone out of our minds or collapsed physically, if mot for her.</span> <span id="s612">First of all, while we didn’t have snow yet, she taught us what roots or grasses or anything that wasn’t poisonous, that wouldn’t hurt us, that we could eat.</span> <span id="s613">And that’s what we ate.</span> <span id="s614">We chewed on things that we could find that she allowed us to eat.</span> <span id="s615">She also said that to survive we have to keep our minds occupied and not to think about the hunger and not think about the cold.</span> <span id="s616">And she made us study every day.</span> <span id="s617">For instance, even now I remember Russian poetry that she taught us by rote, by heart, every day, when her turn came to be the lecturer.</span> <span id="s618">And my friend spoke about all her lectures that she remembered from school, and so did I. And my sister contributed whatever she could contribute to the conversation.</span> <span id="s619">The only one that was very hard on us was this young woman from Belgium who always reverted to speaking about food.</span> <span id="s620">We called the day when she talked, when it was her turn to speak, “the day Lorna cooked,” because she came up with recipes, and luckily we didn’t know what she was talking about, such fancy things that she knew, that she had eaten, so it didn’t really make much of a difference, it was very familiar to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Frau Schmidt also taught us to have a real perspective -- on the guards, for instance.</span> <span id="s622">She taught us to think every time when we felt humiliated, or were cringing inside, or were hurting inside, who the animal was and who the human being was.</span> <span id="s623">Because she always used to say, “A human being cannot make you into an animal.</span> <span id="s624">He can tell you you’re an animal, but it’s only because of the way he treats you.</span> <span id="s625">And the animal really is one that humiliates another human being.”</span> <span id="s626">And so on.</span> <span id="s627">I remember she used to keep our spirits up, and it really was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">As I said on January 20 the camp was closed down.</span> <span id="s629">The 96 who were left behind, we all stayed without food and without any provisions and we had only two guards left in the camp.</span> <span id="s630">They were both armed.</span> <span id="s631">Quite a few among the ones that stayed with us were sick, because this was the purpose of the selection to begin with.</span> <span id="s632">There were some people who couldn’t walk, some people who had bent backs or were in pain, who were just very emaciated, skeleton-like and couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s633">We stayed in the camp only overnight, and the next day we were put into formation and we started on a highway.</span> <span id="s634">The snow was very high.</span> <span id="s635">I remember that was a very harsh winter.</span> <span id="s636">We marched on a highway until we came to a small town where we would be put overnight into the jail there.</span> <span id="s637">I think that by that time we were pretty scared already, because in the beginning we thought that they will burn down the tents with us in them.</span> <span id="s638">When that didn’t happen, we had heard rumors that around Stutthof there was a soap factory where they boiled people -- bodies -- for the manufacture of soap.</span> <span id="s639">When we were put, 96 women, into a small jail cell, we honestly stood so close by that we couldn’t sit down.</span> <span id="s640">If one bent down there was no room for anybody else to bend down.</span> <span id="s641">We thought that maybe the floor will open.</span> <span id="s642">Maybe some things will happen.</span> <span id="s643">The panic I remember was so great.</span> <span id="s644">Everybody started screaming.</span> <span id="s645">It was such a hysterical moment.</span> <span id="s646">Then slowly we quieted down.</span> <span id="s647">You can imagine 96 women pressed like this together, with no bathroom facilities, with everybody going just crazy!</span> <span id="s648">And it was just horrible, this tension.</span> <span id="s649">The nerves were on edge.</span> <span id="s650">We were just absolutely not normal, and it was a relief in the morning when it was still dark, they opened the doors and we really spilled outside.</span> <span id="s651">They recruited a whole bunch of Polish -- home guards or some other groups -- Poles with guns, rifles -- and they surrounded us totally as if in a box.</span> <span id="s652">And 96 women is not that big a group when we went five in a row.</span> <span id="s653">This whole box, this whole enclosed group went further on the highway.</span> <span id="s654">We started to ask the Poles where and what is happening.</span> <span id="s655">They said they don’t know.</span> <span id="s656">They were recruited to escort this group for a while and then they will be told, but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s657">We marched like this till about noon, I imagine, because the sun was high.</span> <span id="s658">I cannot really tell.</span> <span id="s659">We saw some German soldiers, one by one, sort of, going on the highway, and we thought that there is something going on, and we hoped maybe Russians were proceeding there in that area, because we could hear bombardments.</span> <span id="s660">Then the guards told us to stop, and they dismissed all these Polish guards.</span> <span id="s661">And they told us to run into the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">B: And the snow was so deep --up to the knees and most of us were barefoot -- totally barefoot.</span> <span id="s663">We were all frozen and blistering, and it was very cold, and we couldn’t really run in formation, so we spread out into a long line.</span> <span id="s664">In the front of the line was one guard and at the end another.</span> <span id="s665">Whether by design or by a coincidence, I don’t know, but my mother and sister and I were at the very end.</span> <span id="s666">And all of a sudden I heard the sound of a rifle being sort of -- something done, with a click, and I still have the feeling in the back of my spine, and it felt very strange and very scary.</span> <span id="s667">To my mother and my sister, I said, “Let’s run ahead a little bit to be within the crowd,” not right there at the end.</span> <span id="s668">We ran a little faster, and when we sort of reached the group, we were in a clearing in the woods.</span> <span id="s669">The guards shot into the air.</span> <span id="s670">There was a terrible panic and screams and people went really crazy.</span> <span id="s671">My mother, that was one time she let go of our hands.</span> <span id="s672">We always hand-held.</span> <span id="s673">She was always in the middle.</span> <span id="s674">She let go, and she ran towards the guards screaming, and not to shoot, her children, and all these things that mothers say.</span> <span id="s675">And they shot her.</span> <span id="s676">My sister and I just couldn’t face the barrage, I suppose, because we had no design of escaping or leaving, but we grabbed each other by the hand and we ran!</span> <span id="s677">And it was in the woods.</span> <span id="s678">We stopped when we had to catch our breath, and we could hear the screaming and the shooting, and it went on like forever.</span> <span id="s679">We just stood there.</span> <span id="s680">Then it got very quiet.</span> <span id="s681">I don’t know how long after, because we were afraid to move.</span> <span id="s682">Every tree looked as if it had an armband.</span> <span id="s683">The guards themselves were these awful, awesome looking guards in black uniforms with the skull and cross-bone insignia.</span> <span id="s684">Anyway, when we sort of came to, my sister luckily, had a piece of blanket, and we had straw.</span> <span id="s685">My mother, too, may she rest in peace, we had covered her feet with pieces of blanket and straw inside, and I didn’t have enough, so I found a pair of some boots in the snow, not boots, but old shoes, but they fell off.</span> <span id="s686">I was really totally barefoot and I started to hurt.</span> <span id="s687">Then my sister and I started to move away, and we wanted to go and see what happened.</span> <span id="s688">Then a few more women came out from behind the trees, and we were nine that escaped, and we wanted to go back, and milled around in the woods, but we never found that place again.</span> <span id="s689">We were lost.</span> <span id="s690">Besides, wherever we went, we saw German machine gun nests -- the regular army had positions there in the woods.</span> <span id="s691">We were afraid to fall into their hands, so eventually we made it out on the highway.</span> <span id="s692">And there another woman approached us who had been shot through.</span> <span id="s693">She was wounded but she probably survived in the snow.</span> <span id="s694">By that time it was already getting dark, late in the afternoon, and we took her with us.</span> <span id="s695">So the ten of us tried to march back to that village, because we knew there were people, at least.</span> <span id="s696">We needed help by that time, it didn’t make any difference what would happen.</span> <span id="s697">We just had to have some contact, to rest or to eat or something.</span> <span id="s698">We couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s699">We were so weak we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s700">We knew it was seven kilometers, because we had seen a sign.</span> <span id="s701">So then we saw a small village about a mile away and we, with the last strength really, made it into the village and knocked on some doors.</span> <span id="s702">It was a Polish village and they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s703">Then the next house they started to throw things at us, and we went straight to the church and asked for the priest.</span> <span id="s704">The first thing he said was, “I can’t do anything for you.</span> <span id="s705">The Germans are in charge here and there is nothing I can do.”</span> <span id="s706">He said, “Maybe if you survive, you will be liberated very soon, because we know that the Russians are coming very soon.”</span> <span id="s707">It was no help.</span> <span id="s708">So we just parked there on the steps of the church.</span> <span id="s709">Later in the evening the priest came with a man who told us to go and hide in a barn that was empty.</span> <span id="s710">There was a German national who had left because he was afraid to be caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s711">He had left the village.</span> <span id="s712">There was an empty barn.</span> <span id="s713">We stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s714">We did not get any help whatsoever from the whole village.</span> <span id="s715">Not water.</span> <span id="s716">Not a rag to cover ourselves.</span> <span id="s717">Not any medical help.</span> <span id="s718">Nothing.</span> <span id="s719">We stayed there till the next morning when there was a terrible battle in the area.</span> <span id="s720">It was just so noisy.</span> <span id="s721">There was a machine gun nest right in front of the barn, because the barn was on a hill overlooking the village square.</span> <span id="s722">We were so afraid that they might throw a bomb in or something.</span> <span id="s723">We had locked ourselves in.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">.</span> <span id="s725">Then this machine gun nest sort of got very quiet.</span> <span id="s726">We heard Slavic sounds – “Ogonye”, which means “fire,’ -- and we knew that Russians were running around.</span> <span id="s727">Then when it got quiet, somebody from the village came and told us to open the door and look outside, and he said, “If you want to, you can see the first Russian tanks coming in.</span> <span id="s728">You’re free.”</span> <span id="s729">That’s when we opened the doors and really saw the first Siberian troops that came through this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: So can you tell me briefly about the liberation and where you went from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: The liberation, very briefly; we stayed in the barn just for a little while, because at night came some Russians.</span> <span id="s732">They took us out of the barn, and they put us into that empty farmhouse.</span> <span id="s733">We were debriefed by the Soviet military commander in the area, and we were told to leave, because there was a battle waging for a while there.</span> <span id="s734">The Russians did not provide anything special except very slight medical help.</span> <span id="s735">They gave us some Vaseline to cover the wounds and some rags.</span> <span id="s736">That’s all they had, even their military group that came in there.</span> <span id="s737">It was right in the front lines, so they went all ahead, west, and they put us into trucks and took us to the town of Ostrovliemko.</span> <span id="s738">We went through parts of burning territory and fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: What country was this in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: In Poland.</span> <span id="s741">Now we went east.</span> <span id="s742">We thought that in Ostrovliemko we might find trains, but there really was no transportation.</span> <span id="s743">There was some kind of a freight train going -- open platforms.</span> <span id="s744">We just jumped on it, because we couldn’t stay in the open like that.</span> <span id="s745">We came to a border town where the Russian police caught up with us.</span> <span id="s746">They took us off the train and we were taken to a Russian gathering point, where they caught all kinds of refugees that they found on the roads and on trains and all over.</span> <span id="s747">They put us all into this one area, in one big building, actually.</span> <span id="s748">They had their police there -- the NKVD.</span> <span id="s749">And they started to grill us; “How did you survive?</span> <span id="s750">You must have cooperated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s751">Everybody else was killed.</span> <span id="s752">How did you as Jews survive?”</span> <span id="s753">it got so terrible, that we had to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s754">We were five who wanted to go to this particular city, to Vilna, because we thought, stupidly, that if everybody will survive in the family, we would want to meet some place in Lithuania -- at least how will we find ourselves.</span> <span id="s755">That was our only worry at that time.</span> <span id="s756">We lived through it and we should have stayed in Poland and waited out the war.</span> <span id="s757">Eventually there were more refugees, which we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s758">We thought that we were the only survivors.</span> <span id="s759">That was January, ’45, still during the war, because the war didn’t end until May of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: So you didn’t stay there?</span> <span id="s761">You went to Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: So we went.</span> <span id="s763">We wanted to go to Vilna.</span> <span id="s764">Then on the way we had to work there with these Russians.</span> <span id="s765">Finally we got out of this terrible place.</span> <span id="s766">We got some kind of a document.</span> <span id="s767">In Russia, without a piece of paper, you are a nobody; you have to have some kind of an I.D.</span> <span id="s768">So we got these I.D.’s and we made it into Vilna.</span> <span id="s769">We wanted to go back to Siauliai, where we had lived.</span> <span id="s770">But in the station in Vilna, we heard our names called.</span> <span id="s771">There were a couple of Russian officers who looked for me and my sister.</span> <span id="s772">It happened that on the same train when we were going into Lithuania, there was a Jewish doctor that had come onto that train before we reached Vilna, and we were the first survivors that he had ever seen.</span> <span id="s773">He asked for our names and where we were from, and he said, “Don’t go into the small towns, because they’ll kill you!</span> <span id="s774">You are not welcome there.</span> <span id="s775">There are no Jews in smaller towns in Lithuania.”</span> <span id="s776">But you know, we just didn’t know better.</span> <span id="s777">We said, “We want to go on.”</span> <span id="s778">So when we came to Vilna, he had already disembarked, and he had run over to some officers’ quarters and he knew there were some from Lithuania -- from Siauliai, our hometown.</span> <span id="s779">And these two men, who were my parents’ age actually, came and they took us off the train, and said, “Don’t go into smaller towns.”</span> <span id="s780">So my sister and I stayed in Vilna.</span> <span id="s781">We only heard in October, ’45 that my brother and father had survived.</span> <span id="s782">To get out, it was impossible just as it is now.</span> <span id="s783">There is no way that you can get out of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s784">There was only one way, right after the war, that Polish citizens could leave for Poland, that had become then a Communist state.</span> <span id="s785">So former Polish citizens in the area of Vilna were allowed to go into Poland.</span> <span id="s786">The Brichah, the Zionist Jewish underground, worked in that area, and we managed to get documents and things going and then we got to Poland in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Was there any discussion then in Poland about going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: There was.</span> <span id="s789">For us it was not the time, because we were still looking for my brother, who had not returned to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s790">He had stayed in Germany, so we couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s791">I only delivered that child that I had taken with me.</span> <span id="s792">I delivered that to the illegal -- at that time -- Youth Aliya group, that took the children into Palestine.</span> <span id="s793">We proceeded back into Germany.</span> <span id="s794">We had to cross the Carpathian Mountains on foot, my father and my sister and I, from Poland into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s795">And only in Czechoslovakia could we find some camps that were administered already by the international refugee organizations.</span> <span id="s796">Then we took a train, had to cross, again, the Russian zone of Austria, and through the whole of Austria, and then we came into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">In 1946 when we got there, I started to work for the Central Committee of Liberated Jews.</span> <span id="s798">We were an organization that had special privileges.</span> <span id="s799">All the Jewish refugees that lived in the city of Munich, and who administered all the Jewish D.P. camps in the area, were not under the jurisdiction of the Germans, as other survivors of other nationalities had been.</span> <span id="s800">The American military government issued us a special status, that this organization was responsible directly to the American government.</span> <span id="s801">And it was very interesting work.</span> <span id="s802">It was the time prior to the establishment of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Then my sister was married in 1947 while we were still there.</span> <span id="s804">Although I had relatives in South Africa, and my father received one affidavit to go to South Africa, he said that he will not be separated from the family ever again, so he did not go.</span> <span id="s805">We had no relatives in the United States that could issue us an affidavit to come, but my sister, when she married, her husband had family here, and they had an affidavit almost immediately, in ’47.</span> <span id="s806">On the way to the United States, my brother-in-law stopped with her in Paris, where his parents were stuck for a while.</span> <span id="s807">In the meantime, the law of immigration was changed in the United States, and Congress then approved 250,000 refugees to be allowed to come into the United States, and we didn’t need affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: You were on your way anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: When my sister was on her way to the States, my father said that we will all try to wait till our turn will come, and that’s why I came to Minneapolis only in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: How did you happen to come to Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I was married here in 1951, but I knew my husband from my hometown too.</span> <span id="s812">He had gone through Dachau and all this, and I had met him very briefly in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s813">They had a lot of family here, and they had come to the States already in 1947 -- their whole family, my husband, his brother and his parents.</span> <span id="s814">We corresponded all the time, and he had seen to it that I could find work here in Minneapolis and so on, that I should be transferred to Minneapolis, so I came here.</span> <span id="s815">And the year after, I was married here.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Most of all, I think, it has meant to me to be a witness.</span> <span id="s818">It’s not that I’m obsessed with talking about it, or letting everybody know about it, even though I feel that being quiet would really not be very fair to the ones who did not survive.</span> <span id="s819">And this made it, maybe, a little easier to speak about it, because in the very beginning, and not only the beginning, but maybe the first ten years up to fifteen years, we had no audience here.</span> <span id="s820">We kept it all inside.</span> <span id="s821">It was very hard to talk about it.</span> <span id="s822">It’s only in the last few years, really, when it’s out in the open, because the study of the Holocaust started to be incorporated in the curricula in the schools, at the university, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Luckily we can speak about it, because I want it to be known.</span> <span id="s824">I feel that revenge, for instance is not the thing that I could live with, but to look for justice, to be a witness, and all this combined had meaning for my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Can you describe very briefly your general feelings about human nature, non-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: The whole experience, of course, has taught me about the possibility of a human being turned into a beast, into something non-human in relation to other people.</span> <span id="s827">I honestly hope that a thing like this will never happen.</span> <span id="s828">I think there is a danger in not speaking out when you see something brewing, in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s829">I think that the onlooker, the bystander, is as much at fault as the perpetrator, because he lets it happen.</span> <span id="s830">I have a fear of what is called the “Silent Majority.”</span> <span id="s831">That is a very frightful thing.</span> <span id="s832">Very often a non-Jewish friend here will ask me, “So what can I do?’</span> <span id="s833">Or when I speak to students, when I speak to groups, or to anybody who is interested already in the subject, they say, “What can we do?”</span> <span id="s834">If I open a paper after some anti-Semitic thing happened in a city or a community, and I see letters to the editors, the ones that will react are mostly Jews!</span> <span id="s835">So I say, as non-Jews, I don’t want you to do anything.</span> <span id="s836">I want you to get up and say, “I feel it’s wrong.”</span> <span id="s837">Or, “I protest.”</span> <span id="s838">That’s all you have to do.</span> <span id="s839">Send in a letter.</span> <span id="s840">“This should not happen in my community.</span> <span id="s841">I don’t want this.</span> <span id="s842">I protest against it.”</span> <span id="s843">And sign your name.</span> <span id="s844">Then maybe somebody else will be brave enough to come forward and say he protests, too, that he thinks that is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I feel a great comfort to be within the Jewish community and to be active within the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s847">Also about being active in a community in general.</span> <span id="s848">It is a good feeling.</span> <span id="s849">I have a good feeling, for instance, when I am at the synagogue, and when Jews, as a community, perform their rituals in a group, and I feel part of a group, and I feel that all over the world, Jews at this moment are doing the same things that I do.</span> <span id="s850">It’s like a family to me.</span> <span id="s851">I could not live without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Have you seen any of the films or read any of the books related to the Holocaust, and do you think that they are accurate in what they describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Whether a person writes his memoirs or relates personal things that happened to him during the war, or there is a fictional account of the years during the Holocaust with maybe a real background of somebody involved, I have a feeling that anything that a person will even make up out of thin air could have happened, because it did.</span> <span id="s854">So I cannot judge if this person in particular makes something up, or if it really happened to him.</span> <span id="s855">Personally, I think it was heroic just to survive -- but I cannot judge that, because everybody has their own story, whether they escaped from a massacre, whether they survived a child being torn from their arms, whether they saw people dying around them, friends and others, whether they were in one camp or another, whether conditions were better or worse, and, you know, quote-unquote, “It could have happened.”</span> <span id="s856">What they show on T.V., I don’t always approve of, especially not that horrible thing Playing For Time where I feel that the Jewish prisoners, those musicians, were shown at such a disadvantage, it was absolutely ridiculous.</span> <span id="s857">But I don’t want to go into the critique of everything.</span> <span id="s858">There are many, many people who think that the movie The Holocaust should not have been performed on T.V., but I think it let people, non-Jews, be involved with a particular family.</span> <span id="s859">I think this is the only way that maybe they could feel something, because throwing out numbers like six million, or a whole village, that doesn’t have any meaning.</span> <span id="s860">It has more meaning when you get involved with a certain person or a family.</span> <span id="s861">So there are things that are worthwhile that are shown.</span> <span id="s862">But things happened, and I think we should still keep talking about it, because there are already opinions afoot, people write already, saying that the Holocaust never happened, that it’s a hoax, that it’s Jewish propaganda.</span> <span id="s863">If we don’t repudiate that, then the next generation might grow up not knowing anything, saying that maybe it never did happen.</span> <span id="s864">So I feel it is our duty to study the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Yes, and I think this will be a valuable contribution to that study.</span> <span id="s866">I’d like to thank you for your time today.</span> <span id="s867">And this completes the interview with Hinda Kibort
