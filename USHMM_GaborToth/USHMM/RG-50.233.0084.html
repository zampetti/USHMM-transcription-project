Like from the beginning, I was told that I have to be a professional.</span> <span id="s38">It was not--my parents didn't ask.</span> <span id="s39">It was decided that I have to go to medical school to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s40">For her, was decided that she has to marry somebody well-off, a good provider, a handsome husband, children and she just had to be like a lady of the house, a hostess.</span> <span id="s41">Just looking pretty and behaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Anthony: Is that something she wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Lily: Well, she accepted this role from the beginning.</span> <span id="s44">She never was trying to have good grades.</span> <span id="s45">She was just passing and she liked the ballet, she liked to play the piano.</span> <span id="s46">Also she had her little friends and really she was like mentally prepared to a very pleasant life, being very spoiled by both parents and the nanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Anthony: What about you?</span> <span id="s48">Did you really want to be a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Lily: It was not a question that I want to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s50">It was just put before me that fait accompli and I just had to be and--.</span> <span id="s51">Also, I liked to study.</span> <span id="s52">As strange as it sounds today, I really--I was very interested in reading.</span> <span id="s53">When I was six years old, I was introduced to books and I was a voracious reader.</span> <span id="s54">I was very interested in a lot of things.</span> <span id="s55">Also in school I was a very good student and it used to come very easy to me.</span> <span id="s56">I didn't have to study a lot.</span> <span id="s57">When I had to write an essay I could write it in two minutes.</span> <span id="s58">I used to write a few essays for my little friends that had difficulties.</span> <span id="s59">I was not crazy about math but somehow I managed and I used to be a teacher's pet.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Anthony: I noticed your report card and it was quite good.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Lily: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Anthony: Now your little sister went to the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Lily: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">We went to a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Anthony: Was this a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Lily: This was a private Jewish school that only Jewish children went to there.</span> <span id="s67">We were off on Saturdays and Sunday was a school day but all the instructions were in Polish.</span> <span id="s68">We also had two times a week Hebrew but everything was taught in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Anthony: What was the language in your household?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Lily: When I was a little girl, my parents spoke Russian because when they went to the university and before I was born, Vilna was occupied by Russia and the young people, at this time, spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s71">Then when I started to get older, my father one time came from work and said we have to speak Polish.</span> <span id="s72">The child will have to go to a Polish school and she is still talking Russian.</span> <span id="s73">Then they were starting to speak Polish but when their friends came and when they are talking between themselves, Russian was the language that they spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Anthony: Did they speak any other languages between Russian and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Lily: There was a Jewish paper that used to come.</span> <span id="s76">My mother didn't read Jewish but my father read the Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s77">I imagine that my mother spoke Jewish.</span> <span id="s78">But when she spoke with her friends or her family, it was mostly in Russian.</span> <span id="s79">Do you know the Jewish population had three layers of society?</span> <span id="s80">There were these people that were assimilated Jews and they mainly spoke Russian and Polish.</span> <span id="s81">There were the people that were young Zionists and they sent their children to Hebrew School and they were trying to make Hebrew a living language.</span> <span id="s82">The third layer of the Jewish society was people that believe that Yiddish is the language of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s83">There were very famous “Ragymnasium” [?]</span> <span id="s84">(88)that were taught only in Jewish and the children were sent to this school.</span> <span id="s85">They were taught Yiddish and they were speaking between themselves also in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s86">There were like three layers of Jewish society.</span> <span id="s87">Unfortunately, my parents were very assimilated and they, because of their professional background, felt that the Russian revolution and the Russian language is kind of salvation for all people.</span> <span id="s88">They believed in all the ideals that sounded very nice on paper but unfortunately fell apart later.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Anthony: So you would describe your parents as being Socialists at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Lily: No, they were not Socialist, I mean maybe as young students.</span> <span id="s91">As young students they believed in all the revolutionary ideals.</span> <span id="s92">I remember that my father used to just ask me from time to time to sing the International.</span> <span id="s93">I had a good voice and even when the Russian came, his biggest pleasure was just when I was singing the International for him.</span> <span id="s94">He believed in those ideas, equality, was very idealistic about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Anthony: Definitely not a Stalinist but--.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Lily: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s97">Was very idealistic because at this time, when he was a student, all those ideas of Lenin and Trotsky were very much in the mind of the young students who believed very deeply that the oppressed people have to unite and everybody has the same right.</span> <span id="s98">Religion shouldn't imprison people.</span> <span id="s99">So they were very idealistic and very much for equal rights for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Anthony: Would you describe your parents as being secular, more secular than religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Lily: Very secular, very secular.</span> <span id="s102">As a matter of fact, I didn't know that I was Jewish until I went to school.</span> <span id="s103">It was a very hard experience for me because a lot of people that I went to school, the children, were from religious families.</span> <span id="s104">When I went to school the first day, my nanny prepared me my lunch.</span> <span id="s105">It was a Kaiser roll with butter and ham.</span> <span id="s106">I had no idea that there's something wrong.</span> <span id="s107">When I opened the lunch and there are children, who can be very cruel, saw my lunch; they said, you are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s108">I said, yes I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s109">I mean it was like a revelation for me that it came out that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s110">I started to cry.</span> <span id="s111">I didn't want to eat.</span> <span id="s112">They said to me, do you know that Jewish children are not allowed to eat ham and do you know that Jewish children are not allowed to rip paper or grab something on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s113">When my nanny came to pick me up, I was in tears.</span> <span id="s114">When I came, she called my mother.</span> <span id="s115">We sat down and I told her the whole story.</span> <span id="s116">She told me I'm Jewish, we are not religious, but we are Jews and you are going to Jewish school with Jewish children.</span> <span id="s117">I had a very good friend of mine and every Friday night, they used to light candles.</span> <span id="s118">When I went there and I saw that they are lighting candles, I was very impressed with the whole dinner and everything that was--.</span> <span id="s119">I came home and I said to my mother, I was told that God will punish us, we don't light candles.</span> <span id="s120">I was so distressed that-my mother went out and bought two candlesticks and she started to light candles on Friday just to pacify me.</span> <span id="s121">Because it was a revelation for me.</span> <span id="s122">I started to ask her because I never knew my grandparents.</span> <span id="s123">Then she told me that her father who passed away at a young age, was a religious Jew, was not fanatic with a big white beard.</span> <span id="s124">Then I kind of was researching my background and I was very impressed and this is how I come to know my heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Anthony: Did you speak any other languages besides Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Lily: Yes, I speak Russian.</span> <span id="s127">I speak Spanish, Castellan Spanish.</span> <span id="s128">I speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s129">I used to speak and write a very good German.</span> <span id="s130">Even I used to write the Gothic German but I have a mental block now and I just--I get very upset even when I hear the language even spoken so I don't count German.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Anthony: When you were young, growing up in Vilna, could you speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Lily: No, no.</span> <span id="s133">I learned to speak Yiddish when I was brought into ghetto.</span> <span id="s134">Because when I was brought into ghetto, I met there people that if I would live in Vilna a hundred years, I would never meet those kind of people.</span> <span id="s135">I grew up in a very sheltered and restricted little society.</span> <span id="s136">My peers spoke Polish, only Polish.</span> <span id="s137">But when I came to the ghetto, I met all kinds of people; I started to mingle and I learned Yiddish.</span> <span id="s138">I know the alphabet because I was taught Hebrew as a child when I went to school, but I never learned to read Yiddish.</span> <span id="s139">I also, there was a time that I know quite well, White Russian, but not anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Anthony: Earlier you divided the Jewish population of Vilna into three groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Lily: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Anthony: Which would you say was the most numerous of the three?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Lily: It's very hard for me to say.</span> <span id="s144">I would say the most numerous were the Yiddish-speaking people.</span> <span id="s145">This was the most numerous.</span> <span id="s146">This was actually the working-class language.</span> <span id="s147">There were a lot of very, very poor people, Jewish people, in Vilna that lived in basements and had a very hard life.</span> <span id="s148">They were speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s149">Those people who were assimilated and those people that spoke Hebrew were more elitist and they were fewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Anthony: Minority?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Lily: Minority, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Anthony: Your nanny, you mentioned your nanny.</span> <span id="s153">Your nanny was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Lily: No, she was a Polish girl that was a--.</span> <span id="s155">The day that my mother brought me from the hospital, she was there already.</span> <span id="s156">She was brought over because my mother was a working dentist, yes, she was a working woman.</span> <span id="s157">She was a young girl at this time and my mother kind of--.</span> <span id="s158">My mother was a very good heart person.</span> <span id="s159">She kind of taught her manners and she kind of took her into the family.</span> <span id="s160">She was never outside.</span> <span id="s161">She was always a member and she was very, very fond of my mother.</span> <span id="s162">After she became a member of the family, she kind of took over.</span> <span id="s163">I tell you a little instance.</span> <span id="s164">Every morning, she used to dress me up, very, very nice, even with gloves.</span> <span id="s165">We used to go to a park.</span> <span id="s166">The park was called Katajenka.</span> <span id="s167">Over there the other nannies were bringing their little children from parents that were in the same class and all the nannies used to brag about, oh my lady did this and my lady, they went to this theater and they had this and all--it was like kind of a competition between how the children were dressed.</span> <span id="s168">When my nanny decided that I needed a new dress; she didn't go to my mother or my father to ask.</span> <span id="s169">She went to a store where we had a credit, she chose the material.</span> <span id="s170">She went to a dressmaker, she chose the style.</span> <span id="s171">The dressmaker knew, already, that she is reliable.</span> <span id="s172">After she did it, she also went and bought me a new pair of shoes, a new pair of gloves; she came and she said to my mother, you know, I did today, this and this and this.</span> <span id="s173">My mother would never say no to her but when my father got the bills and he used to question her, she used to say, what do you want me to go with your little girl--like a pauper to the park?</span> <span id="s174">My father would never, never speak against her.</span> <span id="s175">She was just like the boss.</span> <span id="s176">She knew that she has to take care of her little girls later on--in the beginning, just me.</span> <span id="s177">She knew that she had to take care of my mother and she was a part of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Anthony: What kind of house did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Lily: I lived in an apartment house.</span> <span id="s180">I was born in an apartment house on Ludwisarska Four.</span> <span id="s181">My mother's office was right there.</span> <span id="s182">She had an office and she had a waiting room.</span> <span id="s183">Then there were quarters, living quarters.</span> <span id="s184">But when my sister was born, the apartment became too small.</span> <span id="s185">We moved to Pilsaskero, where we lived until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Anthony: That was also an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Lily: This was an apartment.</span> <span id="s188">We lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s189">It was a very nice apartment with a balcony.</span> <span id="s190">They were very nice quarters.</span> <span id="s191">My mother also had an office and there was a waiting room.</span> <span id="s192">Also there was a room for my nanny.</span> <span id="s193">It had two entrances.</span> <span id="s194">One was the entrance that you went into the kitchen and one was a front entrance that the patient used to come.</span> <span id="s195">It was beautiful furnished.</span> <span id="s196">When I was trying to furnish my house--when I married and I settled down--I always was trying to imitate whatever I saw.</span> <span id="s197">Like we had a grandfather clock and I had a grandfather clock.</span> <span id="s198">We had a piano and I didn't have furniture yet but I bought a piano, the first thing we bought a piano.</span> <span id="s199">I always--even the coloring--if you look at my apartment, this is the coloring that I was trying to imitate Anthony: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s200">So that was the yardstick by which you measured good taste?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Lily: Good taste, yes.</span> <span id="s202">My mother had a very good taste.</span> <span id="s203">I never saw my mother without a hat and a pair of gloves.</span> <span id="s204">She was a very good looking woman, a beautiful woman and on Fridays was her day off.</span> <span id="s205">Before I started school, when I was a little girl, my biggest pleasure was Fridays.</span> <span id="s206">Because in the morning, she used to dress up and we used to go and do errands, whatever she had to do on her day off.</span> <span id="s207">Strange men on the street used to tip their hat to my mother.</span> <span id="s208">I was very proud that this is my mother.</span> <span id="s209">It was a real--like I was admiring her, not only because she was very good but because she was very attractive.</span> <span id="s210">When I remember my mother, I always see her in the white doctor coat, this is how I remember her or when she was walking on the street dressed up with the hat and the gloves and men just tipping their hat to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Anthony: Your parents wanted you to be like her?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Lily: I don't know if they wanted me to be like her but it was taken for granted that I have to be in the medical profession.</span> <span id="s213">I mean it was no question asked; it was just, this is how I was groomed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Anthony: Did you live in a mainly Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Lily: It was a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s216">We lived nearby from the medical faculty of the university.</span> <span id="s217">I remember the riots, it started at the synagogue riots and it was very hard for the Jew to go to a medical university, a medical college.</span> <span id="s218">In Poland, it was different.</span> <span id="s219">When you finished high school, you didn't go to college.</span> <span id="s220">You go right away to university and you had to make up your mind what you wanted to study.</span> <span id="s221">Now here, here you go to college and then you go to medical school or to law school.</span> <span id="s222">Over there, it was different.</span> <span id="s223">It was very hard for a Jew to go in and study medicine.</span> <span id="s224">From the whole school that I went to, it was a private school, just one person was accepted per year for a period of two or three years.</span> <span id="s225">So those few medical students that were in the university studying medicine, Jewish, were really persecuted.</span> <span id="s226">There was a time that they were not allowed to sit.</span> <span id="s227">They were assigned special seats on the left.</span> <span id="s228">They rebelled and they were standing up and they were taking notes during the lecture.</span> <span id="s229">I met some people after liberation that were medical students in Vilna and they were telling me about those times.</span> <span id="s230">I, myself, remember that there were riots and my mother came running to school to pick me up because she was afraid that I should be assaulted by those people that were just rioting nearby where we were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Anthony: Do you know why your parents sent you to a private Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Lily: My parents wanted me to have the best education and this was a very fine school, one of the best.</span> <span id="s233">I wish I could give my children the kind of education that I and my sister had as children.</span> <span id="s234">The professors were very educated; they were highly dedicated.</span> <span id="s235">Most of the students were motivated.</span> <span id="s236">There were some children that went there just to please their parents and tried to get away but we had movies, we had a chemical laboratory, we had a physics laboratory; we had field trips; we had a gym, gym was important; we had all kinds of visual aids to make the education more interesting.</span> <span id="s237">Also when we had French Revolution, they were teaching us about French Revolution.</span> <span id="s238">It was not that they told us about Robespierre and Marat, but we had a mock judgment.</span> <span id="s239">There was a judge assigned; there was somebody who was Marat, who was Robespierre and somebody that was just from the people.</span> <span id="s240">The history, all of a sudden, became alive.</span> <span id="s241">I just recently met a friend of mine that I didn't see for many, many years and we started to talk.</span> <span id="s242">He said he was amazed how alive the French Revolution became when we were students.</span> <span id="s243">Every class had a school paper.</span> <span id="s244">We had to write articles; the class paper was coming out every month.</span> <span id="s245">The best article from the class paper was put in the school paper.</span> <span id="s246">Those articles were amazing.</span> <span id="s247">This is--the atmosphere was very conductive to bring up an intelligent human being.</span> <span id="s248">This is the reason I was sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Anthony: How would you characterize relations between Jews and non-Jews in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Lily: There were a lot of anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s251">I think that I told in the previous interview that my father was really having a very hard time when he went for an exam.</span> <span id="s252">You see, my father was working in a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s253">This was a pharmacy from --a very big pharmacy that was from the city pharmacy.</span> <span id="s254">Every worker that worked had a kind of insurance.</span> <span id="s255">When he needed a prescription, he went to this pharmacy.</span> <span id="s256">It was a very big outfit; it was called “Casa Horich” [phonetic] (324).</span> <span id="s257">It was like a big insurance for the workers.</span> <span id="s258">From this pharmacy was employed a lot of pharmacists, only three Jewish pharmacists were employed.</span> <span id="s259">In 1935, those three pharmacists were told that they don't have enough education; they have to go and pass a test.</span> <span id="s260">They cannot do just a simple pharmacist; they have to have Masters in pharmacy.</span> <span id="s261">It was called Magister der Pharmazie.</span> <span id="s262">Here was my father, a young man, with a wife and two children, and he had to go to work and also study.</span> <span id="s263">I remember that he used to go and dig up all kinds of herbs and study all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s264">He used to close himself and study whatever, he just had a chance.</span> <span id="s265">Then he went for the test.</span> <span id="s266">The test was in the medical faculty of the university.</span> <span id="s267">Unfortunately there was a professor there and his name was Macheski, one of the biggest anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s268">He passed the written test and then he passed the oral test.</span> <span id="s269">As he was coming out, he asked him, by the way, what is the chemical formula for carbonated water?</span> <span id="s270">My father was so unnerved that he got a mental block and he didn't answer him.</span> <span id="s271">He didn't pass the test.</span> <span id="s272">So he had to study again and he had to travel to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s273">He went there and he passed the test there.</span> <span id="s274">I remember when he sent us a telegram, "I passed!"</span> <span id="s275">and it was one of the biggest joys for us.</span> <span id="s276">But it didn't take long and all three Jewish pharmacists were told that they had to go.</span> <span id="s277">They didn't want a Jew to have a civil service job.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Anthony: So even though he got the Masters and he qualified, he still lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Lily: Yes, he lost.</span> <span id="s280">Then we had like a family pow-wow.</span> <span id="s281">He lost the job.</span> <span id="s282">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s283">So it was decided that everybody will help him and he will have to buy a pharmacy because he couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s284">When he went to buy a pharmacy, he found a pharmacy in a place called Soły [Salos], S-o-l-y.</span> <span id="s285">As a Jew, he couldn’t buy the pharmacy so somehow he found a Polish pharmacist whose name was Vishnefski.</span> <span id="s286">He gave him a sum of money, this Vishnefski bought the pharmacy and my father was the owner and he worked there.</span> <span id="s287">This Vishnefski was not even there.</span> <span id="s288">This was in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Anthony: That's when he lost the shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Lily: He lost his job in 1936 or 1937.</span> <span id="s291">For a year or a year and a half, he didn't work.</span> <span id="s292">There were a lot of anti-Semites.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Anthony: Did you notice whether there was any difference between Poles and Lithuanians, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Lily: Well, actually, I didn't get in touch during my childhood too much with Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s295">I started to know Lithuanians when, in 1940, Russia took over and it then became Lithuania.</span> <span id="s296">So for a year, you know, but… also I got in touch with Lithuanians when they were guarding the ghetto.</span> <span id="s297">They were very tall, the: policemen.</span> <span id="s298">We used to call them “aniterate” [?]</span> <span id="s299">(391), this how tall they were.</span> <span id="s300">Lithuanians were also very anti-Semitic, very anti-Semitic, especially those who were sympathizers with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Anthony: If you had to compare the two, would you say that one was worse than the other?</span> <span id="s302">Lithuanian anti-Semitism or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Lily: I would say they were just--both of them were bad.</span> <span id="s304">It is hard to compare.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Anthony: Earlier, you mentioned that there were some anti-Semitic pogroms?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Lily: They were actually not pogroms.</span> <span id="s307">They were riots between the students, between the Polish students and the Jewish students and the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Anthony: But you were protected from all that because you were still going to the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Lily: I was protected because, first of all I was a little girl and I was going to a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Anthony: How about your mother?</span> <span id="s311">Who were her clients?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Lily: My mother had a lot of non-Jewish clients.</span> <span id="s313">I remember that well-to-do Polish landowners used to come to her and they used to come with a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s314">They used to come like the driver used to sit in the front of the house and wait for them.</span> <span id="s315">They were very tall, young men, middle-aged men.</span> <span id="s316">A lot of them used to come with boots and they used to bend down and kiss my mother's hand.</span> <span id="s317">Especially in the springtime, they used to bring her like strawberries or fresh things.</span> <span id="s318">My mother was a very good dentist and she had a very good reputation that she had a very light hand, they used to say, for extraction of the teeth.</span> <span id="s319">She used to make very nice false teeth.</span> <span id="s320">She had a dental mechanic that was working with her.</span> <span id="s321">Those people used to come for miles to her because they used to like her work.</span> <span id="s322">Of course, I mentioned that they trusted her if they came to her.</span> <span id="s323">They used to sometimes bring their wives, children to attend her.</span> <span id="s324">But there was one day that my mother used to do a lot of pro bono work.</span> <span id="s325">Any poor Jewish or non-Jewish people knew that if they have a toothache, they can ring the bell and they can come in.</span> <span id="s326">She would just help them and cure them and do whatever; she would treat them like the most expensive patients and she wouldn't charge them.</span> <span id="s327">She just had this obligation to do good.</span> <span id="s328">As a matter of fact, when I was in concentration camps, I met a few people that said to me, you know, I know you.</span> <span id="s329">I used to see you in your mother's office.</span> <span id="s330">Sometimes I would sneak in.</span> <span id="s331">I used to pretend that I am a helper.</span> <span id="s332">I would just stay in the corner and look.</span> <span id="s333">Apparently they saw me.</span> <span id="s334">You know that your mother didn't charge me at all.</span> <span id="s335">We're poor people and she was just like an angel to us.</span> <span id="s336">One of the women worked in the kitchen and she used to help me because my mother helped her when she was a little girl and she had a toothache.</span> <span id="s337">This is my recollection about the--.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Anthony: A very-loved mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Lily: Yes, a very good person.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Anthony: The poorest classes and the richest classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Lily: Yes.</span> <span id="s342">She always--and I remember her telling me if you see somebody that puts a hand out, you have to put something in it.</span> <span id="s343">We always had a few boxes in our house.</span> <span id="s344">One box was for orphans, one blue box was to buy land for Israel, there was Keren Kayemet.</span> <span id="s345">It was a Hebrew organization and when we used to get allowance, we had to put a few pennies into this box.</span> <span id="s346">When I got older and I started to think about Israel and all the things, I was very much interested in it.</span> <span id="s347">I was very pleased that even my mother was not a Zionist but she had the sense that you have to help; that you have to kind of go out and start to think about your own land if you are to be a whole person.</span> <span id="s348">So charity I learned in my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Anthony: Charity begins at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Lily: Yes, it really began with me at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Anthony: Now 1939 was a very bad year for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Lily: A very bad year.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Anthony: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Lily: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s355">I never saw my mother sick.</span> <span id="s356">Then in 1938, she went to a doctor and she was diagnosed as having cancer.</span> <span id="s357">She was operated on in a very good hospital.</span> <span id="s358">She was opened and closed.</span> <span id="s359">The professor that operated on her called my father and said to him; unfortunately your wife has a month or two to live.</span> <span id="s360">She has cancer of the ovary that it metastasized.</span> <span id="s361">Your two little girls, you have to think about it and you have to say mentally goodbye to her.</span> <span id="s362">Of course, it was a very big tragedy because my parents--they met as students and they had a very good relationship.</span> <span id="s363">My father put my mother on a pedestal and he couldn't believe it because she was never sick.</span> <span id="s364">We were not told about it.</span> <span id="s365">We were very sheltered.</span> <span id="s366">My aunt Sonia kind of took over.</span> <span id="s367">My mother was brought home; there was a hospital bed there and every day, she was taken for radiation treatments.</span> <span id="s368">Sometimes, I would skip school and I was going with her for the radiation treatment.</span> <span id="s369">She was taking it very bad.</span> <span id="s370">She was very nauseous and we used to save a piece of herring for her after the treatment; something to--the nausea should go away.</span> <span id="s371">I was very, very distressed about it.</span> <span id="s372">I don't think my sister realized what was going on but I understood and after a while, a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s373">She kind of had a relapse, just happened to feel better.</span> <span id="s374">When she was sick, she was lying in this big salon, this big waiting area and the dog, Rex, was just lying there.</span> <span id="s375">We had to disconnect the bell because people wouldn't let go.</span> <span id="s376">The patients just wanted to come and say hello to her and she needed all her privacy and she couldn't continue her practice.</span> <span id="s377">But as soon as she got better, she recovered, and she started to practice again.</span> <span id="s378">She started slowly but all of a sudden, everybody came back.</span> <span id="s379">It was very anxious for her to resume practice.</span> <span id="s380">Maybe for four or five months, everything came to normal and then she had a relapse.</span> <span id="s381">After a month, again the hospital bed came and May 24th, she passed away.</span> <span id="s382">My aunt Sonia, who was a midwife and a nurse, took care of her.</span> <span id="s383">She was giving her all medication but there was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s384">I remember, you know in Jewish tradition, you sit Shiva and my mother passed away on a Thursday.</span> <span id="s385">It was the first day of a Jewish holiday called Shavuot which is a very happy holiday.</span> <span id="s386">Saturday morning, my little friends came to take me out and it was in May.</span> <span id="s387">It was a beautiful, beautiful day.</span> <span id="s388">In May in Vilna, the lilacs were blooming; the smell in the air was incredible.</span> <span id="s389">The birds were singing and the sun was shining and I was walking on the sidewalk with my little friends and I said, my God, the world goes on and my mother is not there.</span> <span id="s390">I also have to mention to you that my mother had a very big funeral.</span> <span id="s391">People that knew her; all the patients came, all the students from the school from me and from my sister's and we had a problem with Rex because he wanted to go behind.</span> <span id="s392">He had just--had to be taken away.</span> <span id="s393">I remember when my mother passed away it was maybe like four o' clock in the morning, and in my ear is this terrible howling of this dog.</span> <span id="s394">This dog was howling, inhuman.</span> <span id="s395">When I woke, up and my aunt that was present, started to cry.</span> <span id="s396">Then this dog has to be taken out of the house and then I realize that I lost my mother.</span> <span id="s397">It was a very, very hard time for me.</span> <span id="s398">I was always a good student but because I was going for the treatments with my mother, my grades fell down.</span> <span id="s399">The teacher came to pay me a visit and he says to me you should come back to school and improve your grades.</span> <span id="s400">What's going on?</span> <span id="s401">After all you were always like a very good student.</span> <span id="s402">I said to him, I'm sorry I just cannot do it.</span> <span id="s403">My world ended and I just cannot do it.</span> <span id="s404">He said to me all right, maybe after the summer, he says, we will put you like kind of probation.</span> <span id="s405">We won't give you the bad grade because this is not you.</span> <span id="s406">After the summer, you will pass the exams, and then we will give you the report card.</span> <span id="s407">I says, all right but I just couldn't bring myself back to go to school because the school year ended June 20, so I still had plenty of time to go, I just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s408">This summer was a very sad summer for me because me and my sister and our nanny, we were sent to Soły [Salos] where my father had the pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Tape One, Side B Anthony: So it's the summer of 1939, and you're in Soły [Salos]?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Lily: Yes, I'm in Soły [Salos].</span> <span id="s411">It was a very big adjustment for us because all of a sudden we met different youngsters and different people.</span> <span id="s412">We were very heartbroken.</span> <span id="s413">We were very grateful that my aunt could stay with us for a month which was kind of our link.</span> <span id="s414">She became our second mother; she took over very swiftly.</span> <span id="s415">Then we were preparing ourselves; in September the school was supposed to resume.</span> <span id="s416">I was sitting in a hammock; it was September 1, I think, reading a book.</span> <span id="s417">All of a sudden my nanny came running and she said your father wants you to come over right away to the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s418">This where we found out that the war broke out and the Germans were invading.</span> <span id="s419">Then the pandemonium broke because all of a sudden Soły [Salos] became White Russia and we were isolated from Vilna.</span> <span id="s420">My aunt sent somebody to take both of us to her; we should go to school there.</span> <span id="s421">But my father said no, they have to be with me.</span> <span id="s422">We had to stay in White Russia.</span> <span id="s423">I was sent to the school in Ashmyana because there was no high school there and my sister was going to a school in Soły [Salos].</span> <span id="s424">This is--.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Anthony: Goodbye Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Lily: Yes.</span> <span id="s427">During the vacation, my father sent us to my aunt because we were missing her a lot.</span> <span id="s428">We went there and we stayed there during the winter vacation for a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Anthony: In Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Lily: In Vilna, yes.</span> <span id="s431">But I just didn't find anything because most--it was just not the Vilna that I remembered.</span> <span id="s432">It became completely different so that when we came back, we were staying till 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Anthony: In Soły [Salos]?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Lily: Yes--no, not in Soły [Salos] because when the Russian came, my father didn't get a passport because he was bourgeois.</span> <span id="s435">He was the owner of the pharmacy so he was persecuted by the Russian also.</span> <span id="s436">They took away the pharmacy and they sent us to a small village called Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Świętokrzyski].</span> <span id="s437">Over there, he became the manager.</span> <span id="s438">My sister had to go to a school there and I was still in Ashmyana.</span> <span id="s439">In 1941, the war, when the Germans took over, we were in Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Świętokrzyski].</span> <span id="s440">From there, me and my sister escaped back to Vilna and then my father came.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Anthony: Now your aunt Sonia, she was your mother's older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Lily: Older sister, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Anthony: Could you tell us a little bit more about her?</span> <span id="s444">She was a midwife and a nurse in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Lily: Yes.</span> <span id="s446">My mother and my aunt Sonia were very close.</span> <span id="s447">There was not a day that they didn't see each other.</span> <span id="s448">When my Aunt Sonia was a young girl, she was romantically involved with one of the leaders of the revolution.</span> <span id="s449">As a matter of fact, she escaped her father's house and she wanted like a set-up, they believed in free-love, and she wanted like to set up house with this young revolutionary.</span> <span id="s450">But my grandfather put his foot down.</span> <span id="s451">He came and took her practically by the hand and said that no daughter of mine will do this thing.</span> <span id="s452">She was a very good-looking woman.</span> <span id="s453">For the longest time she didn't have a boyfriend, she was not interested, she was just interested in the profession.</span> <span id="s454">She married late in life and her wedding was in our house.</span> <span id="s455">She met this very nice young fellow whose name was Joseph Persky.</span> <span id="s456">After the wedding, after the honeymoon, they set up house, not far from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Anthony: This was before your mother died?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Lily: This was before my--.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Anthony: During the 1930's?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Lily: Yes, the 1930's.</span> <span id="s461">I was very close with her because there was not a day that she didn't come to our house or we didn't go to her.</span> <span id="s462">She never had children and she was very, very dedicated to both of us and, of course, to my mother.</span> <span id="s463">My mother had also an older sister, her name was Esther.</span> <span id="s464">She was married with two children but there was a very big binding with those two sisters.</span> <span id="s465">Actually, after my mother passed away, she took her place.</span> <span id="s466">When we escaped from Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Świętokrzyski] and me and my sister came as the little two peasant girls, we came to her house.</span> <span id="s467">We were staying in her house; she was very good to us.</span> <span id="s468">We found shelter and comfort in her house and my father also stayed in her house.</span> <span id="s469">With her, we went to the ghetto when the Jews from Vilna were sent to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s470">The whole time in ghetto, we were together, me and my sister and my aunt and my father.</span> <span id="s471">My aunt and my sister slept in one bed and my father slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s472">She was working in the Jewish Hospital as a nurse.</span> <span id="s473">She was very instrumental in saving, actually, my life because I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s474">I told about it so I don't want to repeat it.</span> <span id="s475">But she took me out from the hospital just in time when the Germans were asking for 500 people, Jews, from the commander of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s476">He, in order to save able-bodied Jews, said to them, send them sick people from the hospital.</span> <span id="s477">She, being a nurse, found out just the night before she took me out.</span> <span id="s478">The whole time during the liquidation of the ghetto, we were together.</span> <span id="s479">When we came to the Rosa Cemetery, there was a selection.</span> <span id="s480">My sister looked very, very young so my aunt took off a pair of shoes with heels and she gave it to my sister.</span> <span id="s481">Also she stuffed her bosom with a pair of socks.</span> <span id="s482">We were all three going together.</span> <span id="s483">I don't know how it happened but we got separated from my aunt.</span> <span id="s484">She was sent to the left and both of us were sent to the right.</span> <span id="s485">When I realized that she was sent to the left, I became hysterical and I was running back to the left.</span> <span id="s486">A German SS man with a rifle beat me over the head and says to me, you are too young.</span> <span id="s487">You have to work for the Fatherland.</span> <span id="s488">Took me off the floor and there were some other girls just took me away and I never saw my aunt again.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Anthony: Do you remember that date?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Lily: I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s491">It was September 23, 1943; it was the day of the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s492">This was the last time that I saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Anthony: Mr. Persky, her husband, was he separated earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Lily: He was a merchant.</span> <span id="s495">He had a business in wild mushrooms and furs.</span> <span id="s496">He had a lot of contact with peasant, buying from them, the wild mushrooms.</span> <span id="s497">Also, he didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s498">He looked very much like a Pole.</span> <span id="s499">So before--when they send notices that they next day they send us to the ghetto, he called my aunt and said to her, he's not going to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s500">He's going to the country.</span> <span id="s501">He want her to go with him.</span> <span id="s502">But she said she cannot separate herself from the children and also my father and both of us, me and my sister, we look very Jewish.</span> <span id="s503">He could take just one, her, but not us.</span> <span id="s504">She said that she is going with us to the ghetto and this was the sacrifice that she made.</span> <span id="s505">Because I always think that maybe if she would went with him to the country, he would be alive.</span> <span id="s506">When I survived, I was searching for him.</span> <span id="s507">I was asking about him, but I could never find a trace, because he was very good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Anthony: So you don't know whether he survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Lily: I don't know, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Anthony: When your aunt was young, did she also attend the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Lily: Yes, she attended the university, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Anthony: The same one as your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Lily: I don't know because--.</span> <span id="s514">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s515">I know that there was always talk that she was with the students, with her romance, with this revolution.</span> <span id="s516">There was always like family secrets and things like this about my stern grandfather who put his foot down but I don't know this I don't know.</span> <span id="s517">I imagine because this is what they were sent to study so I imagine but I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Anthony: Now your father, these are bad years for your father, the loss of his job, the loss of his wife, then loss of the next job, and being forced to move.</span> <span id="s519">Now what happens to him during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Lily: What time of--?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Anthony: He was in Soły [Salos] and then he loses the pharmacy because he's too bourgeois.</span> <span id="s522">Then he is forced to move to Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Świętokrzyski], where he just was an employee--.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Lily: He was a manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Anthony: Manager?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Lily: Yes.</span> <span id="s526">He was a manager and it was a small pharmacy and he was the only one that worked but he didn't own it.</span> <span id="s527">Of course it was very hard years for him.</span> <span id="s528">He developed a lot of friendship with the doctors that used to come, the Russian doctors used to come for the medicine over there.</span> <span id="s529">Since he spoke Russian--but when the German came, there was some Russian doctor that wanted to take us deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s530">He didn't want to do it because he said that during the war, you have to have a roof above your head so he didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s531">But as soon as the Russian left and the German came, a lot of pogroms started against the Jews, against the Jews in Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Świętokrzyski].</span> <span id="s532">When the Russian were there, the Polish landowners suffered a lot because they were just the same bourgeois.</span> <span id="s533">When they used to come to the pharmacy, there was a room in the back where my father used to prepare their medicines and they used to congregate there.</span> <span id="s534">They used to come--they could freely talk without being observed by the communists.</span> <span id="s535">They were kind of friendly so when the pogroms started, one of them came and said that you should take our belongings and he will save us and he will take us to this big house that he said belonged (one word unclear).</span> <span id="s536">So my father and my sister put some belongings on their wagon and he took them going there to this big house.</span> <span id="s537">On the way, they were accosted by twenty Poles and my father was put against a tree, blindfolded and they wanted to shot him in the presence of my little sister.</span> <span id="s538">They just hurt him but we suspected that it was arranged by the landowner who wanted just to take the belongings that my father was taking and scare him.</span> <span id="s539">When my father came home, I was waiting for him.</span> <span id="s540">When I saw him bleeding, we understood that they were just false people that want to take advantage and they want to take our furniture, our bedding, whatever we had there.</span> <span id="s541">My father went to the rabbi of the house, of the little town and said to him that if we could sleep a few nights there because our life is in danger.</span> <span id="s542">The rabbi let us stay over there.</span> <span id="s543">About two days later, he sent both of us with a peasant to Vilna and then he waited two days and then--we became--.</span> <span id="s544">Those were very hard times for him.</span> <span id="s545">First of all, he believed in those people that wanted to save us and it was a very big let-down that only for material thing but it was morally, he lost faith.</span> <span id="s546">He was like--here he was a Jew in Poland; then he was persecuted by the Russian as a bourgeois; then with somebody who was supposed to be his friend, whom he did favors, let him also down.</span> <span id="s547">It was--.</span> <span id="s548">When my father came to Vilna, he was walking, he walked.</span> <span id="s549">From all the aggravation, he developed a very big abscess right here in the back.</span> <span id="s550">He went to the hospital and when it came the time of liquidation of the Jewish population and everybody was sent, we were actually separated.</span> <span id="s551">I went to the ghetto with my aunt and my sister and my father was already in the ghetto because the Jewish hospital was there.</span> <span id="s552">He was desperate because he was operated on and he was lying in bed and he thought that he lost his two little girls and his sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s553">Somehow, somebody that knew us came to visit him in the hospital and told him that we are alive.</span> <span id="s554">He was still in bad shape when he came out from the hospital and we were in the ghetto together.</span> <span id="s555">After he got a little better, he got a job as a pharmacist in a--it was called the Spanish lazareth, the pharmacy and he worked there for a time.</span> <span id="s556">Later on, it was liquidated and he worked in the hospital pharmacy in ghetto.</span> <span id="s557">I was sick in the hospital with the infection and my father was taken out by the Gestapo in his white coat, from the pharmacy with another group of people from the hospital staff, and they were sent to a labor camp in Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Anthony: You remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Lily: The liquidation of the ghetto was in September in 1943 and this was during the summer in 1943.</span> <span id="s560">I saw once, my father, later on.</span> <span id="s561">When I was in labor camp, Dünawerke, it was nearby of Kaiserwald [did not specify whether Kaiserwald camp or town of Kaiserwald, now Mezaparks], once a woman came and said, you know, I met somebody who says he is David Mazur and he was crying going around there looking for his two daughters, little girls.</span> <span id="s562">I said that I know you because when we had a very bad toothache, from the labor camp they used to send us to Kaiserwald, to this German dentist, and she had a very bad toothache.</span> <span id="s563">She went and she met him.</span> <span id="s564">I really don't know exactly how they met but he was desperate.</span> <span id="s565">When he heard there are women from Vilna, he was looking for us.</span> <span id="s566">He was sent from Estonia to this concentration camp, Kaiserwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Anthony: Kaiserwald, where you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Lily: Yes, we go Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s569">The next day I went and I pretended that I have a very bad toothache and I went to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s570">I risked my life and I found him.</span> <span id="s571">Before I went there, I collected some bread and I brought him bread.</span> <span id="s572">When I saw him, I didn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s573">He was wearing the striped uniform and all of a sudden he shrunk and I mean that it was just somebody that was not my father.</span> <span id="s574">We were standing behind the wall because women and men were not supposed to--Jewish women and men were not supposed to communicate even.</span> <span id="s575">We were standing and he asked me where is my sister?</span> <span id="s576">I think it was the time when my sister was very sick with rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s577">This was the reason she didn't come and she was in a small like a--it was called a krankenrevier, in this labor camp.</span> <span id="s578">I said that she was all right and that she's with me together.</span> <span id="s579">He said, look after we will survive, I want you to come to the pharmacy in Soły [Salos] and this is where we are to meet.</span> <span id="s580">When you come there, the only thing I ask you, you should bring me your good name.</span> <span id="s581">I understand he meant that he wants to see me and my sister, two virgins, he meant.</span> <span id="s582">He says to me, I don't need so much bread, I need cigarettes.</span> <span id="s583">He wanted to smoke.</span> <span id="s584">Can you come tomorrow again?</span> <span id="s585">I came back and I asked again and somehow they let me come.</span> <span id="s586">I remember that my friends there that worked in the labor camp, we collected warm socks and gloves and also got some tobacco and paper and I was so happy because when we were working in the labor camp, there were also some day workers.</span> <span id="s587">They asked them for this tobacco and they gave it to them.</span> <span id="s588">They were Latvian day workers, and also prisoners of war from Holland.</span> <span id="s589">The next day when I came there and I was looking for him but he wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Anthony: You don't know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Lily: I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s592">I was searching for him after we survived.</span> <span id="s593">I was on my way to Soły [Salos] but we never--.</span> <span id="s594">It's a long story, we never got there.</span> <span id="s595">There were some rumors that he survived and that he is in Russia but it was never confirmed.</span> <span id="s596">I could never, never, ---.</span> <span id="s597">So actually the last time that I can say that I was in touch with my father was in Kaiserwald concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Anthony: The day that you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Lily: That I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Anthony: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Lily: We arrived in Kaiserwald sometime in September.</span> <span id="s602">It must have been in 1943, in fall of 1943, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Anthony: Ironically, he was acting as a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Lily: No, he wasn't acting--.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Anthony: He was the pharmacist but--?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Lily: No, no.</span> <span id="s607">He was brought from Estonia to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s608">He was not acting as a dentist.</span> <span id="s609">I was brought--.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Anthony: You were pretending to be--?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Lily: No, no.</span> <span id="s612">I was--you see when we worked in the labor camp, Dünawerke, when we had a very bad toothache, we had permission to go to visit a German dentist in Kaiserwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Anthony: And that's how you saw your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Lily: This is how I saw because I escaped; I didn't go to the dentist.</span> <span id="s615">I escaped and I was roaming around in their camp asking around, where is the contingent of men that were shipped from Estonia to Kaiserwald?</span> <span id="s616">They show me the place and I just went there and I looked for my father.</span> <span id="s617">I met him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Anthony: Was he still acting as a pharmacist or was he just a--?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Lily: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Anthony: Just a prisoner in a uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Lily: No, no.</span> <span id="s622">The first thing that they stripped the professional, Jewish people from their profession.</span> <span id="s623">They were just treated like dirt, like laborers, like slaves.</span> <span id="s624">They were stripped away from their human dignity.</span> <span id="s625">This was the first thing, was to break their spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Anthony: So after he left the ghetto, he was no longer a pharmacist?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Lily: No, he was not a pharmacist; he was just a simple slave, doing slave work.</span> <span id="s628">.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Anthony: Now your story, I'm very familiar with your story and with your sister's story as well.</span> <span id="s630">Are there any major differences between your sister's story and yours after--?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Lily: We were always together.</span> <span id="s632">I think we survived because we were together.</span> <span id="s633">We helped each other.</span> <span id="s634">During the incarcerations time, I was the one that was helping her.</span> <span id="s635">After liberation, when I was very sick, she recovered sooner and she was--kind of took over and she became the older sister.</span> <span id="s636">But I think that because we were together, it gave us strength and this helped us a lot, too, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Anthony: You could give each other moral support and also physical support?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Lily: Physical support is kind of--we were looking out for each other.</span> <span id="s639">There was the loneliness and abandonment--is a very big moral deterrent.</span> <span id="s640">We kind of stuck together.</span> <span id="s641">At night, when we slept, we were always together so this kind of gave us strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Anthony: So other than when you were sick, you were never separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Lily: No.</span> <span id="s644">My sister had a very hard time in ghetto because she was there, she was a little girl, and she was very, very hungry, very undernourished.</span> <span id="s645">She didn't have her friends, she didn't know what to do with herself; she was mostly spending that time waiting for me or my aunt or my father to come back and bring her something to eat.</span> <span id="s646">My sister, even now, is very, very depressed.</span> <span id="s647">She is under a psychiatrist's care because she suffers very strong bouts of depression.</span> <span id="s648">She's always admiring me that I remember so well because she doesn't remember.</span> <span id="s649">She just simply does not remember things.</span> <span id="s650">I don't know if it's she blocked it out or it was intentional but when she needs something what happened, she has to ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Anthony: You became like her mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Lily: Yes, I assumed the role of her mother after liberation.</span> <span id="s653">Even today I kind of have the mother role.</span> <span id="s654">I never thought that we will be separated but she is now in Argentina.</span> <span id="s655">But imagine, she was born in 1928, so in 1939, she was just eleven years old.</span> <span id="s656">The whole world crumbled around her and she was just--.</span> <span id="s657">I was never a teenager also but she was never even a child and a teenager, so many lost years from 1939 to 1945, six years lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Anthony: She had hardly any schooling, two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Lily: She hardly had any school, yes.</span> <span id="s660">She was always very much alive and there was no joy in her life.</span> <span id="s661">I mean it was just misery and misery and hunger and cold.</span> <span id="s662">It was six years of indescribable suffering, moral and physical.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Anthony: Just the moving around, even if the other horrors hadn't occurred.</span> <span id="s664">Just the moving around and the loss--.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Lily: Uprooting, uprooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Anthony: That's right--would have been traumatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Lily: That's right, she lost everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Anthony: She lost her mother, and then she lost, in a sense, her aunt/stepmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Lily: Yes, she lost her father, she lost her house, she lost her friends, she lost her school, she lost her ballet, I mean the piano lessons.</span> <span id="s670">Everything that is important--her little friends, everything that is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Anthony: Then from time to time, she almost lost you?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Lily: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Anthony: That must have been frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Lily: Yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Anthony: But you were liberated and you survived.</span> <span id="s676">At the end of the war, you made some attempt to go back to Soły [Salos] but--?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Lily: No.</span> <span id="s678">When we came into Łódź, we were told that if we cross the River Bok and we go to the Russians, we will never come out from there.</span> <span id="s679">There is no point for us to go there.</span> <span id="s680">We have to stay with the West.</span> <span id="s681">I met somebody from Vilna that was older.</span> <span id="s682">She was one of the medical students that I told you about it.</span> <span id="s683">We decided that we should stay in the West and we never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Anthony: You emigrated to the United States and your sister went to ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Lily: No, no.</span> <span id="s686">I didn't immigrate.</span> <span id="s687">I was in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s688">I was for a year, sick, very sick.</span> <span id="s689">After we recovered, we were on our way to Soły [Salos] and we went to Łódź.</span> <span id="s690">In Łódź, we were in a kibbutz for orphans that will be sent to Israel.</span> <span id="s691">We were going on our way to the kibbutz, emigrating from Poland to Czechoslovakia on our way to Israel.</span> <span id="s692">From Czechoslovakia, we went to Italy.</span> <span id="s693">We had to cross the Alps.</span> <span id="s694">We were crossing the Alps Christmas time.</span> <span id="s695">When we came to Italy, we were put in a DP camp, a Displaced Persons camp.</span> <span id="s696">There we were on our way to Israel.</span> <span id="s697">Then my uncle, my father's younger brother found us.</span> <span id="s698">He told us that you'll go to Israel late; he made us papers as Christians, as Protestants and we were brought to Argentina.</span> <span id="s699">There my sister and my husband.</span> <span id="s700">I met my husband in Italy.</span> <span id="s701">We were in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</span> <span id="s702">We were there for nine and a half years.</span> <span id="s703">Then me and my husband and my two sons who were born in Argentina emigrated.</span> <span id="s704">My sister remained--she was supposed to come but she never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Anthony: When did you arrive in Argentina?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Lily: In Argentina, I arrived in June, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Anthony: Then you and your family came to the United States in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Lily: On October 30, 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Anthony: Argentina also being America, we keep forgetting that.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Lily: South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Anthony: South America, yes.</span> <span id="s712">And your sister has also raised a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Lily: Yes, my sister has a husband and three children.</span> <span id="s714">She has two sons and a daughter.</span> <span id="s715">The older son graduated his degree in political science and is an economist but he doesn't work in his profession.</span> <span id="s716">The younger son is a medical doctor.</span> <span id="s717">He married and has two children; the older son, he's married to a psychologist.</span> <span id="s718">Her younger daughter, the only daughter, lives in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s719">She met her future husband in Israel and she has three little boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Anthony: How many children did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Lily: I have two sons.</span> <span id="s722">My sons are not married.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Anthony: Not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Lily: Not yet.</span> <span id="s725">I hope they will.</span> <span id="s726">They are very good sons but they are not married.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Anthony: Did either of them become a medical doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Lily: No.</span> <span id="s729">My youngest son was pre-med and then changed his major and finished Boston College in communication.</span> <span id="s730">At the present time, he is literary agent working in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s731">He represents producers and writers--writers, producers--and directors working in TV and movies.</span> <span id="s732">My oldest son is a probation officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Anthony: Probation officer.</span> <span id="s734">In the New York area?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Lily: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Anthony: There's a lot of need for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Lily: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Anthony: I see a little irony in that your sister produced the doctor so far?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Lily: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s740">Very nice doctor, very nice young man visiting us--very nice family.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Anthony: Is there anything else that we forgot, either today or in the last interview that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Lily: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s743">There are so many things that you can talk about.</span> <span id="s744">You can talk for days and days.</span> <span id="s745">There's really no end.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Anthony: Your testimony is detailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Lily: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s748">I think the testimony that there were songs composed.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Anthony: Yes and the poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Lily: The poem, the songs composed.</span> <span id="s751">I want it to be, this is a very important part that--.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Anthony: They'll need someone who can write it and listen to it--transcribe it because I notice those lines were left blank on the transcript that you interviewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Lily: It would be nice if somebody could--because I sang those things so it would be nice if they would transcribe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Anthony: Apparently whoever did the transcription only knew English so it was left blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Lily: Oh, you mean the words.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Anthony: Yes, the words are in --?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Lily: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Anthony: Yiddish, yes.</span> <span id="s759">But I'm sure they will be transcribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Lily: I heard that you have a musical department.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Anthony: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Lily: I think it would be good if they would transcribe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Anthony: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s764">In fact, I can say this.</span> <span id="s765">Some of the songs are being collected and I think that, without having heard yours, yours should be included.</span> <span id="s766">Several other songs, I know, have been recorded and passed on with the words.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Lily: They should be included because this is a very important part.</span> <span id="s768">Some of the songs, I saw the “triptych” [?]</span> <span id="s769">(470) of the life and the hopes--.</span> <span id="s770">After all, we were very young at this time, it should be included, and it’s a very important part.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Anthony: Do you listen to NPR, All Things Considered?</span> <span id="s772">NPR is All Things Considered on public radio, national public radio.</span> <span id="s773">WNYC?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Lily: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Anthony: There was a program a few months ago which summarized and played excerpts from a recording that the museum produced.</span> <span id="s776">Ghetto songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Lily: Oh, I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Anthony: Including, I recall, including from Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Lily: Oh, yeah?</span> <span id="s780">I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Anthony: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s782">I know that now they're on sale.</span> <span id="s783">They have audio and compact discs, recordings.</span> <span id="s784">What I should do is, as soon as our interview is complete, I should take down the name of the song and then put you in touch or put the woman who's in charge of the music in touch with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Lily: I gave them the songs and everything.</span> <span id="s786">I gave them.</span> <span id="s787">I have someplace--I have copies here.</span> <span id="s788">I would be more than pleased to give it to you because this is a very important part and I think it should be included, it should documented.</span> <span id="s789">I don't want it to be lost because this is the homage of those people in those difficult circumstances, still have the spirit to compose and to write, and beautifully write.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Anthony: And then sing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Lily: Sing it, yes.</span> <span id="s792">We were singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Anthony: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Lily: You are welcome.</span></p></body></html>
