it was at the strait between Denmark and Sweden - harbor, sailing and we had a little work.</span> <span id="s24">It was very fresh and very good and maybe healthy life.</span> <span id="s25">Had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What uh what were your parents like?</span> <span id="s27">Tell me about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Uh well, I'm grown up by my grandmother who at the year, at the age of 60 suddenly because of divorces and death got five grandchildren to bring up.</span> <span id="s29">And one is living here in Washington, in the Crystal town outside.</span> <span id="s30">Another lives in Paris and my sister and I live in Denmark.</span> <span id="s31">So we are spread a little bit.</span> <span id="s32">But we had a wonderful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I went to school in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s35">That was an old tradition.</span> <span id="s36">And uh on our school, uh school in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s37">That's , uh south of there in the must be six, sixth year and uh then we go up to high school and gra... when you can graduate from that school and go to college afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: As a child growing up and going to school in Copenhagen, uh what were your relationships if any with Jewish students in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I tell you I didn't knew they were Jews.</span> <span id="s40">.</span> <span id="s41">Not many but but uh two in my class.</span> <span id="s42">I didn't know they were Jews.</span> <span id="s43">They were uh they were my school pals, nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Schoolmates.</span> <span id="s45">There was no distinction between a Jew and a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s46">They were Danes and in our society there was no, you couldn't say that's a Jew, that's not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: As you got older, uh what did you hear about uh if anything in the early thirties, uh mid- thirties, about Germany and about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Uh well, the most I recall that Germany always our enemy number one, and what happened in Germany was very very bad for Denmark.</span> <span id="s49">You know when you have the tiger at the doorstep you have to be very careful of it.</span> <span id="s50">There was not the possibility to say quite a lot against him and probably - I can tell you that in Denmark, uh the highest of the three percent who voted for Nazi parti.</span> <span id="s51">.</span> <span id="s52">the Nazis.</span> <span id="s53">And we were neighbors so Denmark is an old country with an old democratic tradition.</span> <span id="s54">Every form of dictatorship whether it is fascism, communism, that's that's not Danish.</span> <span id="s55">So I don't think - of course we were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: How as a child, as a young chi... young boy, did you feel the fear and feel the concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, because we were foolish enough to believe when you have a non-aggression treaty with a man, he will keep it.</span> <span id="s58">That's the way we live.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Tell me about the German invasion, for you.</span> <span id="s60">What was it like?</span> <span id="s61">When did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It was really exciting because in the morning I saw the most aircrafts I ever saw.</span> <span id="s63">You know in in '40 to see an airplane - that was something.</span> <span id="s64">And one morning there was hundreds going from Copenhagen near us to and then going back over Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s65">And while I was had to go to school, and I knew nothing about the invasion, the occupation.</span> <span id="s66">But when I came to Copenhagen, to the station there, the German soldiers were there and we were shocked.</span> <span id="s67">Really shocked because we had no idea about it.</span> <span id="s68">Nothing.</span> <span id="s69">There was no shooting you know.</span> <span id="s70">Uh I suppose that thirteen Danish soldiers was killed during the invasion.</span> <span id="s71">There was, well, we couldn't stand anything against the Hitler war machine.</span> <span id="s72">We had I suppose ten thousand soldiers in Denmark and well, they put ten times as much through Denmark to - his main uh goal was to conquer Norway and they did that too you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What happened to you?</span> <span id="s74">The year is 1940.</span> <span id="s75">You're a 14 year old boy.</span> <span id="s76">What did you do after the - what was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, there was not a big change.</span> <span id="s78">The only thing happening which was really, you you saw it at the same time, was the black-out.</span> <span id="s79">From one day to another, you had to black- out.</span> <span id="s80">Denmark was totally blacked-out.</span> <span id="s81">And maybe you'll understand how it was later to stand in the blacked-out beach in Denmark and look three miles over the straits, the water demarking Denmark from Sweden, where the lights were just like pearls on a string.</span> <span id="s82">It was so fantastic uh but the first thing there was the black-out.</span> <span id="s83">And then of course there were lack of goods and uh there was no connection with England anymore, and our biggest trade partner and uh - but in the beginning the Germans tried to act just like human beings.</span> <span id="s84">There was what, we should be the model.</span> <span id="s85">We were the vikings, and we should be - I don't know what he wanted us to be - but there was not, you was not disturbed much by the Germans in the day-to-day, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: When did that change for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Well, for me, you see we were shocked to lost our freedom and every resistance movement first part - I was only 15 when I started - it was to be a messenger boy.</span> <span id="s88">Deliver for papers.</span> <span id="s89">Illegal papers of course.</span> <span id="s90">Because the first thing you really noticed is that all the news are censored.</span> <span id="s91">You only hear what the Germans, the Germans wanted you to hear.</span> <span id="s92">And therefore it was important to keep the real messages, to give the real news and that was to be duplicated and brought out by boys like me and it is of elder people but that was the way we started and it was the beginning to the resistance movement in Denmark, before the , before anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: How did you get recruited?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, one of our teachers was uh became rather a famous figure in the resistance movement and uh as I went to school in Copenhagen, lived forty kilometers from there, I was a very good guy to have to put from one place to another.</span> <span id="s95">And then later on it was, we couldn't have all the papers with us on the train, then we duplicated our own papers and brought around.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Who was your teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: .</span> <span id="s98">Heard about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So this was going on then for a while?</span> <span id="s100">A: For a couple, for one year, two years.</span> <span id="s101">Q: When did it start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, some of my friends, they went in to the more heavy uh stuff in the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s103">Started the sabotage.</span> <span id="s104">Started - and that annoyed the Germans very much because because of course small thing that we could do but the Germans wanted to stop the sabotage and uh they demanded that the Danish government who had cooperated very much with the Germans to uh make uh death penalty for sabotage.</span> <span id="s105">That wouldn't, the Danish government accept and they signed and the Germans took over and that was the really beginning to what's happening later.</span> <span id="s106">From uh the 29th of August in '43 - that's a very point, the day it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What were you doing at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: School boy.</span> <span id="s109">Doing what I've done all the time.</span> <span id="s110">I was not in the sabotage groups.</span> <span id="s111">We only had the papers and we thought that was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: You have described the change in the beginning of the government.</span> <span id="s113">Uh how did it become for you more involved in helping the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: When the uh Jewish New Year, about the first of October, uh we heard that the Germans would arrest the Jews and one day, it was the 2nd or 3rd of October, one of the leaders from the , uh asked me to be there and there, uh to follow, to fetch some Jews from the station in Snegerstein to bring them to a special, specially .</span> <span id="s115">I did that and from there it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How did you feel?</span> <span id="s117">Talk about that.</span> <span id="s118">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I thought, these poor devils.</span> <span id="s120">What are we going to do with them?</span> <span id="s121">See that, I think that's ridiculous that people are hunted not because they are criminals.</span> <span id="s122">Our Jewish, the Danish Jews, were no criminals no where.</span> <span id="s123">They were not in the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s124">They were hunted because of an insane philosophy that your human values are depending on the shape of you nose and the color of your hair.</span> <span id="s125">Nonsense.</span> <span id="s126">That's ridiculous, and we have, you must recall that part about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s127">It was no secret anymore.</span> <span id="s128">We didn't know the full awful truth about the concentration camps but we knew so much that we could imagine the fate our fellow citizens were meet down there with , humiliation, starvation, and we have heard about the "final solution", .</span> <span id="s129">There there was no doubt you had nothing else to do but do what you could in order to avoid that the Germans succeed in their thoughts to the Danish Jews that was our fellow citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So you had, you had helped once.</span> <span id="s131">Did you continue helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: .</span> <span id="s133">Then you are hooked.</span> <span id="s134">And then later on I had to bring them to the shore and later on I had to follow them to Sweden a couple of times and well, you you know it just accelerates a little bit and you do one thing and do another thing and then you can be useful there.</span> <span id="s135">You could be useful there.</span> <span id="s136">That's that's the way it goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What did bringing them to the shore entail?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well, if you - it happened this way in Snegerstein - that uh two or three or four lived in one house, was hiding there.</span> <span id="s139">And then we tried to be quite sure there was no German police, no German soldiers, no Danish uh corroborators, and we brought them down to the shore where the boat was waiting.</span> <span id="s140">We knew exactly when the boat would be there.</span> <span id="s141">We had some - the boat was normally stationed in Sweden and we had every day that point there and there at that time.</span> <span id="s142">And then the boat would go in and and we could uh have our passengers aboard.</span> <span id="s143">But it was very safe because we did everything possible to secure the way from the houses down to the beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: What did secure mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: That they were not captured.</span> <span id="s146">That we were able to see there were no uh on the way.</span> <span id="s147">Also they had to react in a special way - very silent.</span> <span id="s148">Uh we had a problem with children sometimes but we have Doctor .</span> <span id="s149">He gave them injection, the children.</span> <span id="s150">But he was very afraid sometimes because he said I don't know this patient - how much can I do, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s151">It was, they came over all and we never lost a passenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: You said you went on some trips.</span> <span id="s153">(Yes.)</span> <span id="s154">What was your role?</span> <span id="s155">What did you do?</span> <span id="s156">A: It's, first of all to carry some things and well, some times they ordered me to - I'm a , I've been sailing all my life, so have an order to go from there to there and elsewhere to clean up the boats.</span> <span id="s157">If you can imagine how the boat is when a dozen of refugees afraid, what they leave after in the the cabin was well, I can still recall the smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What did you do when you would get to Sweden with the boat load of passengers?</span> <span id="s159">A: What I would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Un-hum.</span> <span id="s161">What was your role?</span> <span id="s162">Did you take them any further?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No no no.</span> <span id="s164">I uh returned - I only went over by when we had the possibility to go two or three trips a night.</span> <span id="s165">Because as I told you, in the daytime the boat was was situated in in Sweden.</span> <span id="s166">But sometimes we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s167">and the German patrol boat is far away.</span> <span id="s168">Then we could go two and three trips because sometimes it only took twenty minutes to pass the strait between Denmark and Sweden.</span> <span id="s169">So then I returned back to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Can you tell me, on the night of October 1st and 2nd when the , of course that was the beginning of the attempt of the great roundup of Jews.</span> <span id="s171">Were you aware that this was a special night and a special trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No.</span> <span id="s173">No.</span> <span id="s174">That was of course, that was very high tensions in Denmark in, after the 29th of August.</span> <span id="s175">Uh we had no government.</span> <span id="s176">We had uh uh Gestapo rule in Denmark for the first time and uh the whole thing was very mixed and very unclear.</span> <span id="s177">The only thing we I remember was that the Germans told all the the ruler, the Gestapo chief, told that now the marshal law was over because the Jews now was taken and the Danish soldier could uh be released.</span> <span id="s178">They were captured on the 29th of August.</span> <span id="s179">Uh the Danish soldiers said no, the general said no, they would never have their freedom as a payment for the Jews uh captured.</span> <span id="s180">But I had no special uh remembrance of what happen... uh of the actions to uh against the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You were doing this for sometime.</span> <span id="s182">(Yeah.)</span> <span id="s183">How long did you continue this?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, you must recall that uh the transport groups was not only for uh the Danish Jews.</span> <span id="s185">It was also for the Danish resistance movement.</span> <span id="s186">So I continued and and then until the end of November when I was over in Sweden and was told not to return because uh some of our groups were taken, arrested, and then I had to stay in Sweden for the rest of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Before we get to Sweden, can you describe some of your fellow resistance colleagues?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">You mentioned Thormod (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Uh Thormod.</span> <span id="s190">Well, I can tell you that they were of course grown up.</span> <span id="s191">They were all ten, fifteen years older than I, very responsible people, very - people who really had guts.</span> <span id="s192">They dared to do things.</span> <span id="s193">They were very cleaver in this way that they would never do something which had too much risk.</span> <span id="s194">They was always in safety problems.</span> <span id="s195">One of them two months later shot himself (ph) but survived, is still alive and uh one was an editor.</span> <span id="s196">He was captured by the Gestapo and got escaped.</span> <span id="s197">Uh one of the very - what you call it - the starter of the whole thing in Snegerstein - the uh innkeeper, Thompson (ph) was captured, died in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s198">And uh that was, of course normal people, a police officer, one editor, one was uh uh bookbinder, Mr. , most famous of them all who saved the most of the times and later on was captured in what we called , the next boat, and was captured.</span> <span id="s199">The next boat was sunk by the Germans and uh was captured and sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s200">But they were all quite normal people.</span> <span id="s201">You see, maybe you wouldn't recognize them when you met them on the street in the daylight.</span> <span id="s202">Very, was good leaders.</span> <span id="s203">They were people you followed and they .</span></p> <p><span id="s204">They did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What happened to you when you got to Sweden and you were told you cannot go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, it was so nice because one of the, the was there, the police officer .</span></p> <p><span id="s207">You know, in Sweden you say "Uncle" to an eld.</span> <span id="s208">.</span> <span id="s209">older man now.</span> <span id="s210">To me, he was Uncle .</span> <span id="s211">So the first night I spent in the jail in , but for open doors and the next morning asked him, uh should I stay here this night and he pointed to the Grand Hotel over on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s212">There was no place there.</span> <span id="s213">So well, I I had to go try - I went to some relatives.</span> <span id="s214">I continued my school and graduated in Sweden.</span> <span id="s215">Later on I joined the voluntary forces, the Danish Brigade, and uh came back to Denmark in '45, in May uh with this force.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Describe for us what it was like, please, for a Danish boy who was seventeen, eighteen, uh going to school in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: It was a quite different country because when you live in a country occupied (cough) and go to another country who haven't got the same feelings as we, to them the Germans were not so bad as we thought because they had the relationship with Finland and with the Finnish-Russian War and all this.</span> <span id="s218">And uh sometimes they really didn't understood what happened.</span> <span id="s219">But after , after there was a change over there.</span> <span id="s220">But we were treated wonderful and there was, but of course they couldn't have the same opinion of the things as we had.</span> <span id="s221">But we were treated good and well I I have uh Swedish relatives so I had no problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: The Danish Brigade.</span> <span id="s223">Tell me about you in the Brigade.</span> <span id="s224">What did you do and what was it like, the training in the Brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, it was normal life as a soldier.</span> <span id="s226">I was come in there and was stayed in the Army for one and a half years and that was the normal training.</span> <span id="s227">Rather tough they said, and I can tell you quite a lot about uh the young Jews were of course there.</span> <span id="s228">It was young people coming there, trained by Danish officers (cough).</span> <span id="s229">We had - I think it was very funny - Germany hand grenades so because they they were bought . . . we got all our weapons from Sweden of course, the Swedish government.</span> <span id="s230">And they had bought lots of German hand grenades.</span> <span id="s231">Maybe instead of the guns (cough) they were selling to the Germans.</span> <span id="s232">But uh we had normal training.</span> <span id="s233">Was a hard life but that's the way it is.</span> <span id="s234">Your GI's had the same fate.</span> <span id="s235">They had also to be away for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s236">That's not - I don't like to be a soldier but (cough) just now when I look back on it it's good but you had to do it that time.</span> <span id="s237">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s238">That was the .</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: You had mentioned that there were Jews in the Brigade.</span> <span id="s240">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: What was your relationship with them and what, what did they say about their fellow Jews' predicament, if anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: You see, I can't understand this question because there is no difference between a Dane whether he is a Jew or non-Jew.</span> <span id="s243">That's - it's also not - so uh that was the same - they were all Danes - it was not so that the Jews were together in uh the camp and not going out with other guys.</span> <span id="s244">And of course they were, we don't notice that.</span> <span id="s245">It was - he was a Dane - and so see I really don't understand that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You told me before we started that in Sweden too you were involved in resistance.</span> <span id="s247">Uh what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, we had sometimes where we, some of our friends went back to Denmark and uh they needed weapons and uh we had the possibility of giving them some weapons to bring back to the resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: How did you get the weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, from friends.</span> <span id="s251">Now, you see it was possible because we bought weapons in Sweden, but still there I was down there and I was a carrying boy there too.</span> <span id="s252">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You have been instrumental in bringing to the Museum a boat with the numbers 0 - 2 on it.</span> <span id="s254">Uh tell us, you told me before that you uh rode on that boat in the course of this.</span> <span id="s255">Tell me a little bit about that would you please?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Uh, it was strange because the first boat that we had never had the possibility to go to Sweden because it was grounded the first - it was a party boat we took - really took, and it was grounded (cough) and destroyed.</span> <span id="s257">And then we got this boat.</span> <span id="s258">It was bought by (cough) uh the bookbinder from - it was a boat laying in the harbor of and uh that was a very good boat and sound boat built in the beginning of the thirties.</span> <span id="s259">It was of course a wooden boat with a good engine and uh it was able to go rather quick eight or nine miles, and that it for a boat.</span> <span id="s260">And when it started, .</span> <span id="s261">The first night I remember had two or three, no two trips to Sweden and I think we got ten to twelve passengers every time.</span> <span id="s262">And then later on we had in October 700 Jews and uh totally I know by this boat brought about 1,400 people from Denmark to Sweden.</span> <span id="s263">And as I told you before I (cough) was, my last trip to Sweden with this boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Uh before you got to stay there?</span> <span id="s265">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Uh was that trip anything special?</span> <span id="s267">Do you remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I can tell you that I never had anything special in all the time, in the couple of trips that I took.</span> <span id="s269">Normally there was no excitement.</span> <span id="s270">The excitement was before and when we were able to see north and south, and so there was no German ships.</span> <span id="s271">OK.</span> <span id="s272">And it was a little boat and the radar was not so uh so uh normal on the German ships at that time and when, if there was a little bit of waves it was very difficult to to find the boat.</span> <span id="s273">But it was not so difficult to go from Denmark to Sweden because as I told you before, if you go from a black dock, place into the lights.</span> <span id="s274">That's easy to find the way.</span> <span id="s275">It was when we had to go back and find the right place and be met by the right people and not by the wrong people, that was the most exciting part of the of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s276">You can see that to go to Sweden where we were accepted and and welcomed, sometimes I know that uh sailed near the Swedish coast because there were Swedish fisher boats took over the the Jewish passengers and brought them to the sho... un to the harbors.</span> <span id="s277">And that gave time savings.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: When you describe being in the Danish Brigade in Sweden, uh would you tell me what it was like please, going home with that Brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I say that's fantastic because we thought we were going home to fight, to throw out to throw out the Germans out of Denmark and the only shots from that was roses thrown on us, flowers thrown on us.</span> <span id="s280">It was just, you know.</span> <span id="s281">The Germans surrendered on the 4th and we arrived in , my hometown, on the 5th in the morning.</span> <span id="s282">And it was you know, it was it was an excitement.</span> <span id="s283">It was a joy.</span> <span id="s284">You, I, it will be the best day I ever had you know.</span> <span id="s285">Free, free and freedom is something you can't describe.</span> <span id="s286">Everybody happy.</span> <span id="s287">Let us out of this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What was Denmark like at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well Denmark is my country and of course it's wonderful.</span> <span id="s290">That's - you must recall we have a very high in my country.</span> <span id="s291">We've had the same royal family more than 1,000 years.</span> <span id="s292">More than 1,000 years.</span> <span id="s293">Queen Martha II was a descendent of King who reigned Denmark about the 9th century, so we never had a revolution.</span> <span id="s294">It, the big uh like reforms were made by the people who owned the land, the counts.</span> <span id="s295">It was an absolute sovereign king who gave us the freedom of choosing.</span> <span id="s296">At that time the other kings were beheaded, but he was beloved.</span> <span id="s297">That's the difference.</span> <span id="s298">It's been so that they have been very cleaver.</span> <span id="s299">They have given the dime before the dollar was I suppose.</span> <span id="s300">That's uh the way.</span> <span id="s301">And maybe it also gives some of the explanation why it happened in Denmark in this way.</span> <span id="s302">If you realize that when you have a country where the tensions are rather low, and other countries in Europe - what did they use when the tension was very high - they tried to divert the tension and then was the easiest way to , kill a few Jews here, kill a few Jews there.</span> <span id="s303">But we never had that.</span> <span id="s304">We never had the, it was not necessary for the rulers in Denmark, the people in power to have scapegoats, so therefore we had never had this special class, special group, as scapegoats.</span> <span id="s305">I think maybe it gives one of the explanations why it happened in Denmark.</span> <span id="s306">I don't know if that's that's why.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: You were coming back though in 1945?</span> <span id="s308">Your country had been occupied.</span> <span id="s309">You had a hand at least in getting Jews out and back.</span> <span id="s310">What was the country, what was the shape of the country like?</span> <span id="s311">What was, what was your life like coming back?</span> <span id="s312">Was it very different?</span> <span id="s313">Was the place a mess?</span> <span id="s314">What . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Of course there was lack of everything.</span> <span id="s316">It was a poor country in this way that the Germans had taken everything and paid with uh uh German marcs and there was no money, no value and we had to start from scratch.</span> <span id="s317">But end of forty... '45, '46, '47, there was, everything was progress.</span> <span id="s318">And there was rather uh optimistic mood and later on I can tell you that , thanks to the , thanks to all what happened in the world, and uh it was not difficult, no no, to go back, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: You, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, I started my education.</span> <span id="s321">I started to be a business man.</span> <span id="s322">I had, then I stayed some times in England, sometimes uh in Germany in order to go into business.</span> <span id="s323">In '49 I started in a family company and uh stayed there - was uh general manager very soon and started my own company in '81.</span> <span id="s324">Rather old but age is nothing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Go back to '45 if you would.</span> <span id="s326">The, you were still a young man coming back.</span> <span id="s327">Were you, did you have any kind of reunion or meet with any more of the club?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Oh well well so, I'm meeting them every time because uh uh they grow old and they were so much older than I, we had - it was so that the old parts of the club, they met once a month - the first Wednesday in the month they had a meeting and done that for years but now two or three passed away and now they are using me as the last uh what do you say - I am the guy that brings it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: When you came back in '45 uh were you involved in helping Jews get re-settled back in their homes?</span> <span id="s330">Were you into that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No.</span> <span id="s332">That was not necessary.</span> <span id="s333">Their houses were there.</span> <span id="s334">Was kept.</span> <span id="s335">The, I haven't heard of anybody who couldn't move into the home he left in in October of '43.</span> <span id="s336">It was looked after by the neighbors of course.</span> <span id="s337">So I, that shouldn't be a problem.</span> <span id="s338">There was no need to help there.</span> <span id="s339">They kept their wages when they were in, from their positions and their jobs were held for them and .</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">I don't think there were any problems there for the Jews.</span> <span id="s342">Neither for us.</span> <span id="s343">We came back and that was all where we left there.</span> <span id="s344">The only people who suffered was the people coming from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s345">The Danish Jews, the Danish resistance movement people and uh - they had a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, you know that uh the Danish Jews in concentration camps and some of the Danish resistance movement people had better time than others because we had no government but we had the health authorities who went down to to Theresienstadt for example and of course knew that it was pretend things that they did.</span> <span id="s348">They painted up the ruins to to show it's better than it was.</span> <span id="s349">But they had their gift passes every month.</span> <span id="s350">Uh the Danish, I really think that the people in the, the Danish in concentration camps had a feeling that people back home cared and maybe that saved some lives.</span> <span id="s351">Uh but of course they, the starvation was very very hard.</span> <span id="s352">And quite a lot of the Danish resistance people came back just like musselmen, you know, without flesh on their body.</span> <span id="s353">It was ridiculous and it was not so bad when they recovered, but now later they have psychology problems.</span> <span id="s354">They, it it must be impossible to to recover completely after a time like that in in Buchenwald, in Dachau, where ever they was.</span> <span id="s355">But I think of big importance was that from the Danish Red Cross there was sent this gift passes every month and many of the Danish uh concentration camp prisoners they survived because of this.</span> <span id="s356">And also the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: You talked a lot about what you did and what was going on.</span> <span id="s358">But can you tell me a little bit about why you did what you did?</span> <span id="s359">Why were you involved in helping Jews or helping anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well uh I don't understand the the question because - could you - you couldn't let people in in need down.</span> <span id="s361">You can't turn your back to people who need your help.</span> <span id="s362">There must be some sort of decency in a man's life and I wouldn't have been decent to turn the back to people in need.</span> <span id="s363">So there's no question uh of why or why not.</span> <span id="s364">You just did.</span> <span id="s365">That's the way you're brought up.</span> <span id="s366">That's the way of the tradition in in my country.</span> <span id="s367">You help of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">And therefore I don't think it's - I - could you have retained your self-respect if you, knew what these people would suffer and said no.</span> <span id="s369">Not likely.</span> <span id="s370">No.</span> <span id="s371">No way.</span> <span id="s372">So that's not a problem of of - you just have to do it.</span> <span id="s373">And nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No.</span> <span id="s376">I think I had yes, well, I think it was a time I understand when decency as, was unique.</span> <span id="s377">I hope we will have a world where decency will be the rule and not the exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s379">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s380">I want you to know something.</span> <span id="s381">I deliberately asked the questions that I did about Jews hoping that I would get you to say some of the answers that in fact I got.</span> <span id="s382">It matters.</span> <span id="s383">Uh, there has been, there, you know, you all from Denmark have all heard this before, and you all still look at us with this same blank look as if you're, you know, we're out of our minds. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: It's an embarrassment.</span> <span id="s385">We are really embarrassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: No.</span> <span id="s387">No.</span> <span id="s388">It's clear.</span> <span id="s389">It's clear.</span> <span id="s390">Isn't it.</span> <span id="s391">We have had so many Jews sit here from other countries - the tape is still rolling - who have told us on the one hand horrible stories of where people not only did not help but who made certain that they would not get out alive or attempted to.</span> <span id="s392">Uh and have repeated this in such quantities, that the few isolated acts of help from people from Poland or Germany or from where ever stand out as single instances.</span> <span id="s393">What all of you from Denmark are telling me is something very different and it is something I think that the world still does not understand was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, you must recall that uh the Jewish in Denmark got their Danish citizenship in 1814.</span> <span id="s395">In, and already, they started in the 17th century to go to Denmark.</span> <span id="s396">You know that was the age of reason.</span> <span id="s397">I think that's very good because then they were accepted there.</span> <span id="s398">In 1814 they got, I think it was 1814, uh citizens' rights.</span> <span id="s399">They were Danes.</span> <span id="s400">In 1849 they had fully political rights when we had our new constitution.</span> <span id="s401">Uh the Jews were just the Roman Catholics.</span> <span id="s402">A religious minority.</span> <span id="s403">That's the only difference and that could be a good thing.</span> <span id="s404">Then they shouldn't pay tribute to the Danish church.</span> <span id="s405">Uh uh we have to do it but they can use it to their own congregations of course.</span> <span id="s406">But you must recall that the Jewish influence in the Danish culture has been rather big.</span> <span id="s407">I can mention that one of the most played uh plays on the Theater in Copenhagen is "Wood Behind the Walls," by Thompson (ph) and the famous Danish high school, you know, the High School - it was one, two or three of the founders of the family tree (ph) was Jews.</span> <span id="s408">Their father was a rabbi but one of the sons converted to to Christianity and, but they was there.</span> <span id="s409">The you have heard about, the , the which was a very big family in culture and but there was never Yiddish literature in Denmark.</span> <span id="s410">They all wrote Danish.</span> <span id="s411">It means that you see therefore that is not Jewish literature.</span> <span id="s412">That is Danish literature.</span> <span id="s413">Maybe you understand why that we we are not able to understand this to try to try to separate Jews from Danes.</span> <span id="s414">And that that may be one of the reasons why there was not this, they were not a special group.</span> <span id="s415">They never lived in ghettos.</span> <span id="s416">And they were I think that the Jews integrated into the Danish society so quick so there was no problem.</span> <span id="s417">I know that in - I don't know whether it was the late 30's when we had some people from Austria and were agriculture uh scheme in Denmark, Jewish from Austria, young Jews.</span> <span id="s418">Even they went into the Danish society very soon.</span> <span id="s419">One of my wife's and I best friends, Mr. Phillips (ph), he's still speaking a little bit Austrian.</span> <span id="s420">He came in '38.</span> <span id="s421">There's one word he never learned to say in Danish.</span> <span id="s422">But he came in '38 as in the scheme.</span> <span id="s423">That was the only way to get an visa to Denmark.</span> <span id="s424">That was the only possibility to get into Denmark.</span> <span id="s425">And uh he still tells about this.</span> <span id="s426">He was not a farmer but OK, he started fair enough in a farm in Denmark and stayed there.</span> <span id="s427">Now he's just retired.</span> <span id="s428">He w as director for uh what you call it - book publisher.</span> <span id="s429">But he's Danish.</span> <span id="s430">He's Danish.</span> <span id="s431">And uh therefore there's there is no difference and that's what I want to point out.</span> <span id="s432">That all these things, that is nonsense to us to talk about a special group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Will you take a minute as long as we have the tape and talk specifically about the boat "0 - 2" for the Museum.</span> <span id="s434">Um, it would be good to have it on tape.</span> <span id="s435">Tell me what you know of it's history.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, you see, I've heard a bit .</span> <span id="s437">I know that it was built in the beginning of the 1830's, early '30's (ph).</span> <span id="s438">I know that it was uh had it in the start in .</span> <span id="s439">It was bought by uh by uh and later on I know we have had some papers uh telling the owners.</span> <span id="s440">For instance, Thormod Larson, he bought it just after the war and had it for five, six years, and uh he he called it the "Con Man" because it has made the Germans to last for so long a time.</span> <span id="s441">And when we discovered it again the name was "Sunshine" and I really think that was a wonderful name to give a boat.</span> <span id="s442">And she is an old boat, but she has been good.</span> <span id="s443">It was a good tool for us.</span> <span id="s444">She was fair.</span> <span id="s445">There was never, so far as I recall, one incident where the motor stopped, the engine stopped.</span> <span id="s446">I think that is also one of the things which - we were very fond of her.</span> <span id="s447">But uh I saw the boat the last time when Harbor uh, no in in Sweden when I when I left it in November '43 and then I saw it again now in the in the Spring here this year when uh asked us to find the boat and we were quite sure it's the same boat because uh for so long a time uh recognized it and everybody said yes, but that's the old boat, the boat that the bookbinder used.</span> <span id="s448">So, she is an old boat.</span> <span id="s449">She needs repair, but uh OK.</span> <span id="s450">I'm very proud to be with her and I think it's wonderful to see her in something valuable for many people.</span> <span id="s451">And I can tell you as I said when I left Harbor here in some months ago, before going to Washington, that we had so many memories, all of us, to that boat but uh it's good that somebody will keep her for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: One of the things that I neglected to ask you when we were on the boat is, can you describe a trip over on that boat?</span> <span id="s453">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, in the start of the mess you know, to put people who had never been in a in a boat before, coming with everything they could have and afraid, first to calm them down.</span> <span id="s455">And then yourself excited and then suddenly you go out in the sea.</span> <span id="s456">It's a little bit wavy there, and people are very silent, very very silent.</span> <span id="s457">And you smell the the fear.</span> <span id="s458">We knew, we were not in the cabin because we stood in the in the back, but we knew at that time when we left, however, we would return.</span> <span id="s459">And we were positively sure that we would go over to Sweden without problems.</span> <span id="s460">And, but first out, well then you have nothing else to do - just sail and be calm.</span> <span id="s461">But the people down there was not able to see anything because they have to stay in the cabin.</span> <span id="s462">They had a much worse situation than we who could see.</span> <span id="s463">So it was easier to stand on the open deck than sit in the cabin.</span> <span id="s464">But normally as I said, there was no special experiences.</span> <span id="s465">It was only you go from here, you go over there and you will be there in so and so long time and maybe you'll be a little bit seasick.</span> <span id="s466">Uh, and anyway we we hoped the weather should be rough.</span> <span id="s467">It was easier for us to go over because they were, people, the Germans would never see us.</span> <span id="s468">But there was never an, you see episodes or - it was rather smooth sailing most of the time and as I told you before, we never lost a passenger.</span> <span id="s469">That indicates also that it's been smooth sailing.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Thank you, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s471">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s474">Now we're back on camera.</span> <span id="s475">Tell me, uh this trip that was different from some of the others and your system?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: We have a system and saying when we return to Denmark, if a red light go in; if there's a green light stay away.</span> <span id="s477">But one day there was no lights and but we took the chance and uh there was no one on the beach.</span> <span id="s478">There was no problem at all.</span> <span id="s479">OK.</span> <span id="s480">Sometimes it's human to fail and somebody had forgotten to put the light on, but uh everything ended happily.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What was it like going in with no lights?</span> <span id="s482">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Scared.</span> <span id="s484">But uh send a prayer upwards.</span> <span id="s485">At that time that was one of the last uh chance for the Jewish refugees but we were so used to uh this procedure that normally it was calm and it choose to be the same thing now.</span> <span id="s486">There was no problem at all.</span> <span id="s487">Only that one had forgotten to do what he had to do.</span> <span id="s488">But. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: How did your captain find his way in without lights?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, we have in Denmark uh pilots of course, but then we had people which we called "men who knows" and that's people who know that exactly part of the the border, of the of the shore and uh it's so in Denmark in the straits that the sand reefs, there are some sand reefs, that they are shifting every year.</span> <span id="s491">But if you know them you can go from one reef through a hole into another and then you should be a man who knows the way to do it all as people they would drown.</span> <span id="s492">And uh the captain knew the thing.</span> <span id="s493">He knew every inch of the uh beach and the shore outside.</span> <span id="s494">It's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You're going in.</span> <span id="s496">Your lights had failed.</span> <span id="s497">Your signals had failed.</span> <span id="s498">If you were caught, did you have guns to defend yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No.</span> <span id="s500">We never had a gun.</span> <span id="s501">We don't think it could help anything.</span> <span id="s502">Uh we couldn't resist uh a German patrol and we had also the security of our passengers to think of.</span> <span id="s503">So we never had a gun.</span> <span id="s504">It was a gunless army.</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">I think that that shows that sometimes you can win victory without arms.</span> <span id="s507">I think that's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: You mentioned earlier too that being without guns, that would get you a different sentence than if you had guns if you were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes, in that time there would be, if you were caught with a gun, you had the risk to have the death penalty.</span> <span id="s510">Otherwise you will shot, maybe shot at sight, but uh if you were caught without guns and then you'll get a long term death penalty, be sent to concentration camp but OK, there was a very much better chance, and at that time uh we, the most of the Danish uh resistance movement caught would be sent uh to a camp just north of the German-Danish border where the conditions were some better, oh no, much better than in a, the German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s511">So there was really difference if you were taken with guns, explosives - then that would be a death penalty, but we had no use of them.</span> <span id="s512">We shouldn't catch fish with the guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: When you were going in, and the signals had failed, did your passengers know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No, there was no passengers then.</span> <span id="s515">We were alone.</span> <span id="s516">We were on the way in after coming from Sweden.</span> <span id="s517">No, there were no passengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Uh, let's go back a minute and describe going out again from Denmark to Sweden.</span> <span id="s519">Can you describe for me the reactions of some of your passengers on on one of your trips?</span> <span id="s520">Describe for me the people on the boat, how they reacted.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Well, I really think they reacted what everybody can expect.</span> <span id="s522">Somebody are calm.</span> <span id="s523">Somebody are very uneasy.</span> <span id="s524">Some have children with them and they had a double responsibility.</span> <span id="s525">They are much more afraid and but normally, and I know it from uh and Thormod Larson who have done it many many times, they said that it was remarkable peace, remarkable calm on the most, of the, from the side of the passengers most time.</span> <span id="s526">There was very seldom that some of the passengers would do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Because they understand that's their last chance.</span> <span id="s528">And that was the last attempt in their uh way from Denmark to Sweden.</span> <span id="s529">And I really think they were very calm in the boat also when we started.</span> <span id="s530">And very much joy there too when when we said now we're on the right side of the strait.</span> <span id="s531">That was a relief and that, that was in my -I understood it.</span> <span id="s532">I understood it.</span> <span id="s533">But uh there was never the disorder or something like that.</span> <span id="s534">No.</span> <span id="s535">But some of them, they had I suppose a out.</span> <span id="s536">And maybe also to the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s538">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
