Okay, maybe we could just start by having you say your name and where we are, maybe what the date is, what the weather’s like outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Well, today is the 13th of January, in 1999, and we are here sitting in my kitchen, in Highland Park, Illinois and the weather is awful.</span> <span id="s18">It’s snowing, and snow is piled up very, very high, and it’s wonderful to be inside and not have to suffer outside in the cold.</span> <span id="s19">And we are sitting here talking about what happened to my life after we were liberated, and I’m ready to ask -- answer questions, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">Let me -- Let me ask you to go back.</span> <span id="s22">You did a video interview about your experiences during the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: -- with the museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s25">But let’s go back a bit and you’ve talked about this somewhat in that interview.</span> <span id="s26">Let’s take it back maybe to a couple months before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s27">If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, where you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans.</span> <span id="s29">But I don’t know much about that any more.</span> <span id="s30">The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions.</span> <span id="s31">In September they started dropping the troops in Arnum, and since I lived in Fenlow at that time, which isn’t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big airplanes, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and I’ll never forget it, because it was just immense.</span> <span id="s32">It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and little airplanes, which we later on found out were gliders, and that’s really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire.</span> <span id="s33">And we -- we couldn’t go outside any more and we didn’t have gas and electricity and things like that.</span> <span id="s34">And life became very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s35">I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally.</span> <span id="s36">We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the field, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn’t get it, because the man didn’t go outside, they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in Germany, I guess.</span> <span id="s37">So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the house.</span> <span id="s38">I was there with my stepfather, who was in bed, because he was on strike.</span> <span id="s39">The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the railroad that they had to go on strike, so he did.</span> <span id="s40">And there was a son in the house, who was supposed to be working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s41">So, he was also somewhere hiding in the house, so I had to open the door.</span> <span id="s42">And the Germans said they wanted to look in the house, and they looked in the house, and they decided the house was good.</span> <span id="s43">And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our house for awhile.</span> <span id="s44">So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us.</span> <span id="s45">And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn’t used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to bed early.</span> <span id="s46">So they never saw me.</span> <span id="s47">Course, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed.</span> <span id="s48">So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently.</span> <span id="s49">And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little town, and they had to all go across the River Maus, into Germany, and then up north, into the northern part of Holland.</span> <span id="s50">And they wanted all the regular people out of town, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming.</span> <span id="s51">So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding.</span> <span id="s52">The man stayed somewhere, I don’t know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out house, and there we stayed for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s53">There was some food, there was water and that’s where we were liberated.</span> <span id="s54">And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn’t cross the river, and it was constant bombarding and grenade fire.</span> <span id="s55">So, we somehow crawled to our house, and then the British decided that they didn’t want us there, so we were evacuated to another town, and there we stayed til I think the middle of April.</span> <span id="s56">In the meantime, Holland wasn’t even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other town with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free.</span> <span id="s57">My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father’s name.</span> <span id="s58">And then the next day they ask me my mother’s name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down.</span> <span id="s59">And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children.</span> <span id="s60">And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to Israel, but -- then Palestine, but I didn’t want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back.</span> <span id="s61">I had no idea where they were.</span> <span id="s62">So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the house for -- I don’t know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever.</span> <span id="s63">And then my father, who was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on left for northern Holland, somehow got himself involved in underground work.</span> <span id="s64">He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where he was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to England, so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every house was, and where every little obstacle would be.</span> <span id="s65">And then somehow he was caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s66">They came in the house to check something.</span> <span id="s67">He and the owner of the house were sent to prison because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in.</span> <span id="s68">And thank God my father didn’t reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in jail.</span> <span id="s69">And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly.</span> <span id="s70">But he was liberated there.</span> <span id="s71">And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated.</span> <span id="s72">So, when my father came out of prison, they somehow presented him with a list.</span> <span id="s73">And my maiden name is D’Ancona, D’A, and when -- in Holland, it’s -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay.</span> <span id="s74">But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in Holland, especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no roads, there was no public transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing.</span> <span id="s75">So, since my father had worked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel.</span> <span id="s76">So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the rivers, and you know, on a bicycle without tires.</span> <span id="s77">And he came one day to -- to the house where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom.</span> <span id="s78">And well, he knocked on the door, and we didn’t get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad.</span> <span id="s79">And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Let me just go back for a second --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: The place where you were at in the country --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: -- who were these people you were with, if your parents were still in Amsterdam, were -- who were you with?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: When I was in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time.</span> <span id="s88">I was taken by an organization to the southern part of Holland, and to a family that I had never met in my life, didn’t know the people, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD.</span> <span id="s91">And the -- the organization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he had helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans.</span> <span id="s92">When -- When you were picked up from your home in Amsterdam, small children were put in a -- sort of what -- what used to be a school, and the parents were across the street in what used to be a theater.</span> <span id="s93">And then, before they went on transport to Westerbork, and those children, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think, nurses, and people who took care of kids.</span> <span id="s94">And they went out for walks sometimes.</span> <span id="s95">And the organization had made it their business to steal some of those children.</span> <span id="s96">So, every day when some of those kids were walked outside to get a little fresh air, -- and I’m sure that it was prearranged with help inside, that certain children were going to be taken away.</span> <span id="s97">So they had as many clothes on as possible.</span> <span id="s98">And then they walked at the end of the line, cause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young people came and just stole them away.</span> <span id="s99">And how they organized getting rid of their papers and -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s100">I guess that’s known in -- in Holland how it went, but those children were just rescued.</span> <span id="s101">And I was still at home.</span> <span id="s102">I was one of the very, very last in Amsterdam, who lived in their own house and that was because we are Sephardic.</span> <span id="s103">My father and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their crazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were going to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really Jews, we were Christians.</span> <span id="s104">So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared non-Jews, not because they didn’t want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to have to go to the other side of the world.</span> <span id="s105">I don’t know what -- what my parents knew about what was waiting on the other side of the fence.</span> <span id="s106">I didn’t know an awful lot, because as much as possible was kept away from me.</span> <span id="s107">But I knew, and everybody knew that, that it wasn’t very good.</span> <span id="s108">So, we were in Holland; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in Amsterdam walking the streets.</span> <span id="s109">There was no school any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for Jews any more.</span> <span id="s110">So, on the 16th of October, my father decided that since we weren’t declared non-Jews, we had to go.</span> <span id="s111">So, my father found this organization and they said they would have a place for me.</span> <span id="s112">So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady came to pick me up and she took me along to the station and there she handed me to a young man, and he took me on the train with another child that I never saw again, and we traveled a long distance.</span> <span id="s113">We had to change the pla -- the train in the station and we took another train.</span> <span id="s114">Then we finally came at the destined place and this young man said to me, “Well, you just wait here.”</span> <span id="s115">And he took the young man with him and came back maybe three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that time that I had to wait at that station was like -- like a year.</span> <span id="s116">It was never ending, and here I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s117">I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware of the dangers.</span> <span id="s118">I had no name, I didn’t know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and if they -- somebody had come up to me and said, “Where are you going, what are you doing, are you waiting for somebody?”</span> <span id="s119">I couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s120">So, I was very, very scared.</span> <span id="s121">And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went with him on the bicycle and he dropped me off at this family.</span> <span id="s122">And there I stayed for the rest of the year and -- and another year.</span> <span id="s123">And I was very, very different from my own home.</span> <span id="s124">I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man was working for the railroad, he repaired railroad cars.</span> <span id="s125">And they were fine people, there’s nothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what they were doing.</span> <span id="s126">And they were terrific.</span> <span id="s127">But it was an altogether different life than what I was used to.</span> <span id="s128">They were going to church all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed every day and I wasn’t used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that they wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my house, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And these people were not Jewish, that you’re with, or they are?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, no, no, they were Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: They were Christians where I lived now.</span> <span id="s133">So, everything was different, and of course I -- I had just said goodbye to my parents, my father and my mother, and I knew very well that that wasn’t all that sure that I would ever going to see them again.</span> <span id="s134">So, at -- it was very traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: When you -- When you were in this house, with these people that you’d never met before and they’re not from your background, and they’re not from your religion or whatever, but they -- did you realize at the time how much of a risk they were taking to --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, yeah, I knew that if somebody was going to come, that th-the man would most likely be killed, and the son, who was 16 or so at that time, would have had a hard time, too, and maybe the whole family.</span> <span id="s137">You never knew what the Germans were going to do.</span> <span id="s138">But, no, they knew very well what they did, and after the war, I asked them why did you do this?</span> <span id="s139">And then my stepmother told me that somebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that town, came to their house and asked if they would take a child, a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s140">And she was willing to say yes right away, but she thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way.</span> <span id="s141">So, she said, “Well, you have to wait til my husband comes home from work and I can tell you tonight.”</span> <span id="s142">So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave home, and that is very important because in those days, you couldn’t buy beds, you couldn’t buy linens, you couldn’t buy blankets, you couldn’t buy anything, even if you had the money, it wasn’t available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed.</span> <span id="s143">So when the daughter left, I could take her place, so they told the man who came from the underground, they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter in the same room.</span> <span id="s144">So that’s how come I found this place, or they found the place for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And in this place, where these people who were, at first anyway, are strangers, and they’re [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: It was very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: I was going to ask you, what was it like to be there?</span> <span id="s148">How did you act, how did you feel?</span> <span id="s149">Did you feel quickly like part of the family, did you kind of keep to yourself, how did they react?</span> <span id="s150">You know, what was that like?</span> <span id="s151">That’s a strange situation to be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: It’s -- It’s -- It’s -- It’s an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very nervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was -- you know, it was so different from a big city, and everything in tha-that household was different than -- than in my house, and I -- I was -- I’m an only child, so I wasn’t used to brothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me and I wasn’t used to that at all.</span> <span id="s153">And I don’t think I’ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I was old enough to realize that crying wasn’t going to help.</span> <span id="s154">And I knew also that I had to behave myself and that I couldn’t be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I didn’t do that, maybe the people wouldn’t want to keep me, and where was I going to go then?</span> <span id="s155">I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s156">And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling.</span> <span id="s157">If -- If they had put me out on the street, I wouldn’t have had any place to go.</span> <span id="s158">I was far, far, far away from even non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had nothing.</span> <span id="s159">And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could be, because I couldn’t risk any problems in that house, so when they teased me I had to take it and they didn’t do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was not.</span> <span id="s160">I couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s161">The daughter went to a parochial school, but that was a long walk and there was no transportation at that time any more either.</span> <span id="s162">So, they didn’t want me to risk that big long walk to school.</span> <span id="s163">So I had to stay home and in the beginning I tried to do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s164">So, my stepmother said, “Well, I didn’t get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help me once in awhile.”</span> <span id="s165">So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the beds, and in those days, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I’m pretty handy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that.</span> <span id="s166">And I loved to scrub, so I -- I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s167">I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and that came in handy later, I think.</span> <span id="s168">So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was bored stiff otherwise.</span> <span id="s169">And so my stepmother and I got along very well.</span> <span id="s170">When she went shopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn’t let me home alone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn’t much to shop, so we didn’t do that too much.</span> <span id="s171">And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to -- to not be a nuisance.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: What were the names of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: They are the Shumachers.</span> <span id="s174">No, they are not alive any more.</span> <span id="s175">My stepfather died years and years ago.</span> <span id="s176">My stepmother died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s177">And she had willed that -- she had asked her children that when she was going to be gone -- in Holland it’s usually that they send out cards that somebody has passed away and an ad goes in the newspaper and she had asked the children if they would resent it that sh -- they also put my name in as a daughter.</span> <span id="s178">So they didn’t mind, and so when she died, we flew over for her funeral.</span> <span id="s179">And I had to sit right in front in the church, and the pastor knew about it, he -- he mentioned what they had done for me, and that I was there, and that they really looked at me as their daughter, even though I wasn’t their -- their real daughter.</span> <span id="s180">But, they were very, very kind to me, and up to now, we are still friends with the children, and the daughter who is the youngest, was my best friend, really, because we -- we were together all the time.</span> <span id="s181">I’m going to see her next week.</span> <span id="s182">And the daughter who left home and made room for me, is very, very ill and I’m going to meet her next week, too.</span> <span id="s183">She’s in a nursing home and I’m going to say hello to her, too, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: This is over there, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: That’s in The Netherlands, that’s in Holland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: What were their first names, this family?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: He was Johann and she was Aleida and then they had three children, Cynthia, Bowker and Yozeem.</span> <span id="s188">And the parents are honored in the Holocaust museum and they are mentioned on the wall upstairs as Righteous Gentiles, and they are mentioned in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s189">I never get -- they got there, a big medal at one time, presented by Yad Vashem, as being Righteous Gentiles, and having saved my life.</span> <span id="s190">So, after the war, when we were liberated, and my father had come to my house where I was hidden, he -- he took me along up north, where he had been living all that time, because we really didn’t know what we were going to do.</span> <span id="s191">And there was a lot of food in the north, and where we were, there was not so much.</span> <span id="s192">So my father took me along and after maybe two or three weeks, we got a telephone call from Amsterdam, that somehow, miraculously, my mother had appeared.</span> <span id="s193">She had traveled for weeks, coming back from Austria, but she had arrived in Amsterdam and was looking for us.</span> <span id="s194">So, then my father and I went back to Amsterdam on a milk truck.</span> <span id="s195">And my mother was like unreal.</span> <span id="s196">She was skinny and she used to be pretty well rounded and she looked scary, and like a witch, sort of.</span> <span id="s197">And I was -- I was really scared of her.</span> <span id="s198">But, a-after a couple of days that -- I got used to it.</span> <span id="s199">Now, we didn’t have a house at that time.</span> <span id="s200">She came to her brother’s house, and so we were there, too, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You say your mother arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: -- suddenly --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hetty DeLeeuwe.</span> <span id="s207">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Scary and like a witch, sort of, and I was -- I was really scared of her, but after a couple of days that -- I got used to it.</span> <span id="s209">Now, we didn’t have a house at that time, she came to her brother’s house, and so we were there too, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: You say your mother arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: -- suddenly --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Up until that point, before she showed up, what did you and your father think had happened?</span> <span id="s215">Di-Did you have any knowledge that she was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Did you think that she did not survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, no, we didn’t think she had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So you thought she was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And then she appears?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Well, that’s an astounding experience.</span> <span id="s224">What -- What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Unreal, unreal.</span> <span id="s226">We -- We -- We didn’t know where my mother had gone.</span> <span id="s227">We knew my mother was caught at the place where she was in hiding, and after jail and I don’t know what else, she ended up in -- in Westerbork, in that camp before you go to -- to Germany or Poland.</span> <span id="s228">And since we had had this stamp in our papers, that we were most likely not Jewish, and merranos and all that sort of stuff, which was like an exemption, my mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn’t first want to recognize that, but when she was in that camp, with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile, they recognized that.</span> <span id="s229">So, my mother was sent to Theresienstadt, and that was sort of the show camp for the Germans.</span> <span id="s230">And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s231">But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in Theresienstadt, and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s232">My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did the rounds.</span> <span id="s233">She stayed in -- She was caught in July of ’44, which most likely is why she was still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s234">She -- She went from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she stayed for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s235">And she didn’t talk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was hell, and it was worse than hell.</span> <span id="s236">They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in Auschwitz was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be worse than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s237">So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a transport going, were lining up outside somewhere.</span> <span id="s238">And another story goes that everybody who is up front ends up going on transport, and the ones who are left over are going to be killed, that they knew.</span> <span id="s239">However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so when all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going away from Auschwitz, were standing in line, they let them turn around, so the ones who were standing in front were standing in the back and the ones who standing in back were standing up front.</span> <span id="s240">That saved my mother’s life, because my mother otherwise would have been in the back, instead of in the front.</span> <span id="s241">Then she was transported to Lanzing, which was -- I guess nobody knows about that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s242">It was part of Mauthausen, in Austria.</span> <span id="s243">And there she had to work in a factory where they made rayon for parachutes.</span> <span id="s244">Very poisonous.</span> <span id="s245">People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have to drink a lot of milk, can’t do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there are strict rules, but for Jewish women that wasn’t important, so they didn’t get fed, and they had to work very hard.</span> <span id="s246">They burned their skin and they were nauseous and sick sometimes, because all the poisonous gases and whatever.</span> <span id="s247">They -- My mother was fluent in German, and that sort of helped them, too, I think.</span> <span id="s248">My mother was -- I don’t know ab -- if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew how to be ahead of the group, and so she told the Germans off whenever she could.</span> <span id="s249">And they sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put your finger on those instruments, then the whole thing messed up, and they ruined I don’t know how much.</span> <span id="s250">And so they were good at that.</span> <span id="s251">And somehow my mother survived, even though she got very, very ill there.</span> <span id="s252">They operated on her without any anesthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing.</span> <span id="s253">And even though the German doctor who did it wanted to kill her, I’m sure, he saved her life, because if he hadn’t done that, I’m sure she would have died.</span> <span id="s254">So, by the time she was liberated, she was very, very ill, but the Americans took enormous good care of them.</span> <span id="s255">They sent them to hospitals, they had them x-rayed.</span> <span id="s256">Everybody who had TB was sent to a sanitorium, and the -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, took care of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s257">They stumbled on this group of women.</span> <span id="s258">Now, my mother was with those 10 -- of which one had passed away, but there were also lots of Hungarian women in that group, and I don’t know where those americ -- the -- where those Americans really took them.</span> <span id="s259">My mother talked about flying to, I think southern Germany, and from there they were transported through Switzerland, to France, and there they stayed for awhile, and then they came to Holland.</span> <span id="s260">But you have a -- imagine that there was absolutely no normal transportation.</span> <span id="s261">Railroads were bombed, and so it was very hard to get a train together and th-there wa -- there was no infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no mail.</span> <span id="s262">My mother wrote every day and we never got those letters, until months and months later, after she had arrived.</span> <span id="s263">And then when we all three were back in Amsterdam, we didn’t really know what to do.</span> <span id="s264">Our business was dismantled, all our belongings were taken away.</span> <span id="s265">And somehow my father started again.</span> <span id="s266">He -- He got some help, I think, from the Marshall fund.</span> <span id="s267">That -- That wasn’t something that they gave you, ee -- it was like loans.</span> <span id="s268">And in the same house where we used to live, we came back.</span> <span id="s269">But we had no furniture, we had no beds, we had no clothes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Your house was still there?</span> <span id="s271">Other people hadn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Well, it was -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: -- taken it, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: -- n-no, other people had lived in our house, but the Germans had taken everything away.</span> <span id="s275">Practically everything was gone and s -- a few -- very, very few things were hidden with friends, and we got that back, but sometimes you didn’t get that back either, cause people were used to having it and they didn’t want to give it back.</span> <span id="s276">But we basically were homeless and -- and penniless.</span> <span id="s277">And my father was in his 40’s, in his late 40’s, and he had to start all over again, which he did, but it was so difficult, because your support was gone.</span> <span id="s278">Everything that -- that used to be n-normal ju -- before the war, and during the vi -- first year, maybe, of the war, was gone.</span> <span id="s279">My grandparents were gone.</span> <span id="s280">All my uncles and aunts were gone, all my cousins were gone, all my friends were gone.</span> <span id="s281">My parents friends were gone.</span> <span id="s282">You -- You had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s283">That what -- was very lonely existence.</span> <span id="s284">And now, after 50-plus years, you -- you wonder how we did it.</span> <span id="s285">We didn’t talk about what we had lost, we didn’t talk about how terrible it was.</span> <span id="s286">It was something that wasn’t talked about and you just sort of try to make the best of everything.</span> <span id="s287">And my mother was sort of not normal when she first came back.</span> <span id="s288">She -- And she never was going to get to dress decent any more, who needed it, and who wanted to wear stockings, hose.</span> <span id="s289">or things like that, th-that wasn’t necessary.</span> <span id="s290">But after maybe half a year, she was sort of the old mommy again, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What do -- What do you think was going on?</span> <span id="s292">Do you think maybe she was depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No, I don’t know, my mother wasn’t depressed.</span> <span id="s294">No, she -- she was stronger than that.</span> <span id="s295">No, she had had typhus in -- in the camps, and I guess she was just so undernourished and so -- had been so sick that it took a long time to recover from that.</span> <span id="s296">And they had suffered so much, of course, and she never talked about much, cause I’ve a-asked my children about what did Omar ever tell you, and she never talked about camps with them.</span> <span id="s297">She never talked about the war, but we never talked about we missed this person, or how sad the way our family came to their end.</span> <span id="s298">It -- It was just a subject that wasn’t touched.</span> <span id="s299">And I guess that it took many, many, many, many years before anybody could talk about it, and realized that we all buried that inside us.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Why -- Why do you think you all did that?</span> <span id="s301">Why did you not talk about it, why did you keep it inside?</span> <span id="s302">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: It was -- It wa -- wa -- It was too awesome, it was too -- too big a problem.</span> <span id="s304">I don’t think anybody could understand it, how it could have happened, why it happened.</span> <span id="s305">It wit -- It was so unreal, it was something that nobody wanted to -- to understand, and I think that basically -- I’m not a psychologist, but I think that basically, everybody felt guilty that the -- the few that -- of us who did survive, did survive.</span> <span id="s306">And I still have that myself, too.</span> <span id="s307">I so many times ask myself, why did I survive and not my very best friend, or m-my very dear cousin?</span> <span id="s308">It -- It -- It’s such a terrible thing that happened, that it’s -- it’s -- you -- you can’t explain it.</span> <span id="s309">And so I think it was so painful, and it hurted so much, that we just figured, don’t talk about it, and maybe it goes away.</span> <span id="s310">The truth ath -- is that with the years, I think the -- the pain never goes away and you keep on missing those people.</span> <span id="s311">I -- I -- I’m fixated with my grandmother, and I was a kid when she died, and I -- I have -- I’ve -- I talk to her in my mind, and I -- I can see her still in her house, in my mind.</span> <span id="s312">And I -- I -- I just have problems sometimes with why, why did all those people have to be killed?</span> <span id="s313">They were all honest, hard working, were not in anybody’s way and they were just regular citizens like the rest, and it’s -- it’s some th -- very, very troublesome part of a life, and it -- I don’t think it will ever go away.</span> <span id="s314">I mean, I live a very comfortable life now, and I have -- thank God I have -- I have a family, but that pain will never go away, that always comes back somehow.</span> <span id="s315">And, if you live in a -- in a society like we are living here, you realize what you’re missing, too, because people have like school gatherings, you know, they have reunions of their school.</span> <span id="s316">And -- And they have family affairs and you see 40 - 50 - 60 people coming, maybe even more, and I have nobody.</span> <span id="s317">I have a cousin in Toronto, and that’s my closest relative.</span> <span id="s318">And all my uncles, all my aunts, my cousins, they’re all gone.</span> <span id="s319">And maybe they were not my best friends, but that -- that part of your life is so empty.</span> <span id="s320">And you don’t realize it every second of the day, but you know it’s there.</span> <span id="s321">And if there are happy occasions in your family, you can’t share it with relatives.</span> <span id="s322">Now, thank God, we have good friends here, but it’s still different than your own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s324">How do you feel about what -- it’s sort of two questions in one, how do you feel about Germany and Germans?</span> <span id="s325">And how do you feel about -- I mean, you had one particular experience, how do you feel about the people from your own country, from -- people from The Netherlands, not the Jews, but the other people, and how they behaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, that’s a tough one.</span> <span id="s327">I prefer not to go to s -- Germany.</span> <span id="s328">I -- I can’t hold it against young people, or people my own age for that matter, so most of the Germans who did what they did, are not around any more.</span> <span id="s329">However, when I see or meet a German, I can think in the back of my mind, maybe your grandfather or your father did to my grandparents or my uncles and aunts, which is the unthinkable, but they did it.</span> <span id="s330">And I can’t hold it against anybody, but I’m not very comfortable with Germans, I have to be really honest.</span> <span id="s331">I wouldn’t drive in a -- in a Mercedes.</span> <span id="s332">I -- I would think of a staff car, especially when it’s black, I would think, “Oh, that’s the SS.”</span> <span id="s333">Or the [indecipherable] polici.</span> <span id="s334">A crazy thing, I cannot have a Krupp coffee maker or a Krupp any machine in my house.</span> <span id="s335">I have a Brown coffeemaker, also comes from Germany, but it doesn’t have the same connotation as Krupp.</span> <span id="s336">Krupp is a bad word in my imagination, so I don’t want to see it in my house, I can’t stand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Because of all the war industries?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Of all the war, and -- and -- and -- and what they did to us.</span> <span id="s339">About the Dutch, I don’t think I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as about the Germans, but I know now that the Dutch, as a whole, could have done a lot more, including our queen.</span> <span id="s340">Queen Wilhemina never talked about anything, not on the -- on the English radio, about stand up against the Germans, try to help your Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s341">Never, ever that that came about, and they turned to her, then they thought, “Well, it’s too dangerous to help the Jews.”</span> <span id="s342">I mean, I was too young to realize all those things maybe then, but when you think about it, when you’re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder why not more people had tried to help.</span> <span id="s343">On the other hand, I know that it was extremely dangerous, because Jewish doctors only could t-take care of Jewish patients and non -Jewish doctors couldn’t take care of non-Jewish -- of Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s344">Everything was segregated and we had never had that in Holland.</span> <span id="s345">Holland was a very liberal country.</span> <span id="s346">As a matter of fact, my ancestors came to Holland after the Inquisition, and Holland welcomed them.</span> <span id="s347">It’s -- It’s -- It -- It’s very hard to -- to really judge and to say, well they could have saved more, because everybody knew that if they did help Jews, they would be punished like Jews.</span> <span id="s348">On the other hand, if lots of people would have stuck together, maybe they would have been able to accomplish more.</span> <span id="s349">In Belgium they did a lot more for the Jews than they did in Holland.</span> <span id="s350">And it’s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn’t publicized, I mean, so most of the Jews lived in the big cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, maybe The Hague, and in some s -- all over the country.</span> <span id="s351">And the -- the population in -- in the smaller towns, might not have known exactly what happened to the Jews, but the masses in -- in the big cities, did know.</span> <span id="s352">They saw it.</span> <span id="s353">I mean, part of Amsterdam was cordoned off and nobody could move, and they went house to house and house, an-and picked up the Jews.</span> <span id="s354">And i-it was -- it was a very difficult thing.</span> <span id="s355">I can’t blame them hundred percent because I know how dangerous it was to help Jews.</span> <span id="s356">On the other hand, you would have liked to had a little more help from the masses.</span> <span id="s357">And they did it once when they had the strike, when the first Jewish young people were picked up, they had a strike in Amsterdam, all the municipal workers stopped working and it was a mass demonstration that day, and there was is a monument, [indecipherable] dock worker in Amsterdam, to remind us of that.</span> <span id="s358">And that was fantastic, but it was one day, and then they went back to work, and the Germans went back to pick up Jews.</span> <span id="s359">So, it’s -- I can’t say that I -- I -- I hated the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight, you could say they could have done a little more for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: But I take it, for instance, if you bought a Philip’s VCR or something, that you don’t ban Dutch products from the house, the way you might some German products?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: You were, you know, a -- a younger woman during the war when all this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What -- When did you first hear about and what was your reaction when say, Anne Frank’s diary was published?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I don’t think I read it for many, many years, and I ha -- I don’t think I have read it all together.</span> <span id="s366">I -- I -- I’ve seen it and I’ve taken a few pages here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Did you know about it when it was first published, or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, I guess so.</span> <span id="s369">And there’s a lot of controversy about it now, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s370">I think it was a beautiful thing, because it gave the world insight of what happened to us, and how -- how people who absolutely had nothing wrong done, were convicted and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and persecuted.</span> <span id="s371">And it give the -- the world an insight of what -- what it was all about.</span> <span id="s372">But, still I don’t think the -- the -- the pain that came afterwards comes out of that, because that’s not what she experienced.</span> <span id="s373">She was one or two years older than I was, and I knew her, because she lived in a neighborhood where I used to live, and I had a friend there, so I -- I knew her so ve-ve-very -- very casual.</span> <span id="s374">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Oh, so you actually knew her personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah, well -- well very casual, I mean, if y -- if you would -- I -- I -- I know she lived there and we played outside once, or twice maybe, you know.</span> <span id="s377">You know, all those little kids there in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s378">But, you know, she was a very nice kid, but very intelligent that she could write about it the way she did.</span> <span id="s379">I was not able to do that in those years, I wasn’t that -- that verbal and I wasn’t good at writing, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Had you known at all, at the time or later, right after the war, what had happened with her family, how they had hid, and how most of them had not survived or whatever, or di -- di -- they -- or they weren’t familiar enough to you that you would even have known about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: The Franks, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span> <span id="s384">No, no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s385">You know, you were all too much involved with your own problems, that I-I didn’t know the family or anything like that.</span> <span id="s386">You know, you were so involved with -- and the very few people who were there, and who needed support, and who were your support, people that -- that you didn’t know about, or were -- that -- that didn’t come up in our lives, you know.</span> <span id="s387">Our lives were tough because we had -- we had to work so hard to get back to -- to where we were before.</span> <span id="s388">And I think about it, I have the greatest admiration for my father, who somehow managed to get a factory back to work, and make some money.</span> <span id="s389">And, I mean, we had a house again and later on, we had -- with everything we needed again.</span> <span id="s390">It’s amazing how it -- it all came back.</span> <span id="s391">And what was very painful after the war was that some people left money and -- and belongings and there were big fights in families on who got what, and nobody had a will, cause you didn’t think of things like that.</span> <span id="s392">So you inherited from the strangest people and from your closest relatives, you sometimes didn’t inherit.</span> <span id="s393">And then the -- the government took enormous amounts of money as taxes of those inheritance.</span> <span id="s394">We had people who had valuables were -- and who came back after the war, tried to get their valuables back from friends, or from a-acquaintances, and people just didn’t want to give it back, they said, “Oh no, that was mine.”</span> <span id="s395">And they were so used to having those things that they didn’t want to give it back.</span> <span id="s396">Th-The -- The strangest situations arose, that made it hard to get friendly with people that you used to be friendly with.</span> <span id="s397">What was it -- it was a strange, empty life, right after the war, and it took years to sort of come back to a normal life.</span> <span id="s398">For instance, I had gone to -- I’ve -- I’ve had -- finished elementary school, and I -- I was supposed to go to some sort of a high school, but I did that for one year, but that year was so strange, because people were not showing up the next day, teachers weren’t showing up the next day.</span> <span id="s399">You know, there was always somebody who was taken away by the Germans, so the school was not a normal school year.</span> <span id="s400">And so when I went back after the war, I went for three years to high school, and then I just quit, because I just couldn’t stand it, I was in the meantime this grown-up -- I had gone through so much that I wasn’t this 15 year old kid when I came out of the war.</span> <span id="s401">I -- I -- I just didn’t have the patience to sit in class an-and study.</span> <span id="s402">So, after three years I quit and I went to work.</span> <span id="s403">And I helped my father in his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: What was his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that.</span> <span id="s406">And I-I worked in the -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hetty DeLeeuwe.</span> <span id="s408">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: -- patience to sit in class an-and study.</span> <span id="s410">So, after three years I quit and I went to work.</span> <span id="s411">And I helped my father in his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What was his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that.</span> <span id="s414">And I-I worked in the office and I worked in the factory, too.</span> <span id="s415">That was better for me, I think.</span> <span id="s416">School was just not challenging enough at that time, I -- I didn’t have the -- the brains to -- to put myself to work, and my mother would have loved to see me go to college, but -- was big disappointment, but I couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s417">I was better off doing something with my hands and keeping my mind occupied that way.</span> <span id="s418">And so I worked for many, many years, and for -- later on my father sold the business, cause he was sick, and so then I had a regular job.</span> <span id="s419">And I lived in Holland til I was 31, and then I married and came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: How I met my husband?</span> <span id="s422">My husband is originally also from Holland, and that family was very lucky, they made it just in time out of Holland before the war.</span> <span id="s423">I guess they were on the boat when the war broke out, or something that close.</span> <span id="s424">And so my husband, as a small child, was growing up in the United States.</span> <span id="s425">After the war, the family went back to Holland, because they used to have businesses there, and my father-in-law wanted to see what he could salvage.</span> <span id="s426">So they stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s427">But having grown up in the United States and then coming back to Holland in a small town, being my husband was very st -- rather observant, it was sort of an impossible task.</span> <span id="s428">So, he came back to the United States when he was 18, and then he ended up in the service, during Korea.</span> <span id="s429">He ended up serving in Morocco and when he was discharged, they asked him to stay on, and he worked in Weisbaden, Germany.</span> <span id="s430">And that way he came home once in awhile.</span> <span id="s431">So that’s how we met, because they lived sort of around the corner.</span> <span id="s432">And then we married, and he lived in the United States, but we married in Holland and then I came with him here.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Where did you come to?</span> <span id="s434">What -- What --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: We started out in New York City, and we lived on Long Island and then he was transferred to Washington area, and we lived between Washington and Baltimore.</span> <span id="s436">And then we got transferred to Chicago, and that’s where we are now.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: How did you feel about coming to the United States and leaving Holland?</span> <span id="s438">Were y -- Were you happy about it?</span> <span id="s439">Did you want to get out of there, or were -- were you sad --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No.</span> <span id="s441">No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s442">I -- I felt bad that I left my parents and I never realized how hard it was for them that their only child was leaving.</span> <span id="s443">I really never thought of that.</span> <span id="s444">But I was happy, I was marrying a very nice guy, and I had never wanted to go to the United States, it never was any attraction to me.</span> <span id="s445">But I had no choice, it was either marrying my -- my lover and go with him to the United States, or not marry.</span> <span id="s446">And so I chose the United States and my husband.</span> <span id="s447">And I’m not sorry.</span> <span id="s448">I love it here.</span> <span id="s449">I don’t think I would s -- go back to Europe.</span> <span id="s450">I love Europe, I love to travel there, love the culture and I think you miss that in the United States.</span> <span id="s451">But -- The old buildings and all that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s452">But, I don’t think I could settle in Holland any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: It’s -- It’s painful.</span> <span id="s455">I ha -- My parents passed away in the meantime, too.</span> <span id="s456">So, I have my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law and her family, and that’s all very well, but it’s -- it’s empty for me there.</span> <span id="s457">And here I have good friends, and my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: When you came over, you didn’t have any children at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: No, no, no, I was just married.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s461">How many children do you have?</span> <span id="s462">When did you have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I have two sons, I have two sons and one lives, thank God, in Chicago.</span> <span id="s464">The other one, for the time being, lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil.</span> <span id="s465">So, that’s far.</span> <span id="s466">But we -- we have travel privileges at United Airlines, because my husband used to be pilot.</span> <span id="s467">So we travel easy and he can come home once in awhile.</span> <span id="s468">It’s -- It’s far, but it’s not that far that it’s unreachable.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s470">What are your son’s names?</span> <span id="s471">How old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: One, the youngest is David, he’s 34.</span> <span id="s473">And Isaac, he’s 35, the oldest.</span> <span id="s474">And sadly enough, they’re both single, but that’s something I can’t do anything about any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Any eligible --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: They know I would love -- I would love them -- to seem -- see them married, but there comes a time that a mother has to keep her mouth shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: If any eligible women are listening, do you want to drop their phone numbers onto the tape at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s479">No, no, no, it’s their business, you know, I can’t mingle in any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did you, when you came to the United States, did -- did you work, did you stay at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No, I stayed home.</span> <span id="s482">I was 31 when I married, I was 32 when I had my first ca -- child and we decided that it was better for me to stay home and raise the kids.</span> <span id="s483">And in those years, it might have been nice if we had had a little extra, but over the years, being an airline pilot, we -- we had a decent income, and it wasn’t necessary for me to -- to go to work, so I was a stay home mom.</span> <span id="s484">But I did always do something, volunteer work, so -- and I’m still involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: What about your children and you, and your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s486">Did you -- When they were younger, did you talk about it much with them?</span> <span id="s487">How did you handle that?</span> <span id="s488">You know, you said your -- your family back in Holland, basically, you didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, my mother didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s490">No, the kids know that I was hidden, and they know about th-the family that I was with, and they know some of them.</span> <span id="s491">And they have visited, too, there.</span> <span id="s492">When they were in Holland, I took them along there, and they visited.</span> <span id="s493">Not too many times, but we did go there.</span> <span id="s494">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: To Holland to visit my step-parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: They -- They knew about it, and somehow they, over the years have told me that I am o -- too overprotective, because -- and they -- they blame that on the sort of holding onto them, and it’s a result of the war that I am the way I am.</span> <span id="s499">I don’t know if that’s true.</span> <span id="s500">They always say, well Jewish mothers are always overprotective.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t think that is true, I think that all mothers are protective of their children if they’re normal mothers.</span> <span id="s502">But, I’m always happy when I know they’re coming, that they’re home and worried that -- I think I wor -- I worry -- I -- I worry that th-they got an accident, or that something happens to them, and I’m always happy when they’re home and then they’re safe around.</span> <span id="s503">But they know my story and -- and they know how difficult it was.</span> <span id="s504">And they missed too, the par -- th-the -- the family.</span> <span id="s505">They -- They have no extended family, as such.</span> <span id="s506">So, they -- they -- they know what -- what the war did to them, too.</span> <span id="s507">It’s -- They have three cousins in Holland, my sister-in-law has three daughters, but that’s all they have.</span> <span id="s508">And they have this one uncle and this one aunt, and there is nothing else, you know, that comes after that.</span> <span id="s509">So they too, feel the -- the pain of not having a big family, like other people around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Did they get to know their grandparents very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, they -- my -- my father and my father-in-law -- my father-in-law passed away before we were married, my father-in-law -- my father died right after we were married, so they never knew their grandfathers, but my mother came regularly and my mother-in-law, too, so they know their -- they knew my mother very well, they had a good relationship with her, and they have a very good relationship with my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s512">My son from Brazil calls her like every other week, and -- and they -- they value that very much, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Your mother had a -- a horrible experience during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Did they talk much with her about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: No, no, she didn’t talk about that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did they ever ask and she refuse, or what?</span> <span id="s518">It just didn’t come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I n -- I don’t think they ever asked and she never talked about it.</span> <span id="s520">She never talked about it.</span> <span id="s521">The only thing [indecipherable] that she was in Auschwitz in October, and when my father had passed away, she came regularly here in the winter, because those long nights and those lonely days, especially in October, she didn’t want to be alone because apparently she always re-lived the horror of those days in Auschwitz, and -- and she liked to be here with us.</span> <span id="s522">She didn’t talk about it, but I know that’s why she wanted to be away.</span> <span id="s523">No, she never -- she never mentioned it, she -- she was very close, though, with all those women who were with her in the concentration camps, and all of them, exe -- except one, I think, have passed away.</span> <span id="s524">But they were all like sisters, like good support for each other.</span> <span id="s525">They -- They understood each other, and they -- without talking about it, they -- they knew what was going on in their minds, I think.</span> <span id="s526">They -- They needed each other very badly.</span> <span id="s527">And they were very, very close bunch, all those years.</span> <span id="s528">But no, my mother didn’t say much about it and I guess the kids never thought of asking.</span> <span id="s529">Maybe they didn’t dare, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s530">Never came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What about when things happen, which they do occasionally, things come up in the press, things come up in the media, things come up in the movies.</span> <span id="s532">There’s a new documentary, a movie like “Schindler’s List” is made, things like that happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I’ve seen that.</span> <span id="s534">I basically don’t go to war movies, I don’t go to -- I don’t read books on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s535">I hate real war movies, like shooting and things like that.</span> <span id="s536">My kids never had guns.</span> <span id="s537">I’m very much against war, because I lived through it and it’s -- it’s so scary, it’s so horrendous.</span> <span id="s538">I’ve -- I’ve seen the last movie, “Life is Beautiful,” which has mixed reactions from some people, and I know the Holocaust is not to make fun of, but I thought the movie was very sensitive about what happened, it -- I feel it’s like -- like a little -- not a fairy tale, what’s the right word?</span> <span id="s539">A fable, you know.</span> <span id="s540">How it starts early in that life of the man and the woman, that they -- they fall in love and they have a good life, good family life.</span> <span id="s541">They have a cute little kid, and already the anti-Semitism comes in with the mother, and then in the war -- of course, in the concentration camp it wasn’t that way it is depicted in -- in this movie, but the love of the father to protect his child, is -- is -- is so beautiful.</span> <span id="s542">I think that the film is really very, very special.</span> <span id="s543">And I went there by mistake, because if I had known it was all about the Holocaust, I wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s544">But I -- I wasn’t sorry I saw it.</span> <span id="s545">And I saw “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s546">And the -- I never saw “Shoah.”</span> <span id="s547">And I don’t want to see movies on -- on -- on the Holocaust, on th-the -- the camps and things like that.</span> <span id="s548">I’ve been to the Holocaust Museum, few times.</span> <span id="s549">But I find that difficult.</span> <span id="s550">I find it very difficult.</span> <span id="s551">It’s when you see all those mass of shoes, I think, “Oh maybe the -- my -- my -- my uncle’s shoes are in there,” or my whatever.</span> <span id="s552">All those pictures.</span> <span id="s553">It’s something that will never leave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And I know most of those people that I mourn all the time, wouldn’t have been here any more, you know.</span> <span id="s556">By this time, most of them would have been gone.</span> <span id="s557">My p -- My grandparents for sure.</span> <span id="s558">But it -- it was -- you can’t realize that -- that all those people were murdered, for what?</span> <span id="s559">Just because you’re Jewish?</span> <span id="s560">And as I say, my parents were atheists.</span> <span id="s561">They didn’t do anything about being Jewish, religiously, that is, for sure.</span> <span id="s562">And -- But Hitler didn’t care.</span> <span id="s563">Hitler didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: How about you and your husband, are you religious at all?</span> <span id="s565">Are you like your parents, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, my husband came from an o-observant home, and I learned, in my hiding days, about religion.</span> <span id="s567">And so, after the war, I guess I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to marry Jewish, because I thought -- I don’t know if it’s true, but that was in my mind, that somebody who was Jewish, could understand better what went through in my head once in awhile.</span> <span id="s568">And so that was a hard thing, because most of the people in my age group, in Holland, were gone.</span> <span id="s569">Were very few eligible men.</span> <span id="s570">So, it took me awhile to -- to find the right one, or the right one to find me.</span> <span id="s571">And so, since his mother is observant, I decided that it was prudent to start out with a kosher home.</span> <span id="s572">And then we, somehow, when the kids grew up, we got more observant, and my husband is very observant, I am a little less observant.</span> <span id="s573">But we keep a kosher home, and we keep all the holidays.</span> <span id="s574">And the kids are not that observant.</span> <span id="s575">We tried to teach them, and it’s up to them now.</span> <span id="s576">They went to parochial school, here in Chicago.</span> <span id="s577">At least they had a good Jewish education, and they know what they don’t want to know when they know what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s578">And we -- we tried to be an example.</span> <span id="s579">But it’s hard, it’s hard to be very religious when I know some people all together forgot about religion after the war, others went just to religion to get strength in life.</span> <span id="s580">There are always so many questions that it’s -- it’s -- it’s hard, it’s hard to believe that everything just was for some reason.</span> <span id="s581">I can’t de -- I can’t deal with that.</span> <span id="s582">I th -- I can’t believe that was God’s plan.</span> <span id="s583">But who am I to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Do you feel like you have found any answer, or it’s just one big question?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No, no, I didn’t find an answer.</span> <span id="s586">No, how can you find an answer to this?</span> <span id="s587">I mean, it’s terrible when -- when -- when some person shoots one person for one reason or another, for hatred, for -- for jealousy, for whatever.</span> <span id="s588">And -- But -- But how can you murder so many people?</span> <span id="s589">I mean, it’s not just the 6,000,000 Jews, there were 6,000,000 other people also killed, homosexuals and Gypsies, and whatever.</span> <span id="s590">People that were not hundred percent the way Hitler wanted them to look.</span> <span id="s591">When you were born with some defect, you were destined to go.</span> <span id="s592">That’s not life, that’s not right.</span> <span id="s593">No, I haven’t found an answer to that.</span> <span id="s594">I never will find an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: How often these days do you think you think about it, does anything pop into your head or you have thoughts about it?</span> <span id="s596">Is it often, hardly ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Oh, no, not hardly ever.</span> <span id="s598">There is always a day, you know, it’s like, it’s now January, so on the seventh of January, my very best friend had her birthday.</span> <span id="s599">She was just a f-few months older than I am.</span> <span id="s600">And now of course, I write down seventh of dec -- of January, and I say, “Oh my God, it’s Yute’s birthday,” and the mil --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: You talked about her in your video interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: And there are things that just happen, you know, that you think of somebody.</span> <span id="s605">No, it -- it -- it’s not daily, but it’s always there, in the back of your mind.</span> <span id="s606">But it’s also because here people have so much family, especially in Chicago.</span> <span id="s607">When we lived in Baltimore, in -- in -- in Columbia, Maryland we lived, everybody was imported from somewhere.</span> <span id="s608">It was a new city and everybody was from somewhere.</span> <span id="s609">So nobody had the whole extended family around them.</span> <span id="s610">Here in Chicago, they all are from the south side or the west side and they -- they have hundreds of relatives around them, and I’m jealous of that.</span> <span id="s611">People don’t realize how lucky they are that they have them, and I mean, they can fuss about a relative this or a relative that, then I tell them, “You have -- You have no idea how I -- how -- how -- how I would love to have a cousin that I could fight with, you know, because it’s better than having nobody around.”</span> <span id="s612">But, it’s with everything else, if you don’t know it, you don’t miss it, and people don’t realize it, when they have all this extended family, and so -- even if you bury somebody, even if you bury that’s a pr -- that’s a privilege compared to what we went through, cause nobody has a grave.</span> <span id="s613">Can’t go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Do you think so -- think a lot of people take family for granted, do you think there are other things that people take for granted that you might not, because of what you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Oh yeah, I guess always having food on the table, cause at the end of the war, we didn’t always have what we wanted.</span> <span id="s616">We went to bed and we said, “Mom, we are hungry.”</span> <span id="s617">Oh, when I think about it, what we did to this poor woman, to tell her that we’d like to have another slice of bread and she couldn’t give it to us, because if she gave us another slice of bread, we wouldn’t have bread in the morning, and everything was rationed, and I, for instance, didn’t always get a ration books.</span> <span id="s618">So, then I ate from their food, and the son told me so, not because he wanted to be mean, but he thought that was -- was cute, you know, to say, “You know, you ate my bread.”</span> <span id="s619">Well, then I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s620">So, no, I am very ra -- very much aware of, that I never go hungry and that everything is available and that I have a -- a good life.</span> <span id="s621">Oh yeah, I’m aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: I’m just old enough so that when -- when I was very young, I don’t know when this stopped, but it was pretty early in my life, that occasionally, you know, we’d be eating and I didn’t want to finish everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: -- that I’d been given to eat, and I can still remo -- remember my mother occasionally saying to me, “You know, you should finish that, there are children starving in Europe.”</span> <span id="s625">And you know, it became like this cliché in a way, and I think when my brothers and I got a little older, we’d still occasionally hear that, and you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Now you make fun of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: -- we’d want to be -- well, we’d want to be smart, so we’d say to her, “Well, you know, so fine, so send it to them.”</span> <span id="s628">You know, “I don’t want it,” or “How is me eating it going to help them?”</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: That’s true, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: But I guess she was referring to people like yourself were in the circumstances you were in after the war, and during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yeah, after the war, it was still very tight.</span> <span id="s632">But, well you realize, you know, when you -- once when you’ve been hungry, it’s a different story, of course.</span> <span id="s633">But there’s so many unjust things in this world.</span> <span id="s634">I wish I could save the world, but it -- I try my best, just a little bit, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: How so?</span> <span id="s636">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I volunteer for Soviet Jews.</span> <span id="s638">Not the ones who are here, but the ones who are still there.</span> <span id="s639">So, try to pay a little bit back to the world.</span> <span id="s640">But it’s -- it’s tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: I think -- I’ve done several of these interviews, and one of the things that always comes up, one of the strongest things that people say, and that they refer to very often, is the same thing you’ve been bringing up here, is all those missing people, and sort of this kind of huge hole which is created at the center of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: That can never completely be filled again.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No, it won’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Every-Everybody talks about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s647">Ca-Ca-Cause that is -- that is what bothers us the most, I think, you know?</span> <span id="s648">Whatever you do, you know, you can make a million dollars, you can make 10,000,000 dollars, i-it -- that will never be able to come back in your life.</span> <span id="s649">You know, in my house I am surrounded with things from my parents and the clock is my mother’s wedding gift from one of their friends.</span> <span id="s650">And you know, I -- I have peace with my mother having passed away at the age she did.</span> <span id="s651">I have less peace with my father having died as young as he did, because that must have been a result of the war.</span> <span id="s652">The sorrow and the anguish and everything else, he just didn’t want to live any more.</span> <span id="s653">And -- And that’s also indirect, you know, a result of the war.</span> <span id="s654">So, there are things in my house that remind me of my parents, that’s fine, that doesn’t seem to hurt.</span> <span id="s655">But there are also things in my house that remind of people who have been murdered.</span> <span id="s656">And that -- that -- that always hurts, that always hurts, and it reminds me of them not being around, you know.</span> <span id="s657">It’s something that will never be -- be fixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Tho -- Those type of things that you were just referring to, are there any of them right nearby here, that we can see from where we’re sitting, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No, this was from my -- my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: That is -- Tell us what you’re pointing to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: This is a -- This is a -- a silver tray that was in my aunt’s house, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Which is filled with cookies right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: -- is filled with cookies, yeah.</span> <span id="s664">And it never should have been in my house.</span> <span id="s665">You know, that’s what it is, too, because she had a daughter.</span> <span id="s666">So, if she had passed on in the meantime, it would have been in my cousin’s house and not in my house.</span> <span id="s667">And that’s -- that’s how it -- how all those things speak to you.</span> <span id="s668">So, you don’t alway think about the person directly, but then you see something in your house and you say, “Oh yeah, this was from this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s669">Or when I say -- when I say a date you write down, you just -- you think of somebody’s birthday or whatever special day.</span> <span id="s670">It’s -- It’s a big hole that can never be fixed, can’t mend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: There are some people, I would imagine, who would -- feeling that way, who would take those reminders out of their life, who would not have things, you know, like this silver tray, or like the clock around.</span> <span id="s672">Maybe they wouldn’t get rid of them totally, but they, you know, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Put them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: I mean often -- I mean, people have different responses to experiences, and sometimes when people go through very painful things, their way of coping with it is to take away the reminders, to kind of put a barrier around and make a space where those thoughts come up less.</span> <span id="s675">There’s -- There’s -- There are less physical things even around to prompt any thoughts like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Well, we did that in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s679">I guess we -- we just sort of had blinders, and just tried to do our everyday chores and tried to make life bearable again.</span> <span id="s680">But I don’t think it -- it -- it serves a purpose to -- to bend those thoughts out of your life, cause they -- there was -- they were all people, they were all bright minds and -- and -- and wonderful persons.</span> <span id="s681">And I think it’s good to remember them, and to remind yourself that they were around one day.</span> <span id="s682">It would -- i -- i -- I think it -- it -- it’s good to remind them, in your mind, of things -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hetty DeLeeuwe.</span> <span id="s684">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: -- bend those thoughts out of your life, cause they -- there was -- they were all people, they were all bright minds and -- and -- and wonderful persons.</span> <span id="s686">And I think it’s good to remember them, and to remind yourself that they were around one day.</span> <span id="s687">It would -- i -- i -- I think it -- it -- it’s good to remind them, in your mind, of things that were also good in our lives, before the war.</span> <span id="s688">We think about the good old days.</span> <span id="s689">They were not everybody’s happiest days, but they, you know, they were part of our life, so I think it’s good to remind yourself that they were one day around and sadly enough, no more.</span> <span id="s690">I don’t want to push it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: When you first came to the U.S. -- well, first of all, I don’t know if we’ve ever actually said your husband’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Abraham DeLeeuwe.</span> <span id="s693">Al, we call him.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: When you came over here at first, was it hard to adjust to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh, awful.</span> <span id="s696">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s697">I spoke a little English, but not American English, and I was different.</span> <span id="s698">It -- It -- It’s a altogether different life.</span> <span id="s699">So I guess I was lucky that we had children right away, and -- and that brings you in contact with your surroundings, and then somehow you make friends, and you get acquaintances, and when my kids were little, I met somebody in the synagogue, who said, “Oh, you can’t stay home all day long,” So she dragged me to -- to one of the meetings of -- one of organizations and that’s how I started, you know, getting part of the community.</span> <span id="s700">But it’s hard to, especially in New York, to get started if you don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s701">Here, it was different, here in the Midwest, people are warmer, and so they -- they come to you, and welcome you.</span> <span id="s702">It’s different, altogether different approach here.</span> <span id="s703">But in New York it was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Did you live actually in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I lived in Queens, yeah, in the beginning, and then later on we lived on Long Island.</span> <span id="s706">And that’s still New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Little different than Amsterdam, though, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: A lot different, yeah, a lot dif -- well, I didn’t live -- after the war we didn’t live in Amsterdam any more, we lived like in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s709">And that was better, that was better, cause you didn’t want to walk those streets every day, where you had so many sad remi-reminders.</span> <span id="s710">It was a good thing that we moved away . . . yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: What were you thinking about just now?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: How th -- How hard it is.</span> <span id="s713">It’s -- It’s -- It’s difficult sometimes to talk about it, too, you know, and it’s hard to express yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Doing fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yeah, well, that’s what they always tell me, but it doesn’t always come easy, you know.</span> <span id="s716">I never say no if they ask me, because I feel that I owe it to whatever, to talk about it.</span> <span id="s717">I -- Normally, I don’t talk about it, it -- you know, it’s something that is inside me.</span> <span id="s718">And my husband was here during the war, so he -- he also lost a lot of relatives, but he didn’t feel that -- the -- the anguish, you know, and the -- the Germans came to the house, and rang the bell, or they picked you up, or things like that, the -- the -- you know, always the nervousness that was around your life.</span> <span id="s719">So he didn’t grow up, thank God, that way.</span> <span id="s720">But he suffered enough from the war, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: When you think back on the time where that family had taken you in, and -- before liberation, or whatever, you did a video interview for the museum, now we’ve -- we’ve talked for awhile.</span> <span id="s722">Is there any little story, or anecdote, or memory you have from that time, that you haven’t mentioned, that -- I mean, it could be anything, or just a little thing that sometimes you remember that happened, or a conversation or some little incident, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s724">You know, it w -- it w -- it was -- it was very serious household.</span> <span id="s725">They’re very orthodox Christians, I guess that’s why they took me in, cause my stepmother told me, when I asked her why did you do this, she said, “Well, when they came to ask me, I figured God sent those people to me, and I have no choice.”</span> <span id="s726">That was -- There was never anything fun, you know, that happened.</span> <span id="s727">Wa -- Ev-Everything was serious, it was a serious time, we -- we -- nearly every night, even before the start of the liberation, we ended up in bomb shelters, because we were bombed.</span> <span id="s728">So, you know, it -- it wasn’t a pleasant life there either.</span> <span id="s729">It -- My father was up north, and nothing happened there, you know, he had all good food, and he was with sweet people, and he walked outside all the time.</span> <span id="s730">And, of course, he wasn’t in his own surroundings, but he -- he didn’t live under that pressure, like we had every day, that they bombed the surroundings, and once he was in jail, he -- he wasn’t so happy either, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s731">But [indecipherable] really nothing extraordinary that I can think of, I mean, when I was there, it was most difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: You say nothing fun happened, it was very serious, was that because, you know, it was a serious and difficult time, or were these people also just very serious and --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: No, I -- I don’t think that that’s the case, cause I remember not too long ago, couple of years ago, when we were visiting, that we were having dinner and we had a bottle of wine on the table, and my stepmother said, “Well, you see me, we can have a pleasant dinners, too.”</span> <span id="s734">Everything was just tight in those days.</span> <span id="s735">I don’t know how much money the man made, but they had to feed another mouth.</span> <span id="s736">I mean, there was -- they all had to sacrifice for me.</span> <span id="s737">And, you know, there was just always nerve wracking -- the circumstances were just that way, they w -- and they were serious people, but the war just made it that way, I think.</span> <span id="s738">And maybe me being there, too, you know.</span> <span id="s739">I -- I was a threat to their family life, there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s740">And they were s -- they were involved in underground work themselves, too.</span> <span id="s741">I never knew that then, during the war, I found that out after the war, cause what you didn’t know, you couldn’t talk about.</span> <span id="s742">The least you know, the better it was.</span> <span id="s743">But, no, it was just a very serious time.</span> <span id="s744">You know, you couldn’t go out, there was no radio, you couldn’t -- th-there -- there was -- people don’t understand it, how --how you grew up in those years, without having any fun, you know?</span> <span id="s745">And then, after the war, I was so serious and old, compared to 15 year old kids, because I had -- it -- it -- it takes it’s to -- it t-took it’s toll, you know, being away from my parents and it’s tension.</span> <span id="s746">And -- And the years before I was in hiding, you know, cause we -- we lived through all these -- these crazy times at home, but it was nerve wracking.</span> <span id="s747">I remember when my -- my youngest aunt was picked up with her husband, my mother just went to bed.</span> <span id="s748">She couldn’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s749">And the life was awful, life was just awful.</span> <span id="s750">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: But you’ve had a decent 50 years since.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s753">Oh -- Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s754">I -- I -- I’m not complaining, you know.</span> <span id="s755">Sometimes I think, “Well, what was the purpose that I -- I did survive?”</span> <span id="s756">You know, why me?</span> <span id="s757">That -- That comes up many times in your mind.</span> <span id="s758">But I have a good life, I’m -- I mean I -- I -- I won’t say I’m -- I’m every day in tears, far from.</span> <span id="s759">No, I have a good life, and I enjoy my -- my family and my husband, and even retirement isn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s760">You know, we travel a lot, and we enjoy that, and we have -- we have fun with our kids.</span> <span id="s761">Nobody’s life is perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: But -- And I think there are lots of people who have tragedies in their life, so I’m not the only one who had it difficult, you know?</span> <span id="s764">But this tragedy was so different from every other, normal tragedy i-in life.</span> <span id="s765">Can get sick and die young, it’s sad, but the whole thing is just unreal, but it happened, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s766">It’s not something we -- we imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: That’s about it for my questions, is there anything that you want to say a little more about, or that didn’t come up, that you want to talk about before we end the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I’ve no idea, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s769">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s770">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Well, listen, thanks for taking the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And -- And talking with us, and it’s very nice and warm and comfortable in here, and there’s what, seven or eight feet of snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: That’s piled up outside there in the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah -- th -- th --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: -- year?</span> <span id="s778">I mean, in the last week.</span> <span id="s779">I mean, I’ve never seen -- I lived here for years and I never saw snow like you have now.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, but you -- no, no, but we haven’t had it for -- the last one was about 11 - 12 years ago, maybe.</span> <span id="s781">I don’t know exactly. ’</span> <span id="s782">70, we came here ’76, in ’77 - ’78, it was awful.</span> <span id="s783">That’s 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s784">I don’t know what -- how long ago it is that we have that.</span> <span id="s785">For the last couple of years, I can’t remember having shoveled snow, but this is awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Now there are mountains of it out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s788">And then the hard part is to get out of driveways and to -- to see your way out of those -- those mountains.</span> <span id="s789">You don’t know if somebody’s coming, yes or no.</span> <span id="s790">It’s tough.</span> <span id="s791">Oh, I live for that, too.</span> <span id="s792">You learn, you learn.</span> <span id="s793">I -- When I first lived here, I couldn’t drive in snow.</span> <span id="s794">In my life, I hadn’t done that.</span> <span id="s795">But you have no choice here.</span> <span id="s796">If you don’t want to drive in the snow, you -- you’re stuck here, sometimes for months.</span> <span id="s797">So, we deal with it, drive careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Okay, well thanks again.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s801">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Hetty
