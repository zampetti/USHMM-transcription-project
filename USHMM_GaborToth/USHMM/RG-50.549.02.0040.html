<p><span id="s41">Q: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My father’s name was the same as my grandmother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s44">And can you tell me a l-little bit about what it was like when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s45">What -- What was your home like?</span> <span id="s46">What -- What did you do?</span> <span id="s47">This is maybe even before you went to school?</span> <span id="s48">What was it like living with your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I cannot say that -- how it would be without her, because I’ve always known one life, and that was with my grandmother, and in a big family with -- with four cousin, which was more like brothers and sisters, and I had a very wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s50">We lived in a big house, three stores high.</span> <span id="s51">My grandfather, he had passed away at that time, but he had -- had had a hotel in Elsinore, our neighbor town, and my grandmother was reasonable well off, and we had a wonderful life, and with much love.</span> <span id="s52">Of course that was -- might be a little bit more old fashioned.</span> <span id="s53">There were some thing which I saw later on, that our maids could do, that we were not allowed to do, but really we don’t miss it.</span> <span id="s54">We had a very nice, very beautiful childhood together.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What were some of the things that you weren’t allowed to do?</span> <span id="s56">How was your grandmother old fashioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Five o’clock, was five o’clock, and when she had said something, she was a female dictator, so she was ra-rather strict, but I-I don’t remember any time she hit any of us.</span> <span id="s58">It wasn’t necessary, yeah.</span> <span id="s59">A blink with eyes, a finger lifted.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s62">So -- But w-we were not a-afraid of something, no, no, no, no, but that was the way -- that was the rule of the house and they -- the rules we had might be -- was a little different from -- from others.</span> <span id="s63">There was also a generation, and different from the way our maids were brought up and the way we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Well, your sister was there, so your grandmother was bringing up six children?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s67">So she -- Tell me a little bit more about her.</span> <span id="s68">What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: She was a very heartful lady.</span> <span id="s70">She did new -- what she could do for helping people.</span> <span id="s71">But still she had -- she was Swedish, so there a difference between Swedish and Danish.</span> <span id="s72">The Swedes are lay -- almost stiff, and -- in their way of life, and she came to Denmark, very youn -- young and married my grandfather and they made together this wonderful hotel, and -- and she has always been in a commanding position, and she was that to her last day.</span> <span id="s73">So -- But our home was full of love and we had all the things we wanted to have to play.</span> <span id="s74">We had the big garden.</span> <span id="s75">We lived in Snagerstein, that is three miles south of Elsinore.</span> <span id="s76">We had -- From our windows we could see over the sounds of Sweden.</span> <span id="s77">We -- Every summer, we -- we wot out swimming and sailing.</span> <span id="s78">We had the boat very near to us, so we had it, really, a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s79">So -- A-And she was, of course, the manager of all the things, who make it possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: You said that she was -- that she gave things, that she reached out to people.</span> <span id="s81">Can -- Can you talk a little bit about that, what you remember of her as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, really, I dow -- just know that people came and -- and what -- what they got, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s83">But I know during the war, she was very helpful in many ways to people who had no clothes, because she gave, of course, what we ha-have left over -- be -- so, she -- she was very h-heartly in -- in her way of living.</span> <span id="s84">But the small details is difficult to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What do you recall about religion, growing up, or faith?</span> <span id="s86">Did you go to church, or were there any habits or rituals at home, that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: My home was a typical Danish four wheel Christian life.</span> <span id="s88">You know, you go to church when you on f-four wheels, for baptism, for wedding, confirmation, funeral and Christmas eve.</span> <span id="s89">We were not -- Of course, we believed, but we were not church-goer, not church-goer.</span> <span id="s90">We -- No, I -- I really think that the only religious influence in the house was that grandma, every morning, 8:30, listened to the radio from the dume in Copenhagen, there was every day, a -- a 10 minute sermon.</span> <span id="s91">And that -- that was -- But, we were not church-goer.</span> <span id="s92">First of all, there was quite a long distance to church.</span> <span id="s93">And, by the way, my grandmother was not very fond of the minister.</span> <span id="s94">He was from what we -- I would call a very Orthodox, and very narrow minded part of the Danish church, called Internal Mission.</span> <span id="s95">That, you know, everything was prohibited, but you were allowed to put cream and shoke in the coffee, but not ter.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Not to stir it?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Thas -- Hey wa -- Tha -- That’s the right, that’s right, that -- that part of -- of course it not -- not true with the coffee, but in that way, that everything was s-sinful.</span> <span id="s98">And that was too Orthodox for my grandma.</span> <span id="s99">And th-the sermons from the radio, that was something else, that was a more Reformed, and open form of religion.</span> <span id="s100">But, of course, the religions, the bages should be the same, bus all the outfits, which make the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What -- You’ve talked a little bit about the love in your household, and the -- the s -- the structure, the discipline.</span> <span id="s102">What else do you remember about values your grandmother taught you, or perhaps a sort of a philosophy, as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: There was no [indecipherable] kind of -- I really think that she thought that if we did what she did, it was okay [indecipherable] example.</span> <span id="s104">I -- I just think that’s -- that was her idea.</span> <span id="s105">She was not a -- a big thinker.</span> <span id="s106">We had too much to do, but she was a good pe -- a good -- a good woman, and we loved her, and so I have had a childhood which was quite out of this world.</span> <span id="s107">When I hear about what’s going on [indecipherable] well, that’s a -- I enjoy to think back a-at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: What did your grandmother do all day?</span> <span id="s109">You said there was some financial resources, was she working at all, fro -- a garden, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I understand you are a young American.</span> <span id="s111">If you have tol -- as-asked this to -- to a Danish girl in that age, “I have six children, I have a big house, and you say wh -- ask what I do?”</span> <span id="s112">I really think that -- We had, of course -- There was an aunt living with us, a-and she was so wonderful, and wa -- that was my grandfather’s sister, never married, and was -- was the lady who took care of the kitchen and all this.</span> <span id="s113">And then we h -- always had a girl, a maid.</span> <span id="s114">But those ga -- a -- a big garden, you know.</span> <span id="s115">That was the only thing I hated, it was to pick up the leaves from the -- the -- the leaves of roses.</span> <span id="s116">That was a big, and a boring job.</span> <span id="s117">But there was a big garden, and my -- my grandmother was very interested in -- in gardens.</span> <span id="s118">So, she got plenty to do, plenty to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: I want to talk a little bit about politics.</span> <span id="s120">I mean, did -- did you ever hear politics discussed at the dinner table?</span> <span id="s121">What -- What were y -- her ideals, or perhaps even yours?</span> <span id="s122">At this point, you’re 13 -14 - 15.</span> <span id="s123">How were you getting some of your political ideas?</span> <span id="s124">A-A-And it doesn’t have to be specifically with a specific party, but just ideas about how things should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: You see that, in Denmark, we ha -- for all the years when I was young, mixed government between the social democrats and a radical party.</span> <span id="s126">And, you must recall that, in the 30’s, after the Black Wednesday in ’29, Denmark had had very -- indeed, very bad economical conditions.</span> <span id="s127">A big part of our -- our export was agriculture, and the first -- everybody stopped in Britain, was our biggest market, that was agriculture products.</span> <span id="s128">So there was a really big unemployment in Denmark in the beginning of the 30’s, and there was, even then, not any tension t -- revolution or to Communism, all this, because there was a social welfare in Denmark.</span> <span id="s129">A social welfare, which was backed up even by the more conservative parties, so there was uni -- unity about -- to give the people who was not so good off as we, a helping hand.</span> <span id="s130">And after ’36, it turns a little bit, and in ’38, just before the war, we had a reasonable good situation, and of course the social democrat got the credit for that, and that is okay.</span> <span id="s131">And, at the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his number in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s132">We thought that Hitler was a clown.</span> <span id="s133">We und-underestimated that guy.</span> <span id="s134">His screaming, his completely directed reviews.</span> <span id="s135">He -- When we saw him in the picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- when we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn’t understa -- we really thought the man must be crazy.</span> <span id="s136">And that gave Denmark an injection against narcissism, because that was also completely foolish for us to believe that anybody are supermen.</span> <span id="s137">I never forget, we as Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, with our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and all this.</span> <span id="s138">And we couldn’t u-understand anything out of -- and therefore, in Denmark, there was a feeling of certainness, that that guy could never be a threat.</span> <span id="s139">That was ’36 - ’37.</span> <span id="s140">There was a -- that w -- I say, here was not something I knew that time, because as 10 years old, you are not that interest.</span> <span id="s141">But, the [indecipherable] was that when he had passed the bridge over Rhine, the river Rhine, and taking over the old German socketbeat without, and he was shooting at him.</span> <span id="s142">Maybe the whole world could have -- be something else today, this day in April, in ’99, where we talk about Kosovo.</span> <span id="s143">If somebody had shot at the German army crossing the bridges over Rhine in 1936, maybe millions of people had been alive today.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t know, but I say it because that gis -- my impression what’s right or wrong in Kosovo.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Do you remember when you first began to form your own idea about Hitler?</span> <span id="s146">Do you remember listening to the radio, perhaps with your grandmother, or aunt, or perhaps other people, neighbors, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I can say the day exactly, the ninth of April, 1940, I woke up and -- because there was airplanes in the air.</span> <span id="s148">We had -- To see an airplane in that -- the -- in those days, that was something special, but here was lots of them, coming up from south, over the river Sund, and they were -- the destination were Norway, because that was the day Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway.</span> <span id="s149">And then they came back and they -- then went over Copenhagen, and we have heard about the bombardment of Wachau, in the year before, when the start of the war started, and afterwards, we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to bomb Copenhagen if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty that let -- he should take over the power and -- and all this.</span> <span id="s150">And we had that time, 13,000 soldier, that was all, and somebody was killed at the -- at the border between Ge-Germany and Denmark.</span> <span id="s151">That day I got my impression what -- a man who have made a non-aggressive treaty with us, and broke it, that man was no good, and he was certainly not a clown, but he was a threat.</span> <span id="s152">And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the man, and the regime.</span> <span id="s153">But I think that goes for many, many, many.</span> <span id="s154">I was 13 years, that ni-ninth of April, and it was strange because I had to go to the station.</span> <span id="s155">I went to school in Copenhagen, that was a dri -- a drive of about an hour or so, and non -- in the train, I’ve heard about it.</span> <span id="s156">We have to -- seen the planes and all this, but when we came to the -- to Copenhagen, we had to stop one station before Norbel, and w-w-w -- had to go out of the train and up in the streets, we heard the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s157">And that was a shock.</span> <span id="s158">I was really in shock.</span> <span id="s159">And -- But we could do nothing.</span> <span id="s160">[indecipherable] dreams that you can have a gun and shoot, all that.</span> <span id="s161">Well, wund -- it became a normal day later.</span> <span id="s162">Where we lived, we saw no German soldiers.</span> <span id="s163">I saw them when I was a-at school in Copenhagen, and I really think Denmark is a sha -- I remember that’s the first time in all our history, we have lost all freedom.</span> <span id="s164">And I know it s-seems maybe a little pathetic, but freedom is something you don’t talk about, and don’t know exists until you lose it.</span> <span id="s165">Then you’ll find out what it means.</span> <span id="s166">This -- To live, one day in a country with law and order, the next in a country where you do not know what is law and order, because the other set up what you have to be and say, that is difficult.</span> <span id="s167">All this -- For instance, with the news.</span> <span id="s168">From one day to another, we just had one side of the news.</span> <span id="s169">And that was the main reason that we young people, of course, guided by grown-ups, came in -- very young in the illegal press work.</span> <span id="s170">As paper boys, we distributed -- and to me it was very clear.</span> <span id="s171">I went to school in Copenhagen, I lived on the country side in -- in Willet, so it was naturally I had some papers with me, and gave them to people who I knew would en -- would use them right, because that was all informations.</span> <span id="s172">W-W-We tried to listen to BBC, but the Germans make some disturbings jop, so it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s173">You should have seen all the antennas you tried to make, in order to get the news from BBC, three times a day.</span> <span id="s174">And, again, BBC was the truthful news media.</span> <span id="s175">But, maybe they’ll be just as muss -- misunderstandings from their side.</span> <span id="s176">Beeb -- The -- The German’s news from the different fronts, was always taken as 100 percent lies.</span> <span id="s177">But on the other side, in the fort -- in ’40, what happened?</span> <span id="s178">Holland, Belgium, France fell.</span> <span id="s179">Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s180">It was a very, very sad time.</span> <span id="s181">It was very difficult to keep up this stee.</span> <span id="s182">That was -- And our government, we had a government at that time, the-they make collaboration with the Germans, which we didn’t like.</span> <span id="s183">We -- We thought they were cowards.</span> <span id="s184">That’s easy to say when you are not sitting at the fir -- in the first row, but that was a very shameful feeling, that we have failed, that we now saw that England was very, very hard pressed, and there was none in Europe, who could help.</span> <span id="s185">Never forget that on -- in the ’40, they had still the pact between Stalin and Hitler.</span> <span id="s186">It was just -- there was no way out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: C-Can -- Can you talk a little bit more about people felt about how your government reacted, and what they would have liked to have seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I think that most people, they thought, oh hey, comme ci, comme ςa, it’s going.</span> <span id="s189">We have still our steak every Sunday, and we have st -- still that and that.</span> <span id="s190">That’s -- It’s not that bad, and that’s -- But, the young people, who had -- out from the -- the point of shame, some other interest.</span> <span id="s191">We wanted something should happen.</span> <span id="s192">Of course, most of the people of that part, were quite young.</span> <span id="s193">They had no responsibilities.</span> <span id="s194">I cannot today understand that maybe I would had another meaning, another opinion of things, if I’ve -- had been married, and two or three kids.</span> <span id="s195">But, we thought that we did too little to show that Denmark should again be a free country.</span> <span id="s196">And that was -- But on the other side, every b -- I think that some Danes believed that Hitler will win the war.</span> <span id="s197">But there were never a great Nazi party in Denmark.</span> <span id="s198">The two -- two and a half percent, that was -- maybe three, was -- and many of them came because -- and that -- that’s completely crazy --because of the pact between Germany and Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s199">And Soviet Union’s attack on Finland.</span> <span id="s200">There was a fro -- Finnish feelings in Denmark, and we really found that Soviet Union and Germany were the same bad taste.</span> <span id="s201">And some people, they went to fight against Russia in Finland and some of these people later on, when Hitler attacked Russia in 1941, joined Hitler, in order to -- it should benefit Finland.</span> <span id="s202">Finland joined Hitler in that war.</span> <span id="s203">But there was this northern feelings for a -- a brother land, and -- but that -- that was only a few people in Denmark, most -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munc-Munch Nelson -- Nielsen.</span> <span id="s205">This is tape number one, side B. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: The most people, they were completely indifferent.</span> <span id="s207">But then, time went on and we, from the [inaudible] started with distributing illegal papers, now started to print them themself.</span> <span id="s208">We got a -- a dummy from -- from one place in Copenhagen, had, by different person, got paper.</span> <span id="s209">That was a very big proten, to get paper for it, and then we made a copy, which we otherwise would have brought hundreds copies, then we made more self, and that’s -- that was our very, very brave assistance, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: I want to go through this step by step.</span> <span id="s211">Can you first remember wh-when this idea arose?</span> <span id="s212">A-And you talk about we, wh-who is we?</span> <span id="s213">If you could tell me who these people were, and -- and if you can think back, were you sitting around and you decided that, let’s do this, or did someone approach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, be -- Yes, i-it was -- the first thing was, that at my school in Copenhagen, that was the oldest school in de -- in Denmark, me -- the Metropolitan school.</span> <span id="s215">We had very good teachers.</span> <span id="s216">It was very national school, a very Anglo-Saxon kind of school, and there was -- there they started with connection to the university.</span> <span id="s217">And s -- one of my schoolmates had some of these papers, it -- brought to the school sometimes, and I said, “Can I have some?”</span> <span id="s218">Yes, and then it start in that way, and we were influenced by our teachers, very much indeed.</span> <span id="s219">And they -- to them, it was very important, because they were academic.</span> <span id="s220">They were Latin, Greek people.</span> <span id="s221">They could do that, they were experts -- they we -- were -- because of their background, very democratic.</span> <span id="s222">And that -- say, about the whole background in the school, and then, from [indecipherable] I started with two or three papers, and later on, we made them ourselves.</span> <span id="s223">And we, that is my mates i-in Snagerstein, playmates, were people who, we had grown up together, same age, 16 - 17 years old, when we -- we got the -- it’s a possibility to make our own paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: So at first -- I want to just go through this, a friend came with some papers and you asked for a few, and then you took them and distributed them, is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: We gave them to people we knew would be interested in them.</span> <span id="s228">And then, later on, it’s most -- quite natural that we made this 50 - 60 copy a month and brought them to people, and sometimes, if something special happened, we had one page, which they -- we brought out for -- I remember one of the main thing was when Stalingrad fell, it was a very, very hot number.</span> <span id="s229">And also, when there happened something in Denmark, the first murder.</span> <span id="s230">B-Because everything escalated.</span> <span id="s231">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: The first murder?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: That was -- That was -- We called it a cleary murder.</span> <span id="s234">Where the Germans shot a Dane who have done nothing.</span> <span id="s235">Just killed him on -- If, for instance, w -- the -- the -- an informant for -- a Nazi informant was a danger for the resistance movement, he, after the case was seen really through, that there will be no mistake, then he was liquidated.</span> <span id="s236">And then, always, when one of this hi -- Nazi servants, they were shot, that was cleary murder.</span> <span id="s237">And then, that was completely innocent people.</span> <span id="s238">And normally, was more than one, this would be doubled up, or something like that.</span> <span id="s239">And also, when there was a big sabotage.</span> <span id="s240">And sabotage was -- I never was involved in that, but sabotage was also a reasonable selfish thing that we did.</span> <span id="s241">Because when we -- not we, but when the saboteurs got the order from England, this factory is dangerous because they are making that.</span> <span id="s242">It is much better that we, in Denmarks, had people who set the -- the -- the bomb inside and blew it up.</span> <span id="s243">You see what happen when you have air attacks?</span> <span id="s244">We saved quite a lot of civil lives by sabotage, and it’s much more precise.</span> <span id="s245">And the people who was working in the factories who were blown up, they were warned, and they came out.</span> <span id="s246">That means it was a human, much better way to be self-destructive, than to have the British and American aircrafts coming over and bombing.</span> <span id="s247">So, therefore, i -- sabotage was a very serious attack on the German war machine, and that was, therefore, that the Germans, in ’43, the 29th of August, where there have been quite a lot of sabotage before, that was railway, it means that the transportation between Germany and Norway, which normally went through the Danish headlines, they were disturbed, and then the -- the Germans demanded that there should be again, a general punishment for sabotage and for carrying weapon.</span> <span id="s248">Then the Danish government said no, we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s249">And the Danish government [indecipherable] Danish government resigned, but there was not appointed a ne -- new government, and the -- it m -- had the effect that the Danish administration continued, but the leader was not a political secretary, but the man who was chief of the office.</span> <span id="s250">And not elected, it was an administration, and that administration continued until the day of liberation, the fifth of May, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: A few more details about the period when you’re distributing papers.</span> <span id="s252">When this young man who initially gave you the paper, did -- I mean, did you have to be interviewed, or checked out in some way to become a part of this network?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Only people they knew got it.</span> <span id="s254">It was not necessary, and af -- and whe-where I live, the school -- okay [indecipherable] schoolmate and the people I had contact with in my home Willet, I knew very well.</span> <span id="s255">So, it was not necessary to -- to have this check out.</span> <span id="s256">We -- We knew it was people who stand for.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: And yet, there could have been people who were collaborating secretly.</span> <span id="s258">Was there that fear at all?</span> <span id="s259">Did you have any misgivings, and how were you careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: We knew who were Nazi in our little town.</span> <span id="s261">That was no prob -- we had one or two who had these crazy ideas, a -- but they were not member of society any more.</span> <span id="s262">They were ap -- only to they -- a -- a kind of outcast, we -- because their mentality was that long from ours.</span> <span id="s263">So, no, that was no -- there was n-no danger there.</span> <span id="s264">Peoples who came out of -- from somewheres, it could be difficult, but then -- then we could make an re -- in-inquiry somewhere, but it was never necessary, but we had people enough, the young people in Snagerstein was almost hundred percent involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Ho-How many young people were involved, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I think we were n -- 15 in the little village.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s268">Now, is this something that your grandmother knew you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Oh, well, later on she says she wo-would have been very, very sorry if we didn’t had.</span> <span id="s272">But I think that was her fear for the consequences, and well, I don’t know, I think that most fathers and mothers, or grandmothers, don’t want to let something be a risk for their children.</span> <span id="s273">I -- What we did was okay, that was right, but why just you?</span> <span id="s274">I think -- I think that was that.</span> <span id="s275">But she would, without doubt, have denied me to do it, I suppose, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: S-So you did have to be secretive.</span> <span id="s277">I mean, how did you -- tell me a little bit about that.</span> <span id="s278">How were you careful?</span> <span id="s279">Ho -- Where did you carry the papers?</span> <span id="s280">If you were dropping it off at someone’s house, who you said would be interested, how did you do that?</span> <span id="s281">Give me a sense of how you did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Just like a normal delivery boy deliver things.</span> <span id="s283">You go to the door, knock at the door, give it to the right person.</span> <span id="s284">That’s all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s285">Only once I was -- another man saw it, and that was a policeman who stopped me.</span> <span id="s286">But he was a policeman, and he’d come t -- later on, it meant something, because he stopped me b -- th -- I don’t know whether it’s the l-lights on my bike that was not okay, but he saw what I had in my briefcase, and uh-huh, good.</span> <span id="s287">Because that is the most important thing, that the Danish police, most of all, really was loyal to the Danes, not to the Germans.</span> <span id="s288">I must admit that in Copenhagen, there was a -- a group of police -- of people who was really Nazi infiltrated.</span> <span id="s289">[indecipherable] And -- But not in our area.</span> <span id="s290">Th -- know that the policemen there have known us for [indecipherable] children.</span> <span id="s291">So -- But that was the only time -- bu-but he didn’t take any of the papers.</span> <span id="s292">That was before we -- we ever printed it ourself, that was something I brought from the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Tell me -- What -- Did -- Did the newspaper that you had brought from the school, did it have a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: That was Studentinus Iftatin, the Student’s News.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s296">And when they actually got news, were they -- how did they get news and then put it in the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, they had from BBC, and the national news, the -- okay, you know, that everything goes faster than -- than the lightning.</span> <span id="s298">So they -- First of all, what ha -- the criticism of the government, and we had very good writers.</span> <span id="s299">Later on, we saw -- saw one of the best journalists was in there, and authors and all this, who was forbidden to -- they couldn’t get their stuff in the papers, and therefore, they came fra -- came through the i-illegal papers.</span> <span id="s300">Tha-That’s the way you can communicate, and that was the only way.</span> <span id="s301">There were hundreds of different small -- small, illegal papers.</span> <span id="s302">There were some special from Elsinore, from the more -- there was a paper named “Information.”</span> <span id="s303">After the war, it became a daily papers.</span> <span id="s304">And there was the Communist illegal paper, “Country and People.”</span> <span id="s305">And there was -- fr-from the more li-left side, from the more right side, there was really quite a lot for -- for different -- There was a man, Nils Swanson, he made his own paper, called Ils [indecipherable] Jutland.</span> <span id="s306">H-H-H-He was from Jutland.</span> <span id="s307">[indecipherable] letters.</span> <span id="s308">And they were -- found through the nation distribution.</span> <span id="s309">They -- They were overall, because some got it, and copy it, and send it.</span> <span id="s310">That’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Gi -- You said that somebody be -- was a -- a -- a very good writer, and became a well known journalist.</span> <span id="s312">What -- Who is the name of that person?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Outsede, O-u-t-sed-e.</span> <span id="s314">He was famous.</span> <span id="s315">And many of the -- the -- the authors ra -- made articles in the -- in this illegal papers under nom de guerre.</span> <span id="s316">And that was -- the only way to -- to have your talk -- the normal papers had censorship.</span> <span id="s317">That was very difficult to -- to write anything against Hitler, against Germany.</span> <span id="s318">That was not allowed.</span> <span id="s319">And in the -- in the radio, the same thing.</span> <span id="s320">There was a -- a censorship there.</span> <span id="s321">There was a man with a finger on the button, that if something not special good for [indecipherable] you cut off.</span> <span id="s322">So that was -- And the papers had to follow the instruction, otherwise we would ge-get no paper.</span> <span id="s323">So it was rather - a little bit necessary, with the illegal papers, and all that.</span> <span id="s324">A little part of the -- of the truth.</span> <span id="s325">But the ne-newsreels, they were just about all the German riksers, all what they could do.</span> <span id="s326">But also they’re -- Never forget, we came through it because of humor, too.</span> <span id="s327">Humor was -- was reasonable.</span> <span id="s328">In that time it was so that the cinema played twice a day, seven and nine in the evening.</span> <span id="s329">And always there was this German newsreel, and the -- one day there was, on the first performance, seven o’clock, the newsreel said, “And we had an attack on England, and we shot 110 enemy aircrafts down.</span> <span id="s330">One of our own are missing.”</span> <span id="s331">There was a man sit -- from the halls who said, “Don’t worry, guys, it’ll be back at the nine performance.”</span> <span id="s332">But, humor, I really think we -- humor has also something to do with surviving, and might be there, Jews and Danes are -- have a little bit in common.</span> <span id="s333">We don’t like, for instance, a Jew -- Jewi -- stories about Jews.</span> <span id="s334">Well, we don’t tell them ourself.</span> <span id="s335">We have -- There was also, in ’43, Fieldmarshall Goering visited Denmark, and he wanted to see a Viking ship.</span> <span id="s336">And then he went out where there was an old Viking ship, the [indecipherable] and when Marshall Goering came and saw it, he -- and he said, “Hm, is that all?”</span> <span id="s337">And the little man who was in care of the -- that museum said, “Yes, that is all, Fieldmarshall.</span> <span id="s338">But with this ships, we conquered England.”</span> <span id="s339">See, th -- such story, told in a depressed situation, give a little light, a little smile, and is also why you survive, reasons of survival, that, oh well, it bad, but it c-could be better, it would be better.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Now, at this point, you’re very involved in these newspapers.</span> <span id="s341">H-H-How are you thinking?</span> <span id="s342">How do you -- What are you thinking about what you’re doing?</span> <span id="s343">Do you think to yourself, I’m a member of this informal resistance?</span> <span id="s344">How do you make -- yeah, make sense of what you’re doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes, but what else could we do?</span> <span id="s346">You see, that’s so strange that you all will -- shall have a reason.</span> <span id="s347">That is the only right to do.</span> <span id="s348">It has nothing to d -- with deep phil-philosophy, it was a must.</span> <span id="s349">Somebody had to do these things.</span> <span id="s350">And well, why shouldn’t it be me?</span> <span id="s351">All my -- my nearest friends do the same thing.</span> <span id="s352">We’re together in it, and okay, it’s also funny to cheat the Germans a little bit.</span> <span id="s353">I cannot -- I cannot go from that s-side of the story to that.</span> <span id="s354">It was irritating for the Germans to know that all their lies is not at all believed.</span> <span id="s355">And therefore, I always take what is coming from every general, in east or west, was some -- a little bit of okay, maybe, maybe.</span> <span id="s356">I hope it’s right, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you -- Were -- Did you ever have an opportunity to choose to do something like sabotage, and what were your thoughts about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I was never -- never -- remember I was that young.</span> <span id="s359">Sabotage, that was for grown-ups.</span> <span id="s360">It means that should at least been 18.</span> <span id="s361">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: You were about 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: N -- Yes, in -- in ’40 - ’41, f -- but when I started, i-it was in ’42 really, I was 16.</span> <span id="s364">So -- But no, I was never -- not any possibility.</span> <span id="s365">And that was also mostly a big town --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: -- affair.</span> <span id="s368">Even if one of the most important groups -- no, that wasn’t sabotage, that was people received weapon from -- from air.</span> <span id="s369">The w-weapon which was sent down from American and British aircraft.</span> <span id="s370">Well, that was guns, that was ammunition, that was detonators and all these explosives.</span> <span id="s371">And that was mostly fr-from people from the countryside.</span> <span id="s372">They kn-knew -- knew the area, they was much better in position to hide this -- the different materials they got down.</span> <span id="s373">And -- But I’m -- I was never involved in that, too.</span> <span id="s374">And the reason why I was involved in -- in the October actions, was because of that policeman, wh-who -- he came one day and s -- that was beginning [indecipherable] and said go and pick some people out from the station and bring them, and he s -- gave me some addresses.</span> <span id="s375">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Who was that policeman?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: He was the man [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s378">You got that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: We’re looking through a book that Mr. Munch Nielsen brought and will be part of his file, and part of the -- the Holocaust archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Mr. Chumla Larsen.</span> <span id="s381">The guy here, and he had the -- the big influence, because he was a police officer and had wi -- he was in the foreign police, and he had the connection with the Swedish Mr. Palmroot, you will see too him, in the book, because they worked together from the -- one from Danish and one -- one from Swedish side.</span> <span id="s382">And therefore, he was able to have more news, more informations.</span> <span id="s383">And he came and he was the founder of the group called Elsinore Sookgloop.</span> <span id="s384">Elsinore Sewing Club, it means nothing, but the child should have a name, and that was the name.</span> <span id="s385">And they were the owner of the book -- of the boat you see on this museum -- in the Holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s386">The fish -- the -- the 21 feet motorboat.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Who was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: This si -- The Elsinore Sewing Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And that was used there in October, for transporting quite a lot of people.</span> <span id="s391">In October, Jews most, but later on, it was used as career boat, as gun running with -- from Sweden with weapons for the Danish resistant movement.</span> <span id="s392">And Danish resistant movement people had to go to Sweden, it was also -- some allied soldiers shot down over Denmark, who had the luck to go to the coast on Canova, and they -- they were -- we had more boats, but this boat was the only -- was -- still was there when the museum required it.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Before we -- we move on to that whole chapter, I’m -- I’m just ask you a few more questions about the period in your -- in your life when you were working with your s-student friends and distributing newspapers.</span> <span id="s394">I wonder if you could -- In your initial interview, you mentioned a teacher that had made an impression on you and guided you, and I wonder if you could tell us the teacher’s name, and -- and more -- a little bit more about him.</span> <span id="s395">He -- He became a -- an important person in the whole situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Froida Yacobsen was the name.</span> <span id="s397">He was a social democrat.</span> <span id="s398">He was very, very soon in the action against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s399">He was a career between the Danish social democrat party, and the -- the German social democrats.</span> <span id="s400">He was in Germany very often, on bicycle and [inaudible] he was in the organization Matcha Otchie.</span> <span id="s401">And they helped many Germans when the party was forbidden by Hitler.</span> <span id="s402">And he was so anti-Nazi, and anti-Fascism.</span> <span id="s403">And of course, he was not a -- a real teacher, he was, what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: An apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: He was an apprent-apprenter --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: An apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Apprentice, okay.</span> <span id="s408">As -- A -- He should learn to teach and the-there were always a normal teacher together with him, but he has -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munch Nielsen.</span> <span id="s410">This is tape number two, side A. Okay, you were telling us about Froida Yacobsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s412">He was one of the men who started the Danish resistant movement, and when there was Council of Freedom, he was one of the first mem-members, and he made a tremendous job for the rest of the war, and had, together with people like [indecipherable] he wa-was later the -- the head of the Copenhagen University, a doctor, and many other people, they really administrated the resistant movement’s actions.</span> <span id="s413">There was no power for them, it was just done.</span> <span id="s414">In ’44, some of them were arrested, but they -- some of them wa-was freed again because of a -- a bombardment of the jail where they were.</span> <span id="s415">And that was -- Again that -- It’s very difficult when s -- things comes by an air attack, because one of the bombs fell in a school, that French school in Copenhagen, where 150 kids were killed.</span> <span id="s416">It was -- Therefore, we were thankful for what the saboteurs did.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Who was bombing?</span> <span id="s418">A: That was the British.</span> <span id="s419">And the -- It was a mistake on the -- but, we see the -- the risk when -- when you have the -- the bombardments.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: If you could just help me understand a little bit.</span> <span id="s421">Did you understand that he was such an important figure when he was in your school as an apprentice, or was it later that you understood what he had done, or -- and -- and -- and, if so, what -- what were you aware of him?</span> <span id="s422">I mean, what was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: He was a little man.</span> <span id="s424">He was very strong in gestures, and talking very loud, and he did not make silence about his hates to ger -- to -- not Germans, he loved Germany, but he hated the Nazis.</span> <span id="s425">He was a Socialist, and our school was very conservative, but he was a premed -- very fine teacher, and his idea about freedom was not to overlook.</span> <span id="s426">And first -- later, I understood -- I was not -- I -- I agree completely, because he was that kind of man who could do something -- aga-again these people were [indecipherable] or were -- were heart and people -- maybe a little bit of a demagogue, but well, he needed to be that on that time.</span> <span id="s427">It was a strange time, and later I met him many, many times.</span> <span id="s428">We had one meeting a year, that was the opening of a artist -- a gallery, where s -- thus -- a union of -- of -- not union, a company of artists, they show what they have done for the last year, and he was from Impa just like we, my wife and me, and we met there every year.</span> <span id="s429">And -- Until last year, he died a little -- year ago.</span> <span id="s430">He was 89, or something like.</span> <span id="s431">He was a marvelous pers-personality, and he really made us forget a little bit of the shame we had.</span> <span id="s432">We also had another teacher, he was the first man who really, in Denmark, wrote a -- against Fascist man, and the nasic idea.</span> <span id="s433">He wrote a book, “Plague over Europe,” where he defined what Fascism was.</span> <span id="s434">He was later on Secretary of Education in a social democrat government.</span> <span id="s435">So -- But he -- he had it -- he was more on the philosophic part of a ger, where he really f -- make us even more to dislike the Nazi philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What would you say your teacher -- apprentice teacher, Froida Yacobsen, what -- what did you take away from him?</span> <span id="s437">What did you do, do you think you learned?</span> <span id="s438">You know, you -- you mentioned that you felt less shame, you were very proud of him, but di -- did you take away any other things from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, but his idea that you have to stand up when thing is not right.</span> <span id="s440">You cannot just, as a good Christian, turn the left chin, when you are beaten on the right.</span> <span id="s441">You have to -- and under these circumstances, during the war, during occupation, you had to stand up and show that you -- [indecipherable] things, that we’ll not -- we’ll be bound of -- and especially because the ideas they wanted us to believe in was all against our ideas, against our belief.</span> <span id="s442">It was opposites all what we have learned to love and -- and believe in.</span> <span id="s443">So, he gave us this -- the maturation, what to do.</span> <span id="s444">If you want to be a full man, you will have to do something maybe you don’t dare to do.</span> <span id="s445">But you do it.</span> <span id="s446">That’s the only way we -- we can survive.</span> <span id="s447">It was, in 1941, ’42, ’43, up to ’45, a matter of survival.</span> <span id="s448">It wa-was about the future of our country.</span> <span id="s449">If Hitler had won the war, okay we as Danes, maybe would be -- ha -- been the next ins -- command after the wonderful SS.</span> <span id="s450">To me it’s -- the greatest fun is to see these wonderful Aryans, Hitler and Goebbels, in the -- in the front.</span> <span id="s451">But that should be the types and samples of the Aryan future [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s452">I don’t buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: At this point, what did -- At this point, what is going on with the king of your country?</span> <span id="s454">D-Do you ever see him, and what do you think about how he’s conducting himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: The king of Denmark was, as typical Danish kings, not true intelligent.</span> <span id="s456">But he was a very stubborn man, and he was stubborn at the right time.</span> <span id="s457">He was an -- no would ever deny that, the gallant pawn for Denmark.</span> <span id="s458">He made a fantastish way out of delod.</span> <span id="s459">He -- in the start, when he rode through Copenhagen every day, and the Germans soldiers, they saluted him, he looked to the other side.</span> <span id="s460">And he -- Once, a German ask people, “How c-come that your king is riding here?</span> <span id="s461">Where’s his guards?”</span> <span id="s462">And the underlings answered, “We are the g-guard.”</span> <span id="s463">He could do that, he was respected.</span> <span id="s464">He -- He did it wonderful his -- he stood up.</span> <span id="s465">I know that’s a story about him that -- that he would wear the yellow star, if -- if -- but that’s not true.</span> <span id="s466">There was never a yellow star in Denmark, but the story is good, and if the situation had been so, he would have done it, no doubt, no doubt.</span> <span id="s467">But the -- that’s one of the stories who are not true, but in a way, bear a bit of truth in -- in the self , because he would have done it, no doubt.</span> <span id="s468">He never talked about Jews or Italians, he talked about Danes.</span> <span id="s469">My citizens are Danes, and -- and that’s all.</span> <span id="s470">He was the first king ever to visit a synagogue.</span> <span id="s471">And that was before the war, but you see, i-it’s -- that’s a game that, it’s to show that the Jews were a part of the Danish society.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: He used to ride his horse -- when you’re talking about riding, he was riding his horse.</span> <span id="s473">Did you ever see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Yes, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yes, but you see, he came from the castle, through one of the streets there, and ladies, they went out and [indecipherable] out, you know, turn, turn.</span> <span id="s477">That was Denmark coming, and nothing else, and he did it in a marvelous, good way.</span> <span id="s478">But then, one day he s -- fell off the horse, there was something happening, and that was the last time.</span> <span id="s479">And then, from August -- August 29th, he had to give up his guard, and police troops came in, Danish, in order to -- to protect him, but from that ti -- we didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s480">And that was again that he was -- yeah, his leg was hurt, I don’t know whether it -- it was amputated, I -- I just know that he couldn’t -- couldn’t walk and -- but he was a marvelous king, from ’40 to ’45 -- ’47, he died, in ’47.</span> <span id="s481">And he was very beloved, and he was married to a German princess who se -- from the ninth of April, never would receive any relatives on the castle -- of the German relatives.</span> <span id="s482">That was -- But our -- We have very good fa -- good royal family.</span> <span id="s483">Oh well, we have had it since year 900.</span> <span id="s484">King Gom the Old, so we have grown accustomed to their ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: His -- His name was King Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: The 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: The 10th?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: I-I -- I want to see if you recall, when you first began getting some inkling that things were shifting in the country, specifically with -- that -- that Jews might be rounded up by the -- the Nazis?</span> <span id="s490">Do you remember how you heard about it or who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: That policeman who came and said to me, I have heard rumors about -- that somebody has been arrested, and -- but at that time, it often happened that Germany stopped some people and -- and then they were arrested and sent to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s492">But now it was a whole group.</span> <span id="s493">The Jews, the -- and well, I was first aware of it the day when I was not asked, but told to go pick these people up, and bring them there.</span> <span id="s494">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And you -- where were you?</span> <span id="s496">Were you at home at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I was -- I was at home, a night, making my loy for next day’s school, and then he came and said, do that and that, and I did, and that was a start.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Do you remember approximately when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: It was in -- in be -- the beginning of October, second, third of October, and it was strange to see these people come there, with their trunks and completely out of their -- know, they were, in a way, rather quiet, but you -- you could see they were afraid, and -- that was -- that was really the first day I really fully understood what we were fighting for.</span> <span id="s500">What the -- What’s it all about.</span> <span id="s501">And well -- But then, when they came to the different houses, with people I knew, of course.</span> <span id="s502">Okay, come in, see so and so, and so on.</span> <span id="s503">No Christian asked them -- later on, when I ask why we should do that.</span> <span id="s504">Because we knew everybody, we knew where there was a dog, we knew how -- yes, because who maybe would bark.</span> <span id="s505">We knew exactly how to find every path in the wood.</span> <span id="s506">We knew also, how you can go from one garden to another, without going on the street.</span> <span id="s507">So, that was -- that was the first assignment we got, and w-we were, let’s see now, fif -- well, 10, anyhow, who did that first.</span> <span id="s508">And then, the day after, I remember we should go there and there.</span> <span id="s509">We had 11 places from where there was -- people was -- boats was sailing from, and we went down with it, with the people on it.</span> <span id="s510">Everything was -- the only thing, one of our doctor, Doctor Gasfeld, he had sometimes to give an injection to children, in order to keep them quiet, and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: To make them sleep, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: And that was, he said, [indecipherable] thing that he ever have done, because it was not his patient, he didn’t know the condition and yes -- but he did it, and -- and never forget that, there was no losses.</span> <span id="s513">All the passenger we had, came out.</span> <span id="s514">And that, luck -- we had the church letters, we had the hospitals.</span> <span id="s515">When the day came, you know that i-it was leaked by a German, the s -- the Jewish society would not believe it.</span> <span id="s516">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: You’re talking about at the higher level, that a -- a German told a Dane that -- that -- that Nazis were going to round up all the Jews in early October.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: That was Mr. Dukfitz, he was a member of the German litigation.</span> <span id="s519">He was a Merchant Marine diplomat, and he had -- was told there would be two boats coming in to pick up the Jews.</span> <span id="s520">Maybe he was okay, infilled by the Danish civilization, so he told it to -- to two Danish politicians and they went to the Jewish societies, to the mosiac society to the synagogue, they wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s521">But when they related this news to the fact there had been burglaries in the different organization, and the only thing missing was --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Burglaries, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Burglaries, yeah.</span> <span id="s524">And -- And the only thing missing was the register of members of the synagogue, they saw it.</span> <span id="s525">And then we have the story about Rabbi Milcher going in and said, “They’ll be no service today.”</span> <span id="s526">It was ju-just before the new year, the jo -- ho-hoshonah?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Roshanna -- Rosha -- Rosh Hashanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s529">The -- Just be -- before that, and -- and there was quite a lot of people.</span> <span id="s530">So, when the Nazi came, there was no people left.</span> <span id="s531">Of course there was -- the -- there -- it was not possible to -- to evacuate the Jewish old age home, because it was just behind the synagogue, and the synagogue was always guarded by -- by Gestapo.</span> <span id="s532">So they couldn’t bring these people out, and it meant that when they came, that morning, and on that night, quite a lot of the people from -- from the old age home, were taken and brought to -- to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: I want to ask a few more details about what you’re assignment was.</span> <span id="s534">So, you were at home, and this policeman that we’ve mentioned, comes and tell -- gives you an assignment.</span> <span id="s535">Where were you supposed to pick up the group of people?</span> <span id="s536">What -- How did you pick them up, in a car or walking?</span> <span id="s537">And did you do it right away?</span> <span id="s538">Was this something you went and did right away, or how did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: [indecipherable] within one hour, they should come, and I went to the station, and they came there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: The train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: The train station, yes, and I, of course asked, “How shall I know them?”</span> <span id="s542">“You will know them,” he said.</span> <span id="s543">And they came there, and okay, you know, very confused.</span> <span id="s544">They have got the message that -- and then the -- the only guy -- man they saw was a guy 17 years old, come along.</span> <span id="s545">And we went to these families and stayed there, because I -- I was also -- I would get new orders later.</span> <span id="s546">And brought them to the -- to the people there and from other stations, Elsinore, Esbeger, Snagerstein, people came, they have got ex -- explanations, you go there and there.</span> <span id="s547">And then the Mr. Chumsen, who [indecipherable] see there, he was the man who combined -- in two or three days, he combined all the different groups, because many -- there was a private fisher, we belonged to the resistant movement, and so, out of nothing, came a fleet.</span> <span id="s548">Really, there were quite a lot of boats going o -- further up at the coast, the big fisher boats, they could take 50 at every trip over, and that was -- but our boat had been there before, because that -- that [indecipherable] used to -- since the 29th of August, where we shipped soldiers, Danish officers, because that’s -- they started -- Danish military battalion -- no, that’s regiment, I joined that, later on, after coming to Sweden.</span> <span id="s549">So, it was -- the -- we had our boat, and that boat was in use all the time, and then a couple times, I was asked to go with a -- if there was something very important, and later on, I too -- because I was a culear, I had letters from -- I don’t know who, but I knew who was the receiver in -- in Sweden.</span> <span id="s550">But, i-in the first time, it was so, that the people came up, and they have been hidden, the -- the Jewish refugees come up, they have been hidden, for instant, in the hospital, becau --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: This was the first time you were asked to do it?</span> <span id="s552">A: No, the first time, no, no.</span> <span id="s553">But people came from hospitals, they came from ev -- anywhere.</span> <span id="s554">In hospital, there are always places or rooms where they connect the different -- different parts of the hospital.</span> <span id="s555">That was warm, there were -- and they had plenty of food, and they stayed there for a couple of days, three, four days, and then, for instance, if there was a funeral from the hospital, first was the wagon with the body -- and there was lots of taxis, and they go from the hospital to the cemetery, but a car, one on one, make another direction, and that way, they came out of the hospital, without being -- it was natural there was many cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Oh, you’re describing how you snuck people out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: N-Not me.</span> <span id="s558">Resistance --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Not you, but the resistance movement?</span> <span id="s560">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: And that gave the possibility to get up to the coast, and that is one of the ways.</span> <span id="s563">Other ways was by ambulances, they were going up there.</span> <span id="s564">But, the most came by -- by train.</span> <span id="s565">And that’s, see, especial in Denmark, we should not have passport for driving train -- to go by train.</span> <span id="s566">We had some different -- There was a quite different situation in Denmark.</span> <span id="s567">We were -- We had more freedom, in a way, if you can call that freedom, that you can drive a -- a train without a special passport.</span> <span id="s568">But we could do that, and -- and people came by themself, and every time -- Goldberger -- Professor Goldberger, he ha -- has been very involved in this -- this museum, he told that his father was cantor in the -- at the synagogue, had taken out his beard, that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Shaved his beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yeah, shaved his beard -- beard, and that is, for him, very, very, very important, but when he was sitting in a train, he had tried to find a way to get out, and was in the train back to -- to Copenhagen, then the -- [indecipherable] came and they said, “Oh, hello Cantor Ricoff.”</span> <span id="s571">So, but that was -- at the trains, there were no special guard.</span> <span id="s572">And by the way, I don’t think that the most of these crazy SS men, Gestapo, knew what a Jew looked like.</span> <span id="s573">One thing they wouldn’t understand, that anybody would help a Jew.</span> <span id="s574">That was a very big surprise, they thought, it’s very easy, let them hide, w-when -- in no time they will come up and we take them as sitting ducks.</span> <span id="s575">But they didn’t come, and it gave us, really, at least one week where they just hesitated, and -- and that -- that was a mood in the people, they re -- that was the first time we -- a li -- forgot a little bit of the shame and -- and really thought, okay.</span> <span id="s576">That -- That was the result of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: You were sitting up straighter --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I’m a little bit proud --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: -- just now, when you did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: -- a little bit proud of it.</span> <span id="s581">And -- But, on the other side, we had all the luck.</span> <span id="s582">In 1943 -- no, in 1942, the Norwegian Jews was taken.</span> <span id="s583">Sweden did not help, would not help.</span> <span id="s584">But in 1943, after we had el Alemaigne, where Rommel was thrown out of Africa, we had Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s585">Rome had surrendered and the master of the sky was the allied aircrafts.</span> <span id="s586">There will be no, no risk for Sweden for a German attack.</span> <span id="s587">Germany, or ra -- ja -- Sweden accepted to take all Danish refugees in.</span> <span id="s588">Remember one thing, all Danish refugees.</span> <span id="s589">I -- Is very important, because we had some not Danish Jews, who’d been in Denmark, coming up from Poland.</span> <span id="s590">Not many, but they were ha -- ha -- was in the country the ninth of April, when we were occupied and pa -- they stayed there.</span> <span id="s591">But that was the cr -- we’ll always see that in the -- in the book -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munch Nielsen.</span> <span id="s593">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: And -- Where did we come to?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: You -- You were just talking, I think, about the circumstances which had changed, which perhaps made this possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah, because what happening was that now w -- the Swedes gave all Danes free pass to Sweden.</span> <span id="s597">But we’d had these Jewish -- non-Danish Jews, but together with quite a lot of refugees, came also Danish police people.</span> <span id="s598">You must remember that in 1943, and before the war, it was very seldom a Dane had a passport.</span> <span id="s599">We could go without passports as -- into Sweden, Norway and Finland, and that was normally what was done, that was before the charter explosion and -- and people did not -- I remember when my uncle, wh-who lived in Paris in the 30’s, came back to Denmark by air, it was in the local papers, that -- th-that -- so it wa -- so seldom was it.</span> <span id="s600">But the Danish police, they issue a passport to most all the refugees, and when a girl, Jewish, from Poland, non-Danish resident, she got a Danish passport.</span> <span id="s601">That way, she was under the promise from si -- from Sweden, that all Danes were able to come in, and she tells it -- about it in -- in my book.</span> <span id="s602">So -- But, again, the whole situation in Ochabol was very uncertain, a -- but also, there was something, I don’t know, who saved -- there was -- as a Christian, I can say a guardian angel.</span> <span id="s603">We had the time, we had the warning, we had the church, and out of nowhere, there was a fleet of boats, and that is, to me a sign of something, I don’t know, but the meaning was that there should be no Holocaust in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: I wonder if you could tell -- tell me a few more details.</span> <span id="s605">I want to fi-finish the story that you -- you were told by the policeman, one evening without warning.</span> <span id="s606">You went to the train station, you recognized the group of people, the group of Jews coming.</span> <span id="s607">What did -- Tell me where you took them.</span> <span id="s608">And presumably, you hadn’t had a chance to call your neighbors and say you were coming by, so tell me how that worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: They have already been in contact with the policemen, and that was no -- that was later on, when more came -- more refugees came than expected, that we just went to the next door, and it was never denied.</span> <span id="s610">Come in and let’s -- We never took more than three in -- we have seen in at -- a little town, north of Elsinore, Gilleleje, where 80 people was taken on the church loft, and that was because of a girl who was dating a German soldier, talked, because of ignorance.</span> <span id="s611">And then Gestapo came and took these 80 people.</span> <span id="s612">And that was the most that were taken, and just like the -- together with the people from the old age home, the greatest number.</span> <span id="s613">So far, I remember about 600 were sent to Germany, and 60 died.</span> <span id="s614">None of them came -- of the [indecipherable] came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s615">And I really think that -- that’s also very important, that we had no government, but we had that administration.</span> <span id="s616">And then, they got to go to Red Cross -- Danish Red Cross, the possibility to visit Auschwit -- no, Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s617">They knew it will be used -- misused in propaganda.</span> <span id="s618">The Danish part of Theresienstadt was painted, they got dressed up with plants outside, but of course, the prisoner was not allowed to speak alone with -- with the delegation coming down from Denmark, but they should speak together with a German officer, and the only language, of course, German, was allowed.</span> <span id="s619">But this delegation had two very important -- very important results.</span> <span id="s620">The first, that it was allowed to send gift parcels to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s621">That was some va -- why someone send clothes, some food, not much, but just that was give the different for starving to death and just starve.</span> <span id="s622">They sent school books to the children, so they could have some formal education down there.</span> <span id="s623">The next, and the most important then, was that none of the Danish prisoner should be sent to Auschwitz, or the other extermination camps.</span> <span id="s624">And the German kept it.</span> <span id="s625">And just before the war was over, I think it was March or April, ’45, the white buses came and took -- that was the Danish resistant movement, who demanded that it was not only the Danish resistant movement people who should be brought back from Buchenwald, or what -- the other name, but also the Jews in Theresienstadt, so they came home before the war, not to Denmark, they had -- they was not allowed to be there, to Sweden.</span> <span id="s626">And from Sweden they returned, in ’45, in July, I suppose.</span> <span id="s627">A-A-A month or two after the war, and they come back to their homes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Th-Th-This week that all of the activity’s going on and -- and you’re very busy, did you stop going to school that week, and tell -- and were you working pretty much all the time?</span> <span id="s629">H-H-How many people did you pick up, would you estimate, in -- or maybe how many trips did you make?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I -- I -- I can’t recall.</span> <span id="s631">I -- That was a 24 hours job.</span> <span id="s632">Of course, picking up from the station, that was only until 11 - 12 o’clock.</span> <span id="s633">There were no trains pa -- in the night, but to bring them round, to -- and then maybe sup -- go down to the beach and wi -- cause now, there’ll be -- there’ll be a transport possibility.</span> <span id="s634">That was -- And that’s the first time my grandma smelled there was something.</span> <span id="s635">But at that time, one of my cu -- my oldest cousin, he went to America already, in ’39, and he was in the American Air Force.</span> <span id="s636">And my -- He was also [indecipherable] my cousin.</span> <span id="s637">He flew -- He was refugee in, oh that was in ’43, in beginning of ’43.</span> <span id="s638">And then, in end of ’43, I had to go to Sweden, because of the -- something happened in Denmark, some were arrested, and then I had to stay.</span> <span id="s639">But, that was, of course, pretty much the job, and -- but the worse thing was, when s -- when the refugees had tried to hide themselves in the wood.</span> <span id="s640">And then we were young people, who knew every path.</span> <span id="s641">We knew exactly where would you hide if you -- and -- and -- but it took longer time to get them.</span> <span id="s642">And th-they were afraid un -- beca -- in that [indecipherable] in that way that we were speaking Danish to each other.</span> <span id="s643">So -- And the refugees could not understand what we would, that no German soldier dared to go into wood.</span> <span id="s644">They walked together two or three, but through a wood?</span> <span id="s645">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s646">It was too dangerous, no lights, no nothing.</span> <span id="s647">No.</span> <span id="s648">When they have seen, often before, that was the way the Danish resistant movement had some of their weapons, by knocking two soldiers down and taking their rifles.</span> <span id="s649">So -- But, in a way it was -- when a -- I look back, it was without any excitement.</span> <span id="s650">That was -- I understand the refugees, how it must be awful, awful, awful.</span> <span id="s651">But I -- All the things we have, and now the view of life and death in -- during a war.</span> <span id="s652">We accustomed to death.</span> <span id="s653">When you hear about Stalingrad, 400,000 killed, the millions, they [indecipherable] after the war, we really understood that six million Jews, so and so many Gypsies, and 10 million Russians was killed by Stalin, and -- but that was, in a way -- let me say I -- I thought we did a good job.</span> <span id="s654">I was satisfied that we have done it, and when we waved goodbye to -- i-in a way, have we fulfilled what Eichmann would have?</span> <span id="s655">To remove the Jews from the Danish bot?</span> <span id="s656">Isn’t that completely ironic?</span> <span id="s657">That, in a way, Hitler had a result.</span> <span id="s658">But, there was one thing that is more important.</span> <span id="s659">They came back, and they were welcome back.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: In your years, did you ever come across someone who recognized you and said, “You took me over on a boat.”</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: The only [indecipherable] is my wife’s maid.</span> <span id="s662">They graduate together, no.</span> <span id="s663">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Tell that story, tell that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes, that’s -- We were here in New York some years ago, and -- here at the museum, and then we were asked if we knew any Danish Jews living in America, and Sonia had the girlfriend, th -- they graduate together, and she came -- ask her to gi -- if they had some material, artifacts, to the museum, and they did.</span> <span id="s666">And then we came in and talked about it and she have been over in our boat, in the boat.</span> <span id="s667">So, at the meeting here, after the museum was opened, about Denmark and the rescue, she could tell about the boat up here.</span> <span id="s668">She came over, and I could tell how it was to have that boat, and -- but that was only a-an -- she was, of course, a little girl at that time, and -- 10 years old, maybe -- may -- no younger, eight years.</span> <span id="s669">And I-I-I can’t recall all that, and she couldn’t, of course not.</span> <span id="s670">But, it was a job who was done secretly.</span> <span id="s671">You did notice [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s672">The less people knew, the better.</span> <span id="s673">And quite a lot of the thing was in darkness.</span> <span id="s674">Remember, it was ju -- we have black -- what you call black-out, we -- it was not allowed to show lights from the houses, and when we went from the houses, down to the beach, it was through these passes.</span> <span id="s675">We knew, so we can go on scene from there, where they have stayed, the shelter, and down to -- to the beach.</span> <span id="s676">So -- And the most of the people were thinking of anything else.</span> <span id="s677">Why, that was the last part, which they thought was the most dangerous part.</span> <span id="s678">What I think was, I couldn’t ag-agree that wa -- w-we never discuss it, but unsure -- we were never hundred percent sure, out there, we could see the enemy.</span> <span id="s679">So -- But -- But most of -- of the people never m-met again.</span> <span id="s680">It was -- You must recall that from Denmark to Sweden came totally, over 20,000 refugees, from resistant movement, the searchers from Germa -- German army.</span> <span id="s681">Only one-third of all the -- the refugees w-was Jewish.</span> <span id="s682">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Essentially, at some moment, you were a refugee, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, it happened so that later this year, when the refugees -- not more were Jewish, I continued to -- to work in this way, that I was a career.</span> <span id="s685">I got from -- still from my school --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: A courier.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yeah, courier.</span> <span id="s688">I -- From -- Came, got some letters to deliver in Sweden, because we have the route, I was in charge to do that, and one day, I was told when they come over from our liaison officer, Mr. Pallum, the -- the Ger -- Swedish policeman, that I couldn’t go back because something had -- some had been arrested and -- and well, I was 17 years old, so I maybe thought that it was too dangerous, so I went to school in Sweden, graduated.</span> <span id="s689">I have a Swedish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: In Lindsherding.</span> <span id="s692">That’s in wi -- it’s, oh well, if -- 300 kilometers north of -- of the -- where we -- we have our -- at Helsinbor, th -- 300 kilometers.</span> <span id="s693">And I graduated and from there I went directly into the Danish brigade, and was a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Tell us a little bit about the Danish brigade.</span> <span id="s695">You’ve mentioned that, but I wasn’t as -- sure what that was, because -- are you saying it existed in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: It was so that after the 29th of August, in ’43, the Danish gen -- staff -- general staff, sent some Danish officer to Sweden, in order to, if it was possible, to make a regiment over there, because most part of the refugees was from resistant movement, and they wanted to do something, and there were military force built up with the Sweden’s acknowledgement, and paid by the Danes, of course, and under command of General Jewingeres, and British general, we were s-str [indecipherable] to serve to the six army.</span> <span id="s697">No, the eight army, under ja -- Montgomery.</span> <span id="s698">And we were supposed to be -- to land in Denmark, if there was -- and when -- an invasion on the Danish.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So you were training to be a real ground troop?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s701">Yes, we ha -- we had really commander training, it was very hard, but still we have that -- we had a purpose.</span> <span id="s702">We had really that idea to come back and fight.</span> <span id="s703">To have the sin from the ninth of April away.</span> <span id="s704">But -- And in that, of course, there were many Jews.</span> <span id="s705">Young Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s708">They were Danish citizens.</span> <span id="s709">So that was the same -- you si -- you see, that’s also maybe the difference.</span> <span id="s710">No -- No, that’s not difference, because quite a lot of Jews were really wonderful German soldiers in the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And the Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: The Polish, too, yes.</span> <span id="s713">So, their loss.</span> <span id="s714">So we -- I started there, just after I graduated, and was -- I think it was end of March from ’44, and we returned back in the fifth of May, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Were you hoping that you would be able to go while the war was still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Hope to do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: To fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Well, that was the purpose.</span> <span id="s719">Later on, that was strange enough, because we only had very small fights with the Germans, and I suppose we lost 10 or 15 men, or something like that.</span> <span id="s720">But we were a little bit disappointed.</span> <span id="s721">We -- It wa -- Again, luck.</span> <span id="s722">I -- I -- I don’t know how we shall d-describe, not only the Jews situation, but oth -- the other Danish situation.</span> <span id="s723">That was something that kept em from the disaster.</span> <span id="s724">When you came back to Denmark, it has not towns ruined by bombs.</span> <span id="s725">We -- We had the possibility to -- to live, we -- so it -- i-it was something very strange.</span> <span id="s726">Not a rich country, but not a poor country, not a destroyed country.</span> <span id="s727">And it’s a country which not had an internal fight between left and right.</span> <span id="s728">And we were so lucky that the Russian invasion stopped before our border.</span> <span id="s729">Only one place, on one of the isles, Bornholm, it was bombed, because a German commandant would not surrender, then they were bombed by Russians.</span> <span id="s730">And the Russian took Bornholm, and stayed there for so and so long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Describe how you got back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s732">When were you told that you should mobilize?</span> <span id="s733">How did you get over with your brigade?</span> <span id="s734">And -- And perhaps even when you actually got off the boat, how did your -- your fellow citizens react?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Well, we were mobilized long time, because from [indecipherable] after the Odenna offensive of -- in -- of pard -- Christmas, ’44, we were in red ale-alert, always should be no distance from -- from our weapons.</span> <span id="s736">Then we were brought down, transported to our camp in south of Sweden.</span> <span id="s737">And then, in the night and I can tell you that Denmark was an ixtas, the fourth of May, that it was said on BBC.</span> <span id="s738">The German troops in Holland, northwest Germany and Denmark, has surrendered.</span> <span id="s739">And we stood there, of course, happy.</span> <span id="s740">But then, during the night, we went to Helsinbor, went into -- to a fisher boat com -- [indecipherable] over, a small -- Maritimcota from the fleet, and later on, the ferries was used, and we came into Elsin-Elsinore and families standing there, and crying.</span> <span id="s741">It was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Did you know anyone in the crowd?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Oh, that was my hometown, yes.</span> <span id="s744">After 10 minutes, I was in my own hou -- home, just for five minutes, to say hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: What did your grandmother say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Welcome home.</span> <span id="s747">Oh, wa -- It was -- It was a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: And then, you said you just had five minutes.</span> <span id="s749">Wha-What was your assignment, where did you have to go off to?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Oh well, we should -- we had two assignments.</span> <span id="s751">First of all, our -- we were an infantry battalion, we went down to the boat line between Germany and Denmark.</span> <span id="s752">We have to see that the Germans came out of Denmark in order, and not stealing too much.</span> <span id="s753">And we did that for -- until July month.</span> <span id="s754">We had another -- We have some pioneers -- engineer soldiers, and they should be in command of getting the mine fields clean.</span> <span id="s755">And that was, of course, the German soldiers who -- who did the Dutch job, but our men was so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You kept the German soldiers so that they could help you sweep for the mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">I know that is not quite doing the Geneva co-committee, but well, they have put it down, let them take it up.</span> <span id="s759">So -- But w-we -- That was a really smooth affair down in -- in -- in -- in their borderline.</span> <span id="s760">There was only few accidents.</span> <span id="s761">Some German soldiers tried -- that was SS soldiers, tried to go behind the lines, because they knew that they will be in special camps, and we caught some of them, but the most they -- old men, to me.</span> <span id="s762">They came there, going with their baskets and there no future, they couldn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s763">That was not the -- the very strong army we have seen Hitler, that -- what he did to his own, that is remarkable.</span> <span id="s764">But they followed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munch Nielsen.</span> <span id="s767">This is tape number three, side A. Before we move on too much into the post war era, I wanted to ask this question, and you’ve certainly touched on it many times, but why do you think the rescue of Jews, fellow citizens, but they were Jews, was so successful in -- in your country?</span> <span id="s768">Why do you think that was so?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: It was obviously the only way we can do it, the only way we could live.</span> <span id="s770">That’s, as I said before, 20,000 refugees, Danish refugees was in -- in Sweden, one-third was Jewish.</span> <span id="s771">Whether you’re -- Whether Dane, Jewish or non-Jewish, thas would be the same.</span> <span id="s772">We had to do everything we could to save Danes from the fate, to go to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s773">We knew about the concentration camps in 1943, not the -- the whole truth, but we knew that these people will live in agony, I -- we nee -- they had to live in humiliation, they were starve -- you couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s774">And especially not the Jews, because they were absolutely innocent.</span> <span id="s775">There was very few Jews in the Danish resistant movement, because that was an agreement, that we wouldn’t have -- we wouldn’t know, the people who decide that -- that because of a Jew was caught, we should see a Crystal night in Denmark.</span> <span id="s776">We couldn’t have that.</span> <span id="s777">One of my good friends, [indecipherable] Israel, he lives in Israel now, he was one of the guys who took -- broke in -- in the synagogue, and took all the silver.</span> <span id="s778">The Torah scrolls, they were all hidden in a Danish church, remember that, all hidden there.</span> <span id="s779">But -- There was quite a lot, and they were afraid.</span> <span id="s780">And he was one of the few members of the -- the resistant movement, and together with other Danes, he took the silver, send it to the commanding chief of the German troops in -- up in Narveek.</span> <span id="s781">It came, because then would it go to Elsinore.</span> <span id="s782">And in Elsinore, it was taken by the resistant movement, and -- and -- and -- and hidden ti -- until the war.</span> <span id="s783">The synagogue was not touch by the Germans.</span> <span id="s784">This -- The Jewish prisoners interationta was not sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s785">Why?</span> <span id="s786">Because SS, Gestapo, the Germans, have seen how we reacted.</span> <span id="s787">And we were -- Denmark were rather important as distributor of food to Germany.</span> <span id="s788">And it mean, if they did something, it will be closed.</span> <span id="s789">The Danish railway sabotage was qua -- rather good.</span> <span id="s790">At the same time, they were building up the west la -- la -- the lansing line, or what, west wall what do you call it?</span> <span id="s791">And it was so much sabotaged in Denmark, by putting sugar in the concrete, and it wouldn’t harden.</span> <span id="s792">You know that?</span> <span id="s793">And they have seen -- they have seen the result that -- but they never would have believed, helps the Jews.</span> <span id="s794">They must have been completely out of their mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Do you ever think, or have you thought, or discussed this with anyone, that if -- if in other situations, in other countries, if there had been a similar kind of organized -- well, a similar kind of resistance, let’s say, and an attempt to save Jews, that things could have been different in other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: First of all, that was -- that is not right, with organization.</span> <span id="s797">The success was because it was not organized.</span> <span id="s798">It was private -- I mean, here and there, but of course, later, and during the time, it was organized.</span> <span id="s799">What I really mean is that if the Pope had done something in the 30’s, maybe the situa-situation have been different.</span> <span id="s800">To me, a situation -- I -- I am proud that the only church who really condemned, was the Danish church.</span> <span id="s801">That -- And it was not just words, because many refugee found a shelter in the vicary, and many Danish priests were in connection with the resistant movement, and that way, were helping the refugees to Sweden, send them ta -- send them to -- to other people who was -- but naturally, if there have been con -- people have condemned this, but who want to help a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: You’ve talked a lot in this interview, mentioned that -- the feeling of shame, of not doing enough, and then a -- and then how that -- that feeling shifted, when people -- Danish people began to do so much.</span> <span id="s803">In the -- In the era after the war, I -- I wonder if you could talk about that, the Danish people came out of the war feeling that really, you had behaved, you had done the right thing.</span> <span id="s804">Many people have come out of the war feeling maybe that they didn’t make good choices, and as -- I -- I read a quote that the Danes did not lose their souls during the time of Hitler.</span> <span id="s805">And I just wonder if you have any thoughts on that, I mean, whether -- whether you disagree with it, or -- or if it sparks any other thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I never gave it a -- a thought, because we come -- we came back and we have been involved all the time, and I know that it was, as I said, with my grandmother’s blessing.</span> <span id="s807">I think the main thought in Denmark, oh, God be praised.</span> <span id="s808">We had a very cheap travel.</span> <span id="s809">And -- But we learned from it.</span> <span id="s810">Denmark went into NATO.</span> <span id="s811">Today we are in Kosovo.</span> <span id="s812">We -- I learned -- to me for -- for instance, that the eur -- eur -- European union is very important, I z -- have worked for -- and the European movement for 35 years or something.</span> <span id="s813">That was -- NATO and that European movement was in order to avoid war.</span> <span id="s814">We have seen the war, and in the -- the years after the war, we saw the casualties, we saw the million, we saw the result, we saw the con -- the concentration camps and -- and if continued in -- in the Soviet Union, where a gulag -- where Stalin killed even more people than Hitler.</span> <span id="s815">But, I thought, naïve as I was, that unity in Europe could make us a better continent.</span> <span id="s816">And I really think we have achieved quite a lot in that way.</span> <span id="s817">I really think that for the first time in history, there’s not being a war in 50 years between central European states.</span> <span id="s818">We have, of course, now down at the Balkan, but we have not have this war between England, France and Germany.</span> <span id="s819">England an-and -- and France, to be the master of Europe.</span> <span id="s820">We have had this union which -- and my idea of a -- a union is what Charles DeGaulle said, a Europe of the Fatherlands.</span> <span id="s821">We are Danes, we are French, but we are Europeans, but we are not going to be directed from Brussels.</span> <span id="s822">We have our own parliament, but we have so many common interests.</span> <span id="s823">We have the now -- which Denmark, not are in yet, the eril -- the economy, but we will have it [indecipherable] in some years, we will also be member of the European -- have the Euro as our currency.</span> <span id="s824">And I really look forward to that.</span> <span id="s825">But the question that we should have been proud of ourself now, I really think there was, in Denmark, very much self criticism of the way we behaved, the government, the -- the work.</span> <span id="s826">They worked too much together with the -- with the German authorities, but on the other side, we did not lose ourself, that’s right.</span> <span id="s827">The -- I was not less Danes when I returned than before, I really think that.</span> <span id="s828">W-We had a much easier time during the war than most part.</span> <span id="s829">Only Sweden had it better.</span> <span id="s830">Yeah, they -- that -- so -- and after the war, I really think that we have made very, very big progresses.</span> <span id="s831">We -- And the situation between the nations in Europe is much better than it was before, and so we have learned by the war, f-for Denmark to go into NATO, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s832">That’s just like to make a garden on the inlands eyes of -- yes, because we -- It’s so long time we were a wild Viking nation, we still remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: You’ve mentioned Kosovo once or twice, and I just ge -- like to get you to sort of elaborate a little bit on that, and I must remind people listening to this, that it’s April 16th, 1999.</span> <span id="s834">It’s about two weeks into a very -- a very fierce bombing of Kosovo and of -- of Serb -- Serbian forces, by NATO.</span> <span id="s835">So, I would just like you to tell us a little bit more about what you think about the decision to do that, and -- and why y-you think it’s important or not important.</span> <span id="s836">A: I said before what would happen if, in 1936, we had seen the French attack the German -- the Nazi German troops.</span> <span id="s837">Maybe million of people’s life have been spared.</span> <span id="s838">Every time we stand against a dictator, you will see that he do whatever he want, and blame always his enemy for what is done.</span> <span id="s839">Now, that was the only way out.</span> <span id="s840">We had, in order to still live up to what we are taught, that we are our brother’s keeper, we must attack people who deny other peoples their freedom.</span> <span id="s841">And I can’t see it co-could have been done another way.</span> <span id="s842">Maybe I -- I -- I will not talk about sending in today, ground troops.</span> <span id="s843">What happened today is that a fanatic man dec-decide hundred of thousand people’s fate.</span> <span id="s844">It’s -- It -- He is really a dictator, he’s really danger -- dangerous against the -- the world society, and to me it’s quite clear when you see the only people who support him, is the former -- people from the former Soviet Union, and China, and both of these countries have severe problems when it comes to human rights.</span> <span id="s845">And human rights is one of the thing we mut -- we cannot adjust them.</span> <span id="s846">We cannot say that human rights is for Christian, not for Muslims.</span> <span id="s847">So I really think that’s it.</span> <span id="s848">Go without saying, we have to fight against what I call the evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: The evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: I’m going to sort of go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s852">I wonder if you can tell us anything you remember right after the war, about trials of collaborators.</span> <span id="s853">And I know that there were some i-in -- in your country.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Well, I was against these trials, because the collaborators who was taken, was a small fish.</span> <span id="s855">And because of the -- the punishment they got, the lowest punishment for four years, all the small, easy cases, they got four years.</span> <span id="s856">But, when the big cases, where the real criminals came up, oh well, then the softhearted Dane has said, that was too much.</span> <span id="s857">The people who got the four years, they served their time.</span> <span id="s858">The others, they got maybe two years, three years, and nothing hap -- and we had, of course, the severe examples, the killers, the informers, and -- and some of them were shot.</span> <span id="s859">They deserved that, but the whole s-system of laws we had, first of all, it was against Danish morality to have a law which punished things what has happened already.</span> <span id="s860">You cannot have a law going backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: They had to enact new legislature for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: [indecipherable] l-l-l-legislation, but th-their excuse was that the Council of Freedom, in ’43, had said, if that and that are done, it’s an offense, and it will be punished after the war.</span> <span id="s863">But, it was not a government, it was -- that had no power but okay, the main ideas in -- in the law was exactly what the Council of Freedom has said, but the Council of Freedom had not included this small, unimportant guys, they would have the criminals, they would have really crimi -- the people who broke our law, who was traitors, but that was a small, completely inno -- not innocent, but ignorant people who was punished out, and that was -- and then, if you were lucky and first were taken prisoner three years after the war, and have done serious crimes, we would not have the death penalty.</span> <span id="s864">Children, be at five, six, seven years, and well, that was wrong done.</span> <span id="s865">The idea was right, of course you sc -- you have to be punished for thing you do, but it was done in the wrong way.</span> <span id="s866">They hit the wrong people.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: What -- What about in your town, or Elsinore, what happened to the -- there weren’t as many, but what happened to the handful of collaborators there?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Oh, they were arrested, but wha -- I must say, I’m ashamed of one thing.</span> <span id="s869">Quite a lot of the girls who dating German soldiers, ti -- they were captured and they cut all then painted swastika on the ma -- I -- I was very upset when I saw that, and that -- that was, to me that’s -- that’s a shame on -- on the people who did it, I -- was very brave to cut -- take the hair off a girl, that’s -- no, but it normally was people who never had done a single thing during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: The people who were -- who were looking for revenge, had ne -- I’m not sure what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: I said that the pe -- the people who -- who did that, never did a single thing until the war, they were -- they just find out how -- that was funny, that was -- okay, that was people of the street, and I’m very much ashamed of that.</span> <span id="s872">But it happened in all towns all over Denmark that wrong people was taken prisoner, and wrong thing was done to -- to -- to women.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So what do you think was going on there?</span> <span id="s874">Wh-Why did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Because of the ligisation.</span> <span id="s876">First of all, because the Council of Freedom wanted to avoid the Night of the Long Knife, as we had in other countries, where --</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: The night?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Of the long knives.</span> <span id="s879">Where, in France, for instance, where many was killed when the liberation came.</span> <span id="s880">Also private problems was taken [indecipherable], then telling this is because of -- of the war, he is killed or she is killed, he had done so and so.</span> <span id="s881">That was -- Therefore, the Council of Freedom wanted to have law, so the people who did something wrong, should be punished, but not private, this would be by the official authorities.</span> <span id="s882">And we did that -- we did that.</span> <span id="s883">The only thing was when the judges of the street, and that went the wrong way for quite a lot of -- of -- of the girls.</span> <span id="s884">S -- I don’t like what they did, I think that was completely wrong, they -- but punishment, not that way, not that way.</span> <span id="s885">That is the -- the jury of the streets, we -- we can’t have that, not in a society wh-wh-who wants to have law and order.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How long were you active in the brigade, after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Oh, for two months, about two months.</span> <span id="s888">We were dismissed the 10th of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Okay, and what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Well, when I -- Just enjoyed life.</span> <span id="s891">For more than a month, I just went around looking good friends up and meeting girlfriends, and living a life, and -- and then, in end of August, the hard work started, I started studying, I went through -- I went to the mercantile, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: The Mercantile?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yes, I ha -- merchant high school.</span> <span id="s894">Then, it took three, four years, and in the meantime I got married, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Tell us -- Tell us a little bit about your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: My first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Your first wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Nice girl, and we met, by the way, in the summer of love, summer of freedom, summer of everything.</span> <span id="s899">The summer the sun was up 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s900">So we [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s901">It was out of this world.</span> <span id="s902">That was -- And well, many of these [indecipherable] coming the first years was maybe a little bit too early for us.</span> <span id="s903">And then my -- the last year at school, at university there, I started in my father-in-law’s company and stayed there until ’81, long time after we have been divorced, and that -- that made a rather quick way out of the ri -- was many direction, by now I was 28, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What kind of company was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: We are selling chemicals, we are selling products for paint and varnish, plastic and all this industrious, and medical.</span> <span id="s906">And in -- in 1960, I ki -- had my divorce.</span> <span id="s907">We had three -- three children, a boy and two girls, and he is now a -- well, is -- is an old guy now, and he is, of all places, in the re -- what do you call it, taxation?</span> <span id="s908">He’s a lawyer, and they sit there and -- but ki -- he is a very, very keen civil servant.</span> <span id="s909">So -- B-But that’s not my way of life.</span> <span id="s910">But w-we -- w-we -- I see him two or three or four times a month, he lives not -- not so far away.</span> <span id="s911">And then two daughters, one is a teacher, and the other is studying, now it’s art [indecipherable] studying all their life, and had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s912">And they live both in Copenhagen, in the same -- s-same apartment house as my former wife.</span> <span id="s913">They bought that -- They bought that some years ago, and they -- they are living, and they are both divorced, my daughters, I hope, soon, because I want to have more ch -- grandchildren then.</span> <span id="s914">And then in ’60, I suppose, ’61, I married Sonia and we have three sons.</span> <span id="s915">The oldest is now main director in our company.</span> <span id="s916">[indecipherable] son is director and been working since ’81.</span> <span id="s917">And then a son who’s a journalist, he has been here, and who’ll -- who’ll be back in May, to New York.</span> <span id="s918">And then the youngest who has just been in onwha -- enwise -- enwi --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: NYU?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: NYU.</span> <span id="s921">Started on a film course, he wants to be a film maker.</span> <span id="s922">And we live in Esbagere, very near to where I was born, and we have the -- the -- a good reason to go to Washington once a year, and we -- I’m making quite a lot of speeches now, in America, and that’s very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: I want to ask about the speeches and why you come here, but before, do your children know a lot of your history and wha -- and what you did during the war, and if so, when did you tell them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: As I told you, this is not a issue in Denmark.</span> <span id="s925">When we are talking about what happened during the war, the -- we will always have this -- our debt, was it the first or the second World War?</span> <span id="s926">That is not an issue, because how could we behave in another way?</span> <span id="s927">That’s -- Th -- My children, when they see -- for instance when the groups of Jews are coming to Denmark, are telling that and that, they -- they can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s928">Why?</span> <span id="s929">Wh-What could you have done else?</span> <span id="s930">So that’s -- that’s not an issue in -- in -- in our speech, in our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Preben Munch Nielsen.</span> <span id="s933">This is tape number three, side B. Can you talk a little bit about when you first began making speeches about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh that’s -- I really think that’s about the time with the -- with the boat, when -- ’89, I suppose it was, that Professor Leo Goldberger asked me to find a boat.</span> <span id="s935">We have been together somewhere and -- and then he -- he asked me to find, and then I make -- and there was an interview in one of our papers, and the day after, the boat is here.</span> <span id="s936">And that’s the boat, you know, and that was fantastic.</span> <span id="s937">And then -- And then, the boat it built oak on oak, and it was from pre-war, and you don’t find them very often, because they were -- it took quite a lot to make it clear every year, for the season, so -- but the -- the guy who had it now was the third owner of the boat in this -- almost 50 years.</span> <span id="s938">So it was -- And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Let me just clarify something.</span> <span id="s940">You’ve mentioned Professor Goldberger before, he’s Danish?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: He’s a Danish.</span> <span id="s942">His father was cantor of the synagogue in --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Okay, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: -- in -- in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So, he is involved with the museum, and -- and he contacted you and said, “I -- We would like to find this boat,” and he sort of gave it to you as a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s947">Not the boat, but a boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: A boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: A boat, and we found the -- this boat and my surprise that it was our boat, was minst -- that has been placed for 50 years, for all the years, in Elsinore, and I have boats in that same harbor for many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And you didn’t know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s952">Because it was changed a little bit.</span> <span id="s953">The -- And the -- th-the name was quite different, and that is, you see, el -- in -- in Elsinore port there, the marina, that’s 1200 boats, so you can’t -- can’t see the -- know them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: How -- How did you search for the boat?</span> <span id="s955">Tell me what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Oh, well I just was interviewed and asked if anybody knew about a -- a b -- a boat from -- from the October ’43, and then he came with it and said, “I bought that from Tormul Larsen,” so it was so -- so easy to -- to go back and find the real thing, and [inaudible].</span> <span id="s957">We had some wonderful pictures the day it was taken up from the harbor and put on the truck for -- dispatched thing to -- to Baltimore, I suppose it was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s959">Do you remember when you found this particular boat and you actually went to see it?</span> <span id="s960">Can -- Can you remember back what it was like to walk back on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: It was wonderful, because when I saw it first, oh it was ugly, it’s ugly.</span> <span id="s962">And -- But then I saw the captain, and there was one thing different, because there was another engine, and that engine was bigger than the engine that was in the boat before.</span> <span id="s963">And, but also the same thing.</span> <span id="s964">You could -- You couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s965">And Tormul Larsen, who was the -- the man who owned it after the war, said he had many good hours in that boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Did he -- Did you get a chance to go out on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s968">But only on the last -- the last trip from -- from -- down to the harbor where it was put on the truck, and sent to -- to America.</span> <span id="s969">And then I saw it in Baltimore, because we had very, very keen discussions about the color, because the paint that was used on the boat in that time, was made of fish oil.</span> <span id="s970">We hadn’t -- We had no mineral oil to do it, so it was fish oil who was -- that was the -- the main part of it.</span> <span id="s971">And that was fine to -- to find the -- it was gray, in order -- and non-reflecting, you know, not -- no gl -- [indecipherable] should be non-reflecting the light, in order to have it more hidden, when they were sailing, as they go, one wi-with the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And so it -- Was it brought here on a ship, in a container?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: In a container, on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s976">But that was not our business, because we di -- it was delivered on the pier.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about -- about when you speak.</span> <span id="s978">You said you do it quite often now.</span> <span id="s979">What do you find people are interested in when they hear you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: First of all, si -- I must say that what I’m speaking of, is why Holocaust failed in Denmark.</span> <span id="s981">We are try to give the historical perspective, to give all the good thing which happen, with -- with the dates, the time.</span> <span id="s982">It was in ’43.</span> <span id="s983">With the help from the German, with the -- the position in Denmark that everybody would help a Jew, that it was not something uniqued.</span> <span id="s984">I want to give that forward, and then, the question is, of course, how did you do it, and all this and -- and I try to te -- also, in humor that there’s been very funny times.</span> <span id="s985">For instance, some of the -- the refugees, they had to stay, because they couldn’t move the pe -- move the hospitals.</span> <span id="s986">And then a nurse asked the -- the -- the doctor, “What disease shall we write on the chart here?”</span> <span id="s987">“Oh, call it German measles.”</span> <span id="s988">You see, that’s -- that’s typical Danish, typical Danish, that if we can have a little bit of joke, a little bit fun, and also to take the -- the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s989">These people lay in their beds, had maybe a depression, they were afraid and all.</span> <span id="s990">And then, call it German measles.</span> <span id="s991">They-- It gives a better atmosphere.</span> <span id="s992">So -- And then they asked the story about the king and the -- the -- the yellow star.</span> <span id="s993">And then, the -- always says, why was they not arrested?</span> <span id="s994">Well, because, as I say, nobody of these guys, knew a Jew.</span> <span id="s995">They had to ca -- th -- from the gossip papers and all this.</span> <span id="s996">And also try to tell that -- that w-we -- we had food enough in Denmark, we -- it was not under same control and that it was not an organization.</span> <span id="s997">It was many, many different people who tried to help and okay, there must have been a guardian angel in one way or another, whether you believe in angels or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, because I think this is in your first interview, and i-i-it’s just in speaking to you again, you’re clearly asked over and over, why did you do this, why did the Danish people help the Jews?</span> <span id="s999">And you -- you, over and over, try to convey why you did it, but you’re also trying to convey a kind of disbelief, almost, that you get asked this all the time.</span> <span id="s1000">Almost like a frustration, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: No, not -- But I thi -- But I think it’s very telling, ab -- it i -- it’s telling of who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Well, I really think that what we did was a matter of decency.</span> <span id="s1004">Could I have been able to look and see myself in the mirror if I had turned my back?</span> <span id="s1005">It was in ’43, we knew about the concentration camps, we knew that we had the possibility.</span> <span id="s1006">We knew that these people were innocent people.</span> <span id="s1007">I think that’s -- that’s motivation, must be valued, also for the people who ask.</span> <span id="s1008">It’s enough for me.</span> <span id="s1009">I don’t think we made something unique.</span> <span id="s1010">I will never be able to live a -- a country where you’re a hero because you give a helping hand to a fellow citizen.</span> <span id="s1011">Or unique be-because you act in a decent way.</span> <span id="s1012">You see, that’s -- that’s the whole thing that my belief -- that’s why I’m not for democrac -- lif -- I’m not for dictatorship.</span> <span id="s1013">I want to be democratic, but I cannot eat oysters and drink champagne if my next door neighbor starve.</span> <span id="s1014">I cannot enjoy my freedom when my next door neighbor, an -- because of nothing, because of innocent work, are punished, because he -- he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1015">It shouldn’t be a crime.</span> <span id="s1016">And we -- And we cannot accept that.</span> <span id="s1017">And therefore, I -- I really find that it was just a matter of decency.</span> <span id="s1018">And that is why we don’t talk about, that’s not issue.</span> <span id="s1019">That my children, they would have hated me, if I had done nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: H-How do you make sense of the fact, though, that so many other people do?</span> <span id="s1021">That they want to applaud you for what you do, that they do single you out, that they do talk about it?</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, how do you make sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I’ll have to answer with a joke.</span> <span id="s1024">Once there was a man who came to me and said, “Why are you always so happy?”</span> <span id="s1025">And [indecipherable] say, “Okay, in the morning, I s-stand up, go out, shave me, and see me in the -- in the mirror.”</span> <span id="s1026">“I do the same,” he said.</span> <span id="s1027">And then I ask, “Yes, but you don’t see me in the mirror.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Let me see, h-how did your initial interview with the museum come about in 1989?</span> <span id="s1029">D-Do you know who recommended, or did you offer to do an interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No, no, no, no, I was asked to -- to do it, and because we have been on L Street there, several times, and because I was involved in the boat.</span> <span id="s1031">And -- And maybe Leo Goldberger have said I should -- could give some -- some views on this.</span> <span id="s1032">And today, because I’m the only survivor of the -- of the rescuer, not only, but you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Almost only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Y-You come frequently, and you’ve participated in a celebration at a s -- a synagogue nearby.</span> <span id="s1036">I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: They have a -- They call it a Garden of Righteous, and every year they honor a person who have helped the Jews.</span> <span id="s1038">And I was honored some years ago, and I can mention that Professor Kaska is one and Frau Welnber another, so I’m in a very wonderful company.</span> <span id="s1039">So -- But I find that a very beautiful day and we meet quite a lot of the good friends we have here in Washington area, and we love to be here.</span> <span id="s1040">And one thing more, it’s at the right time.</span> <span id="s1041">You see, time means something.</span> <span id="s1042">We come here and have spring two weeks before we have it in Denmark, and we long for spring, after gray, very dull winter, to land in the airport here, 20 degrees Celsius, go down and see green trees, lots of flowers blooming [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1043">That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: What do you think of the current -- the last few years there’s bis -- perhaps an intensified interest in -- in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1045">There have been documentaries, and of course, the movie “Schindler’s List,” which won many awards.</span> <span id="s1046">A-A-Ha -- What do you think of all of that?</span> <span id="s1047">D-Do you think there is a genuine interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind of a fad, or how do you make sense of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: It’s very difficult, because we have seen, after the war, many thing which goes near Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1049">We see it today in Kosovo, we saw it at Rwanda some years ago.</span> <span id="s1050">We see it in Sudan, Muslims again Christian, we see that in India.</span> <span id="s1051">We see that in the former Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1052">I think that it’s also the interest in -- in avoiding -- avoiding a new Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1053">Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it i -- a part of an Holocaust education, and I really think that the Holocaust education maybe can give us some answers how to avoid it.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean, education is one of the things, when you see round the world, people living next to each other in different countries, they believe the other country will do that and that and vice-a - versa.</span> <span id="s1055">And they fear it, they don’t know.</span> <span id="s1056">The more we’re able to know about our neighbor countries -- neighbor countries, it will help.</span> <span id="s1057">I don’t believe that we are able to make countries love each other, but could we, through education, make them hate a little less, we would had achieved quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1058">But, I think it’s so important, with the Holocaust education, and a part of the Holocaust education is also “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s1059">Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish rescue of the Jews, and it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression all the time, that we can do something.</span> <span id="s1060">Not to avoid it, but to dimin-diminish the results of it.</span> <span id="s1061">We -- We must do something, we must learn people to do what we, as Christian or Jews, are taught.</span> <span id="s1062">That we are our brothers and sisters keeper.</span> <span id="s1063">If we live up to that, I really think that it will be a much easier way to live, and a more lucky world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: How -- What is the situation in your country now, with Jews?</span> <span id="s1065">Is -- Is it similar, has it shifted in any way?</span> <span id="s1066">Have you ever seen a period where there was some anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1068">I can tell you, last time there was anti-Semitism in Denmark, was in i -- 1813.</span> <span id="s1069">And there was something unique, because th -- that -- this year, 1813, the Jews got full Danish citizenships and were allowed to trade on the exchange.</span> <span id="s1070">And some of the Dane -- other Danish -- non-Jewish merchants there, were very annoyed about that.</span> <span id="s1071">And they hired some people to beat the Jews.</span> <span id="s1072">And some of the Jews were beaten badly.</span> <span id="s1073">But, the king made an action.</span> <span id="s1074">The people who was hired was jailed, and the merchant who paid them was fined very hard.</span> <span id="s1075">Since that day there have been no anti-Semitism in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1076">And I -- There won’t be ba -- for instance, we have lots of literature in Denmark written by Jews, but all in Danish.</span> <span id="s1077">In other country, y-you will see, in Yiddish or in -- in Hebrew, but the Danish -- by accident Jewish, authors, write in Danish.</span> <span id="s1078">They’re a -- an important part of our literature.</span> <span id="s1079">And therefore, the Jews are not something different.</span> <span id="s1080">They are not living in ghettos, they can be your next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s1081">They are -- During the war, during the occupation, one of the chefs of the department of Social Affair, was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1082">Today, y-y-you don’t -- y-y-y-y -- that is -- that is not a question to put because why should there be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Well, in preparing for this interview, I did read one thing that right after that war, that there was a -- a few situations of anti-Semitism and that people attributed it to the Nazis had sown some seeds, and -- and then it -- it kind of was pushed away again, but that -- that it was hard right after the war, and some people were grumbling and saying, oh, everything’s the Jews fault.</span> <span id="s1084">This I read, but I think that it, the source of it was Rabbi Melchior.</span> <span id="s1085">And he said that it was very short-lived, but that it -- it -- there was just that moment, and I -- so I was curious about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Well, normal -- normally I quite agree wi -- I don’t know the -- we have several Melchior.</span> <span id="s1087">The -- The rabbi who said in the synagogue in ’43, was the other -- that was Marcus Melchior, and his -- hi -- that he wrote, “That was a Golden Heart,” when he returned.</span> <span id="s1088">And the other, Ben Melchior, he just retired last year, and I haven’t seen that, about that, but maybe something I have overlooked, but today, that’s nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1089">I -- Because everything we were against, as a nation, was nascism, and I will be very unhappy to believe that one of the most nasty things with nascism, should have been survived id -- in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1090">I think that’s -- No, well I -- I can’t -- I can’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: H-How -- How is what you did and many, many others of Danes, how is that commemorated in your country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Why should it?</span> <span id="s1095">Why should it?</span> <span id="s1096">We have our Friends of the Sound.</span> <span id="s1097">We meet once or tw-twice a year, and we have our tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Oh, Friends of the Sound is your -- re-really, your -- the group that did all this work with the rescues and the boats, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, no, no, that -- that is -- that is a -- a union of all this who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Because ha -- Elsinore’s Sewing Club is one, and -- but the Friends of the Sound was founded by t -- Mr. Thompson, he was an innkeeper and he died in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: And what do you do when you meet?</span> <span id="s1103">The Friends of the Sound.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: What I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: What -- Wh-What -- What does the group do when it meets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Having a yearly what do you call it, yearly meeting.</span> <span id="s1107">We are a society and we have election about who shall be the chairman, and on the very, very high level.</span> <span id="s1108">And then we have a good dinner, and we have some songs and -- and we are still, the few of us, still able to drink a beer or two.</span> <span id="s1109">We -- But we have a -- that’s a reunion every year and that’s in -- that’s really nice, but it is hard to be the president, with less and less members.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: And just one last question.</span> <span id="s1111">A-A-As people who really remember the experience pass on, do you have any -- how do you think your -- what you did will be remembered?</span> <span id="s1112">I mean, how will it be remembered correctly, as you would have liked it to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: That -- That was a bunch of people, because there was many women in it, who act in the only way you can act, if you want to be a decent person, and nothing more.</span> <span id="s1114">Because it must not, if we want to avoid Holocaust, be heroes or unique who do that.</span> <span id="s1115">No, that should be the normal man, because he can avoid -- the hero cannot but maybe save a couple o-or two, but that must be the normal man who understand it’s possible to avoid, without being a hero, because we are not Rambos or Schwartzenegger, or VanDamme or what.</span> <span id="s1116">It -- To avoid Holocaust is, you will have to use the normal person.</span> <span id="s1117">And I -- If I shall be remembered, it’s that I did a reas -- a decent thing and that was not more what you can demand of everybody.</span> <span id="s1118">Still remembering you are your brother’s keeper.</span> <span id="s1119">There we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">End
