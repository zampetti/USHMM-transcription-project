it’s Crémieux – C-R-E-M-I-E-U-X, so that there is a village named Crémieux in Avignon, and so…</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Now, explain why you say this is a Jewish Pope.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Because, at the time, the Pope in Avignon protected the Jews.</span> <span id="s50">And they came to live in Avignon.</span> <span id="s51">And that means that when the Germans asked about the Jews, you had to prove that you were a French Jew.</span> <span id="s52">And the French Jew had to have five generations.</span> <span id="s53">And five generations, you have to go way back to cover five generations, but it was easy for my mother because she was a Pope Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: My mother’s name was Marcelle and then she took my father’s name.</span> <span id="s56">Crémieux was the original name of the family.</span> <span id="s57">And she became Denier when she married Pierre Denier.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And her first name was Marcelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Marcelle.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Marcelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: M-A-R…</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: And her last name?</span> <span id="s63">Maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Was Monina.</span> <span id="s67">M-O-N-I-N-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And your father…?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: My father was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s70">They met during the First World War.</span> <span id="s71">She was a – you know – bourgeois nurse.</span> <span id="s72">And they fell in love and married.</span> <span id="s73">And he was an interesting fellow.</span> <span id="s74">He wasn’t born to be a father.</span> <span id="s75">He deserted when I was three months.</span> <span id="s76">And my fa-… my brother was only, was only 12 months older, so he was 14 or 15 months.</span> <span id="s77">He took off and went to Argentina.</span> <span id="s78">And became a great scientist.</span> <span id="s79">He has a museum named in his honor in Argentina.</span> <span id="s80">But he was a real skunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So, he never kept in touch with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Never!</span> <span id="s83">Never wrote a letter, never sent a penny.</span> <span id="s84">But his parents took over.</span> <span id="s85">Those are my Catholic grandparents.</span> <span id="s86">And they were very influential in my life, intellectually.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So let me ask you something, your mother is left with two babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: And no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: So, she comes from a powerful family with a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: That cousin who married Mendes-France is from those other people with castles and what would be now millions.</span> <span id="s93">And they supplied her with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: So she did not work?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: She did work.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: She did work, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: She did work.</span> <span id="s98">And she lived with her sister.</span> <span id="s99">Her sister lived with us, if you want, and her mother lived with us.</span> <span id="s100">So we had a warm family.</span> <span id="s101">And it was in a neighborhood near the Luxembourg, which up to this day I like very much.</span> <span id="s102">Which my daughter, when she visited it, thought was ridiculously poor.</span> <span id="s103">But she didn’t realize that at the time I thought it was a little jewel.</span> <span id="s104">My mother had great taste and it was a small apartment but extremely sunny and opposite the elementary school where I went.</span> <span id="s105">And I had a cozy family…</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So you felt secure at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Most.</span> <span id="s108">And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandparents is that my grandfather never allowed the name of his son pronounced in front of him the moment he left us, never.</span> <span id="s109">He… the mother was more tender-hearted and kept in touch.</span> <span id="s110">But he never would like to see the letters; he was not interested in ever hearing from that man.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So, did you think that your mother and her mother-in-law spoke about – that her mother-in-law told your mother about what her son was doing?</span> <span id="s112">So she – so your mother knew?</span> <span id="s113">Or do you think not?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don’t think… It’s interesting, when – much later, when I went into her papers, when she died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still kept.</span> <span id="s115">I don’t think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they felt so shameful, but they certainly took over.</span> <span id="s116">They had a house in Brittany, and they spent three months of the year.</span> <span id="s117">The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: So there was no break with the grandparents on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: On the contrary, they were very much involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Oh, very much and intellectually.</span> <span id="s122">He – my grandfather was for his job but extremely intellectual.</span> <span id="s123">He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times crossword puzzle.</span> <span id="s124">And then once a year, he would go – he never went out; they were very sedentary.</span> <span id="s125">But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a competition and that made the money for the rest of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles.</span> <span id="s128">Either winning the competition – that was a yearly thing – or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day.</span> <span id="s129">And that meant that he was encyclopédique.</span> <span id="s130">When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot.</span> <span id="s131">He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French.</span> <span id="s132">He had groups of our little friends come every… once a week to study with him and he was great.</span> <span id="s133">I mean, they were just great.</span> <span id="s134">And it was very, very modest life.</span> <span id="s135">They did not have any hot water.</span> <span id="s136">They did not have any running water except in one faucet in the whole house.</span> <span id="s137">So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them.</span> <span id="s138">But for us it was a necessity of life.</span> <span id="s139">You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So the difference between your mother’s family…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: And the other family.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And the other family was very different financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Extraordinary.</span> <span id="s144">But from the other side, we got some financial help, but we saw them for the first of January or something, but not…</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: But not on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Oh no, it was not at all.</span> <span id="s147">Because the caste system is such in France that you live in a different part of the city, you never, never…</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So explain this caste system, as you understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, you have the working class; we had nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s150">We were bourgeois poor, but we had a maid.</span> <span id="s151">We always had a maid.</span> <span id="s152">It was done that way.</span> <span id="s153">And she had what is now the students’ quarters in the building where we used to live, because they had the, had the view.</span> <span id="s154">It was on the sixth floor.</span> <span id="s155">All that floor was maids.</span> <span id="s156">And now it’s all students and they all fight…</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: To get that…</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: …to have the view because it’s over the roofs.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So, there’s a strict kind of class system that was in place?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s161">And you were not aware of it; it’s built in you.</span> <span id="s162">You talk differently.</span> <span id="s163">I married a man who is that way and I mean, he spends his time watching T.V. and they say “who” when they should say “whom”, and he says “whom” aloud.</span> <span id="s164">I can hear him from my room because he is incensed.</span> <span id="s165">It’s built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as clothes – except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes.</span> <span id="s166">You can’t wear other people’s shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Uh-huh, but you can wear other people’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: All the rest was discards, all the time.</span> <span id="s169">And I remember the time when I begin to wear my own clothes and it was a sensation and that was – I was in my twenties.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: But now you said that your grandparents – which grandparents had had the house in Brittany?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: The poor ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: The poor ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: But all their money was put in buying land in Brittany.</span> <span id="s174">Now, we go back, it’s like having a mansion to us, an acre of land on the sea…</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: …in Brittany.</span> <span id="s177">Because the mansion Constanty (ph) was near Bély (ph).</span> <span id="s178">It’s mentioned constantly on the news because of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Now your, your mother is obviously young when her husband leaves her.</span> <span id="s180">Did, did she ever divorce him?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: She did, but she didn’t remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No, you didn’t in those days, a woman did not.</span> <span id="s184">And she didn’t take lovers either.</span> <span id="s185">She really… it destroyed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So, she was very much in love with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I think it was a passion – it makes me feel choked.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Yeah, yeah, hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: It’s interesting because when I got involved with an American, and another one of those love-at-first-sight and fast-move type.</span> <span id="s190">It ran in the blood.</span> <span id="s191">She was devastated in a way; on the other hand, she saw that I was going to be happy.</span> <span id="s192">And she let me go and never regretted it, and I wrote every week and never missed a week.</span> <span id="s193">And he wrote, too, so they had two views of our lives.</span> <span id="s194">When we were at the University of Chicago, we would write.</span> <span id="s195">And they also wrote – both of them – and I still have their letters, wrote every week.</span> <span id="s196">So, there is a way to keep in touch.</span> <span id="s197">We didn’t have phones and so…</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s199">So you wrote to the grandparents and you wrote to….</span> <span id="s200">?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Oh, I have the letters of my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: We didn’t write, but she wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: She died when I was 30.</span> <span id="s206">You see, they got married much earlier and so they had children early.</span> <span id="s207">So, I was lucky to have her ‘til I was 30.</span> <span id="s208">And I remember in Chicago when they told me very carefully…</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: That she had gone.</span> <span id="s210">Tell me what you remember about your mother.</span> <span id="s211">What she was like for you as a mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: She was a roly-poly.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Which means, what, heavy?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: She was... We called them the “fatties”, my mother and aunt.</span> <span id="s215">We were not respectful.</span> <span id="s216">We were loving, but not respectful.</span> <span id="s217">Ce sont les petites grosses – “the little fatties”.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And you called her that to her face?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: I called her mamoun, also.</span> <span id="s222">People call me mamoun now, too, but they were the two “little fatties”.</span> <span id="s223">They were fat, small, but she didn’t look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s224">I had my nose, I was the Jewish one looking, but I had perfect papers.</span> <span id="s225">It was a queer mixture.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: When you – you were not baptized?</span> <span id="s227">Or were you baptized?</span> <span id="s228">When you were, when you were a baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, because neither of the grandparents – although grandmother had been raised in a convent and him by monks – they were not believers.</span> <span id="s230">So, I had a perfectly non-religious childhood.</span> <span id="s231">When I was – when the German occupation came, the Jewish issue came to the fore.</span> <span id="s232">The day the Americans started their war, seventh of December, 1941.</span> <span id="s233">Then the Germans began to force the French Jews, the Jews in France, let’s say, to wear the star, the yellow star.</span> <span id="s234">And the people lined up, but I didn’t know my mother was Jewish until then.</span> <span id="s235">It was never mentioned; we never went to the temple or to the church.</span> <span id="s236">It was completely laïc…</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So until you were twenty, you didn’t, you didn’t know there was some background of the family?</span> <span id="s238">Nobody said…</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Oh yes, I knew that there was some Jewish background, but it meant nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: It meant nothing?</span> <span id="s241">Because there was nothing in your life…</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: There was nothing culturally.</span> <span id="s243">I had never seen a word of Hebrew until I was in my 50s practically.</span> <span id="s244">And it meant nothing to her.</span> <span id="s245">And it was strictly separation of church and state, so it was never mentioned.</span> <span id="s246">In school, I never heard anything, any mention of even Catholicism, although 90 percent of them ________ Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Did you celebrate any holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Christmas, but as a non-religious holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: As a non-religious holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: But not Easter?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Is there, is – there was a chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Chocolate eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So you never attended synagogue?</span> <span id="s258">You never attended church?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Never attended either.</span> <span id="s260">Never set foot in a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: And then the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Okay let’s talk a little bit more.</span> <span id="s264">Your mother is a “fattie” you say, she’s “roly-poly”.</span> <span id="s265">But what is her personality like?</span> <span id="s266">She’s a warm person?</span> <span id="s267">She’s an intelligent person?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: [Sighs] You have to go back, way back.</span> <span id="s269">That would be 19th century.</span> <span id="s270">She was from Marseilles, from Avignon.</span> <span id="s271">She was so prosperous that the apartment house where she lived in is still there, standing up at an apartment house; that means something.</span> <span id="s272">It’s a beautiful, stone, powerful apartment house.</span> <span id="s273">She never – she was sad, she was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Because of the father leaving…</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: She was destroyed for some reason.</span> <span id="s276">I never saw my mother but somewhat sad.</span> <span id="s277">My aunt was the joy of our childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Her sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, she was playful.</span> <span id="s280">But I had a brother; I had a brother who was only 11 months older.</span> <span id="s281">We played and played and played.</span> <span id="s282">And we were happy.</span> <span id="s283">We managed to – they were extremely loving.</span> <span id="s284">I found my mother, her sadness was kind of frightening, but she was so loving that we didn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And what was your aunt’s name that lived with you?</span> <span id="s286">Her sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Tante Yvonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Tante…?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Tante Yvonne.</span> <span id="s290">Tante Yvonne – Tantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Tantine?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Tantine.</span> <span id="s293">Mamoun and Tantine.</span> <span id="s294">And we… and she was married to a Monteux.</span> <span id="s295">You know Pierre Monteux?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: It was his son or whatever.</span> <span id="s298">So, she married well, and he… for... and he left suddenly and disappeared from, from all of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Another one?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Another one.</span> <span id="s301">So, it was really a family of divorce.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: It isn’t built in the genes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: No it’s not [laughs].</span> <span id="s305">And were you close to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: We lived in twin beds, in the same room.</span> <span id="s307">We played together.</span> <span id="s308">He resented me when I began to be 10 or 11.</span> <span id="s309">Because, that was maybe genetic, I was my size at 10.</span> <span id="s310">I grew up faster and there was one or two years there that he was smaller and he deeply resented that.</span> <span id="s311">But then later we became friends again.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: When… when I began to be an excellent student and go to those highly competitive oral exams that the French torture the young with, he came to see me perform, bringing his best friend who is still one of our closest friends – he lives in France.</span> <span id="s314">And so that showed me that he loved me in a clumsy way, but he did.</span> <span id="s315">And then, he and my husband got along very well and we remained friends through the rest of his life and he wrote regularly, also – we corresponded.</span> <span id="s316">And when he died you, you could see that, you would say that we were the closest thing.</span> <span id="s317">When he came to Cleveland to have his arteries bypassed, he asked me to come with him.</span> <span id="s318">Which was quite a thing to ask because, by that time, I was teaching college.</span> <span id="s319">I had to take the 11 days that it took him to stay in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s320">And I was friendly with his – to, to this day I am friendly with his kids.</span> <span id="s321">Now adults, they come and visit us and stay with us at the beach.</span> <span id="s322">We rent the biggest possible house and all the nephews from France come.</span> <span id="s323">I’m very family-inclined.</span> <span id="s324">I think it’s part of the happiness of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And obviously you had a very close set of relationships, even from the…</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes, yes and money had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s327">Which is a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Can I assume that you loved school, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I adored school and I was recognized, and they had things – they had prize at the time, you know the prix d’excellence, prize of excellence, and I made a point of getting.</span> <span id="s330">But what I was more pleased with is that they had the prix de bonne camaraderie.</span> <span id="s331">The good chum of the year and I always got that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: That’s lovely.</span> <span id="s335">What a nice idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I was – and I am – a good chum and I still have friends from childhood.</span> <span id="s337">We write regularly and, and their children are close friend.</span> <span id="s338">I have a letter, I got a letter yesterday from the daughter of my closest friend.</span> <span id="s339">She’s extremely close to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Was it wonderful to grow up in Paris as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, although we had no money, so we did not go to… I went once in my life to a restaurant, in my life, in my childhood, when I was 12.</span> <span id="s342">I remember it and it was a cafeteria.</span> <span id="s343">But to this day, I remember it as a day of extraordinary thing.</span> <span id="s344">We – things that are normal for Americans now were not in existence.</span> <span id="s345">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s346">I don’t think my friends went to restaurants, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And who cooked in the house?</span> <span id="s348">Did your mother cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: We had a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: You had a maid who cooked?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I never entered the kitchen until I was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You never entered the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I remember that because it was a sentence in my biography, that my husband remembered.</span> <span id="s354">I never entered the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Isn’t that extraordinary?</span> <span id="s356">It seems extraordinary, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: For an American, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So, was she a good cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In my grandmother, you remember, I said my…</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Yeah, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: …was a good cook, yeah.</span> <span id="s362">My mother was a good cook and I am a good cook.</span> <span id="s363">But I – Jew – that may be genetic, or it may be whatever, it could be taste.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So, if you had a maid who cooked, did your grandmother cook in the house, too?</span> <span id="s365">And… you’re talking about your father’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No, no, no, no, no, I’m talking about the one who lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Okay, so she also went, but she went into the kitchen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh she did.</span> <span id="s369">Maybe the others did.</span> <span id="s370">I just didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: You just didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Did you have a favorite food as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It didn’t matter too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: It didn’t matter to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Nah, I don’t remember food.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Despite of the fact that France is so known for extraordinary…</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And I went once to a cafeteria and I thought it was a great celebration.</span> <span id="s381">No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did you go to museums as a kid?</span> <span id="s383">Or were they not there, maybe not?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I probably did.</span> <span id="s385">No, I wasn’t very… I had an uncle, my brother… my husband had an uncle who was a painter.</span> <span id="s386">So, I am in some of his paintings and I was in some museum.</span> <span id="s387">And he gave us some paintings.</span> <span id="s388">And some paintings of his are still in Paris museums.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: You don’t mean your husband’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, I mean my father’s brother…</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Brother, is a painter?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s393">And he was a stay-at-home.</span> <span id="s394">My grandmother had two children, one who stayed at home and never left the house practically, and the other one who took to… went to, to Argentina.</span> <span id="s395">And they were also only 18 months apart.</span> <span id="s396">Like night and day.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And this is to skip time, but did you ever make contact with your father or did your father ever try to make contact…?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Ah, that is an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s399">When I was 60…</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: 60?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: When I was 60, my son in town called me one day and said, “I have Jeannette” – my grandmother was named Jeanne, remember?</span> <span id="s402">– “I have Jeannette on the phone.”</span> <span id="s403">And I said, “And who on earth is Jeannette?”</span> <span id="s404">At that point I was in – directing Continuing Education for the women in the college.</span> <span id="s405">And I was at my desk, surrounded by secretaries and “Who on earth is Jeannette?”</span> <span id="s406">And he said, “Your sister.”</span> <span id="s407">I didn’t know I had a sister.</span> <span id="s408">And so he put Jeannette on the phone and Jeannette was in town.</span> <span id="s409">She was researching her family.</span> <span id="s410">And to this day, we are very close.</span> <span id="s411">We went to Argentina; she had the six children that I would have loved to have.</span> <span id="s412">And when we met that evening, when she came to Washington to see us, we went to a restaurant and the children said, “That we have to see, the two sisters.”</span> <span id="s413">I was 60, she was 40.</span> <span id="s414">We were the same person.</span> <span id="s415">We laugh at the same thing, we adore each other.</span> <span id="s416">If she lived next door, I would talk about my sister as the lady in the house here talks about her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So he remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well, six times.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Six times?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s422">So, he moved around a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Moved around a lot.</span> <span id="s424">I recently got, got something, yeah.</span> <span id="s425">I mean, he was really a woman chaser.</span> <span id="s426">Great charm, great gifts.</span> <span id="s427">But my sister is quite a thing.</span> <span id="s428">Yes, I have that half-sister.</span> <span id="s429">I never see her because… but we sent her money at the time when Argentina was in trouble.</span> <span id="s430">She’s delightful, married, six beautiful children.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s432">Did you go to the movies as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Ah-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: My grandmother, the one we lived with, loved movies, and at the time you paid according to the quality of the seats.</span> <span id="s436">So we were poor, so were always sitting in front.</span> <span id="s437">But every Thursday afternoon, she took us to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And did you have favorites?</span> <span id="s439">Did you see American movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: You have American movies in the 30s in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: I don’t know, they were – they were in Poland, but not in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: No, no, they were… maybe on the Champs Elysées, but not in my neighborhood.</span> <span id="s443">But I saw the old French movies and some them are excellent.</span> <span id="s444">And it was completely… There were no rules of age, you know.</span> <span id="s445">I must have seen extraordinary, risky things and I never… To the innocent, everything is innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: That’s true, so every single Thursday with your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, that was the…</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So, it was very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And every Sunday, we went to the Catholic grandparents’ and we had a big dinner.</span> <span id="s450">It was a feast, and they played with us.</span> <span id="s451">One funny thing my grandfather had is that he played at our level.</span> <span id="s452">So he played checkers, chess.</span> <span id="s453">We played games.</span> <span id="s454">There was a game where you throw dice, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So, in addition to teaching you languages…</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: All, all afternoon we played games.</span> <span id="s457">And they were surrounded by great books.</span> <span id="s458">They had first edition, all the Oscar Wilde in first edition.</span> <span id="s459">They were collecting first editions.</span> <span id="s460">I mean, they were not collecting, but they bought the books.</span> <span id="s461">So, it was a very, very bookish, intellectual household, completely full.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: We are going to have to stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: You are getting tired?</span> <span id="s464">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: No, no, no, we just have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s466">I’m not getting… [Laughs] End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Then the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Nicole, when you were growing up were you conscious politically of what was going on?</span> <span id="s470">Was there talk in the family or what it – were you more intellectually…</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I was conscious and I liked it, I liked the political life.</span> <span id="s472">I liked the fact that my grandfather would, was… left, as he got older.</span> <span id="s473">And we were for the worker movement, whatever it was, not communist but let’s say center-left.</span> <span id="s474">And we were somewhat left, more left, I mean, don’t forget that there were newspapers in that household all the time.</span> <span id="s475">So, we followed the political life very much so.</span> <span id="s476">And then it continued and still to this day, I’m very conscious of political things and…</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: So, when Hitler takes over in Germany, in January of ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I was…twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You were twelve?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Twelve.</span> <span id="s481">The French were blissfully wanting to be unaware.</span> <span id="s482">Remember, there was a movement to try to appease, to do as if nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s483">So, we went to send people visiting and they came back saying, “Don’t worry, don’t worry, it won’t happen.”</span> <span id="s484">And we felt insulated, and when it came, it came only because the Americans entered the war.</span> <span id="s485">The Germans invaded France and France completely capitulated and it was shameful and I was very aware of that.</span> <span id="s486">But, as I mention in passing, the French protected their thoroughbreds, and so they sent to unoccupied France.</span> <span id="s487">And I had a scholarship that paid not only my mother for, for my upkeep, it paid for books for me.</span> <span id="s488">So, whenever I wanted to buy books, the government would pay.</span> <span id="s489">And during the war they kept feeding us money, because of my continuing to be such a good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Okay, let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s491">So, so prior to…</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Unaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: …the Germans taking…</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Unaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You’re unaware.</span> <span id="s496">But when refugees begin to come into France and certainly at first…</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Not in our milieu.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Not in your milieu?</span> <span id="s499">So you didn’t know this…</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: They didn’t move into that neighborhood at all.</span> <span id="s501">Not any more than they would move into Bethesda.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: So you’re not conscious of this?</span> <span id="s503">You’re not feeling this?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So, it’s ’36, it’s ’37, ’38…</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: No, happy in high school and working very hard.</span> <span id="s507">Okay, yes, I began to be aware of them in ’40 when France fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: But what about ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: ’39, I was, again, I had, I had my vacation paid by the government in a youth hostel in Verdun.</span> <span id="s510">And I visited the German battlefields and the German cemeteries.</span> <span id="s511">And I made a German friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Who was a pianist, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes, and he remained a friend until he died, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Now this is, you are talking with him and visiting these World War I…</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes, and he is a German…delight.</span> <span id="s516">And that, I think, helped me through life, not ever generalizing about Germans because I knew that Hans Mattern existed in Kaiserslautern and if maybe there was one, there was more than one.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And his name is Hans?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Hans Mattern.</span> <span id="s519">M-A-T-T-E-R-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And he was a concert pianist?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: And he was a concert pianist and I still have his letters at home.</span> <span id="s522">And we corresponded, and he came!</span> <span id="s523">When Germans invaded and my mother started having to wear the star, Hans announced that as a German he was playing for them in the army.</span> <span id="s524">He came to visit and he came to visit Jews, a German in uniform coming to visit Jews!</span> <span id="s525">And he did, he never changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So, you are, in 1939, under… you’re outside of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Paris.</span> <span id="s528">And we were very worried because my mother and aunt were government employees and we were worried for them, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And what were your mother and your aunt doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: They were working for the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: As… Doing what?</span> <span id="s532">As secretaries, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No, more than that, but they were not very high level.</span> <span id="s534">You know, at that time, women in that milieu didn’t study very hard.</span> <span id="s535">So, I don’t think that their jobs were very important at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Was there worry that the war would turn west?</span> <span id="s537">Here, Hitler had gone east and Austria was taken and Czechoslovakia and now Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: We didn’t give it a thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You didn’t give it a thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Nothing?</span> <span id="s542">Was your brother concerned about being taken in the army at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: And my brother turned 20 in 1940.</span> <span id="s544">He was born in ’20.</span> <span id="s545">And he was a medical student already, extremely good student himself.</span> <span id="s546">We were both on heavy, heavy scholarships.</span> <span id="s547">Our parents received money every month because we were such good students.</span> <span id="s548">And if we had not kept our grade up…</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You would have lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: We would have lost the scholarship.</span> <span id="s551">Which means that my mother would have practically lost her way of life.</span> <span id="s552">So, we were always studying hard.</span> <span id="s553">And he left Paris walking and he walked to, to the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s554">At some point, the Germans were before him – he met a German on a bridge, stopped him and had pity on him because he was 20 years and was wearing a brand new uniform.</span> <span id="s555">And he said, “Hurry up, or else I’ll make you a prisoner.”</span> <span id="s556">And then he went all the way to the Pyrenees and he stayed in the provinces during the rest of the war years.</span> <span id="s557">He never came back Paris during the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Uh-huh, this is obviously before the occupation that he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, in ’40, they did occupy France.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s561">They come in, in…</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: ’40, French, French lost in, in 1940, the spring.</span> <span id="s563">The Germans just ran over them.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: But that, was that a shock to you?</span> <span id="s565">That, that France was going to be attacked?</span> <span id="s566">I mean there must have been some build up between ’39 and ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I was studying so hard, you know.</span> <span id="s568">Those were the studies I don’t even – I have good students among my grandchildren, I don’t see the same intensity of the… competitive study.</span> <span id="s569">I was in my books up to here, and that was, I was specializing in Ancient Greek, so I was ______ and that was when the Germans invaded France.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So explain something to me.</span> <span id="s571">You were in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And that’s a little bit different than the high school here, you’re a bit older…</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Way above level.</span> <span id="s575">Let’s say that at the time, definitely the graduating class would be junior college level here.</span> <span id="s576">I have checked it since, since I was teaching college all through my adult life here.</span> <span id="s577">And so we were really advanced and so during the war years, and we talk 21 – when I was 21, I was studying for what you would call a master’s.</span> <span id="s578">But I was studying independently, although I had been – but fate was very tied with my grades.</span> <span id="s579">Because I had been accepted at École Normale Supérieure, which would be like the Radcliffe, the chaplain was sensitive to the fact that the Germans were working against the Jews, and gave me the baptism certificate that saved both my life and the life of my mother.</span> <span id="s580">So, from then on, I had a baptism certificate but I was never baptized.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And the baptism certificate was dated when?</span> <span id="s582">Way back…</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Way, way back?</span> <span id="s584">Sure, it was a perfect piece given by – practically given by a chaplain.</span> <span id="s585">It was not made by him because it would have been suspicious.</span> <span id="s586">He wrote to somebody in the Loire Valley, in a little village that guaranteed that at age 3, I had been 3 months, I had been baptized in that village.</span> <span id="s587">It was new in the church, it was very complex.</span> <span id="s588">And I had my baptism certificate, which was the life of the whole family in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Yet you didn’t ask for this.</span> <span id="s590">It was, it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: The chaplain…</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Suggested that this was a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s594">That it was, it was going to be needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Did you feel vulnerable?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No, I felt blissfully out of it.</span> <span id="s597">Maybe because my roly-polies were optimist and I definitely was an optimist – it pays in my life to have been an optimist, to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: I’m going to ask you a little bit about the money that you got because you were such a good student.</span> <span id="s599">This was like a stipend?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: It was a real salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: It was a real salary?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: It was a real salary that you could live on.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yes, I mean they really, to this day, pushed for the people that they wanted to save.</span> <span id="s605">And there were laws that they created to protect people like me – were created with Petain, you see, Petain and Laval, was where those people protected their people.</span> <span id="s606">They, they sacrificed in a disheartening way.</span> <span id="s607">At that point, I began to be disheartened about it.</span> <span id="s608">But that would be ’41, ’42.</span> <span id="s609">The Petain Law – Petain took the second half of France, you remember Vichy and collaborators.</span> <span id="s610">And the Vichy laws are the laws under which I came, protected people like myself.</span> <span id="s611">As against the Poles, that were refugees, the Polish, the Hungarian, the names that you see in the book you can notice, for years, there is not one French name.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: If I’m correct, a few days before the occupation of Paris, didn’t you take a train to the south?</span> <span id="s613">As I understand it, your mother asked you to leave?</span> <span id="s614">Do you remember this?</span> <span id="s615">There were a lot of people leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: It was… yes, but she was… and the Germans didn’t appreciate it, she was a devoted government employee.</span> <span id="s617">She stayed at her job.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So she did not leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, she didn’t—and also she was an optimist I don’t think she saw, that, that was… In fact, to the very end, she was having, ready for the deportation, a little bag, a small black bag with a chamber pot in it.</span> <span id="s620">She thought it was going to be a working camp.</span> <span id="s621">And that… she may have problem going to the toilet but that would be all and that she would survive; otherwise, she would not.</span> <span id="s622">When they came to pick us up, she still had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Why did she ask you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Ah, the children were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: So, she was worry about you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes, as a, she was a very, very worried mother.</span> <span id="s627">And that train was full of children and women.</span> <span id="s628">There wasn’t one single man on that train that went to southern France.</span> <span id="s629">That was in ’39, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: I don’t, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s631">I think it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Or ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: I think it was ’40 because Paris fell on June 14th and this was a few days before.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yes, right, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So did you have questions?</span> <span id="s636">“Why am I leaving and you’re not leaving.</span> <span id="s637">I have a baptism certificate and you’re a Jew?”</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No, no, no I was not thinking of the Jewish issue at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, the Jewish issue did not come up until…’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Until ’40 December ’41.</span> <span id="s643">Then you had to register as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: But then why is she asking you to leave, do you think?</span> <span id="s645">I know that thousands of people are going south.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: To protect, to protect me.</span> <span id="s647">I don’t know what against.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: From the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Do you think, from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: From the possibility of the bomb or whatever happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Then you get stuck?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yeah, and I learn that eleven, that’s the longest line.</span> <span id="s654">Nobody has lined up that long.</span> <span id="s655">Eleven hours to come back!</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: But this is after a couple months?</span> <span id="s657">You’re away for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And where are you for these couple of months?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I was at the house of a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So, you got off the train?</span> <span id="s662">This, this was an intentional place that you were staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, in Limoges.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: In Limoges?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Central France, God forsaken city, and I stayed there for a month or two and then lined up for eleven hours in order to get a ticket back to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So, then, okay, so now, why do you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Because my mother was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: And did she say to you that it’s okay?</span> <span id="s669">You were writing to each other, and she said, she said that it was okay to come and you said “that’s enough already”.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I forgot…</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: You forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I remember the line up, I remember the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Do you remember German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I remember the first German soldier.</span> <span id="s675">My aunt was the funny roly-poly, so saw the first German soldier.</span> <span id="s676">And she came back to the house to say – somebody saw a German soldier and said, “I have seen a German soldier.”</span> <span id="s677">And my aunt said, “It must be English, it must be British.”</span> <span id="s678">She never understood the war; she never understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s679">But it was a blessing.</span> <span id="s680">I remember the first one I saw.</span> <span id="s681">And they said… You know what they did?</span> <span id="s682">They sent smashingly good-looking soldiers for the first wave.</span> <span id="s683">Boy, were they handsome, and they behaved perfectly.</span> <span id="s684">The French, you know, touched you, the Americans played around.</span> <span id="s685">The Germans never touched a woman.</span> <span id="s686">They were impeccable…bastards.</span> <span id="s687">Impeccable.</span> <span id="s688">Never, never.</span> <span id="s689">They would have been killed if they had done anything wrong in their behavior.</span> <span id="s690">Perfectly handsome, awful bastards.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And do you remember seeing a German in Limoges or do you remember in Paris when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Oh, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s693">It was in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Was it shocking to come back to Paris occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: It was a pleasure to see my mother again.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: You know, the occupation, I took… You took… When… There was a funny rule: you didn’t look at them.</span> <span id="s698">What arms do you have when you have no arms, while you are good-looking, 21-year-old, and you never, never looked at the German in the face.</span> <span id="s699">That’s the way.</span> <span id="s700">You look at their belly button where they have the sign saying “God Meet Us” (ph).</span> <span id="s701">That’s what you look at.</span> <span id="s702">You never laugh, you never… but you never even look at them.</span> <span id="s703">They do not exist.</span> <span id="s704">So, that was the game.</span> <span id="s705">I mean there were many games that were played like that.</span> <span id="s706">I never looked one in the eye, I saw, I saw they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And that was as a way of …</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Of resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Of resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It must have been… disheartening.</span> <span id="s711">There were many things that must have disheartening.</span> <span id="s712">You can dishearten somebody just by being very passive, “You don’t exist, I see through you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No.</span> <span id="s717">We believed… they never, never were brutal or friendly or anything.</span> <span id="s718">Don’t forget, that was their rules.</span> <span id="s719">Impeccable.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Do you think this was true all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: In Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: And, as a typical French… Except for Paris, there is no French.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: [Laughs] You think that.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yes, to this day, I still feel that way.</span> <span id="s726">There is a culture – You asked me if I went to the theater.</span> <span id="s727">I went to the premiere because, for the premiere, I had free tickets.</span> <span id="s728">So, if there was a play in Paris, I was at the premiere, the perfect orchestra seats.</span> <span id="s729">That was really perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Can you explain what the premiere is?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: The first show.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: The first show?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yeah, when, the show opens, at the opening hours.</span> <span id="s734">I had some tickets.</span> <span id="s735">So we had only the journalists and some, some people had those tickets in the best seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Did you understand how privileged you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I was proud, I was proud.</span> <span id="s738">I was working terribly hard for it.</span> <span id="s739">I remember then, I remember being told you had only one room that you could barely heat.</span> <span id="s740">So that was the dining room for the French.</span> <span id="s741">They had no kitchen practically and that was the maid.</span> <span id="s742">The dining room and the dining room table was where you worked, so I remember working with my brother at the dining room table.</span> <span id="s743">We never, never, never stopped before midnight.</span> <span id="s744">Never.</span> <span id="s745">We were… and we never interrupted each other, either.</span> <span id="s746">He had his books and I had my books.</span> <span id="s747">You know, we were… and that was a way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: And did you discuss your work with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: No, no, that wasn’t what it was, but you did with your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes, but that was earlier.</span> <span id="s752">Oh yes, he, he trained us.</span> <span id="s753">He, he would, he would give us little things to translate.</span> <span id="s754">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So, when the occupation begins, you’re going to school and you remain in school.</span> <span id="s756">You, you, your life does not radically change until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Until ’41, the Americans entered the war.</span> <span id="s758">We were plenty in, in anticipation of – we knew they were going to be the saviors.</span> <span id="s759">But it started elsewhere, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s760">The 7th of December, 1941, you did enter to the war.</span> <span id="s761">And you were to come eventually.</span> <span id="s762">Much later, but you did eventually come, and at that point, the Germans pounced on the Jews.</span> <span id="s763">And requested the star.</span> <span id="s764">They requested that you register if you were a Jew, and that you wear a star.</span> <span id="s765">And that is where the lined up at the mairie, where I was later to be married.</span> <span id="s766">You lined up as a Jew and that’s where the Dashund (ph), who was a big philosopher, already in Switzerland completely safe, came back to register as a Jew.</span> <span id="s767">People were proud to be Jewish and didn’t realize what it was going to entail.</span> <span id="s768">You just didn’t deny the fact that you were Jewish, “Damn it, yes I am!”</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: But now you had a baptism certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, I went with my mother to line up, my mother lined up.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Yes, I understand that.</span> <span id="s772">But you didn’t, you were not lining up…</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I was lining to be with her because I was afraid what was going to be… I was afraid that she might be attacked in the street, who knows?</span> <span id="s774">I, I, I began to sense danger, but for her, not for me.</span> <span id="s775">I was in no way in danger.</span> <span id="s776">Although I… we always joked that I, I really had the Jewish nose.</span> <span id="s777">If the Germans were any more intelligent, they should have been after me, not after my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And did it seem, I mean, you’ll have to pardon me for, for raising a question like this but, your mother is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So, you, of course, are born of your mother, even though you have a certificate that says you are baptized; nevertheless, your mother remains a Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s781">Is that of no significance under the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: I had no idea what being Jewish meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s784">So, for you it had no…</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No significance.</span> <span id="s786">A sense of danger for her, definitely, very, very broad-based, you know.</span> <span id="s787">Intangible, but there.</span> <span id="s788">She was… and that star was very ugly.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Do you ever say to your mother, “Let me try to get you papers; you don’t look Jewish”?</span> <span id="s790">No, she doesn’t ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: There was little that was said and intuitively that I heard others say, “Why didn’t they resist?”</span> <span id="s792">And you reach a point where you are so deep in the hole that you don’t resist.</span> <span id="s793">Nobody is going to resist.</span> <span id="s794">It was, it was an enormous wave that was engulfing Europe.</span> <span id="s795">There was nothing you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: [Quietly] What do you see in your head now?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: What, what are you seeing in your head now?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I see…</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: I can see that you see something.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yeah, I see the lining up.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And that really upset you?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s804">I don’t know what I would… I mean, you, you wouldn’t tell them anything now because it’s so far away.</span> <span id="s805">But I understand deeply why they didn’t revolt.</span> <span id="s806">It was too big to resist.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: But you feel the pain of seeing that line now.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s809">But now I have only American enthusiasm behind me, you know.</span> <span id="s810">I am not… But…</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: When people were lining up in, after December ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Then they were given, then they were given a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s813">And it was sadistic – you had to cut up your own star; you had to sew up your own star.</span> <span id="s814">It wasn’t a star; they didn’t give you a star.</span> <span id="s815">They give you a big piece of cloth with stars on it.</span> <span id="s816">And you cut it up and you cut up around the star and you had to carefully sew so that it looked only like a star.</span> <span id="s817">It was sadism.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And you could have them put on your…</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: It had to be put on the left-hand side, outside at all moments.</span> <span id="s820">If you were in your pajamas and going out, it had to be on your pajamas.</span> <span id="s821">If you were outside on the street, the moment you were outside on the street, you had to have the sign of your Jewish denomination, beginning at age six.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And what… I understand that you were not either feeling Jewish or understanding what it meant to be Jewish, but you saw Jewish people including your mother and your aunt…</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: …your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: My grandmother by that time was… She died in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: So, you see Jewish people wearing stars…</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: It doesn’t make me feel Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: No, but were you angry?</span> <span id="s829">Were you upset?</span> <span id="s830">Did you think, “What are they, why are they doing this to these people?”</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: No?</span> <span id="s833">Was your mother agravat--… angry or fearful because she was wearing a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Was she proud of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: No.</span> <span id="s838">This was just what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: It was just really the reality of the day.</span> <span id="s840">Maybe it’s survival instinct.</span> <span id="s841">But she was not going to deny it, although it meant religiously nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: So, something in her was…proud?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Proud, but of what, you’re not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: No, because they were not sure either, to this day, what is it that it meant by being Jewish.</span> <span id="s846">According to that, in fact, my granddaughter who lives in McLain (ph) coming from the women is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: What do you hear… oh, I think I’m gonna to stop.</span> <span id="s848">This is the question I’m going to ask you as we start with, after we change the tape.</span> <span id="s849">What did you start hearing about what was happening on the eastern front?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Never.</span> <span id="s853">As I tell you, if my mother had learned that there were extermination camps, she would have not kept her little chamber pot ready for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: She would have?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Not!</span> <span id="s856">Would not!</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Not.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Because it wasn’t… If we had known that we were going to be stripped bare before we even hit the train… It was blissful ignorance.</span> <span id="s859">Until the end of the war we didn’t know, until saw the news of the liberation of the camp, we did not know about the extent.</span> <span id="s860">We did not see those cadavers piled on top of each other, not until ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Okay we have to change the tape now.</span> <span id="s862">So, let’s stop the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: When your mother lined up, when the, when the Jews were lining up, you remember this as 1941, not 1942?</span> <span id="s866">And is registration… that they were registering the same time they were getting the Jewish star, as far as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s868">The two actually went together.</span> <span id="s869">Then there was a period of time my brother and I were really worried for her and that started when she began wearing the star.</span> <span id="s870">So, we escort her.</span> <span id="s871">That’s the time they begin to have laws – in the subway there were no cars left, as I told you.</span> <span id="s872">And you had to take the… and the Germans had reserved for themselves the first class.</span> <span id="s873">So, the one little way, one of the little ways the French resisted was that nobody went in the first class.</span> <span id="s874">And the Jews were forced to go in the last train.</span> <span id="s875">And so the word was in Paris that everybody had to go in the last train.</span> <span id="s876">It was a sort of an extraordinary joke, because you couldn’t get into the Jewish trains.</span> <span id="s877">And this is where I have my little quote about my mother and the French anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s878">I escorted her very often because I was afraid for her.</span> <span id="s879">So, I was once in the train with her, and we were in the last train, and she came in the train, push shoving and there was, of course, no sitting place free, until a very tall gentleman, very distingué, de Gaulle-type, you know – very strange to be that tall but very distingué.</span> <span id="s880">And he got up all his height, bowed to her very low and gave her his seat and said to her, and I remember that was my war quote: “Ah, Madame, when are we going to be allowed to be anti-sémite again?”</span> <span id="s881">[Pauses] I love that.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: What did you think when he said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I thought it was true.</span> <span id="s884">That’s the way they were, when we were caught finally after – but that’s – I am going ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s885">When we were caught, the French came to arrest us.</span> <span id="s886">Finally, they caught up with me and then they came – well, it was morning, in the early morning hours (ph), I was out and the French, the French policeman came to our arrest, not the Germans.</span> <span id="s887">The French were doing the dirty work.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: But when you went… when this man said this…</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: So, the French are going into the last car not because they care about the Jews, but because they hate the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: So, it wasn’t to necessarily help the Jews at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: It was not allowed to them, mentally, morally, patriotically.</span> <span id="s894">It is not the moment where they can even contemplate being anti-Semitic, because the Germans are anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s895">It had nothing to do with the Jews, probably.</span> <span id="s896">It hadn’t much to do with my mother; she laughed, and took the seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: She laughed at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah, she had a sense of humor.</span> <span id="s899">And she took his seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Were you anti-Semitic, do you think, in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I’ve been accused of it by an American friend – that was much, much later.</span> <span id="s902">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s903">If, by helping people, you feel superior, then maybe that was certainly the case.</span> <span id="s904">But I certainly didn’t feel superior to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: I didn’t, I didn’t mean that as disrespectful.</span> <span id="s906">I meant that, given what you said about the French, and you were brought up in France as a secular person.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: No, oh no, oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So, you would not have identified with what this guy was saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Oh, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s910">No, but I knew that “So be it”, that’s the way, at that point, the French were and you better take it.</span> <span id="s911">But it was putting it into words – and beautifully.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: But it wasn’t allowed them.</span> <span id="s914">I mean, the French, as I said, when they finally caught us and then let us go, again, because of my baptism certificate… The French were overwhelmed with what they were doing with us at that point.</span> <span id="s915">They were even in Paris, and the beginning of the deportation was already terribly ugly.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: But let’s stick with ’41 for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s918">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: ’41, you… you remain living with your mother during ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: And your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: And your brother, or he...?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: No, my mother… My brother was married, married very early and moved into an apartment.</span> <span id="s925">He married a Catholic and so he was completely out of any problem because he was out of the circuit, you see.</span> <span id="s926">They couldn’t trace him.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Really, why couldn’t they trace him?</span> <span id="s928">Didn’t they…?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Well, Germans were both extremely organized and completely disorganized.</span> <span id="s930">They were concentrating, but they were sort of single-minded, you know, they had their eye on this one.</span> <span id="s931">They weren’t going to go to somebody else in the family who was married to somebody from a long line of Catholic.</span> <span id="s932">That would be too complicated, no, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: But he was in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: And he was studying…</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: And practically every day he came to see if we were still alive.</span> <span id="s937">There was a mixture of realism, worry and completely aberrant behavior.</span> <span id="s938">Everyday he came to see if they were still around, rather than tell them to move out.</span> <span id="s939">But that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s940">You asked me how it was and that’s the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did you have a phone?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Nah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: No phone?</span> <span id="s944">So if you…</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Ah, wait a minute we were – no, no, I don’t – I remember, I remember when the phone was installed.</span> <span id="s946">I see myself in front of the phone, but I can’t place it, but it… I spent my youth without a phone definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: But it must have been somewhat dangerous for your brother to be coming to find out if you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yes, that’s what I said.</span> <span id="s949">But it was aberrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: So, you’re both… you’re living at the same… almost side by side with at least two emotions.</span> <span id="s951">One is you’re worried about what will happen to your mother and your aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yeah, but it didn’t take much of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: But it didn’t take much of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No, completely oblivious and they were, too!</span> <span id="s955">I think completely unknowing of the extent of the horror of the camp.</span> <span id="s956">_______.</span> <span id="s957">Put that in a big box because that was what kept us going was the fact that we didn’t realize the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Do you hear rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: There were no rumors in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: No rumors…</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No rumors in Paris.</span> <span id="s962">My mother was working with the Jews with the U.G.I.F. – that’s the French association of the Jews.</span> <span id="s963">She had a friend that was with her when she lost her job with the government because they were Jewish, at the same time her job went.</span> <span id="s964">So, she bumped into the Jews and worked with them.</span> <span id="s965">And then that’s the way she got the dates when the Germans were going to take, to take the kids.</span> <span id="s966">It was the Jews who gave the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So she, she lost her job because there are now rules against Jews holding certain kinds of jobs, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No, the Jews were bounced out of all administrative jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: In the, in the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: In the government, that’s it, lost her job.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s972">Okay.</span> <span id="s973">So then she gets this other job…</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: So, she gets the job working with a Jewish agency in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: And what are you doing besides school?</span> <span id="s976">Are you, do you get involved…</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Dating.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: You’re dating?</span> <span id="s979">You started dating young?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I was, it was…very chaste, but very liberating.</span> <span id="s981">They were, don’t forget also… I don’t know if I was already dating because there were no men.</span> <span id="s982">They were either prisoners or they were in hiding or they were in the Resistance in the fields somewhere outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s983">I wasn’t going to… Who was there, who was there to date?</span> <span id="s984">Anybody, anybody between the age of 20 and 25, there was none living or they were sick.</span> <span id="s985">Prisoners, killed, sick, Germans prisoners of war, or else there was nobody.</span> <span id="s986">I mean, there was a few, but very few.</span> <span id="s987">Of course, I dated, but at the Sorbonne, mildly.</span> <span id="s988">But that’s the other part of the Resistance I got involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: At the Sorbonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: At the Sorbonne, that was delivery arms.</span> <span id="s991">It had nothing to do with the children of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: So did, did you do that first, or at the same time?</span> <span id="s993">At…</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: It was the same time…approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Two different groups for whom you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: The… The Resistance, it was extremely… First, it was very romantic – the only thing you knew, you had somebody that hired you, and you depended on somebody above you.</span> <span id="s997">And you only knew – you only knew of that person was that the name he went by was not his name.</span> <span id="s998">I was Michelle during the Resistance.</span> <span id="s999">Nobody knew where I lived, who I was.</span> <span id="s1000">You met in subways.</span> <span id="s1001">You had to know nothing because of the torture.</span> <span id="s1002">You had no information to give.</span> <span id="s1003">I had no idea who the guy was; it was very, very seclusive (ph).</span> <span id="s1004">I had no idea where he lived; I have not seen him ever.</span> <span id="s1005">But he gave me orders and I filled out the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: But how did it start?</span> <span id="s1007">I mean, you were going to school…</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: I met a guy at the Sorbonne.</span> <span id="s1009">He was also a student.</span> <span id="s1010">He was slightly older and he was involved.</span> <span id="s1011">And I had a teacher, a history teacher, who was later, much later, the witness at my wedding.</span> <span id="s1012">He was teaching at what would be the Radcliffe of the time and he was a big… He was a min… He was in the Cabinet, in fact.</span> <span id="s1013">Minister… he was the Secretary or the Minister of Information, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1014">And his son put me in touch with that guy and that guy would give me the orders.</span> <span id="s1015">But he knew nothing about me and I know nothing to this day about him either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: But he must have known enough to trust you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Because he knew where I came from.</span> <span id="s1018">In other words, that teacher and his son had recommended me as somebody solid.</span> <span id="s1019">And there was also an element of that you had to, to risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And were you at all hesitant when you were approached…</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh, I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: You loved it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Oh, it was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s1026">I mean carrying, carrying arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: And how, how would you do that, underneath your skirt?</span> <span id="s1028">Or in a bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: In a bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: In a bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: It wasn’t… You know, at that time, they were not huge things; they were just little pistols.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: And so, where would you get the pistols, in the subway or something?</span> <span id="s1033">Did someone pass you one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Well, most of the meetings were in the subway, because everybody was in the subway.</span> <span id="s1035">To this day, they are still in the subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: So, how would you know?</span> <span id="s1037">You’re told to go to the subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Oh, you had to wear clothes – You had to wear your, your right-hand label is going to be this way or you are going to wear – a flower, of course, or some sign, by which you would be recognized.</span> <span id="s1039">And the only thing you knew, that you would meet that person once and never again.</span> <span id="s1040">And his name was not his name, and if you fell in love with him, too bad for you, because you were never going to have an appointment with that one again.</span> <span id="s1041">Very, very stimulating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So, you would meet this person, usually a boy, a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Always a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Always a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Oh, I know, one thing, also.</span> <span id="s1046">Very French, and very… something that the Germans never understood: You would meet a boy and you knew that he was simpatico because he was involved the same cause as you were – and if the Germans were around, then you would huddle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: As if you were kissing, as if you were lovers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: That’s right, in a corner of the porte-cochère, and the man always protecting you.</span> <span id="s1049">The man always with his broad back, so that if anything happened he was going to be hurt and you were not going to be hurt.</span> <span id="s1050">It was just delightful.</span> <span id="s1051">And never again.</span> <span id="s1052">Once or twice, I would have given something to meet those guys again.</span> <span id="s1053">But never again, it was never twice the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: So, these were very passionate moments and very exciting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: They, they were exciting moments and they didn’t last.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: But to this day, I remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: So explain… I see that – that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Explain why you were boy and girl together.</span> <span id="s1061">And who would be carrying…</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Because then, then it was less, less dangerous.</span> <span id="s1063">Then, the Germans were fooled.</span> <span id="s1064">They really thought they were witnessing a love affair.</span> <span id="s1065">And who would dare interrupt a boy and a girl, twenty-one or -two, kissing in the corner of a door?</span> <span id="s1066">Not a German, no, they were too well behaved, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: And who would carry the bag with the arms in it?</span> <span id="s1068">Would you, a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Well, at that… probably, at that point, I had passed it on…to the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And how long would you be walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Oh…</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Do you think…a half hour or an hour or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah, one hour.</span> <span id="s1074">All through Paris… not quite all through Paris.</span> <span id="s1075">We really stayed around the Latin Quarter.</span> <span id="s1076">I was very much a student, my group was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: And would he then leave you, or you’d…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yeah, forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: He would take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: He would take it and then that was it…never see him again.</span> <span id="s1081">And the next day, I would get an order to meet somebody else, elsewhere in Paris, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: And do it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: And do it again.</span> <span id="s1084">Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1085">But that was nothing; that had nothing to do with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: I under-… that this was just fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s1087">Do you, do you know the name of the, of the group with which you were associated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1089">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: No, there was no, no knowledge of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: The less, the less you knew, the better off you all were.</span> <span id="s1092">That’s the sort of thing you go by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: If you can, explain this to me again, because I am a little bewildered about something.</span> <span id="s1094">You go into the subways; you meet somebody who has…</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: You had an appointment; you had an appointment that… oh, and you never are ahead of time more than five minutes, never, never.</span> <span id="s1096">Never late, but never ahead of time.</span> <span id="s1097">You arrive promptly, you really – time was of the essence – you arrive at a certain time and you do your job and you disappear and disperse, take another direction in the subway or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And you don’t want anybody loit-… loitering.</span> <span id="s1099">It looks suspicious, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: You don’t want to be too involved too long.</span> <span id="s1101">In other words, the faster that can go, the better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: But here, here’s where my question is, ‘cause I’m not understanding something.</span> <span id="s1103">When you meet this guy, does he have the gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: So, you were just…</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: No, I have the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Oh, you have the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Usually, I am bringing the arms to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: To the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1112">Okay.</span> <span id="s1113">So where then do you get the gun from then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Somebody…</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Somebody has given it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: …or else at another place which I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1117">The man I don’t know, and I will never see him again, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1118">And it goes a chain of command, and it goes way up and I have no idea where it goes past a certain level – the guy I got my orders from.</span> <span id="s1119">And even that guy, I don’t know who he is or who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: The guy who’s name was Jacques, you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Jacques or Pierre or Robert.</span> <span id="s1122">And he knows he’s going to meet somebody called Michelle and that was who I was at that time and we would never see each other, each other again.</span> <span id="s1123">And you were not supposed to try to see each other again.</span> <span id="s1124">[Pauses] We made it romantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: It’s romantic, but lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Oh, it was lonely in a way, but I was studying hard so that I wasn’t lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Did your mother know you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No.</span> <span id="s1129">Ah, no!</span> <span id="s1130">Ah, no!</span> <span id="s1131">I know because she would have been endangered and that’s the one thing I wanted to avoid.</span> <span id="s1132">And also she was a babbler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: So you couldn’t trust her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: No, oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Did you tell anybody?</span> <span id="s1136">Did you have any close friends that you said something to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: I’m assuming you had close friends at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: [pauses] ’41, ’42… I moved out of my mother’s place because I was endangering her.</span> <span id="s1140">So, I took lodging at the student… it’s still there….</span> <span id="s1141">on Boulevard St-Michel there was a student house.</span> <span id="s1142">And I had, I had some friends that I had from the competitive years, you know.</span> <span id="s1143">Student friends, who knew nothing about my activities.</span> <span id="s1144">No, it was… I mean, really, if you call that lonely, that part was the silence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: And it’s quite possible that people that you knew, with whom you were friends, were also doing it, but nobody was talking, because you weren’t supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yes, I don’t know that… But maybe they were.</span> <span id="s1147">Maybe they were.</span> <span id="s1148">But we never discussed it afterwards.</span> <span id="s1149">That was not something – but fun – it’s done, it’s disappeared, you don’t write about it, you forget about it.</span> <span id="s1150">When I go to sleep, we were talking about thinking of… I think of all the times in Brittany in childhood.</span> <span id="s1151">I don’t think of those years at all.</span> <span id="s1152">I never think of those years.</span> <span id="s1153">Probably because they were so fleeting, the whole thing had to be fleeting in order to be safe for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Why do you say that you were endangering your mother?</span> <span id="s1155">Since she was Jewish and you had a baptism certificate and you were not suspected of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1156">Because of your activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1158">If I had been caught… that would have endan-… Because I was not hiding who I was, and therefore, she as a Jew would be endangered in another, at another level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So, how did you explain to her why you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: That’s why I didn’t live with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: I know, but why did you, how did you explain to her why you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Because I wanted my independence; that’s why I had moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: And did you live nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1165">Practically next door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: But in a, but in another building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: In another building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So, you saw your mother still very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: I must have, yeah.</span> <span id="s1170">We were very close, we were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Do you think she suspected you were doing something, or she believed you that you were being independent, to be living…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No, I don’t think she was involved in my behavior.</span> <span id="s1173">She thought I wanted to be independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: And were you working at this time?</span> <span id="s1175">You had finished school, in ’41, or not, or were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I was on that scholarship and then again through school, I got a plum job, which consisted [laughs] of teaching, but teaching people like, for instance, Dominique de Villepin, the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, had a father, whom I taught.</span> <span id="s1177">Teaching people from great families who were… failing.</span> <span id="s1178">You know, they have that baccalauréat, which is difficult.</span> <span id="s1179">And so it was three or four hours in the morning, during which we would tutor them 15 minutes at time, and see them all day long, always the same guy, teaching him everything for strictly that exam.</span> <span id="s1180">And we had a practically 90 percent success level.</span> <span id="s1181">And that was very much fun, it was intensive teaching.</span> <span id="s1182">I guess it… I never heard of it here too much.</span> <span id="s1183">But over there, I think that school had some others created after it, same intense – intensive teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Was this a government job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No.</span> <span id="s1186">And extremely well paid, oh boy!</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: A fortune, they paid you a fortune.</span> <span id="s1189">But those were the, the, their parents were in the Cabinet.</span> <span id="s1190">They were the nerds’ children – the guy at the school called them “Children of Degenerates”, degenerates, children of degenerates and they were the cabinet members’ children, I mean, they were all…</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: [Laughs] Children of degenerates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes, that’s the way we greeted them in the mornings.</span> <span id="s1193">We were rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: [Laughing] Did you give, did you give some of your salary to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: She didn’t need it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Or I was egotistical, I don’t remember any passing.</span> <span id="s1198">Later on, I would help her in life, when I, after I was married.</span> <span id="s1199">But, at that time I think that I was well-dressed, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So, did you, did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: And I paid… You know, it’s far away, but I must have paid to stay at that student house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: You had to spend some of it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Do you remember about how much it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No, but it was royal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So, you were now rolling in money in a way you hadn’t before?</span> <span id="s1207">Is that true?</span> <span id="s1208">I mean, you had…</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: If it… because of the set-up of life in Paris, nothing changed.</span> <span id="s1210">There were no cars to be had, there were no… the great luxuries didn’t exist, there were no furs… Yes, I had no… I was very slim, so I didn’t even need to eat much.</span> <span id="s1211">What were you going to spend your money on, simply clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: So, so let’s talk about that a little bit.</span> <span id="s1213">You have to have coupons to buy clothes and to buy food, to have food.</span> <span id="s1214">Was there, were there rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: That was late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Or that was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1218">No, that was, that was then.</span> <span id="s1219">We had coupons for bread, we had coupons for… heh, we had coupons for wine, and, and coupons for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1220">I remember those three things.</span> <span id="s1221">I remember the episode because my mother was the most unlikely chain-smoking roly-poly.</span> <span id="s1222">She was a chain smoker.</span> <span id="s1223">And the postman did not smoke but he sure liked to drink, so she exchanged all her wine for all his cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1224">That was, that episode I remember, so there were tickets.</span> <span id="s1225">Also, well I gave my tickets away… to young men I loved, who had mothers who were sick, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1226">I didn’t, I didn’t have many needs… What can you do?</span> <span id="s1227">There wasn’t that much in the way of luxury to spend on and I had never been born or raised in luxury.</span> <span id="s1228">It meant nothing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Your… your room that you had, was it a room with a bathroom and a kitchen?</span> <span id="s1230">Or did you have to share with…</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: No, no, I don’t remember that, no.</span> <span id="s1232">No, it was a student hostel.</span> <span id="s1233">It’s still there, on Boulevard St-Michel, and I think it was a room.</span> <span id="s1234">And you know, they were not very heavy on bathrooms, and definitely no kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did you have heat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s1237">I don’t remember being deprived in any way…</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No.</span> <span id="s1240">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s1241">Not in those circumstances</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Well, we’ve come very close to the end of the tape.</span> <span id="s1243">So, I think we’ll take a break and then…</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Mm-hmm, but we are not talking about the thing that I came here for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: We are getting…</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: We are getting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: We’re getting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Nicole I, I don’t want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942, because I’m not sure anybody’s memory can be clear about when things happened.</span> <span id="s1251">But do you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you moved out from your mother, or was it… do you think it was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it.</span> <span id="s1253">Because I used not to come back to the house, as I told you, not to come back to that apartment, not to involve her, not to have her know about my activities.</span> <span id="s1254">And so… And also for the date, I know that what really shook me was that Vel d’Hiv… when the word came out, and it came out, not that I saw the inside of the place, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so close to were everybody lived.</span> <span id="s1255">And at that point, I thought I had to do something.</span> <span id="s1256">But I just sort of had to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: More than what you were doing?</span> <span id="s1258">‘Cause you obviously were doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children…</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Then that bothered you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: …which was late, then I had to step in and do something.</span> <span id="s1262">Because I was in a unique position to probably be able to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that they were going to take children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had – thanks again to the organization of the German – an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raids.</span> <span id="s1265">And that’s the way I knew where to go to get the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: But was… Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew?</span> <span id="s1267">Were they in some sense assisting with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy.</span> <span id="s1269">It probably was.</span> <span id="s1270">There was a point there where it was unhealthy.</span> <span id="s1271">But for my sake, it was practical.</span> <span id="s1272">I think after the war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they maybe shouldn’t have had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: But when your mother… Your mother would give you the information…</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: I guess that’s the way I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: You think that’s the way it came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Because there was no other way I could get it.</span> <span id="s1277">And I know of what transpired after the war about the U.G.I.F and how close they were with the Germans, because they knew of the German work as it took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going to do something?</span> <span id="s1279">I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable?</span> <span id="s1280">‘Cause she’s just not giving it to you casually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Probably, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: But you don’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: But everything, everything was so…shrug your shoulder.</span> <span id="s1284">You do it and then that’s it.</span> <span id="s1285">I thought it was normal, in other words, I never made… until you shook me up, I never thought of it.</span> <span id="s1286">Definitely normal behavior.</span> <span id="s1287">What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s1288">Sit back and let it be.</span> <span id="s1289">So, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the type of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something.</span> <span id="s1290">And I was in an unusual position that I could do something.</span> <span id="s1291">Because of the way the French government was going to protect me, one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: So you felt…</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Compelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: [Coughs] I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1295">You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the French government would protect you, which didn’t mean that you were totally protected because the Germans might do something, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: There was some danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: That came, that came – for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that moment on the train in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the compartment door, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or whoever it was that I was transporting – and it was a kid capable of talking – had given out anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead – I was just as good as dead at that point.</span> <span id="s1299">So, when I went into it, I didn’t know the extent of the danger and most of the time, probably, I wasn’t discovered, so there was no danger.</span> <span id="s1300">It worked well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1302">But now you’re doing this in connection with the underground group that you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: So, it’s a different group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Completely different.</span> <span id="s1306">That had to do with the Jewish U.G.I.F.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: All of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes.</span> <span id="s1309">Because otherwise I would not know where they were to be had, to start with, Paris being a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: So this was a Jewish underground…</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: …organization that you were connected with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: It wasn’t really underground.</span> <span id="s1314">It was the Jewish… administration of the Jews, at the time…</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: The U.G.I.F., yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the Germans… You were not doing this openly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: And the only people that would have any inkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was the Jewish organization in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: So your mother – You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people you were going to be taken.</span> <span id="s1320">And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at once?</span> <span id="s1321">Or they were taking a few at a time that they…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: They came, they came individually.</span> <span id="s1323">They would come to your apartment and ring, and if the bell rang at four o’clock in the morning, you knew who it was.</span> <span id="s1324">And what happened is that after the Vel d’Hiv – this is when the Vel d’Hiv come in – they would not anymore – I didn’t see it in the book – but they would not anymore tackle young children.</span> <span id="s1325">So, the Germans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands.</span> <span id="s1326">Because it created such an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point the whole city would rebel against them.</span> <span id="s1327">So, in some ways, I was in the middle.</span> <span id="s1328">It was a sort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things.</span> <span id="s1329">It was some very shady participation there.</span> <span id="s1330">‘Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that happened at the very specific date.</span> <span id="s1331">“Enough with the babies!</span> <span id="s1332">If there’s one thing that we don’t need in Paris, it’s that problem.”</span> <span id="s1333">And I stepped in and took that problem away from their hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Was anyone else doing it, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: That I would…not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Not that you know of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: I never mentioned it and nobody mentioned it to me.</span> <span id="s1338">It was rare… It could have been obvious, you know, all those people taking a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: So, let’s talk about the process, you get names, and you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Addresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Addresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Times, times, time, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: These people did not necessarily expect you.</span> <span id="s1344">You’re just, you’re just as surprising as the Germans knocking.</span> <span id="s1345">For a different reason, but you’re a surprise to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal experience, do not give away their children.</span> <span id="s1347">So I had some persuading to do to them, which was the difficult part.</span> <span id="s1348">It was in two parts: first, “This is it, you are doomed”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: You would tell them that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I don’t know how I did, but I passed on that message.</span> <span id="s1351">“As far as you are concerned, let it be, there is nothing anybody can do.</span> <span id="s1352">But there’s something that that German soldier is going to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child is safe.”</span> <span id="s1353">And then I would get the child.</span> <span id="s1354">And the same day, he was in Italy, he or she, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Did you usually have one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: One child at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: One child at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I couldn’t handle…</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: How long, how long would it…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I think the Jews – the Jewish association took care of them until the train time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: No, I mean, when you went to someone’s apartment…</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I got the child.</span> <span id="s1363">I got…</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: But how long would it take you to convince people usually?</span> <span id="s1365">You would sit there for an hour, two hours or much less?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: [Scoffs] No, much less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: You don’t have that much time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Much less, the Germans are not going to let me.</span> <span id="s1369">They don’t have the message.</span> <span id="s1370">I have the message from the Germans at large; they don’t.</span> <span id="s1371">So they are brutal.</span> <span id="s1372">They, they want the whole thing finished and also maybe they have some human feeling that the whole thing is ugly, so they want it over with.</span> <span id="s1373">So, I don’t have much problem with them, I have the problems with the woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: You don’t have problems with whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: With the Germans.</span> <span id="s1376">The Germans have been given the message: “No children, no dealing with children under the age of three”.</span> <span id="s1377">So, I had no problem with the German at that point.</span> <span id="s1378">I am in a small apartment in nowhere in Paris, usually a poor neighborhood, not especially a Jewish neighborhood and confronting a woman, and that’s the woman that is the problem or could be the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Is the husband usually there, or not…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No, there were no men in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: No men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: He is either a prisoner of war or in the Resistance or he’s out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So, these women are alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: So, would it be very often very quickly that the people would say, “Okay, take the child”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germans come in, they had a feeling that… of the ugliness of it.</span> <span id="s1387">Even if they were uncultured and uninformed, they would sense the enormity of it and it wouldn’t be a battle.</span> <span id="s1388">I don’t remember a battle.</span> <span id="s1389">And then you would have to get the identity of the child in order to after the war to be careful to have kept track.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Of who the child was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Of who the child was!</span> <span id="s1392">And at that point, he was in Italy, the child was in Italy, in a convent.</span> <span id="s1393">And that’s when another battle started with the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Were there mothers who refused to give you their, their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s1396">Never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: All of them – all of the mothers got…</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1399">They would… all of the mothers would give a chance to the child.</span> <span id="s1400">Immediately… what happened was that immediately they realized that there was no chance for them… with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1401">There was no chance for them and if they took the child with them, I told them in no uncertain terms “That child will not save you.</span> <span id="s1402">The fact that you have a child even at the breast will not save you.”</span> <span id="s1403">And the, the ugliness of the German soldiers was such that they felt it.</span> <span id="s1404">And that I came from the, probably, I don’t remember, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was reassuring for them.</span> <span id="s1405">I had their identity, I had their card, and they trusted it.</span> <span id="s1406">And then they were, were in such a….</span> <span id="s1407">state that they had to trust somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Did you, by this time, understand sort of what was happening, that these people would be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: So you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: I had a deep understanding.</span> <span id="s1412">It didn’t give me… I was 21.</span> <span id="s1413">I thought everybody was dead at 25 or should be dead…</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: …anyway.</span> <span id="s1416">And that it was the time limit for living, and that I was immortal, definitely.</span> <span id="s1417">I never felt that there was any – felt deeply that I was immortal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So, did you think these Jews were going to be killed in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Hmm.</span> <span id="s1420">[nods]</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the…because of the confrontation between the German soldier and the, and the women, I had the feeling that it was going to be very ugly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Now, do I understand you that the German was there with you sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: They, they were arresting the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: At the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: That’s when I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: You came at the time that they’re arresting…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Oh, oh, I see…</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Because otherwise, the kid would not be left behind in the apartment all by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to the Germans, that you would try to beat the timing of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1432">So you’re there just as the German…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: I wouldn’t have had a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Because the mothers wouldn’t do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: They wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1436">But when they see – saw the Germans come for the family and they’re willing to let go of the child.</span> <span id="s1437">Then they realize the danger they were in, and they were willing to let go of the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: That’s quite amazing.</span> <span id="s1439">I didn’t – I had no idea that it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Well, when you think of it, it’s the only way it made sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: And it was not very difficult because they really banged – they didn’t knock at the door – they really banged at the door.</span> <span id="s1443">And they looked… very… you would have to have a picture them – they were Gestapo soldiers; they were not regular German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1444">Or they were French policemen.</span> <span id="s1445">But the whole, the whole episode was very dramatic and the women felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: So, when they knocked at the door or…</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: They banged at the door!</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: …banged at the door, were you standing with them?</span> <span id="s1449">Or did you, after they got in, you went in with…?</span> <span id="s1450">I mean, how… where were you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: I guess I must have been with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: It’s quite amazing when you think about it, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: The whole thing is amazing, that it took place and I… and we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Was there a lot of screaming and crying, with the children…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: At other times, at other times, when I was taken with my mother, it was, it was another thing.</span> <span id="s1456">When they finally got my number and came for me early morning.</span> <span id="s1457">At that point, there were a lot of hysterics.</span> <span id="s1458">But when it was individual, the mothers were very protective of the child and if you have a young child, you don’t want to be hysterical in front of the child, so they kept the face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: But often, the child feels the terror…</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: They feel it but they freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: But they freeze?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Which is what saved my life in the train when the Germans came in the compartment was that the reaction of fear in that child then is going to be freezing and not yelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: But what happened to you when you, you… On the one hand, you’re going to probably save the child.</span> <span id="s1464">On the other hand, you know that this child’s mother is going to be killed and that the child will never see the mother again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: It was very dichotomique.</span> <span id="s1466">Yeah, it didn’t faze me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: It didn’t faze you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Was that because you were saving someone, or just because you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: I think, you had to be anesthesized (ph) or you’re not going to work for the procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: You had to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: To be anesthesized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Anesthesized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: In some way, if you are very deeply involved in the whole procedure of the Germans, you’re not going to do it.</span> <span id="s1475">You’re going to miss it; you had to keep your composure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: So, the mother is taken, you have the child…</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Then, I give it during the day to the Jewish thing because I have to get my train ticket.</span> <span id="s1478">There is a procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: So you go to the U.G.I.F. and they keep the children, the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: They keep the children until…</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Until you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Right, until train time comes.</span> <span id="s1483">And then I get my ticket, the children were traveling free, and then I get my ticket, always in the same direction: Paris-Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Paris-Nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Paris-Nice, which is the Paris-Méditerranée.</span> <span id="s1486">That’s a very straight train, it is an overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: An overnight train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: It’s an overnight train, so it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Now, were most of the children actually babies or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: The ones I took care of were all under three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Were all under three?</span> <span id="s1492">But some of them could talk a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1494">But not in front of Germans, they wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: They talked to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Oh, babbled, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Babbled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: But they knew I wasn’t their mother.</span> <span id="s1499">But they were in pretty bad shape, bad day, you know.</span> <span id="s1500">They had had a bad day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: And did you try to comfort them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Sure, I was… warm and nice, but I was only 21.</span> <span id="s1503">I hadn’t even slept with a man; I was out of it.</span> <span id="s1504">In the deep sense that I would have been when I had my own children in my arms, completely different, which probably helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Yes I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: I would have become hysterical myself otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So, you’d be on the train, did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Then I took the train and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Did you have… If there were babies, did you have diapers, did you have changing clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes the U.G.I.F. organized… I had, I had the stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Did they teach you how to change diapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Oh, well.</span> <span id="s1513">[shrugs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Or did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: At the time, you know, it was during war years, you did what you could.</span> <span id="s1516">And they are not that keen on cleanliness.</span> <span id="s1517">But the child was safe.</span> <span id="s1518">And I – they had – they had those long banks, which are fairly padded.</span> <span id="s1519">And I would give my warmth, in other words, I would put the baby on me so that, you know and I would wrap my arms around, so that the child felt protected at the end of a difficult day.</span> <span id="s1520">It was a difficult.</span> <span id="s1521">I, I tried to feel for the baby.</span> <span id="s1522">It must have been very horrible.</span> <span id="s1523">But they fell asleep and that’s… until they stopped and they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: So, then you would get off at Nice, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Yes, I had that episode when the Germans came in and the child…</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1527">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Because one time, the Germans, they were patrolling the train.</span> <span id="s1529">I don’t know what for, but for… And at that time, I was frightened.</span> <span id="s1530">Because my life was really on the line, if the kid gave me away.</span> <span id="s1531">But I can remember, they absolutely froze; they never said a word, they were just stiff with fear.</span> <span id="s1532">They remembered the morning episode, the separation of their mother.</span> <span id="s1533">It was the end of a terrible day.</span> <span id="s1534">So, I didn’t have any problem with the children, and we arrived in Nice finally.</span> <span id="s1535">And I still remember, I still remember the view of the Italians.</span> <span id="s1536">The Italians were cowards made live and had declared war with France, their neighbor, in June ’40 and had moved militarily to Nice.</span> <span id="s1537">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1538">[Laughs] That’s all they could manage.</span> <span id="s1539">And so they occupied from Monaco to Nice, which is 30 kilometers of France territory.</span> <span id="s1540">But for those kids it meant life and death because when you saw an Italian soldier, you knew that they were not going to kill any babies.</span> <span id="s1541">So that’s it.</span> <span id="s1542">And I know that they took them to some religious institution in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Now, was this established that the Italians police – oh, not the Italian police – the soldiers would take…</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: No, they were in the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: They were just there and you just gave it to them?</span> <span id="s1546">You just gave it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Yes, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1548">But at that time, the, the Jewish organization in Paris must have communicated.</span> <span id="s1549">They had contact near the frontier, and those children were taken to convents.</span> <span id="s1550">And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those convents and Israel, at the end of the war, because Israel wanted those Jewish kids to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1551">And the Italians wouldn’t give them.</span> <span id="s1552">At that point, I thought it was a huge joke, I couldn’t care less… what happened, they were alive.</span> <span id="s1553">Whether they were Israeli citizen or Italian citizen or no citizen, they were safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Now, how did people keep track of which child was, was actually who… you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1555">…the identity of the child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Well, well I… that would be given to whoever was handed the child.</span> <span id="s1557">I would give the pap-whatever written scribbles I had about the identity of the mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1559">So, that would go with the child and then that would be given…</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Then that could be their problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: I got rid of that problem with the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: So, as far as you knew, these soldiers would bring these babies…</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Oh, as far as I know from documentation, from movies, from everything that has been written, there was not one child killed by Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: And you would then stay overnight in Nice?</span> <span id="s1566">Or go right… Or turn around and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: I had a feeling that I had to come back if only so that my mother wouldn’t be worried and suspicious, and so that I could continue in my studies or whatever I was doing.</span> <span id="s1568">But that was the least of my worries, so I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s1569">I don’t think I stayed in Nice – I didn’t have any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: How long a trip did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: How long a trip did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: It’s an overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: It’s an overnight, so that if you would come in the morning…</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Yes, I guess I must – must have stayed somewhere.</span> <span id="s1576">Maybe there was a day train.</span> <span id="s1577">I have no idea of the return.</span> <span id="s1578">That was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: But you think that you were still staying at mother’s house, or you were in the other place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: I had another place and one night, I was so tired coming back early, I came to sleep at her place and that’s when the Germans got us.</span> <span id="s1581">So it was a…</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: You were going back…</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: I was going back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Did your mother ever become suspicious?</span> <span id="s1585">Ever say anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Well, she must have known there was something going on.</span> <span id="s1587">She knew better than to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Do you remember approximately how many trips you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Five?</span> <span id="s1591">Ten?</span> <span id="s1592">No?</span> <span id="s1593">You have no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: No, probably not more than ten.</span> <span id="s1595">I remember just a very few of them, and definitely part of the job was not to count.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids?</span> <span id="s1599">Do you see yourself on the train with these babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yes, yes, yes, that I do.</span> <span id="s1601">Some moments are very clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Are you crying about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: No, that they were children and they were in my lap and they were sleeping and that damn door flew opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: It was pretty scary when the Germans...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Oh, yeah, that was for me, too.</span> <span id="s1606">But the people in the compartment never knew much either.</span> <span id="s1607">They didn’t like – nobody liked to be asked by the Germans about their I.D. in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: So, one night instead of going to your little studio apartment…</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: …I went back to sleep in my bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: And that night, that morning, they came.</span> <span id="s1612">Unmistakable knock at the door.</span> <span id="s1613">And they were, those were French policemen, two little French policemen almost may age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Little ones?</span> <span id="s1615">Almost your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Yes, they were maybe 23 to my 21, but very young.</span> <span id="s1617">And I remember them – they were almost my size and they followed me… to where I washed.</span> <span id="s1618">They watched me wash, supposedly because they were afraid I was going to commit suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: So wait, wait, wait a second; they come to your mother’s house…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: They come to my mother’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Why do they come – for you do you think?</span> <span id="s1622">What do they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: To take me to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Take you?</span> <span id="s1625">So do you think that they were…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: And my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: …tracking you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: In terms of your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: I think, I think that they were, yes.</span> <span id="s1631">I think they were tracking me finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: So they… Well, some Germans knew what you were doing because you were at the door with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: However, you thought this was okay…</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Well, as I said, I was blissfully lackadaisical.</span> <span id="s1636">I… it is a tendency I have kept through my life.</span> <span id="s1637">I think it helps with the bumps of life altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Now, do you think they were coming for you and your mother, or you, and they happened to pick up your mother at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: They happened to pick up my mother [laughs] at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: So all along, it’s your mother who you think is in danger…</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1642">And at that point mostly… What was lovely at that point was that the only papers that she carried was my baptism certificate.</span> <span id="s1643">And she let those little soldiers, those little policemen, French policemen follow me and see as much of me as possible.</span> <span id="s1644">She didn’t say, “Leave her alone.</span> <span id="s1645">Don’t go to the bathroom with her.”</span> <span id="s1646">No, she wanted as much intimacy between those two little guys and her little daughter as possible.</span> <span id="s1647">And that, at the end of the morning, is what saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: She was smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Because then we were taken to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1650">Then we were taken to the Marais and the German scene was very… That’s when the women were hysterical.</span> <span id="s1651">And there were 52 of us, as I remember, and they knew that I was going to get out.</span> <span id="s1652">And they all gave me their lists of addresses and people to notify.</span> <span id="s1653">And not one of single one of them came back alive.</span> <span id="s1654">So, what happened is that the scene got uglier and uglier and at some point, as you see in movies, you are pushed into a courtyard.</span> <span id="s1655">And in the courtyard, there is a truck and the back of the truck flips down and at that point, you’re pushed in.</span> <span id="s1656">And at that moment, it was bedlam.</span> <span id="s1657">The women were hysterical.</span> <span id="s1658">The whole tr-… the whole thing was crowded; there were too many people for the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1659">And my mother kept after those two little guys – and she was much more in danger than you can imagine – was keeping after them saying, “Let her go, she shouldn’t be here, let her go!”</span> <span id="s1660">And at some point, they said, “The hell with you, get out of here!”</span> <span id="s1661">And at that point, I lost all my courage.</span> <span id="s1662">I began to cry and she found all her courage back and she was, that little roly-poly with no gumption at all, was smiling and said, “Okay, let’s get out.”</span> <span id="s1663">And she knew how to get out and she knew how to find the café.</span> <span id="s1664">And she stood there at the Jewish café, which is still there, it’s a Jewish café, and she plunked down and she had to have her café, in front of all the trucks going by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: We have to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Nicole, I would like to bring you back to when these two guys, the police – the French policeman and French detective, am I correct?</span> <span id="s1669">Or are they two French police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Two French policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Two French policemen, no detective.</span> <span id="s1672">When they come in, the bang on the door, were you – are you actually sleeping yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: You are sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: It was four or five in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: They take you to the subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: No, but what do they say?</span> <span id="s1679">Do they say anything?</span> <span id="s1680">They’re in the house, but not very long.</span> <span id="s1681">They just say…</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: They, they, they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: “Come out.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: The same thing that they must say around the world, “I.D. verification.”</span> <span id="s1685">I.D. verification, whatever that meant, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: So, your mother has the presence of mind to take your baptism certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Oh, that!</span> <span id="s1688">She was carrying it…</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: All the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: All that morning.</span> <span id="s1691">She practically slept with it.</span> <span id="s1692">Yes, it was very meaningful to her that I would survive those experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: So, she has that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: But they know she is Jewish of course because she…</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yes, she wears the star, mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1697">It’s five o’clock in the morning and we go on the subway and it’s filled with working class people.</span> <span id="s1698">And they don’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s1699">You could feel that they do it very early, but still get the lower class, working class people and those are the least prejudiced probably.</span> <span id="s1700">And they don’t like what they are seeing.</span> <span id="s1701">They, they know it’s going to be ugly and they had those two women surrounded by those two police officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Are you finally frightened at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: No, you’re still not frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Takes you, takes you a while.</span> <span id="s1706">So, they bring you to Marais?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: To the Marais.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: The Marais?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: To the hotel in front of Flambaum, which is still there.</span> <span id="s1710">A beautiful hôtel particulier.</span> <span id="s1711">And there, they take us to the… There that the Germans are, and then it becomes ugly, ugly, I mean, they start… My mother puts her hand on the table and they whipped her.</span> <span id="s1712">So, that sort of behavior I hadn’t seen before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: And do they ask you questions?</span> <span id="s1714">Is there an interrogation or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Well they ask for I.D. and I showed the I.D. and so they, they know that it is I and it is my mother.</span> <span id="s1716">And then we went into a waiting room with 50 other people, all women and children that morning, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: And at this point, do you know that they’re going to deport you?</span> <span id="s1718">Do they say anything?</span> <span id="s1719">They’re going to take you somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s1721">There was no other thought that you could have; that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Do you remember what you were wearing?</span> <span id="s1723">Did they, did they allow you to change your clothes from your pajamas or nightshirt or whatever you were wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yes, since they watched me wash, they watched me dress!</span> <span id="s1725">I was wearing the same thing I wore during the whole war years.</span> <span id="s1726">I spent a lot on shoes.</span> <span id="s1727">As I told you, the rich don’t give up their shoes, so the luxury for me was to have shoes made to mesure – custom made.</span> <span id="s1728">And no stockings because there were no stockings to be had during the war and, you know, I remember the coat, which was very handsome.</span> <span id="s1729">It was cut up from the beautiful coat of a man cousin of mine, the rich cousins.</span> <span id="s1730">So, I was simply well-dressed, no hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: They watched you get dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: They watched me get undressed…</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: And dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Wash…</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: And dressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: They went to the bathroom with me.</span> <span id="s1737">So they watched me wash, bare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: They sat around the sink with me while I washed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Because…</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: They didn’t speak, but they were with me.</span> <span id="s1741">And I came back and I snuck to the bathroom and that was so small they couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s1742">But they stayed at the door of the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1743">I went to the bathroom and I went to my room and I got dressed and they were there when I got dressed.</span> <span id="s1744">Then that’s when they got attached.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: And that, in part – they may have done it anyway – but your mother knew that that was somehow… might, might work that they might get attached if they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: I don’t think that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: I don’t think it was a conscious thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: They would have done anyhow.</span> <span id="s1751">I mean, that was part of the…humiliating you.</span> <span id="s1752">You know, it’s humiliating to have somebody watch what you are washing your behind are two young people, snickering.</span> <span id="s1753">They didn’t snicker.</span> <span id="s1754">They didn’t say anything, do anything, just watched…but they were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: But they were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: They were in a French uniform.</span> <span id="s1757">And then we went to the subway, in second class, not specially in a compartment.</span> <span id="s1758">And those were French people going to work very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1759">Therefore, those are not the bourgeois; those are the working class people.</span> <span id="s1760">And you feel that they didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Did they… anybody say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: No!</span> <span id="s1763">That was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1764">Those French people were a… police people are… well, they had their bâtons, at least, you know; it was dangerous to say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: When your mother was hit on the hand once you were in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: She just took her hand off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: And that’s all they did?</span> <span id="s1768">They didn’t, they didn’t beat her; they simply didn’t want her hand on the table, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Just a whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Yeah, and it hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Probably, she didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: So, you were then put in this room with about 50 other people, mainly women – or all women and children, no men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Mm-hmm, it was just women and children, no men at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And is there someone in the room guarding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: It’s supposed… There is a room where the Germans are.</span> <span id="s1776">And then there is the other room.</span> <span id="s1777">There is no need; there is nowhere to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Because the only exit…</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Would be through that room, which had their desk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Any windows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: I think there was, going into the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1782">Nobody tried anything.</span> <span id="s1783">They were kind of, you go into a sort of what you would call a state of shock.</span> <span id="s1784">You are not quite at your most vivid at that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: So, people are not talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: People are not talking, but they are passing pieces of paper to me with their name and addresses to contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: But that’s only when they knew that you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: No, they just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: From the word go, they knew I had a baptism certificate.</span> <span id="s1791">And my mother was flaunting it probably and talking about it.</span> <span id="s1792">And they knew that if one person had a chance of getting out, I was the one, and therefore I could contact, because they had no way of contacting their relatives.</span> <span id="s1793">So, I came out with a list of names and addresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: [Background person says something to interviewer] Okay, so we’re now back after that little interruption.</span> <span id="s1795">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: So, people are handing you names of relatives that you can contact because they think, if anybody gets out, it’ll be you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1799">And it was.</span> <span id="s1800">Fifty-two of them, not one of them otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: So, all of you go out to the courtyard, the truck comes, that little…</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Flips down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Flips down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: I saw a movie once that, that depicted that.</span> <span id="s1805">That’s the only movie that was about the time that was realistic to me.</span> <span id="s1806">It shows the truck – that’s when you knew – and the back flips down, and you’re pushed in, and then that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: And was it, was it very rough?</span> <span id="s1808">Was it a very large truck or smaller…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Was enough to get…dozens of people.</span> <span id="s1810">It was a big truck.</span> <span id="s1811">It took the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1812">And the policemen were going on the side of the courtyard toward the exit…and by that time they were petrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: And were people screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: The women were somewhat hysterical.</span> <span id="s1815">They were crying; if you were screaming, you would be whipped.</span> <span id="s1816">But sobbing probably and it was not pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Now are you in the back?</span> <span id="s1818">One of the last ones so that your mother can find…?</span> <span id="s1819">I mean these two policemen…</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: At that point, my mother was following the policemen, so we must have gone to the side of it.</span> <span id="s1821">And she was talking to them constantly, saying, “Look at her, she should not be here, let her go”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Then they finally said…</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Then they said…</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: “Get the hell out of here”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: “Eh, merde, foutez le camp!</span> <span id="s1826">Foutez le camp!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: “Merde!</span> <span id="s1829">Foutez le camp!”</span> <span id="s1830">They were tired of the whole scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Were there Germans there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Yes, there were Germans, but it was such a confused set-up.</span> <span id="s1833">There were only a few German soldiers; there were two French policemen who stayed out of the way; and there were 52 – I counted them – 52 Jews.</span> <span id="s1834">With a lot of commotion, because it’s a lot of crying of babies and yelling of mothers; they forecast the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: So, when these two guys said…</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: “The hell with you!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: “Get the hell out of here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: “Get the hell out of here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1840">Where do, where did… how do you get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: That’s when my mother suddenly recovered and became a very clear-eyed mother again.</span> <span id="s1842">And I became nothing in tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: At that moment…</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: At that moment, the change of personality was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1845">She became the mother-in-charge and I became the child good-for-nothing and in tears.</span> <span id="s1846">And then she pulled me out.</span> <span id="s1847">Well, you’d have to see the porte-cochère – It’s a very specific thing for those enormous mansions, where they used to have the carriages come in with the four horses and a cart, right?</span> <span id="s1848">So that’s the courtyard and the porte-cochère is opened – it had to be opened – and that’s the entrance that’s an enormous entrance, enough for the truck to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: And you went out the same way that the truck…</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1851">We went out by the truck!</span> <span id="s1852">The truck was occupying the whole courtyard and we just sneaked away and the Ger-… the… two little French policemen were there and we went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: No Germans saw you as far as you know?</span> <span id="s1854">Certain…</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: They were very busy.</span> <span id="s1856">It was bedlam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: And as soon as you get out…</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: My mother goes to Flambaum.</span> <span id="s1859">She crossed the street and I said, “You are out of…!”</span> <span id="s1860">And we see the truck going out… with the 50 people inside.</span> <span id="s1861">And she’s at the café terrace – terrace!</span> <span id="s1862">– not even inside!</span> <span id="s1863">On the terrace!</span> <span id="s1864">She said, “I have to have my coffee,” and she has her coffee.</span> <span id="s1865">And Flambaum is patting her hand and saying, “Oh, madame, things will be all right”.</span> <span id="s1866">And so the whole scene was preposterous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Did people in the Flambaum know who, know what…</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: There was nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: There was nobody…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: It was very early still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: But somebody was there to serve you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Yes, but it wasn’t a crowded terrace like the Montparnasse in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: And why do think that she went there?</span> <span id="s1874">Was she just so exhausted from…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: She just…yeah, I don’t know, emotionally, she was drained, what you would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Funny how you can have your highs and then suddenly are completely wiped out.</span> <span id="s1878">And she always drank, drank coffee.</span> <span id="s1879">She was a chain smoker and a heavy coffee drinker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Now, did you stop crying as soon as you got out of that courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: And why did, I mean, you may not know the answer to this question, but why at that moment when the two police said, “Hell, get out of here!”</span> <span id="s1883">, you leave, why were you crying then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: I think it was, the whole thing was a little too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1887">It was because it was such an ugly scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: And you had never seen that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Yeah, can you imagine 50 women knowing they are doomed?</span> <span id="s1890">And here I had talked with them five minutes before.</span> <span id="s1891">And they were young women with their children.</span> <span id="s1892">They were getting them younger and younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s1894">[Long pause] You still see it, don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: You can, you can see it now, can’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1898">I’m not making any effort to… [Chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: To hide it.</span> <span id="s1900">[Laughs] Did you get angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: No.</span> <span id="s1902">No, not really.</span> <span id="s1903">I never was angry, all through it.</span> <span id="s1904">I rarely, rarely get angry…doesn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: But you got sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Oh, that I do.</span> <span id="s1907">And I don’t get revengeful either.</span> <span id="s1908">I remember when Paris fell.</span> <span id="s1909">The Americans marched down the Champs Elysées.</span> <span id="s1910">And I wanted to see the redition (ph) of the Germans; so I went to the Arc de Triomphe.</span> <span id="s1911">And the behavior of the French, who had been so non-committal during the war, was atrocious.</span> <span id="s1912">They were spitting at… you know, by that time the Germans were putting in arms some people who were 18 and… nothing little fellows, who had seen nothing, done nothing.</span> <span id="s1913">They were just marching, and they had to have their head – their hands on their head to shame them.</span> <span id="s1914">And the French – I was preventing the French from hurting the Germans.</span> <span id="s1915">These were the wrong ones, anyhow.</span> <span id="s1916">But the scene was very ugly.</span> <span id="s1917">The French didn’t ever behave well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: No matter what was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: No matter what was happening, they were wrong, on the wrong side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: On the other hand, you speak of at least some of the war years, where the French are angry enough at the Germans to have a certain kind of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Those are popular classes that don’t go to the Champs Elysées to see the Americans march down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: It’s very funny how it is a city, the city is divided; those are not the same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Mm-hmm, so when you say the French…</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: They were… We were at Passy.</span> <span id="s1926">You see the Americans march at the Arch of Triumph.</span> <span id="s1927">That’s near where we were, at my grandparents’ house in Passy.</span> <span id="s1928">Those are the exquisite, broad avenues, and… little working people were not anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Let’s go back to the café.</span> <span id="s1930">You’re in the café and you’re seeing the trucks… One truck?</span> <span id="s1931">More than one truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: No, one.</span> <span id="s1933">I remember only one because that was the one where I would have gone and where the women I was talking with were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: And did… How long did you sit there with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: Not long, just until after they had gone.</span> <span id="s1936">And then, then she decided she wanted to go back to her apartment, where we had been captured the day before – the same day!</span> <span id="s1937">To get her silverware, of all things, I mean, she never… She always was one train behind, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: So did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: You went back, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: And the Germans, in their disorganization, never went back to that apartment.</span> <span id="s1942">They had done their hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: But you thought that they might come back to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Well I… It wasn’t the most comfortable place for me to be.</span> <span id="s1945">And to see that little fatty… And have you ever – and the crystal ware – have you ever piled crystal ware in a box?</span> <span id="s1946">It breaks as you put it down.</span> <span id="s1947">It was utterly absurd; it was very much my mother.</span> <span id="s1948">And then she gave it to the neighbor downstairs to keep for the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s1949">And one day, all after the war, it was all there.</span> <span id="s1950">But the Germans never came back to that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: So, she packed what she thought was valuable…</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: …and gave it to the neighbor downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: …And then, did you pack any clothes?</span> <span id="s1956">Did you pack anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: We didn’t have much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1959">And then you went Passy to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yes, to live, and we lived out the rest of the war there.</span> <span id="s1961">And when there was the liberation of Paris, I remember that I went from Passy – it was a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower – and I remember the American who flew under the Eiffel Tower.</span> <span id="s1962">They were having so much fun liberating Paris.</span> <span id="s1963">They were the anti-German.</span> <span id="s1964">Imagine, flying under the Eiffel Tower.</span> <span id="s1965">They had fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Small plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: Small plane, but still…</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: You went to the apartment of your…</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: …grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Father’s parents, right…</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1973">That side of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: And they were in Brittany.</span> <span id="s1976">They had gone…</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: They stayed in Brittany all through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: So you, your mother had keys to that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Then there was a concierge.</span> <span id="s1982">And what is funny is that the concierge never gave us up.</span> <span id="s1983">You had to… you were in danger all the time.</span> <span id="s1984">All that was necessary – Passy was surrounded by Germans; all the beautiful apartment buildings were occupied by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: So, if this is the case, are you any longer doing any work with the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: What we did then was hide people in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Then you hide people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yes, but they were older then.</span> <span id="s1991">But people who were in danger of being deported.</span> <span id="s1992">I had a bed; it never was empty.</span> <span id="s1993">I was heavily dating, the curfew was midnight, so I would come back at midnight, get into my bed and it was full of people.</span> <span id="s1994">Not full of people, but it was at least one person here, one person there, it would be…</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Now, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1996">Now, now it’s getting complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: They were people who were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Right, but how… how would they come to you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: They knew…</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: They knew your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: They knew my mother and they knew me and knew that we had survived and we were at Passy, they had the address and wanted an apartment for overnight.</span> <span id="s2002">So, it served as a sort of a refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: For the night and then they would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2005">And then they would have to find a permanent place where to hide until the liberation of France.</span> <span id="s2006">And that I found for them.</span> <span id="s2007">I found among my friends people who would be willing to take women, children, whatever, for years to come.</span> <span id="s2008">And it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s2009">At that point, among friends, that you found people who were willing to help, really to help.</span> <span id="s2010">And I kept, kept those friends on both ends.</span> <span id="s2011">The people who took care of the people who were taken care of – I saw them until they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: And, and how…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: In the living room, I remember one.</span> <span id="s2014">I was talking with friends of the fate of a young woman that I knew whose husband had been taken, and nephew had been killed at the age of 18 months.</span> <span id="s2015">The whole family was absolutely destroyed.</span> <span id="s2016">And she was beginning a pregnancy so she really wanted that child, because her husband just had been taken.</span> <span id="s2017">And she came to live with us at Passy.</span> <span id="s2018">And then I saw a friend one day when she was there, and I said, “Who on earth is going to be able to take you, pregnant, for the rest of your pregnancy, to salvage the child?”</span> <span id="s2019">And the friend said, “I will!”</span> <span id="s2020">And she had her in her living room – she had a very small place – for the remainder of the year.</span> <span id="s2021">And they became the best of friends after the war.</span> <span id="s2022">They did – had two houses with joint backyards.</span> <span id="s2023">But then, they never forget.</span> <span id="s2024">I will.</span> <span id="s2025">So, there were some individual cases of French devotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: So, how many people did you help, you and your mother, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: [Sighs] That was a flow…I don’t know how long… you had the… we have to think of dates, that was ’43, ’44.</span> <span id="s2028">It was just one year…</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: Right, one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: One year.</span> <span id="s2031">And then the Americans debarked and that was over.</span> <span id="s2032">Although they continued deporting, but I didn’t know it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: But you were not hiding.</span> <span id="s2034">You were heavily… You describe yourself as heavily dating!</span> <span id="s2035">So, you’re going out?</span> <span id="s2036">Who are you going out with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: If you… you can…If you were cute, you can always find a man [Laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Were these boys in the underground?</span> <span id="s2039">I mean, there’s not a lot of men…</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Medical, medical doctors like my brother, anybody who was in one of those higher schools of higher learning were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Did you fall in love a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Did you fall in love a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Constant…</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: The door opened and there I was.</span> <span id="s2047">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Yes, I dated…I remember, I dated several times during the evening.</span> <span id="s2050">And the best date was around ten o’clock.</span> <span id="s2051">Six o’clock, not very good; eight wasn’t really better, but the ten o’clock date was really the serious one of the evening.</span> <span id="s2052">That was… my heavy dating, nothing ever happened, but it was very exhilarating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: So, you would date three guys in one…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Oh, yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: So, what would you do?</span> <span id="s2056">Dinner with one and drinks with another…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s2060">And Paris is a lovely city where to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Was… were people sexually free during this time or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: Not I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: No.</span> <span id="s2065">I don’t think it was at all the morals of the generation.</span> <span id="s2066">You are talking to somebody who is in her 80s.</span> <span id="s2067">That was 60 years ago, you know.</span> <span id="s2068">I think that behavior is only in the last… It became much more lax in America with my daughter’s generation.</span> <span id="s2069">But I had not seen it in my generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: So, when you say it was more… the 10 o’clock date… I don’t know if you planned it like this, but 10 o’clock, it was more exciting.</span> <span id="s2071">Is that because the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Kissing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Uh-huh, so there was a lot of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Yeah, of course, very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: So, that’s why it had to be that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: So, did you choose people you were dating at the particular hours?</span> <span id="s2078">You knew what was going to happen, sort of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Well, we made an appointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Were you frightened of being caught?</span> <span id="s2081">Or you didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Anyhow, when you are out with a guy, you don’t feel that frightened.</span> <span id="s2083">No, I didn’t have the tendency to feel frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Were you now carrying around your baptismal papers or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: I could not find them for the life of me.</span> <span id="s2086">They are not important.</span> <span id="s2087">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: What did your I.D. card say?</span> <span id="s2089">Nothing?</span> <span id="s2090">Just your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: That, I probably could find it.</span> <span id="s2092">I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: You do have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: I had it; it did say my name.</span> <span id="s2095">I never destroyed papers, so somewhere in a box, I might – if I find it, I’ll send it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: At the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: And how, how are you getting coupons for food?</span> <span id="s2099">I mean, you’re not working, right?</span> <span id="s2100">Or are you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: No, but my mother could collect for, for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Because she’s working for… She’s still working…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: No, no you could not.</span> <span id="s2104">No, no, this is the official French government that gave them at the mairie and mairie, at the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Was giving coupons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yes, you get your coupons every month.</span> <span id="s2107">Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: So, is your mother at home all the time now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: After, after the arrest, when you go to Passy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: I forgot, I tell you.</span> <span id="s2112">The food, as I said, was very, of very minimal interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Was this a hard time, that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: [Shakes head]</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: No, I… The hard times was the German occupation, you know.</span> <span id="s2117">For instance, during the… when the Americans liberated us, we had – it was ’45, the Battle of the Bulge – one of the hardest winters we ever had.</span> <span id="s2118">We had no heat whatsoever and it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2119">I remember when we invited an American for dinner.</span> <span id="s2120">He was the one who introduced me to my husband.</span> <span id="s2121">He came, he was flabbergasted that we had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s2122">You know, it was a polenta-type of thing.</span> <span id="s2123">And from then on, he brought us the supplies; he was very generous and fun.</span> <span id="s2124">But we didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s2125">We ate whatever there was to be eaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: And that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: It isn’t that important in life.</span> <span id="s2128">The freedom was what mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: We’re going to take a break and … End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: So, you’re telling me that after the arrest, that year, until liberation – not after liberation, which may have had all sort of difficulties attached to it – that it wasn’t so difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: After liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2134">That…</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: The year...</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: From ’43, when you were arrested and…</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: We felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: You felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: After… If you were going to be given in by the concierge, it’s going to take place in two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: If not, she’s not going to say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Something.</span> <span id="s2143">Was there any communication with your grandparents in Brittany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: You were writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: So, they knew whether you were okay or you were not okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: They must have, I must have the letters…</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Was there censorships of letters?</span> <span id="s2150">Were the German…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: Yes, there was, but you… there are ways of going around it.</span> <span id="s2152">If they were family – I should have brought you one I have--I found a hil- hilarious one of my brother’s from the Pyrenees experience in France.</span> <span id="s2153">It was… they were typed; they were printed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2154">And I better give them to you because the print is disappearing.</span> <span id="s2155">If it isn’t good paper, you know, the printing it becomes very, very white out.</span> <span id="s2156">But it’s all printed so is tué, killed.</span> <span id="s2157">It’s for people like war killed, tué, blessé, fatigué, décédé, provision.</span> <span id="s2158">I mean, the things that really mattered.</span> <span id="s2159">And you had no right to write anything that had not to do with the immediacies of daily living.</span> <span id="s2160">I mean, people find a way of… And you, you find a way of writing.</span> <span id="s2161">You should see how microscopic your handwriting can be.</span> <span id="s2162">And they let it, they let it ride.</span> <span id="s2163">And you can imagine the German spending his day looking at those cards going by.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: And your grandparents were okay during the whole time, in Brittany, as far as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: Oh, unfazed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Unfazed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Unfazed.</span> <span id="s2168">I mean, they had a property, they were solidly established.</span> <span id="s2169">They spent, I told you, they spent most of the year in Brittany, most of their older lives.</span> <span id="s2170">And although it was very uncomfortable, it was a beautiful set-up and they were safe.</span> <span id="s2171">I don’t think they worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Now what, what news were getting about the progress of the war and also what the Nazis are doing to Jews?</span> <span id="s2173">Are you now getting more…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Nothing?</span> <span id="s2176">Nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Nothing, I think… I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Are there newspapers?</span> <span id="s2179">There are newspapers.</span> <span id="s2180">Did they say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: The newspapers were censored.</span> <span id="s2182">[laughs] The correspondence between people may have been censored but if there was one thing that was censored, it was the newspapers and… so you learn practically noth-… In fact, I knew nothing about the American debarkation from the German-French and French newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: And you’re not getting rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: I didn’t hear one word of rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: It’s funny…</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: We were expecting, expecting, expecting.</span> <span id="s2187">It was kind of joke.</span> <span id="s2188">I remember a neph-… a nephew of mine – two, two and a half – and he was spending the night at Passy with me, at the place we were.</span> <span id="s2189">And he was learning to speak and he was bouncing on the bed.</span> <span id="s2190">And I remember the thing that he was saying, “Les Américains sont à Paris.”</span> <span id="s2191">or whatever; he was bouncing on the bed.</span> <span id="s2192">I mean, there was some knowledge, but it was after the fact; they were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: So, didn’t know anyone who had a radio of some kind that could get…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: BBC?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: The Jews, their radios were taken.</span> <span id="s2197">Oh, they, they were very thorough.</span> <span id="s2198">To have no radio, no communication, the, the subway was full of radios.</span> <span id="s2199">You know why?</span> <span id="s2200">Because the Jews put their radios in the subway, and we put one in the subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: But how about non-Jews?</span> <span id="s2202">They had radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Yeah, I have seen that in the movies, but I don’t remember in France sitting around the radio listening, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: So, you are blank, you have no idea how long this was going to last, how short it’s going to last?</span> <span id="s2205">You can’t tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: It had to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: It had to end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: It had to end; you were getting kind of tongue sticking out and panting.</span> <span id="s2209">By that time, it had lasted quite a long but…we knew… When was it?</span> <span id="s2210">I didn’t think that…I remember one episode.</span> <span id="s2211">I wrote it… It’s after the American landed.</span> <span id="s2212">Somebody… saw a truck, an American truck, and touched the wheel, the, the, the tire.</span> <span id="s2213">And the tire was real rubber.</span> <span id="s2214">And he communicated to everybody that the Americans were going to win the war because we were sick in ersatz by now.</span> <span id="s2215">Nothing was real you know; everything was ersatz.</span> <span id="s2216">Those were people with real rubber, they had it made.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: [Laughs] That’s funny.</span> <span id="s2218">You never got depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: I’m not a depressed type.</span> <span id="s2220">No, with old age, when I had that massive stroke, that was a time when I was depressed.</span> <span id="s2221">It was very depressing to find myself completely paralyzed.</span> <span id="s2222">But then, you bounce back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: So, nothing during the war, even those…</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: You would get sad or you would…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: No, depressed is not the word, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: No?</span> <span id="s2228">What word would you use?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: At some point, I was overwhelmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: I was overwhelmed because, to this day, it is beyond my humane understanding to see that extent of cruelty.</span> <span id="s2232">That was, that was unbelievable… That a nation could then inflict that on their neighbors… and a nation civilized.</span> <span id="s2233">I was a student; therefore, the idea that those guys were usually learned people, they were not savages from the depth of the jungle, they came from universities.</span> <span id="s2234">And they could live through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: So what did it…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: It’s not individually.</span> <span id="s2237">As a nation, it overwhelmed me.</span> <span id="s2238">And that wasn’t depression; that was just amazement.</span> <span id="s2239">To this day, I don’t… I don’t understand what went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Did it in any way at that time, not now, but at that time make you cynical about human beings and about education?</span> <span id="s2241">Did it make you wonder what was the point of education if people…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Oh, no!</span> <span id="s2243">That I never wondered, no, because that was also my salvation… You get lost in a good book – that’s it, you found your salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: But then it seems that education doesn’t protect someone, to be… to remain civilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: No, but I never felt thought philosophically about it; I just acted when needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s2247">And your… well, go ahead, you’re thinking of…</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: You’re thinking about something.</span> <span id="s2250">What do you want to say, something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: No.</span> <span id="s2252">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2253">My short-time memory is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Did your… I know that said that after your… Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: No, I was having a funny thought.</span> <span id="s2256">I was thinking one thing that came of the war.</span> <span id="s2257">I told you how cold people were.</span> <span id="s2258">It was unbelievable that the walls were dripping wet.</span> <span id="s2259">Dripping wet from humidity, you know, no heat in the building for five years and then there were the walls.</span> <span id="s2260">And… what was I thinking?</span> <span id="s2261">Oh, you lived in bed.</span> <span id="s2262">To this day my favorite place is my bed.</span> <span id="s2263">You absolutely lived in bed because that was the warm place you could control and you could do practically everything.</span> <span id="s2264">Not talking about even the love part, which we didn’t make, but you could eat, you could read, you could write, you could talk.</span> <span id="s2265">And when I met John, I received… I received my dates in my bed.</span> <span id="s2266">They sat around, and I remember John, covered with his uniform because the apartment was so cold, sitting by my right side and we had conversation.</span> <span id="s2267">That’s the way I entertained.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: So, there was no heat the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s2270">I think there were two week… two weekends… I, I know that before that there were two weekends.</span> <span id="s2271">That’s almost nothing.</span> <span id="s2272">In one room, one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: Then there’s no hot water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: No hot water ever.</span> <span id="s2275">No stockings.</span> <span id="s2276">That came with the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: So were you always cold even…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Yeah, you, you were always feeling damp and cold, yes.</span> <span id="s2279">That was the… to me, that was the worst part of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: Just a constant physical discomfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: Of the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Of the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Not the hunger at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: I wonder then…</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: It takes, no, it takes nothing to fill you up.</span> <span id="s2286">You can eat a little bread and you are satisfied.</span> <span id="s2287">And I was young and slim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Did you lose weight during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: No, I kept my weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: No, you… you had a very unhealthy but fattening diet.</span> <span id="s2292">Bread is fattening.</span> <span id="s2293">We had bread and flour.</span> <span id="s2294">That we did have – a sort of polenta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s2296">What did you drink mainly, coffee or wine, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: I told you, there was no coffee.</span> <span id="s2298">Come on, coffee is an exotic thing.</span> <span id="s2299">You can’t coffee any more than you can have tobacco.</span> <span id="s2300">They don’t come from France.</span> <span id="s2301">France doesn’t cultivate that sort of plant.</span> <span id="s2302">So, what… We did have wine.</span> <span id="s2303">There was, I told you, a ration of wine.</span> <span id="s2304">I didn’t drink any.</span> <span id="s2305">Water, so I only drank water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: There were no soft drinks.</span> <span id="s2308">Ah, that’s a magnificent thing that they did to us.</span> <span id="s2309">You kept your figure.</span> <span id="s2310">There was nothing – the sugar was out, there was no sugar.</span> <span id="s2311">There was no, what’s that, no butter, no fats.</span> <span id="s2312">No fats.</span> <span id="s2313">One time a week, I mean, there was nothing to be fat – a lot of vegetables and fruit.</span> <span id="s2314">It was the perfect slender diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: But you did have vegetables and fruit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: In France, we sure did.</span> <span id="s2317">And we went to farms to pick them up.</span> <span id="s2318">You picked up your cherries.</span> <span id="s2319">You had friends who lived in the country and you… I went 50 miles a day on my bicycle to pick up cherries from the tree, to pick up strawberries from the ground.</span> <span id="s2320">It was a very… They were precious things that you had.</span> <span id="s2321">But no fat – no fat on you.</span> <span id="s2322">Nobody – that’s the thing – there was, at the end of the war, not one obese person in France.</span> <span id="s2323">They all died.</span> <span id="s2324">They couldn’t take the diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: But your mother you said was fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: She lost… she lost it.</span> <span id="s2327">She was extremely thin by the end the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: She was thin by the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Did she gain it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: A Jewish mother, she would manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: So, how did you have the time to bicycle out to the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Well, there were weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Even if you work, you have weekends.</span> <span id="s2338">I would do, I would do the whole thing in one day.</span> <span id="s2339">I remember, I would do the 50, 50 miles a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: But how would you keep the food?</span> <span id="s2341">There’s no electric, there’s no…</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: The balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: I see, outside.</span> <span id="s2344">And in the summer, then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: You ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: You just ate it fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: It isn’t that warm in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: I remember when we first, when I was first married and we had a maid.</span> <span id="s2350">We had to have… I had an American husband; we had a magnificent apartment overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens.</span> <span id="s2351">And he absolutely insisted we have an icebox.</span> <span id="s2352">I had never heard of that.</span> <span id="s2353">So, we had an icebox.</span> <span id="s2354">She said, “What are we going to put in it?”</span> <span id="s2355">I still remember, “Madame Nicole, what are we going to put in the icebox to please Mr. John?”</span> <span id="s2356">So, we would think, and we would find something to put in the icebox to please the American.</span> <span id="s2357">But she would put… You see, they had those, those things in the windows.</span> <span id="s2358">To this day, if you go to Paris to an old apartment, in the kitchen, there is an opening in the window in the kitchen and it is sort of a meshed window, and all the food was there.</span> <span id="s2359">That’s… the refrigeration, and it works for them.</span> <span id="s2360">For that sort of very moderate weather, it works.</span> <span id="s2361">And then also you have the shops.</span> <span id="s2362">You shop everyday.</span> <span id="s2363">It’s a different way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: So, when do you get an inkling that the Germans are finished?</span> <span id="s2365">Only when the Americans march in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: When we saw the rubber tire.</span> <span id="s2367">The Americans were overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2368">When you saw them come down the Champs Elysées, you know that it could not be resisted.</span> <span id="s2369">In a, in a different way… it was a maelstrom of strength and a fresh strength.</span> <span id="s2370">By that time, the Germans were beaten.</span> <span id="s2371">They were down to their last troops, to their youngest soldiers.</span> <span id="s2372">They were demoralized…</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: And you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: And you could see that in the type of soldiers that they would send in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Now, you said earlier that you tried to stop people who were throwing… were spitting at the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: At… that was at the liberation of Paris.</span> <span id="s2377">What was the name of the…?</span> <span id="s2378">There is still that hotel.</span> <span id="s2379">There is the Arch of Triumph and then there is a street… L’Attala… No, not l’Attala; it was another name.</span> <span id="s2380">There was a huge hotel facing the Champs Elysées and the Arch of Triumph at an angle.</span> <span id="s2381">And that’s when I saw, all that, and then the Avenue Foche and that… They were marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Am, am I correct that you also saw women whose heads had been shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: And what did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: And I protected them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: You protected them?</span> <span id="s2387">From what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: Yes, from that.</span> <span id="s2389">I shamed the people who was doing it because they were wrong.</span> <span id="s2390">There were the same ones who would sleep with the Americans.</span> <span id="s2391">They would sleep with, they would sleep with… These were not the, the ugly fighters.</span> <span id="s2392">They were just easy to catch and it was ugly and it was demeaning of the people who did it as well as the people, and it was very ugly to watch…very ugly to watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: But it happened all over…</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: And it… and the people who were doing it probably were the people who had done nothing to resist the German occupation.</span> <span id="s2395">But they hit on… maybe they were worthless but it was nonsensical; it was beside the point.</span> <span id="s2396">And they marched them the same way that they marched the young soldiers with their hands on their… head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: That they did it in public, it was very humiliating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: Again around at the Arch of Triumph, the same route.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: So, the time was ugly, the time after was ugly…</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: There were… Yes, I don’t want to give you the impression that the whole life was ugly.</span> <span id="s2401">But those were very ugly scenes.</span> <span id="s2402">It seems that people took their worst possible feelings and they had a way of expressing those very ugly feelings.</span> <span id="s2403">And they took an opportunity and it hit at the wrong target.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: Did anyone threaten you when you tried… when you were protecting these women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: They were ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: They were ashamed at what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2410">I saw Arletty, you know, the… the great actress who… She had a fabulous word, they shaved her head.</span> <span id="s2411">She slept with Stülpnagel, was the name of the general in charge of France.</span> <span id="s2412">And her answer was, “Mon cœur est à la France, mais mon con est internationale.”</span> <span id="s2413">And I thought that was good.</span> <span id="s2414">My heart belongs to France, but my cunt is international.</span> <span id="s2415">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: [Laughing] Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: That is sort of a woman who… she would have… So, she slept with a general occupying the… She would have slept with an American general if he had been more than that rubber tire ________.</span> <span id="s2418">She would have been better than many.</span> <span id="s2419">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: [Laughs] So, what is it like, those first few months of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: [Sighs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: It’s still not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: No, but who cares about the physical when you are 21?</span> <span id="s2424">It was…</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Actually, you’re a little older by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: By now ’40, 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: 23, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: And I don’t accept the, the, the couvre-feu was still at midnight.</span> <span id="s2429">They kept, they kept you out of the streets at night.</span> <span id="s2430">The streets were dangerous.</span> <span id="s2431">But your dates – my dates always took me home.</span> <span id="s2432">I remember, my mother was waiting on the balcony, so they all knew that; they stopped at the corner of the street, because my mother was going to pounce on them.</span> <span id="s2433">[Laughs] It was fun.</span> <span id="s2434">Yeah, I didn’t…We didn’t think in those terms.</span> <span id="s2435">We didn’t think in terms of – it’s now that we’re thinking in those terrible terms.</span> <span id="s2436">We just lived with it and were swallowed by it.</span> <span id="s2437">The same way when I look at the Martin Luther King thing, this is history at the time.</span> <span id="s2438">You live through it; we didn’t make such a point of saying, “This is the march of the…this is the year where we are beginning to end this sort of racial…” You don’t think in those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: The war is not finally over, however, when France is liberated, when Paris is liberated.</span> <span id="s2440">There’s still…there’s still time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: Then the Battle of the Bulge comes in.</span> <span id="s2442">Then we party.</span> <span id="s2443">What happens… but what was very interesting is that you never stopped the partying.</span> <span id="s2444">What happened is that it was everybody brings, so everybody brought something.</span> <span id="s2445">And if you didn’t have much, you didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s2446">You had the party and you had the dancing, you had the music, you had the youth.</span> <span id="s2447">And then you walked home.</span> <span id="s2448">It’s walkable, again.</span> <span id="s2449">You can you go to a party practically – and also the people, you know, are all in the same milieu, so they live… I can circumscribe Paris.</span> <span id="s2450">Somebody, oh, Mendes-France is having a boulevard named after him in the 13th.</span> <span id="s2451">I don’t even know where is the 13th in the city.</span> <span id="s2452">I never set foot in the place.</span> <span id="s2453">The 4th arrondissement is where the Marais is; that one there, never again.</span> <span id="s2454">I know 14th, the 15th, the 16th, the 17th is wealthy but I never go, the 18th is Montmartre, I never set foot in it, and the 19th is where the young live now but it’s awful.</span> <span id="s2455">The 20th and 21st, never heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: So you went…</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: And again, the Opera, I mean, it is small and you can see that you really, when you think of it, you go to Tuileries Garden, it’s the same, very circumscribe arrondissement.</span> <span id="s2458">I’m not a specialist in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s2460">So, you partied?</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: Sure, everybody partied.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: Including people who were more adult than you, older?</span> <span id="s2463">Your mother?</span> <span id="s2464">That generation?</span> <span id="s2465">No, not…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: It was, oh no, no, no, no, no, I’m talking about the 20-year-olds.</span> <span id="s2467">No, because, then you had to go… Then, you had to walk home… You have to walk home, because it’s really pitch dark.</span> <span id="s2468">There’s the blackout, and the blackout means that you see nothing in the street.</span> <span id="s2469">And you don’t have any electric light or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Now…</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: So, you tripped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: [Laughs] So, you have to be young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Yes, it’s, it’s for, it’s for the young.</span> <span id="s2474">You don’t find anybody past their 40’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Does the organization of your life changed drastically when the Americans come in?</span> <span id="s2476">Obviously, you’re… you’re free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: Because of my mother, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: That was lifted, she was safe, I mean, we all…</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q: So you didn’t have to worry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: No.</span> <span id="s2482">That’s a huge change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2484">And is your aunt still with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Oh, sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: So they’re all the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: You know, lived all through their lives together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Together.</span> <span id="s2489">So, now you know you can go out and party and do what you will?</span> <span id="s2490">You don’t have to worry about anything happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Well, I could – I always did go out and party, except now the worry is lifted.</span> <span id="s2492">But I never was that much of a worrier.</span> <span id="s2493">My brother was more the worrier than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Did he come back to Paris once the Americans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: No, he settled in Normandy.</span> <span id="s2496">He wanted… I wanted to be a small fish in a big town; he liked to be a huge fish in a very small town.</span> <span id="s2497">So he settled in the provinces where I would never set foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: And where was his, where was his wife and child at the time?</span> <span id="s2499">Did they go with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2501">They bought a big estate and settled and bought a big mansion and settled private hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: But where was his wife and child during the war?</span> <span id="s2503">‘Cause he had left and gone across to the Pyrenees, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: Well, he wasn’t married then.</span> <span id="s2505">That was ’40.</span> <span id="s2506">That was…</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: That was the coming… the moving in of the army.</span> <span id="s2509">He married in ’42, ’43…</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: But during the war, he married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: And he had children during the war.</span> <span id="s2514">Since they were playing with us at the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: And so, when was the first time you saw your brother after 1940? ’</span> <span id="s2516">44? ’</span> <span id="s2517">45?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: He came back [laughs]… I remember, when it is over, him coming back.</span> <span id="s2519">He had had – I saw it somewhere in an article recently – he had had one towel for the whole time when he was out, so he used the same towel.</span> <span id="s2520">It was so dirty, it was stiff!</span> <span id="s2521">He brought it back!</span> <span id="s2522">That’s what I remember of his return.</span> <span id="s2523">But he returned in maybe ’42, ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2525">So before the liberation he returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Oh, yes, since he was, he was a doctor, so he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2528">That’s ‘cause he was coming everyday to make sure that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: He was again…what do you call that?</span> <span id="s2530">A horse?</span> <span id="s2531">A running horse… He was intern, you know.</span> <span id="s2532">To be intern in medicine is more than to be an extern, or to be just a plain doctor.</span> <span id="s2533">He was really competitive and very good at, at his job, so he was completely safe.</span> <span id="s2534">He was named Michel Denier and he…</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: Did he have a baptism certificate too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: He didn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: He didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: No, but he had been with the, the… He had been a scout and that was with the Protestants.</span> <span id="s2539">And the Protestants, the moment they tried to touch him, they pounced back and said, “Not at all, he has been a scout since he was the age of nine, don’t touch him”.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: So, he was protected by the Protestants and I was protected by the Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: And your mother was, who knows?</span> <span id="s2543">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: [Laughs] She swam through, probably didn’t know how to swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: All right, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: How, how did it happen that you started working in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s2549">What, what… was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: In fact, there were five girls – because we were all in our… between 20 and 25 – who were chosen by the French government to thank them for their work in the war, to go to Switzerland, which was paradise and chocolate, to take care of the remnants of people from the camps.</span> <span id="s2551">They landed… they couldn’t… they were untrans-… People could not be transported.</span> <span id="s2552">They were too sick to be sent to their country of origin, were sent to Switzerland, and who had… which had remained nastily… neutral during the war.</span> <span id="s2553">They are still fighting the issue in 2003.</span> <span id="s2554">But they were “neutral” during the war, but at least they offered the hospitals.</span> <span id="s2555">They had fantastically modern hospitals, in particular in Davos, that you see now on the T.V., which is a ski resort, agreed, but it had best tubercular hospitals in Europe.</span> <span id="s2556">And so they accepted… the stretcher cases were sent from the camp to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2557">And I was sent to Switzerland to take the… to wait until they were no longer stretcher cases and then transport them back to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: How were you five chosen?</span> <span id="s2559">Who… This is in… This is in ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: That was after the… ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: This is ’45.</span> <span id="s2562">So who chooses you?</span> <span id="s2563">I mean, what… who in the government knows that you’re doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: Oh, I had a boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: Who was high in government.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Do you want to name him or you don’t want to name him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: He was named Jean Iliovissy (ph) and now he’s working at the U.N., probably is dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: So, he mentioned your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: Well, I had a reputation; I had the papers, I had the figures to prove.</span> <span id="s2571">But he pushed certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: So the… is… you had not met your husband to be yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: No I met him, I met him in December ’46.</span> <span id="s2574">No, December ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: So this is…</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">A: ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">Q: This is’45 and you’re in Switzerland for about six months, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: Yes, six months.</span> <span id="s2579">I was working in Geneva and then Saint Martin (ph) and then Davos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: And what were you supposed to do for these folks, these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: I was what you call a social worker.</span> <span id="s2582">My job was as vague as the job of a social worker, which infuriates my daughter, who’s an active lawyer.</span> <span id="s2583">I was a social worker, so I’d would vi-… visit them, cheer them up…take them out, make them walk, and… visit with them.</span> <span id="s2584">I was with them when they died and I encouraged them to go out, walk and get back into life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: These were not just French… These weren’t French citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: They were all French citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: At that time, they were all French citizens.</span> <span id="s2589">They were – no, excuse me, there were a few other nationalities, but almost all of them were French.</span> <span id="s2590">And some of them had tuberculosis and some of them were completely emaciated.</span> <span id="s2591">I probably fell in love with one.</span> <span id="s2592">It was absolutely glorious.</span> <span id="s2593">Switzerland can be glorious.</span> <span id="s2594">I didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s2595">They would, they would say… what did they say?</span> <span id="s2596">They had such a terrible sentence.</span> <span id="s2597">“One of your… one of your deportees…” Oh, what happened is that they stole.</span> <span id="s2598">They came back from the camp and they had been hungry, and they were in the land of plenty and you would put a marvelous table and they stole from each other.</span> <span id="s2599">And it was almost instinctive and they did.</span> <span id="s2600">And the Swiss, I remember them saying to me, “One of you deportees has stolen again.”</span> <span id="s2601">And it really hurt me because it was a complete misunderstanding of who they were.</span> <span id="s2602">They were like animals; they had been hungry for so long that they couldn’t resist.</span> <span id="s2603">You had to have the understanding that the Swiss didn’t.</span> <span id="s2604">But they had the food.</span> <span id="s2605">And the fresh air.</span> <span id="s2606">So that they got better.</span> <span id="s2607">And they had very good hospitals, very good hospitals, and the hospital care was great.</span> <span id="s2608">And my job was to be, you know, to come in the room and be fresh and available.</span> <span id="s2609">And some to them would die and I would call the family and be there when they died and comfort the family and be present at the funeral.</span> <span id="s2610">The presence was enormous for them at the time, a friendly presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: And there were five of you from Paris doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: There were five young women doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: No, they were sent to different…</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Ah, they were sent to different places.</span> <span id="s2616">And you were the one sent to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: I was the one sent to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: And what happened to the boy you had fallen in love with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: I… euh…he died very recently.</span> <span id="s2620">I kept in touch.</span> <span id="s2621">I became very friendly to his wife.</span> <span id="s2622">He was a marvelous fellow.</span> <span id="s2623">He was not a Jewish deportee, he was a political deportee.</span> <span id="s2624">And he wasn’t from Auschwitz; he was from Mauthausen, which was second worst.</span> <span id="s2625">Those were death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: So, you’re there in ’45.</span> <span id="s2627">Have you yet seen photographs, newsreels of anything that happened in…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: In Switzerland?</span> <span id="s2629">[Shakes head]</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Before you went, nothing?</span> <span id="s2631">So, the knowledge that you have is from people telling you what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">A: And dealing with them, seeing the way they look and seeing them die.</span> <span id="s2633">The amplitude of it was there because they had suffered it.</span> <span id="s2634">But I had volunteered to be taking care of children survivors and that’s because there were no children survivors that I had been sent as a sort of compensation to take care of other people who had survived.</span> <span id="s2635">Then I would accompany the convoy back to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: You mean, when people would get well, that you would…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">A: When they were feeling well, then I would…</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: You would take them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Take them like a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: But you wanted to take care of children, but there were no children…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: There were none.</span> <span id="s2642">I was told there were none, there were not.</span> <span id="s2643">When you look at history there were not convoys of surviving cases taken care of by the Swiss.</span> <span id="s2644">There were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: There were hidden children, but they obviously didn’t come to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: And why did you stop working in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s2648">You were there for six… Was it only for a certain period of time, or everybody from France was okay, or unfortunately had died and then you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: Yeah, after six months…</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: Did you then meet you husband or is it then that you were with UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: It was… in December ’45 that I met John for… It was at the end of… It was after my return.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: From Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: And you fell in love with him… quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Right off, as well.</span> <span id="s2656">But then the other one was in my life, and they met in the subway.</span> <span id="s2657">I remember, they didn’t like each other at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: The two men you were involved with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: Yes, the deportee…</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2661">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: They didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s2663">I still remember the meeting.</span> <span id="s2664">They met in the subway, they greeted each other.</span> <span id="s2665">But there was no…</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: But they didn’t like each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: And did you like John immediately better then you liked this other guy?</span> <span id="s2669">Or were you not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: The other guy lasted in my life a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: In my life, I mean, not in actuality, but in flirting.</span> <span id="s2673">Because he had been a real hero and that he had a halo that John didn’t have.</span> <span id="s2674">John spending one night on the beaches, it was enough for him, you know, he absolutely loathes discomfort.</span> <span id="s2675">I don’t think he was ever without a real breakfast once in his life.</span> <span id="s2676">But he still will talk about that night on the sand.</span> <span id="s2677">And I told you that he would, he would burn a tree and he’d burn the furniture to be warm.</span> <span id="s2678">No, he was no great hero.</span> <span id="s2679">But one reason I married John was that he was a strong character.</span> <span id="s2680">He came from Tulsa and he was a conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s2681">And in… He had one of his closest friends, I mentioned to you, that Mauricio Freidman, who was a genius, a Jew, was also a conscientious objector, but he was for religious reasons and John was for philosophical reasons.</span> <span id="s2682">And in Tulsa, they said, “Philosophical reasons, five years of hard labor.”</span> <span id="s2683">So you went to the, the prison where the assassin is, wherever, a prison in Oklahoma, which is the pits.</span> <span id="s2684">And he spent one year there.</span> <span id="s2685">And he got to the library and he started organizing the coming of the books to read.</span> <span id="s2686">He thought he would cover a lot of reading in five years.</span> <span id="s2687">And then he was pardoned, and in one day, he was shipped overseas.</span> <span id="s2688">So, that’s the way, you know.</span> <span id="s2689">But then he had, he had done something with his life.</span> <span id="s2690">And he is quite a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: How was he shipped if he was a conscientious objector?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Because they pardoned him.</span> <span id="s2693">They first condemned him for hard labor, and then, after a year, or whoever was the President pardoned him, they got him; the same day, he was shipped overseas to England and then from England to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: So, you figured this was strong character.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: Well he, he was.</span> <span id="s2696">He was and I told you the way he understood the suffering of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: How do you understand…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: And he would hide, he would hide rations.</span> <span id="s2699">You know, we had those beautiful curtains, silk curtains.</span> <span id="s2700">And after John had gone out, we would look and there were those sardine boxes, hidden beneath the folds of the country curtains.</span> <span id="s2701">He was generous and he had a feeling for, for suffering, and he had never seen or done anything himself.</span> <span id="s2702">Except once, we went wherever it was, we went where they have the most… in San Francisco they have a terrible prison.</span> <span id="s2703">What was the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Alcatraz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: Alcatraz.</span> <span id="s2706">We went to Alcatraz.</span> <span id="s2707">We went with a group of judges and John was a top lawyer, and we were there with the judges.</span> <span id="s2708">And we were in a cell in Alcatraz.</span> <span id="s2709">And they put you in the cell individually and then they lock, to give you the feel of what it means to be a prisoner in Alcatraz.</span> <span id="s2710">And John said to me in passing, “I’m the only one in the crowd who knows what it is to be in a real prison with a locked door.”</span> <span id="s2711">For he had spent one year in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: What, what do you think is, what is it about John that enabled him to understand the suffering that you and your mother went through, or that… what happened?</span> <span id="s2713">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Do you call that a big heart?</span> <span id="s2715">I don’t, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2716">He’s a liberal at heart.</span> <span id="s2717">Anything that smacks of… imposing your will on you because of the race or anything… He was born a liberal, and his family, too.</span> <span id="s2718">His… our grandparents and his parents just adored each other.</span> <span id="s2719">They spoke not a word in common and they babbled away, Catholic grandparents.</span> <span id="s2720">It was a joke!</span> <span id="s2721">Well, my grandmother had been raised with some English, so she could speak a few words.</span> <span id="s2722">How you can go with people just on feelings without any vocabulary is amazing, gestures.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: So, did you see John for about a month in December?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Very little, very little.</span> <span id="s2725">I was heavily dating elsewhere, and it was absolutely spat at to date somebody in uniform in Paris.</span> <span id="s2726">We were… We’d go to a theater together; we received insults when we would come down the aisle.</span> <span id="s2727">Really, insults.</span> <span id="s2728">Because I was dating a soldier.</span> <span id="s2729">You just did not date the conquering soldier.</span> <span id="s2730">It was spat upon by the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: In spite of the fact that these were soldiers who had…</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Oh, the French never liked to be… It is not easy to be liberated by somebody that you do not respect intellectually, and also someone so new.</span> <span id="s2733">To this day I’m getting the articles about how, the same thing, they think we are young and innocent in a bad sense of the word.</span> <span id="s2734">So, they were very… antagonistic.</span> <span id="s2735">So, when we would go out outside, it was courage to go out with a then-American soldier because you did get passing insults.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: So, did you ask him not to wear his uniform?</span> <span id="s2737">Or he had to wear his uniform all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: Well, of course, and I… He was liberating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: Did he propose to you very quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: He proposed to me very quickly, if you count… He stayed three weeks in France and then they were shipped back to the States.</span> <span id="s2741">That had been from… He was gone by the time of 27th of January; he left around middle January.</span> <span id="s2742">So, if you count the time where I am very busy dating, it’s December to the third week of January.</span> <span id="s2743">And then he said he was interested.</span> <span id="s2744">And then, again, we hadn’t touched each other; we hadn’t even kissed on the cheek.</span> <span id="s2745">He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and what happened and what is what I deeply believe in – I don’t know that my children do, but, but that’s their lives – I believe that to marry somebody you have to have the same political opinions, if not religious opinions.</span> <span id="s2746">We were both at ease, and both left – not too far left, but for the poor.</span> <span id="s2747">Okay?</span> <span id="s2748">You have two things in common, you have it made.</span> <span id="s2749">With Toulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right.</span> <span id="s2750">As we said to each other, “We don’t need to go out for election, we stay home” and we would cancel each other.</span> <span id="s2751">We cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with somebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth.</span> <span id="s2752">So that counted a lot.</span> <span id="s2753">We were really very close, so I said, “No, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise, anybody in uniform.”</span> <span id="s2754">I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German uniform, the American uniform.</span> <span id="s2755">“You go back home and come back dressed properly.”</span> <span id="s2756">So, he went back to wherever it was in the States, got demobilized, got into his uniform and then he came back.</span> <span id="s2757">Then he came back and he rang the bell.</span> <span id="s2758">And my mother, who had cried – Oh, he sent to me from… He came back by boat; at the time we didn’t have the planes – So, he sent me a telegram and said, “Reserve the 14th.</span> <span id="s2759">Signed, the Huron” which is the critical term that Voltaire has for guys from the Pampa.</span> <span id="s2760">And he came back… Oh, do my dates make sense?</span> <span id="s2761">He left in December, we wrote to each other, he came back on the 13th of July and the 13th in the evening we were then engaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: You mean in January he came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">Q: Oh, he came back months later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">A: He comes… he came back…</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Six months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: Six months later it took him time to get…</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: Not only out of uniform, to get a job.</span> <span id="s2770">So, he got a job at the same hotel where they… that had been occupied with the Germans, was then occupied by the Americans and he got a job as an assistant to the Brigadier General, whatever, in charge of American things in Paris.</span> <span id="s2771">And then he had a job and then the day he was back, we had got engaged.</span> <span id="s2772">I never believed in waiting.</span> <span id="s2773">As I said, there is an element of luck, and also, don’t let it pass by – grab it.</span> <span id="s2774">So we did.</span> <span id="s2775">And the 13th or the 14th we were engaged.</span> <span id="s2776">And when we were married, the French did not like at all officially the idea that a French woman would marry an American, not done.</span> <span id="s2777">So they had us wait and the first date we could get was in September, so we were married in September ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: It’s an amazing story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: Is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s2781">You hardly know this person!</span> <span id="s2782">You spent…</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">A: I knew the essential.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Clearly.</span> <span id="s2785">That was… you…</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: Okay, you had the physical attraction.</span> <span id="s2787">I found him handsome… He was making himself available.</span> <span id="s2788">He was very interested.</span> <span id="s2789">And we had the same opinion: no God.</span> <span id="s2790">And the same democratic of the left political view and what there is to, so jump in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: And he seemed a sweet person...and a generous person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: And also, also very kind, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: Yes, so your mother liked him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: Oh, my mother when he called back, no she was de-…devastated at the idea that he was an American.</span> <span id="s2795">It’s 3,000 or 6,000 miles away, her daughter, her only daughter.</span> <span id="s2796">She had lived with us, you know.</span> <span id="s2797">We were extremely close.</span> <span id="s2798">So, when he called, she had opened – she was completely without decency of fear.</span> <span id="s2799">She had opened the telegram and I had read it right around, so obviously she knew he was coming back.</span> <span id="s2800">But when he called to ask for the appointment, she said, “Oh, what a surprise!”</span> <span id="s2801">And he laughed because he knew she was laughing… er, she was lying.</span> <span id="s2802">But she knew I was going to be happy and it was nice, it was important for her.</span> <span id="s2803">She had had such a terrible… Oh, at first she would say, “Oh,” she would say, “it’s only one month.”</span> <span id="s2804">Then she would say, “Oh, it’s only three months.”</span> <span id="s2805">Then after that she stopped saying, “It’s only…” She knew it was going to work out.</span> <span id="s2806">And then she became very fond of him, yes.</span> <span id="s2807">And when she died... she wanted him to, I mean, later on in life when she wasn’t feeling well at all, she was as much interested in having him come back to see her as she was in me coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: That’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Yeah, he was a good – and he still is – a good fellow, yeah.</span> <span id="s2810">It’s not easy to live 60 years together.</span> <span id="s2811">Mostly tail years, tail end years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: What is – what was that, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: The tail end years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: The tail end are difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: Are not that easy… part of the game.</span> <span id="s2816">So, it’s a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: What language did you have between you, French?</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: I never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: [Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: I… Don’t ask me, because sometimes it’s English and sometimes it’s French.</span> <span id="s2821">He would say that it is more French because it flatters him.</span> <span id="s2822">But I think it’s mostly English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: Did you, did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: Not a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: When you met, not a word?</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: No, but I read fluently.</span> <span id="s2827">With my background… The French background of school, schooling was very bizarre.</span> <span id="s2828">You studied language but not a word of spoken language, all literature.</span> <span id="s2829">So I knew the grammar.</span> <span id="s2830">I knew the literature very well.</span> <span id="s2831">And I remember that I expressed myself with a great difficulty.</span> <span id="s2832">I practically didn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s2833">But when you have the grammar the vocabulary and what else?</span> <span id="s2834">And it comes.</span> <span id="s2835">Three months in the country and you speak fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: But when you met in France…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Then he spoke French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: He spoke… and he was fluent in French, clearly… Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Yeah, I mean he has… as our children say, “Both our parents have an accent.”</span> <span id="s2840">I have an accent and he has an accent in French.</span> <span id="s2841">They don’t; they are fluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: They are fluent.</span> <span id="s2843">When did you work for UNRRA in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: UNRRA?</span> <span id="s2845">UNRRA is after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s2847">Is that, was that between the time you meet John and you get married or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: UNRRA sent something to me, I didn’t work for UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: People in my family did, but I didn’t, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s2851">Which is it’s very… What does it spell out?</span> <span id="s2852">United…</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">Q: That you were visiting survivors in hospitals?</span> <span id="s2854">Maybe, maybe only, that you only did that in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">A: Only in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: Only in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: So then, in between the time you meet John and he comes back, are you working?</span> <span id="s2859">You’ve come back from Switzerland…</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: I probably was teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2862">So you went back to teaching?</span> <span id="s2863">And when he came and you got married, where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: 187 Boulevard St-Michel, above the École des Mines, above the Luxembourg Garden.</span> <span id="s2865">We were the…</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: So it’s near where, where your mother was living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2868">We sometimes lived with her at first, but as soon as we could, we got our own apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: So where was she living now?</span> <span id="s2870">The old apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: My mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">A: During… She was still living in the old apartment.</span> <span id="s2874">During the time when we lived in Boulevard St-Michel she was visiting us for dinner or… but keeping us… I mean, we were very private; we didn’t live with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">Q: Yeah, but when you were growing up, you were living near Luxembourg…</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">A: Up ‘til 12 years of age, then at Vaugirard and that’s where I was caught by the Germans with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2878">So how long… You are in Paris with John until 1948?</span> <span id="s2879">For two years?</span> <span id="s2880">Three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s2882">Yes, and then we came back in ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: And was it good living in Paris?</span> <span id="s2884">I mean, your mother must have been very happy that you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">A: I guess!</span> <span id="s2886">We were living in Boulevard St-Michel, we had a maid, I had all my friends.</span> <span id="s2887">Yes, it was great.</span> <span id="s2888">It was difficult to let go…</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: To leave!</span> <span id="s2890">Yeah, I would think…</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: Yeah, it was a great sacrifice.</span> <span id="s2892">Mostly, when you consider my culture, my background, that was huge.</span> <span id="s2893">But you don’t realize it until afterwards.</span> <span id="s2894">I don’t think anybody would do it now.</span> <span id="s2895">Not with my background.</span> <span id="s2896">I offered for him to stay there and work there and find a job, but he didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: He didn’t want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: No, he should have, but that’s after the fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: And wh-…</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: He had no studies finished.</span> <span id="s2901">I had earned my degree already, I was already teaching.</span> <span id="s2902">He was just a student studying at University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s2903">He had… He wanted to enter law school and he wanted to go to Chicago Law School.</span> <span id="s2904">So, happily, I have enough degrees and good records that immediately I kept ________, so I went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: So you left and…</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: But Chicago, I tell you, when we are in Chicago, he had made a mistake and he drove through a slum area, and to come from Paris and think you are going to live your life… It was a mistake, but it was still overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: He… You… so he drove you through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">A: No, it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s2909">He took the wrong turn.</span> <span id="s2910">We lived by the university, which isn’t that…</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">A: …glorious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: But at least it was an apartment, you know, a graduate student apartment, which was decent.</span> <span id="s2915">Although the neighborhood isn’t very great.</span> <span id="s2916">But it’s mostly nowadays.</span> <span id="s2917">It was all right back then.</span> <span id="s2918">But those slums--from Chicago, I don’t know if you know them.</span> <span id="s2919">They are, they are worse than Harlem by a long…</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2924">Was your mother very upset when you decided that you were going – both going – to leave Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">A: Of course, she must have been.</span> <span id="s2926">But she was enough of a good mother to realize that by that time, we had been deeply married, and we were really kicking, so that was more meaningful for her.</span> <span id="s2927">Also, his mother came to visit, and although again there was a complete barrier of language, they liked each other, and she liked how, you know, learned and sedate the mother was.</span> <span id="s2928">Sort of give her the idea of the stability that she absolutely had not had in her love life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: So you, you ended up having something that she wished she had had, but she never wanted to destroy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: Oh, no she would not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: She did not…</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: She would not interfere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: And it’s extraordinary because she was completely… she didn’t know the word of discretion.</span> <span id="s2935">You know, when, when we lived together, there was that master bedroom that was the end of a long hall – they are specialist of long halls.</span> <span id="s2936">That’s the only places where they put theirs clothes is in the long halls.</span> <span id="s2937">And then, then the bath, she would barge in any time, never thought of it.</span> <span id="s2938">Don’t forget, she had been without a man for all her life.</span> <span id="s2939">She did not know what married life meant.</span> <span id="s2940">Or, either she was nosy, or she was very indiscreet.</span> <span id="s2941">Both of them, true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: So, you come to Chicago and you… John goes to law school.</span> <span id="s2943">Am I correct?</span> <span id="s2944">Or he finishes his B.A.…</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: Goes to law school and I am accepted for a… with a teaching fellowship for a doctorate in Ancient Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: Ancient Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: And we live in a graduate student apartment.</span> <span id="s2948">Which is not bad.</span> <span id="s2949">And I learned to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: You finally get into a kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">A: I have to.</span> <span id="s2952">John was in charge – we shared always, to this day, we do share – so, at the time, he was in charge of the dishes and I was in charge of the cooking.</span> <span id="s2953">And now, I’m trying to make him in charge of the cooking.</span> <span id="s2954">‘Cause I think it’s, I think it’s more constructive for old age.</span> <span id="s2955">It’s more stimulating for him.</span> <span id="s2956">I take over the cleaning up and the dishes, which is not much fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: Was this the first time you were in a kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: Where, in Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s2961">I didn’t make a huge point of it but I have – I have pictures – I might send you one, where it is obviously he in the kitchen and not I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: Did you like being in the kitchen?</span> <span id="s2963">Did you like cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: I had a gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: You had a gift?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: My mother, grandmother was a good cook, I told you my mother was a good cook and I turned out to be a good cook.</span> <span id="s2967">I, yes, I like it because I like to entertain.</span> <span id="s2968">So to this day, we have friends and I cook.</span> <span id="s2969">And all the friends know that I am a good cook, so it’s a pleasure to come.</span> <span id="s2970">Good conversation and good food, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: It can’t be better.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: And why Ancient Greek?</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: It was the field I was the least proficient in.</span> <span id="s2975">And when I came here I was so proficient in French and in Latin that it would have been ridiculous for me to… And I am glad because it’s a one-on-one – at that level, it’s a one-on-one relationship for the PhD.</span> <span id="s2976">So, it would have been devastating to have a relationship – and they were… I didn’t like them very much.</span> <span id="s2977">And they… the little bit of the relationship I had, they already were very resentful that I was so superior.</span> <span id="s2978">I mean, you think of it, I had had fourteen years of Greek by the time I reached Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Fourteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Fourteen, because you start in quatorzième, quinzième, seizième, philosophie and then I went through all the competitive...</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: So, you’re saying that the other students were resentful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: Yes, and the teachers also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: The teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: I didn’t get along at all well.</span> <span id="s2985">You know, I had to have special – for a PhD, you have to have, whatever you call it, in each field.</span> <span id="s2986">You have to have an exam and the French person didn’t like it, didn’t like me, I felt.</span> <span id="s2987">It was very difficult to teach me.</span> <span id="s2988">What is he going to teach me?</span> <span id="s2989">I remember, I showed some authors and he… he wasn’t interested in them.</span> <span id="s2990">I wasn’t the run-of-the-mill student that he was expecting.</span> <span id="s2991">But – and those were the rough years.</span> <span id="s2992">The weather was… Talk about yesterday, you know.</span> <span id="s2993">That plus was the day in and day out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: Cold, very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: Oh, biting cold and we, we had to cross the Midway.</span> <span id="s2996">And I told you, that’s one thing I don’t like is cold.</span> <span id="s2997">And you could not escape it without a car in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">Q: So, Chicago was much colder, even though it was extremely uncomfortable during the war.</span> <span id="s2999">It was not this cold, or was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: Paris, [laughs] when they say they have a cold wave, it’s a joke.</span> <span id="s3001">I told you, there is one inch of snow and the Luxembourg will close its gates.</span> <span id="s3002">And they take pictures of all the museums with the little statue with a crummy little inch on the shoulders of the statue and they have a snowstorm.</span> <span id="s3003">No, so even in the depth of it, Paris is livable.</span> <span id="s3004">Chicago was, was really biting cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: Were there… I’m assuming there were very few women PhD students in 1948, even in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3006">You must have been not only a superior student in Ancient Greek, but there weren’t, women were not going and getting… a lot of people weren’t going and getting PhDs.</span> <span id="s3007">But certainly not women, so you must have been…?</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: I was, we were isolated.</span> <span id="s3009">We were very self-sufficient and busy studying and I have pictures in that student apartment where I with my great dictionaries and John with his law studies.</span> <span id="s3010">We were happy and self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s3011">I, I don’t… I had some…they had some war… He had a G.I. Bill.</span> <span id="s3012">We lived on that G.I. Bill.</span> <span id="s3013">And he had some friends in law school who lived in war… it was sort of huts in the middle of Midway.</span> <span id="s3014">And we thought it was paradise that they had a place.</span> <span id="s3015">You know, we, we had not really, in the States, a real apartment of our own.</span> <span id="s3016">But it never was a problem for me not having much to live on, as long as I had the books and studies and John.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: How long did it take you to get a PhD?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: I never finished it.</span> <span id="s3019">By that time, I was closing in and starting having to write a thesis since I passed all the exams, and I had to pass one in French, which I remember ‘cause John said it was a big joke ‘cause it took me a long time.</span> <span id="s3020">He didn’t realize it was a test on my English, not just my French.</span> <span id="s3021">Dr. Smith took off and I was left in the lurch, and at that point, I said, “Look, who needs it?</span> <span id="s3022">I have a certificate of proficiency in all the fields…” even in German – that’s when I studied German.</span> <span id="s3023">And if I had time, that’s what I would study.</span> <span id="s3024">I’m fascinated by deepening the German language.</span> <span id="s3025">I had to study German for the PhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German.</span> <span id="s3026">So, I passed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one.</span> <span id="s3027">Oh, I remember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course.</span> <span id="s3028">And I was distraught at the idea of coming from the war, having to study German, and he began to say something in German to the class and I utterly disliked it.</span> <span id="s3029">And he sensed it and he called me after class and he said, “Don’t you feel that way.</span> <span id="s3030">I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s3031">So, you don’t have to be so frightened of me.”</span> <span id="s3032">But I was delighted that I had only to write, to know how to read.</span> <span id="s3033">And I love the literature.</span> <span id="s3034">And I love the literature… I have to find those books.</span> <span id="s3035">Anybody that can find those books for me is my love.</span> <span id="s3036">There was a series of books, nine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates.</span> <span id="s3037">You, you have to realize that 75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots.</span> <span id="s3038">So, you start with the literature; it’s all written in German.</span> <span id="s3039">And you read the nine little books and at the end, you are reading German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">A: And there is no grammar at all; nine little books and no grammar.</span> <span id="s3042">You have the same in French.</span> <span id="s3043">I think I have the French series.</span> <span id="s3044">And it’s a very clever way of doing it ‘cause you get yourself into it without noticing it.</span> <span id="s3045">Then you’ll be able to read it.</span> <span id="s3046">So I read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">Q: Your professor left University of Chicago and they had no replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">A: No, no replacement.</span> <span id="s3049">She was taking a break, but it was really not a moral thing to do.</span> <span id="s3050">She shouldn’t have in the middle of the year then that…</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: Right and with only one, one PhD student.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: [Laughs] Well, that’s probably why she took the pretext that there wasn’t much for her to stay.</span> <span id="s3053">So, I didn’t miss it, you know; I always went by without…All – It’s called All But the Thesis…</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">Q: A.B.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">A: A.B.D., whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">Q: And you, did you stay in Chicago or you moved elsewhere?</span> <span id="s3057">Did you move east or west?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: I always found a jobs and we moved with my jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A: So I wrote and found and we moved wherever I found.</span> <span id="s3061">And I wrote to the University of Maryland and hop!</span> <span id="s3062">they jumped at me.</span> <span id="s3063">So I began teaching at Maryland and we came to the area, and that’s the way we started.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: And did you love teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A: Not at Maryland.</span> <span id="s3066">I don’t know if I dare say that.</span> <span id="s3067">The – their student body was very poor.</span> <span id="s3068">And the faculty wasn’t much higher.</span> <span id="s3069">Johns Hopkins was – I taught at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Studies – that was interesting – on Massachusetts Avenue.</span> <span id="s3070">American U. wasn’t very interesting either; the teachers were better but the students were still very mediocre.</span> <span id="s3071">There isn’t really… It is not really an area of great universities.</span> <span id="s3072">It’s not very stimulating.</span> <span id="s3073">But, by that time, I was teaching also in the daytime.</span> <span id="s3074">Those were only evening jobs, I told you, because by that time we supported both my mother and aunt in their retirement.</span> <span id="s3075">Their retirement from government was very pitiful so we supplemented it.</span> <span id="s3076">And I was teaching during the daytime at Mount Vernon College and I – The Greek died, the Latin died, the French at that time began to die off.</span> <span id="s3077">And they said, “What are we going to do with you?”</span> <span id="s3078">I said, “There is one thing you don’t have.”</span> <span id="s3079">It was ’63.</span> <span id="s3080">“It’s a program of Continuing Education.”</span> <span id="s3081">And I opened in the area the first program of Continuing Education for – I called that for women and men.</span> <span id="s3082">And now the whole college is living out of its programs for women.</span> <span id="s3083">But it, there was no program for women at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">Q: Then how did you come to that?</span> <span id="s3085">That was a very new idea at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: Because I was going to lose my job.</span> <span id="s3087">“How did you come to that?”</span> <span id="s3088">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: [Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">A: That is a very good incentive.</span> <span id="s3091">I still have the first program.</span> <span id="s3092">I made it, pasted it by hand.</span> <span id="s3093">And I was very imaginative.</span> <span id="s3094">I started, I had started with non-credit courses and I had the most imaginative program in the city.</span> <span id="s3095">I had a friend of John, and he was a builder, you know, he had built his own house.</span> <span id="s3096">So, I had a course.</span> <span id="s3097">And I had another one, he was very good with tinkering with car, a course in auto-mechanics.</span> <span id="s3098">I had a course in home repairs at the time when, on Foxhall Road, you had, you had people flocking for the home repair.</span> <span id="s3099">And people flocking for the car repair course.</span> <span id="s3100">And I had, you know, the bet-… and I paid them very highly as I had been highly paid in France and they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s3101">It became humongously successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">Q: It was very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: It was a clever idea and I enjoyed it and they enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: And when did you have your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">A: I placed them.</span> <span id="s3106">I missed, I missed the summer months in both cases.</span> <span id="s3107">I was a teacher, so three months, that was perfect.</span> <span id="s3108">Missed both cases and I hit on Christmas.</span> <span id="s3109">So, I had two Christmas vacations and I had Silvia.</span> <span id="s3110">My daughter was born on the 21st of December, and I went back to school on the fourth.</span> <span id="s3111">I never missed a beat.</span> <span id="s3112">I went to the hospital – I was so pregnant you could have pushed me I would have rolled down the hill – and I had her without pain.</span> <span id="s3113">I mean, the children were the least problem of my life.</span> <span id="s3114">And when I had Olivier, the first one, in Paris, I was in the delivery room and John was outside and he heard the baby cry, and he stopped the nurse and said, “That was, there, there, what’s that?”</span> <span id="s3115">and she said, “You must be teasing me.</span> <span id="s3116">She’s been there for 15 minutes.”</span> <span id="s3117">He said, “Was there, is there another baby there?”</span> <span id="s3118">She said, “No, I checked and it was…” Fifteen minutes for one and no pain for the other.</span> <span id="s3119">I had lost the first one.</span> <span id="s3120">The first one of them all was… lost at birth.</span> <span id="s3121">It was an abnormal child, and it was devastating.</span> <span id="s3122">That was ’47, devastating to have an abnormal child.</span> <span id="s3123">It couldn’t be… it couldn’t be salvaged.</span> <span id="s3124">It was a spina bifida.</span> <span id="s3125">And they said now that the war deprivation, finally it got to me.</span> <span id="s3126">It was a lack of certain nutrients in my body, that I could not produce a child with a growth spine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3128">Wow!</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: That was difficult, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">A: But we didn’t miss a beat after that.</span> <span id="s3132">I waited because we had study years, and I couldn’t – I had to wait for five years – but then we did it after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: But 15 minutes for each.</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: Second, for the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: Still, even so.</span> <span id="s3136">That’s really…</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: And no pain for Silvia.</span> <span id="s3138">They would put in my room the other women to, to see what it was like to have a child without… thinking it was anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: And who took care of the child, your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">A: I had a maid, a black woman who was devotion… I had checked among my friends.</span> <span id="s3141">And I checked and we once visited a friend.</span> <span id="s3142">She had a nursemaid, an old maid that took care of the children, and when the maid left, the children had a tantrum and wanted to go with the maid.</span> <span id="s3143">I said, [kisses her finger] “This is the one for me.”</span> <span id="s3144">Never mind the degree of whatever the… That’s the recommendation and I had that one and she… we lived I don’t know where and at 7:30, I left the children knowing the she would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: And she was there until… I have pictures of her with Silvia.</span> <span id="s3147">She was there for years, and I had my mother-in-law living with us.</span> <span id="s3148">But she never lifted a finger, so it was Annie Mae who took care of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: I have two questions to ask you.</span> <span id="s3150">You’re born of a Jewish mother and a Catholic father.</span> <span id="s3151">I understand that you’re an atheist.</span> <span id="s3152">Do you have – if someone asks you what your background is – do you say you’re Catholic, do you say you’re Jewish, or do you say you’re nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: I say nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: Because it’s truly, it is nothing.</span> <span id="s3156">I cannot claim anything else.</span> <span id="s3157">I would lie to say I was raised a Catholic because I really… It was built on a false paper that I got when I was 21.</span> <span id="s3158">And Jewish, I… If you asked me where is a synagogue in Paris, I have no idea and no curiosity.</span> <span id="s3159">But if my children had married a Jew, I would have been perfectly satisfied.</span> <span id="s3160">I don’t even know what they married.</span> <span id="s3161">They married somebody who claims to be a Catholic but... And the other one married somebody interesting in that his father – she, she delved into pastor’s sons, she loved pastor’s sons, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s3162">She married the son of a pastor and her mother-in-law, the wife of a pastor, never set foot in the church, not even for the baptism of the children did she set foot in the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A: But I never ask what she believes or not but her husband is a pastor.</span> <span id="s3165">A delight, a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s3166">My son is divorced, but I remain friendly with his ex, who’s the mother of my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s3167">Also, I have an extremely bizarre trait, once I have loved somebody, I can’t stop.</span> <span id="s3168">I mean, you cannot pull the plug and say, “I am going to the next chapter of my life.</span> <span id="s3169">You drop this one, and I’m going to be in love with…”</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">Q: So, you have many loves in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">A: I have many people that I have loved for a long time and I hold on to them – not in a possessive way, because it’s so far away – but they are still meaningful.</span> <span id="s3172">I am not a person with different chapters and close doors.</span> <span id="s3173">I don’t close doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">Q: Does that come from your family you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">Q: Does that come from your family?</span> <span id="s3177">Is this how your family is?</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: No, remember, my mother…</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">Q: But your mother was forced to close a chapter in certain ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">A: Yeah, my father’s family… He left… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3181">It’s probably genetic, but I have no idea where it comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">Q: You never met your father.</span> <span id="s3183">You met the daughter, you met Jeannette.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">A: I tried to meet… It’s a big loss in my life.</span> <span id="s3185">At the end of the war, in ’47, you had the right to ask the Red Cross about anybody around the world, and they would contact that person and give you news and I asked about Pierre Denier.</span> <span id="s3186">I hadn’t heard about him since…’40.</span> <span id="s3187">I know in ’40, I was 18; when I was 18, he married somebody my age.</span> <span id="s3188">And he must have been an interesting character and I wanted to see him.</span> <span id="s3189">And I was told that he was dead.</span> <span id="s3190">And that was a big shock, I remember.</span> <span id="s3191">And they said he died of lung cancer.</span> <span id="s3192">And I had never, never even heard talk, anybody talk about the fellow, so I asked my mother, “Pierre Denier” – I never called him father, I always called him Pierre Denier if I mentioned him to anybody – “Pierre Denier, was he a smoker?”</span> <span id="s3193">She said, “Three packs a day,” but I knew nothing about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">Q: Did Jeannette help you to get…?</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">Q: Did his daughter that you met, your sister…</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">A: You mean Jeannette?</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">Q: Yes, Jeannette, did she give you some sense of what he was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">A: It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s3200">It’s interesting because I was very interested in what he was like.</span> <span id="s3201">And if you follow… If I follow the schedule, he married – he had many mistresses and then he married Jeannette’s mother, who is a delight, loved me, I mean, we wrote the letters and it was very funny.</span> <span id="s3202">And Jeannette said that Pierre Denier died when she was 10 months old.</span> <span id="s3203">And so we had one picture of Pierre Denier with Michelle as a baby on his shoulder, but he was at a casino – it was because of the game and the women that he was there.</span> <span id="s3204">And she made the comment – you asked the question – she made the comment, “Do you realize that, out of the three of us, Michelle is the only one who had had her picture with her father?”</span> <span id="s3205">He really is a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">Q: So, there is a picture of Michelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">A: But if you go to… if you go to, to Resistencia ___________ in Argentina there is a museum named after him, he became a big scientist.</span> <span id="s3208">He suddenly blossomed when he was there.</span> <span id="s3209">And it’s funny because I knew several divorced men who ended up in Argentina it was the wild pampa.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: For Nazis and for refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Maybe that, I mean, many people took refuge in the last frontier, and it is an extraordinary and huge country.</span> <span id="s3212">He felt free, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Let me ask you one last question.</span> <span id="s3214">I think it’s the last question.</span> <span id="s3215">Do, do you think that it… that there are… that there’s some effect of having been through the war and your experiences on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">A: That there is some effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: Effect on you from the war, that you, that you can piece together.</span> <span id="s3218">Did it change you in some way, did it…?</span> <span id="s3219">Or is it simply this is just part of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">A: You know what came to my mind?</span> <span id="s3221">What came to my mind is that it probably enriched my life.</span> <span id="s3222">To have thrown at you so many experiences that call for a reaction, it gets things out of you that probably would remain dormant and unused if not for the catastrophe.</span> <span id="s3223">Does it make any sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: Yes, it does.</span> <span id="s3225">Is there anything you’d like to say that you haven’t mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">A: [Shakes head] No, I think I am talked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: You think you’re talked out?</span> <span id="s3228">Well, I can’t thank you enough for…</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">A: I hope you get something out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: I, I did.</span> <span id="s3231">And I’m sure other people will.</span> <span id="s3232">And I’m really grateful.</span> <span id="s3233">You’re a wonderful storyteller and you have a great story to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">[Picture of Nicole as a young woman is shown]</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">Q: What’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">A: This is a picture of Nicole looking out of the window.</span> <span id="s3237">I was 11 or 12 years old.</span> <span id="s3238">My hair looks very nice but it’s a fake.</span> <span id="s3239">I pretended that my hair was naturally curly;
