the interviewer about an experience she had in a store).</span></p> <p><span id="s12">...Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s13">And, uhh, there was a saleslady and looked VERY familiar to me and I right away pictured her in that S.S. cap and a black, not a coat, was, uhh, cape.</span> <span id="s14">And I said, ‘yes, she’s the one who used to come with us out to the field.</span> <span id="s15">We were building an air field and, uhh, she wasn’t, sh –she wasn’t bad to us, except she has to watch us to work to make sure that we not stopping, and,uhh, we had a kapo from, from Walawas?</span> <span id="s16">Who spoke German and, uhh, she wanted to be nice to this S.S. woman, but she wouldn’t let her go near because she was afraid of a disease –the S.S. woman, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s17">But when I saw her in that store, and then a other, uhh, saleslady, a Jewish woman, they were talking about something, and she, the saleslady, the Jewish saleslady, was so happy that she said something to her that she liked, that she kissed her.</span> <span id="s18">And all of a sudden it, it came back to me and she was trying to go far from us being afraid so much, and here is this Jewish woman kissing her.</span> <span id="s19">I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s20">I was afraid to say anything to her or ask questions.</span> <span id="s21">And then the second time I met her in the beauty shop and for some reason I told myself I have to say something good.</span> <span id="s22">Ask something.</span> <span id="s23">But I was afraid to start.</span> <span id="s24">The only thing I asked her was that if she had any relatives in, uhh, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s25">And she asked me ‘Why?’</span> <span id="s26">–‘so because I had a good friend and she looks so much like you.</span> <span id="s27">Would you have a younger picture?’</span> <span id="s28">So when I, when I said, even asking for a younger picture, she looked up to me, she says, ‘No, I don’t have any!’</span> <span id="s29">with a tremendous German accent.</span> <span id="s30">She says, ‘No,’ she says, ‘I don’t have any,’ she says, ‘We came from Germany with my family and we couldn’t bring out many things,’ so I noticed right away that she was trying to change the subject.</span> <span id="s31">That, you know, she came from Germany and all things they had to move.</span> <span id="s32">And that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s33">I went home and told my husband.”</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: This was about, uhm, good six years ago.</span> <span id="s36">But but I see her in shopping centers.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: You live in Fairfield?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Fairfield, yes.</span> <span id="s39">But, uhh, I was so afraid to start anything.</span> <span id="s40">I mean, where can I go, what, what can I say?</span> <span id="s41">Then again they would take my name and, tell her.</span> <span id="s42">Maybe she’s surrounded with, uhh, more S.S. people.</span> <span id="s43">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s44">And, and to be afraid that they will follow me and kill me.</span> <span id="s45">So I just let it go-.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Does she work (still?)</span> <span id="s47">.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: -but I feel very guilty.</span> <span id="s49">Ahh, no, she doesn’t work any more.</span> <span id="s50">I, I ask her when I met her in the mall once that, I said, ‘Freida?</span> <span id="s51">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s52">You don’t work any more?’</span> <span id="s53">she says, ‘No,’ she says, ‘I can’t find a job and I’ll wait.’</span> <span id="s54">But then I can see, ‘no’?</span> <span id="s55">inaudible) she’s running away so much from me.</span> <span id="s56">That too, I am so sure she is the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Do you think that she thinks that she may recognize you?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">She couldn’t recognize me ‘cause we were there in that commando about 45 girls, so how can she remember me?</span> <span id="s60">But, then again, I had a friend in, in Hungary, Budapest, and she came to visit me, and I told her that ‘let’s go to the store and I want you to, to tell me if I’m right’ and it just happened that that time she wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s61">Can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What kind of a store is it-?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: A department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Just a regular department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Regular department.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: In a shopping mall in Bridgeport?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, no- this, ya was in a shopping mall in Trumbull.</span> <span id="s68">It’s not far from Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s69">Yes, Trumbull.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Trumbull Shopping Park...what is the name of the department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: ...Kays...but now that store went out of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So she’s not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: She’s not working, yes.</span> <span id="s74">But I didn’t even know whom to go or what to say.</span> <span id="s75">The fear in me was terrible.</span> <span id="s76">Just terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you see instances where she was cruel to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: She- that’s why I didn’t- really, that too.</span> <span id="s79">No.</span> <span id="s80">I didn’t see her being cruel or, or, or beating up anybody.</span> <span id="s81">It’s just, eh, eh, she had a very straight face and (as such?</span> <span id="s82">she kept looking us how we working, and- but that’s it.</span> <span id="s83">O mean, if I would have known someone that she was cruel to her, I would probably do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You would have felt more guilty, you would have felt worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Exactly!</span> <span id="s86">Exactly!</span> <span id="s87">But this way too, knowing that she was there and I can do nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did it ever happen...that, you know, there were Jewish kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, Jewish kapos, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you ever meet anyone like that in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Jewish kapos?</span> <span id="s92">Ahh, not really.</span> <span id="s93">Not really.</span> <span id="s94">After the war I do met one.</span> <span id="s95">In Hungary.</span> <span id="s96">And she was the one who, who was, who wanted to show the S.S. women how good- how loyal she was to them and she beat up a woman, a mother with three children, SO badly, her head looked like this.</span> <span id="s97">And when I met her on the railway station, she was surrounded with two men, and I says to her, ‘Laura, what are you doing here?’</span> <span id="s98">She looked at me.</span> <span id="s99">She probably had that experience before me.</span> <span id="s100">She says, ‘This is my husband and this is my brother-in-law.’</span> <span id="s101">For me to know that I can’t do nothing to her.</span> <span id="s102">So I says to her, I says,’And you are alive?</span> <span id="s103">You really don’t deserve to be alive.’</span> <span id="s104">So one of the men, I don’t know, the husband or the brother-in-law, ask me, ‘Was she a good kapo?’</span> <span id="s105">I says, ‘No.</span> <span id="s106">And I told them what happened.’</span> <span id="s107">And she started to CRY!</span> <span id="s108">She said she had to do that, that the German- the S.S. woman told her to do that.</span> <span id="s109">I says,’ No, that’s not true.’</span> <span id="s110">But I was crying so much I couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s111">I couldn’t-.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I felt like, like killing her!</span> <span id="s114">So in that station there was a train coming- a fast train and she ran and she was killed.</span> <span id="s115">Under the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: She was killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And she ran to the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: To the train to be killed.</span> <span id="s120">She wanted to wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s121">She couldn’t take this any more.</span> <span id="s122">And then this, the husband says that this is not the first incident.</span> <span id="s123">All over they find her.</span> <span id="s124">That’s why they are with her all the time.</span> <span id="s125">Because she was beaten up by, by Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s126">So, ahh, young woman, ahhh, that time my age eighteen-.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: What was their reaction when she ran (to) the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Ahhh, they didn’t, ahhh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s129">For some reason, they thought that this was the best thing for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Even then?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Was this her husband, you think before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I don’t know if if she made it up or, or, she, she paid for these two men to be with her to to guard her, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s135">I never find out.</span> <span id="s136">In a way I felt sorry for her that she, you know, chose this death.</span> <span id="s137">But then, I guess, she deserved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Czechoslovakia...Varie...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: You had sisters, brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I have a sister and a brother, yes.</span> <span id="s142">My sister lives in Maryland, she is sick since, emotionally very, very sick.</span> <span id="s143">Never came out of it out of it.</span> <span id="s144">She was beaten up by the S.S. soldier and my brother who also lives in Fairfield</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: These were your only siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Only siblings</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And they made it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeh, the three of us- not our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Where were you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: We started out in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you get there in ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: We get there in 1944, May 29th.</span> <span id="s153">And that time a kapo In Auschwitz in one of the barracks, said to us that we should mark the date when we came in because that date will be our yahrzeit date.</span> <span id="s154">And we looked at her, ‘how can you be so cruel, telling us something like that!’</span> <span id="s155">She says, ‘look at that chimney.</span> <span id="s156">You see that flame?</span> <span id="s157">You see the smoke?</span> <span id="s158">This is your parent’s body going up in that chimney’.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did you believe her?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No.</span> <span id="s161">It’s a good thing we didn’t.</span> <span id="s162">Because I remember we were standing up there- five rows and kept on looking up at the chimney and, and the flame like a head came out, and then the arms.</span> <span id="s163">We were imagining or, or I don’t know if that can happen, all of a sudden behind me a girl started to scream, ‘I don’t want to live!</span> <span id="s164">They are killing my mother and my father!’</span> <span id="s165">and from then on, she screamed and screamed, day and night.</span> <span id="s166">So finally the S.S. came to check us every other day, and they took her to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s167">There was no help for her there.</span> <span id="s168">Age of 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: ...at the camp, what was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: From Auschwitz we spent 10 weeks luckily, and then from there we went to Stuthoff(?)</span> <span id="s171">, also a- (inaudible) heard about it probably.</span> <span id="s172">And from there we went to Probst?</span> <span id="s173">...and there was a place where we had to work with vegetables, the the best thing that ever happened to us, because we could eat the vegetables, at least.</span> <span id="s174">And then we ended up there until we had to, we had to evacuate because the Russians were coming closer...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Where did they make you march, somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, into-in more, more deeply more into Poland.</span> <span id="s177">And the Russians came behind us all the time.</span> <span id="s178">We heard the bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: ...so then the war ended, and you went where, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: The war ended and then we went home, and we find the biggest city, (Berekfas(?)</span> <span id="s181">there already a few Jewish men were home from the working camp and they did everything for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: 19.</span> <span id="s184">My sister, 21.</span> <span id="s185">And little by little, these girls, these people, came back.</span> <span id="s186">But no parents.</span> <span id="s187">Only our age.</span> <span id="s188">Boys and girls.</span> <span id="s189">And then, naturally, those who were home already like these mans who were welcoming us, we were telling the truth.</span> <span id="s190">One of them asked us, we knew him by name, and he asked us, ‘Would you know what happened to my wife and the four children?’</span> <span id="s191">So we told him what happened.</span> <span id="s192">He collapsed there, and a short while after, he died.</span> <span id="s193">Young man...we were among the first ones to go home.</span> <span id="s194">To be in that, in the city.</span> <span id="s195">Like, everybody came to see us because they thought, especially the goyims, that we were all killed.</span> <span id="s196">That’s why they robbed our homes and, and took out everything from our houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: You had to leave from there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: We had to leave from that.</span> <span id="s199">First of all, we didn’t trusted them- second of all, we had nothing to do there.</span> <span id="s200">And then we heard that, uhh, if we go back to Germany, ahhh, we better off.</span> <span id="s201">But we didn’t go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s202">We went to Czechoslovakia...The Christian Czechs helped us tremendously!</span> <span id="s203">Tremendously!</span> <span id="s204">.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: ...they were a different type of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Completely.</span> <span id="s207">Completely.</span> <span id="s208">Although they were goyims, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: You saw a difference between the Czechs and the Hungarian gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh tremendous!</span> <span id="s211">You can’t compare the Hungarians- I don’t even want to speak the language!</span> <span id="s212">Because there such a bad memories!</span> <span id="s213">These people they they just terrible what they did to us!</span> <span id="s214">I mean, they could do the same thing as Romania did in Buchavena, Romania, when they, when Hitler went in the first thing, ah, we want to have your Jews.</span> <span id="s215">And they said, ‘We have no Jews.</span> <span id="s216">All Romanians here.’</span> <span id="s217">And they- survived Buchavena.</span> <span id="s218">Yes, they all survived.</span> <span id="s219">All the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: ...you were brought up in a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes- my father had a semicha.</span> <span id="s222">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s223">Religious background.</span> <span id="s224">And, ah, what can I say.</span> <span id="s225">When, when we were in Auschwitz he was about two- we were A,B,C.</span> <span id="s226">We were in the ‘C’ larger.</span> <span id="s227">He was in the ‘A’ larger.</span> <span id="s228">And that, ahm.</span> <span id="s229">That tremendous long ah, electric fence were up so he couldn’t, he couldn’t do anything to send us, like if he had more food, he only did, wrote a little, uhm, note and put a stone, a piece of stone in it and said the guy in ‘B’ larger ‘would you please throw this over the fence, whoever finds it, our names were there.’</span> <span id="s230">Sure enough, it happened.</span> <span id="s231">So he wrote, ‘Whatever they give you to eat, kindelach, eat.’</span> <span id="s232">He was afraid that we were so kosher-.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: ...b’chorf(?)</span> <span id="s234">nefesh and you have to eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Anything they give us, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: After the wars, you left there and you went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s237">Did you come to America from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No.</span> <span id="s239">From Czechoslovakia we we heard that we have to go back home, where we came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: ‘We’ means whom now?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: My brother, my sister, my husband, that time he was just a, a boyfriend since childhood.</span> <span id="s242">It happened that he came home also and his two brothers.</span> <span id="s243">So the six of us.</span> <span id="s244">We kept together.</span> <span id="s245">And we, we find out that if- they go back home, they will have to join the army.</span> <span id="s246">So coming back from the concentration camp, they don’t want to join the army!</span> <span id="s247">Even though this was a Czech army, mind you.</span> <span id="s248">So we didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s249">Instead we went to Germany- Munich.</span> <span id="s250">And we stayed there for about six months, until the uncles on my husband’s side sent us affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: They were in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Oh they were long time in America.</span> <span id="s253">His whole family.</span> <span id="s254">We had no families in America.</span> <span id="s255">Because my father was so religious he said that he heard that the Jews working in the factories- he doesn’t want to go to America, and none of us, our families should adopt there.</span> <span id="s256">But his, ahh, his parents and, and the whole family were here.</span> <span id="s257">So we had such good affidavits from all these uncles and aunts, that we gave to those who didn’t have anybody in this country.</span> <span id="s258">Although they joined then the HIAS, naturally they did everything to everybody to come.</span> <span id="s259">Even without the affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: ...they gave you individual affidavits, so you didn’t need HIAS, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: We did need HIAS, although, when we arrived, when we arrived, ahh, the three uncles were waiting for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: 1947.</span> <span id="s264">And, uhh, and somebody in the office asked them, uhh, ‘are they going to pay for them?’</span> <span id="s265">You know, for the ship that we came.</span> <span id="s266">He said, ‘Yes, we’ll be more than happy to pay.’</span> <span id="s267">So that means that we didn’t need their help.</span> <span id="s268">So, I mean it was, it was wonderful that they helped those who, uhh, who didn’t have anybody here.</span> <span id="s269">And they didn’t have any money!</span> <span id="s270">But we, since the, the uncle, alright, we have to pay the uncles later- a few years later, you know,</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You came in what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: The 7th of May,</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Pretty close to what would have been your yahrzeit according to the kapo...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s275">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Guess you were right.</span> <span id="s277">It’s a small victory, but...?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s279">Yes.</span> <span id="s280">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: ...you came by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Came by boat.</span> <span id="s283">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Left from Bremmerhauffen?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What was the name of the boat...?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: The Marine Marleen.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Are you sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I’m positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Marine Marleen?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">I don’t know- we said, The Mariner because we didn’t speak English, so now, Mar-Marine, Marleen.</span> <span id="s293">Is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">It’s a boat that there’s a record of it.</span> <span id="s296">It made many trips.</span> <span id="s297">Many people came on the Marine Marleen.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: They were so wonderful, the, the, the nurses on that, that ship.</span> <span id="s299">I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s300">They just didn’t know what to do for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: What were they like?</span> <span id="s302">What do you mean, they didn’t know what to do for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: They were bringing me in the morning, juice, breakfast,

id="s452">Yes.</span> <span id="s453">Definitely.</span> <span id="s454">Especially, now, since, ehhh, we hear so much about the, the, the skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan and all that.</span> <span id="s455">You know, we keep telling each other that you see, you see, we should have gone to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Does it represent something in your mind that could become a very serious problem in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Definitely!</span> <span id="s458">Definitely!</span> <span id="s459">We have to be really live with an open mind and open ears and eyes

<span id="s463">They were working.</span> <span id="s464">They just kept on looking around and when the S.S. turned his back, then they said a few words.</span> <span id="s465">Just a few

country.</span> <span id="s476">Alright, it is nice, of course, but too much freedom.</span> <span id="s477">Much, too much.</span> <span id="s478">We have to sit and watch on TV or somebody through their window what these, these Ku Klux Klan’s doing.</span> <span id="s479">And these, these, uhhh, these people have the nerve to come on TV’s and, saying things that it looks so dark.</span> <span id="s480">So dark, the future.</span> <span id="s481">Seeing, and hearing them on, on TV that so many peoples watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: What do you think of Jesse Jackson?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: What I’m thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Does he frighten you?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: very much so.</span> <span id="s486">Very much so.</span></p> <p><span

terrible for the Jews.</span> <span id="s490">Terrible.</span> <span id="s491">Terrible.</span> <span id="s492">That’s why I didn’t vote for Bush, because being a registered Democrat, for some reason, I, I don’t know why, I just couldn’t, I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s493">But then again, I said, ‘oh I hope Dukakis won’t win because of Jackson.’</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did you vote for Dukakis?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: That’s a real conflict.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I know.</span> <span id="s498">But then again, I, I said to myself, now how can I, as a Democrat, how can I vote for Bush, and Dukakis I don’t think that Dukakis will let him do whatever he wants to do if he will be the president.</span> <span id="s499">Took a tremendous chance, really!</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: So you think that Bush is better than Dukakis ehh, would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: You never know...Dukakis didn’t win.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Until ehhh-.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Until it’s too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s505">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span

EVERYTHING what’s going on.</span> <span id="s513">THIS is the most important thing for us Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When you came here in 1947 it all looked optimistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Oh, tremendous!</span> <span id="s516">Tremendous!</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: They met you at the boat, your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes.</span> <span

<p><span id="s523">Q: How come HIAS was able to take you if you came on an individual addidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Because there was nobody, no-when we arrived since, ahhh, the, the aunt was dead, the uncles couldn’t be there to wait for us.</span> <span id="s525">They came later, late at night.</span> <span id="s526">It was about around 12 o’clock when they came.</span> <span

the, the papers.</span> <span id="s537">Everything there.</span> <span id="s538">How they still questioned us.</span> <span id="s539">Our names, and where we came from.</span> <span id="s540">And that was the time we lost our marriage license.</span> <span id="s541">And I had a tremendous problem with the Social Security because of that.</span> <span id="s542">So they told me to get the, ahhh, get witnesses.</span> <span id="s543">So I kept thinking, ‘Who can I have?’</span> <span id="s544">All of a sudden I said to myself, wait a minute- we have a wedding picture so I took it up to the Social

look at how much bread!</span> <span id="s621">Everything seemed so much!</span> <span id="s622">And naturally, uhhh, the money part, you know, it, uhhh, we didn’t have much, but at the same time we BOUGHT and BOUGHT, and, and for some reason, we still had money.</span> <span id="s623">So we kept saying, that how come that everything is so cheap here!</span> <span id="s624">And it’s, it’s so good and so delicious!</span> <span id="s625">Ahhhh.</span> <span id="s626">I, I just can’t describe it to you that, that feeling.</span> <span id="s627">That free feeling we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: What happened when you first saw a policeman in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: The policeman wasn’t as bad as the, uhhh, the, the, the, uh, black people.</span> <span id="s630">Ahh, we learned, ahh, about them in, ahh, in our history books.</span> <span id="s631">BUT, I never saw them, so when we came, I said, ‘Oh, that, that black.</span> <span id="s632">Why is he black?’</span> <span id="s633">Where is he coming from?</span> <span id="s634">Alright?</span> <span id="s635">And not only that, I was going downtown and as we went off the bus, the bus driver was hollering, I didn’t understand too much English at that time, the only thing I saw that they went to the back of the bus, and I sat down in the front.</span> <span id="s636">So I said to myself, ‘Now wait a minute, how come I’m sitting there, why they have to go to the back?’</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: ...this is in Bridgeport?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s639">But I couldn’t ask and questions because I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s640">But I couldn’t wait to get home and talk to my uncle, who was here already a few years, and then my uncle explained.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: But in the north, blacks didn’t go to the back of the bus...what made you think that they were going to the back of the bus because they belonged there, because they had to.</span> <span id="s642">Maybe that’s where their seat was?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, I for some reason I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s644">I just couldn’t figure out why they, they go all of them.</span> <span id="s645">As they came up to the front, paid, and went to the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: You said the bus driver was hollering?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Hollering.</span> <span id="s648">And I didn’t understand why he was hollering.</span> <span id="s649">The only thing I notice that they were talking to each other loud.</span> <span id="s650">I don’t know, they didn’t like the idea or what, but they sat down and I said, ‘oh this probably, these people have to go to the back because they are black?’</span> <span id="s651">And then my uncle said, ‘Yes, that’s why they have to go to the-.’</span> <span id="s652">I just couldn’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Did you think that maybe they were bad people?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: No.</span> <span id="s655">No.</span> <span id="s656">My aunt made a remark, I just, just thought of it, she says, ‘you know, these black people not only bad, but they smell bad.’</span> <span id="s657">So, I couldn’t put two and two together, so up to a few years, I kept telling myself that was the reason.</span> <span id="s658">They had to go to the back because they smell (laughing).</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: ...for the first couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: It took a, took a, yes.</span> <span id="s661">Yes.</span> <span id="s662">Yes.</span> <span id="s663">And when I, when I knew the truth, ohhh, it was hurting me so much because it us so terrible.</span> <span id="s664">I mean, they are people, too, they are human beings too.</span> <span id="s665">And then I, I said to myself, ‘see, just like we were Jews, they couldn’t stand us.’</span> <span id="s666">We couldn’t do lot of things, uhhh, when Hungary took over when the Czech was, was uhhh, chased our from Czechoslovakia in 1938, and the Hungarian took over.</span> <span id="s667">Uhhhhh!</span> <span id="s668">Were they bad, my G-d!</span> <span id="s669">(she whispers very, very softly.)</span> <span id="s670">What they did to the Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s671">I just can’t describe it to you.</span> <span id="s672">It’s so bad.</span> <span id="s673">That’s why when I hear a Jew going to, to Hungary, to, ahh, for a vacation, my G-d, you spend your dollars somewhere else!</span> <span id="s674">Don’t go there!</span> <span id="s675">But for some reason the American people couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s676">They didn’t have the hardship like we had.</span> <span id="s677">So they can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s678">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s679">They-.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Did you feel any prejudice from American Jews when you first came here?</span> <span id="s681">...that they thought of you as a greener...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Naturally, we had the greener, sure, but they said they were called ‘greeners’ also, and, uhhh, the only thing, uhhh, we said that uhhh, we were very surprised that you didn’t do enough for us that we shouldn’t reach Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s683">You HAD to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Did they say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: They said that ‘We tried!</span> <span id="s686">And, and we went to the, uhhh, to the White House, to the steps, and hollered and screamed and the rabbi’s’- and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: I don’t know, I said to myself, uhhh, may- maybe it’s true.</span> <span id="s689">Maybe, maybe, ehr, they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s690">Or maybe they were too slow.</span> <span id="s691">They, they weren’t feeling the, the pain as much as we did THERE.</span> <span id="s692">But, as, as the year went by, I understood more and more-.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: You lived in downtown Bridgeport?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s696">We lived in a, uhh, that was a few stores, businesses, bakeries, groceries, small grocery stores and a lot of- it was a Hungarian area.</span> <span id="s697">That time.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s700">Just couldn’t stand them.</span> <span id="s701">And, and some of them had the grocery store, they said, ‘Oh, the Christian has businesses too?</span> <span id="s702">We only thought that only Jews had businesses!’</span> <span id="s703">But I could never go into their business.</span> <span id="s704">Never!</span> <span id="s705">And I know later, we knew they were innocent because they were here- but just knowing that they were goyims we couldn’t, just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s706">And even to this day, even to this day!</span> <span id="s707">I really feel that we, uhhh, survivors, we are prejudiced.</span> <span id="s708">But then, again, we have the reasons many times over, to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Do you belong to any survivor group?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s711">Yes.</span> <span id="s712">That, uhm, Meed...We went to Washington, D.C. when we had the Holocaust gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span

Bridgeport.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: You have meetings now?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s724">We get together, yes.</span> <span id="s725">The people from the- city, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: How many people are there from your city?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh, uhm, it depends on the, the meeting.</span> <span id="s728">We see 50, 60 uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: ...what city?</span> <span id="s730">...</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Bridgeport.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: ...from your home city...people from your

year we have this.</span> <span id="s737">Not only on the same city, the whole surrounding cities, we get together.</span> <span id="s738">And they were for Israel.</span> <span id="s739">Everything goes for Israel.</span> <span id="s740">Schools...the money that they collect from us, you know, they- we have dinner we pay (inaudible) thirty dollars a couple and everything, all the money goes to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: And they come from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Come from the people.</span> <span id="s743">The peoples who’s attending the, ahh, this affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: As far as the Bridgeport group goes, they’re people who come from Europe, but they all live in Bridgeport or Trumbull?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s746">All over yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Are they all from Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, they from Poland, some of them.</span> <span id="s749">Yes, some of them Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Who organized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: ...two women survivors who organized and Meed- and his wife came to see the, the, the group, there was the meeting and he gave us a beautiful lecture about, about these things, you know, to, to keep it up and to, uh, to work hard and all that.</span> <span id="s752">(heavy sigh)</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: You meet...once a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: No.</span> <span id="s755">No.</span> <span id="s756">Maybe once in three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: What do you do at the meeting?</span> <span id="s758">What’s it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: We talk about many things, uhh, the Holocaust, the survivors, lots of them, like my husband died 4 years ago, age of 64 and he went to and then and we, we meet a lot of others who said, ‘you know, that this one died, that one died’ and they’re in their 60’s!</span> <span id="s760">60!</span> <span id="s761">That’s why this is so important.</span> <span id="s762">Because we’re really, you know, in, in 60’s today that’s a, it’s a young age.</span> <span id="s763">But looks like that this is what we got from the, ahh, concentration camp.</span> <span id="s764">That, ah, (heavy sigh) we became became, I don’t know, sick or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Your resistance was low-.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s767">Exactly</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: How is your own health?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Thank G-d, thank G-d.</span> <span id="s770">I, I just can’t thank enough, knowing what I went through, and my sister who was with me all the time, and a few friends, and they’re, they’re all sick.</span> <span id="s771">They all have something wrong with them, and I feel-.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: ...has to do with what they went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Definitely.</span> <span

id="s778">My husband had three jobs in the beginning.</span> <span id="s779">Very short time.</span> <span id="s780">And then his uncle took him into the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: This was a tailor business?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s783">And a very, very good growing business and then when my husband, uhm, knew the business he went in his own with a big cleaning establishment- in Bridgeport and we became very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Did you have other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, just one, because I was afraid that this will happen again and I kept going back and forth to the doctors to, to give me pills, to give me anything I don’t want to be pregnant again.</span> <span id="s786">I don’t want any more children.</span> <span id="s787">Because this gonna happen again, and it was just terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: That what is going to happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: (heavy sigh) Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s790">Will happen again in this country.</span> <span id="s791">I kept saying it.</span> <span id="s792">It stayed with me even until this day.</span> <span id="s793">That’s why I, I had only one child which I regret very much today.</span> <span id="s794">And not only that, she has only, she has only, one child because of that.</span> <span id="s795">Can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: If you’re going to have one, why not have two?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Because to suffer, to go through suffering, we, we kept on saying there in, in, in this working camps, that we, why, why were we born?</span> <span id="s798">To, to, to go through this?</span> <span id="s799">If we EVER survive and get married, we will NEVER have ANY children.</span> <span id="s800">We were young girls, we kept on telling each other these things.</span> <span id="s801">And it happened in many cases, that, uh, among us friends, at least 15 of them have one child.</span> <span id="s802">But their children already have 4 and 5 luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Why have any, if you feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I didn’t want to have any.</span> <span id="s805">Oh, no!</span> <span id="s806">I was so much against it and my husband said too, ‘I don’t know, we’re not going to have any children’ so, it, it happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s809">It happened, but-</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: ...sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No!</span> <span id="s812">No!</span> <span id="s813">Sorry?</span> <span id="s814">What can I say.</span> <span id="s815">Sorry enough and not.</span> <span id="s816">And, and not.</span> <span id="s817">She married in 1070 (inaudible).</span> <span id="s818">She finished college that time.</span> <span id="s819">She graduated and married a lovely, lovely Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s820">Beautiful family.</span> <span id="s821">He was a Harvard lawyer, and my daughter is a high school teacher.</span> <span id="s822">Two years later, divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Was he a child of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No.</span> <span id="s825">No.</span> <span id="s826">American born.</span> <span id="s827">Even the grandparents are born here.</span> <span id="s828">And two years later, I don’t know, she met, she met another guy who went to school with the, the first husband, but when we find out already, it was late.</span> <span id="s829">He was a shaggetz.</span> <span id="s830">So, he did everything.</span> <span id="s831">Everything.</span> <span id="s832">Whatever we told him to do.</span> <span id="s833">He would convert.</span> <span id="s834">Everything.</span> <span id="s835">Just let me marry your daughter.</span> <span id="s836">You can imagine, US, how we felt it.</span> <span id="s837">I think it had a lot to do with, uh, my husband’s death.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: I’m sure</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">Yes.</span> <span id="s841">(she answers very quietly).</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: What did she say?</span> <span id="s843">Did she say she loved him?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: She loved him SO much!</span> <span id="s845">What a love, and love, and love.</span> <span id="s846">I think today she feels differently, but then again, it’s a-.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Is she still married to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: This marriage didn’t break up.</span> <span id="s849">The first one did.</span> <span id="s850">Alright, I was wishing, and hoping and praying, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Did he convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: That boy is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Well, ahh, -he’s Jewish, yes (inaudible)0</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: but you don’t have a family really...machetonim.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: What do you think why am I here!</span> <span id="s857">It hurts me having one child and I have to come alone and being in a place- I don’t have to tell you that feeling.</span> <span id="s858">(heavy sigh)</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So you ever feel that if you come here maybe you’ll meet someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: It’s very hard.</span> <span id="s861">It’s awfully hard.</span> <span id="s862">Ahh, two years ago, when I was here, ahh, we were going into the elevator, my friend came with me that time, and uhh, he, the guy, noticed my accent and he asked me, ‘where you coming from?’</span> <span id="s863">I says, ‘Czechoslovakia, I said, but my father uh, a Romanian born.’</span> <span id="s864">He says, ‘Where in Romania?’</span> <span id="s865">So I said the, the town Daiz(?)</span> <span id="s866">and he says, ‘I’m coming from Daiz(?)</span> <span id="s867">as a child of 6 years old.</span> <span id="s868">Those days their parents came from Romania.</span> <span id="s869">So, we became friends.</span> <span id="s870">His wife, and him, and my friend.</span> <span id="s871">When I came this time, I saw the guy, so naturally I went up to him because I wanted to meet, you know, him again and his wife.</span> <span id="s872">So I says, ah, ‘where’s your wife?’</span> <span id="s873">He says, ‘she died two years ago.’</span> <span id="s874">(heavy sigh) So, since then he came, we talked, he said, ‘how terrible’ he says, ‘I am alone, also,’ which he has two sons.</span> <span id="s875">Luckily they were both married well.</span> <span id="s876">‘But’ he says, ‘I’m a sick man.’</span> <span id="s877">I said, ‘why, what’s wrong with you?’</span> <span id="s878">He says, ‘high blood pressure, sugar,’ he, he said a few things.</span> <span id="s879">I said to myself, ‘that’s enough!’</span> <span id="s880">I mean, to go into something like this, and I feel bad because he’s a very nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Well he was honest with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s883">He says, ‘I don’t want to cause tzores.</span> <span id="s884">It would be very unfair’ he says.</span> <span id="s885">So he was, he was really honest, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s886">But then again, over 60, especially 65, there’s so many sick with our people, I’m talking about!</span> <span id="s887">So many!</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: ...my mother passed away five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: How old?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: 72.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Young.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: ...you have to wait for the besheret...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s894">If there is such a thing- I hope there is.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: If you stay in Fairfield, your chances are...almost zero.</span> <span id="s896">Here, your chances are maybe 10%.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yes, that’s true,</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: But 10 % is better than nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: But then again- yes, that’s true.</span> <span id="s900">But then again, I mean, uh, where else can you go, only places like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: You got here, you got Brown’s, you got the Stevensville.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Florida...</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Too many old people in Florida.</span> <span id="s905">It’s-.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Florida, you get old...</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, bit it’s very, very hard alone.</span> <span id="s908">Very, very hard and I’m not alone, you know, there are plenty of widows.</span> <span id="s909">More than enough.</span> <span id="s910">Uh,</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Do you have your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes, I have my brother.</span> <span id="s913">Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s914">The business, um, we took him in as a partner because we were very close and knowing that we are the only the three of us, so he took over.</span> <span id="s915">I didn’t didn’t want to stay in the business because every time a customers came, they came- sh- the crying, and, and the, I just couldn’t take it any longer.</span> <span id="s916">So I told my brother, ‘Please take over.</span> <span id="s917">You pay me when you will have enough money but I don’t want to stay any longer’.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Did you belong to the Orthodox community in Bridgeport?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Oh, sure, sure...Statfield Road, Fairfield.</span> <span id="s920">Sure.</span> <span id="s921">It’s an Orthodox shul...the first shul, Hancock Avenue...we have a new shul now.</span> <span id="s922">Much modern shul on Statfield Road.</span> <span id="s923">Beautiful shul.</span>

id="s981">A: I went, ya, I went to help out until, uhh, the business became bigger that we needed more workers and then I became very active with the shul Sisterhood and I helped out with the Federation many times and also, ah, Amit Yeshiva Women’s Organization, life member, so I’m doing all the work all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: It was rough.</span></p> <p><span

id="s995">Because they know that I’m going always.</span> <span id="s996">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: When you came to America...Bridgeport, did you go to school to learn English.</span> <span id="s998">/</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: I couldn’t because I had a baby and my husband had the, the three jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So how did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Evenings, Sundays- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1002">Probably-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Movies-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Movies, of course.</span> <span id="s1005">The radio constantly, and, uh, neighbors, I tried.</span> <span id="s1006">My daughter is a teacher so every time I write a letter she says, ‘mother you wonderful’ so I’m so happy.</span> <span id="s1007">Don’t forget, it’s over 40 years now.</span> <span id="s1008">I mean, uh, it would be terrible if I, uh, couldn’t (laughing) you know, read or write or speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: ...you got people who come to Brooklyn and they continue speaking Yiddish...</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: ...don’t believe in (inaudible) the friends, Hungarian, we speak Hungarian constantly with the friends.</span> <span id="s1011">We playing cards.</span> <span id="s1012">The minute we have somebody who doesn’t understand Hungarian, we speak only that time, we speak English.</span> <span id="s1013">Other- otherwise, we always- we look, look around, that everybody speaks Hungarian, then, only Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1014">And it wasn’t easy, really, to, to learn English, because uh, as I say, the friends, and they don’t care.</span> <span id="s1015">You know, sometimes I do tell them, ‘you better, better off to speak English, because, you know, for yourself!’</span> <span id="s1016">Ah, they ‘can explain ahh, things, ahh, as, as, as well as as their own language.’</span> <span id="s1017">And I hate that Hungarian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: But you’re stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Uhhh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Do you feel that there’s a difference between the way a survivor looks at life and an American Jew looks at life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Definitely!</span> <span id="s1022">Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: In what ways do you see the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: ...we keep saying that the American Jews are so sure that everything will go smooth.</span> <span id="s1025">And they not worry about anything.</span> <span id="s1026">And they just, they just out for, for making money and, and going on vacations and, and that’s the only thing they care about, and where we- we, worry, we, we keep saying to each other, all the news we hear, we call each other on the telephone and, and tells us, pretty soon, pretty soon, we gonna end up like we were in Europe- so scared all of us.</span> <span id="s1027">All of us.</span> <span id="s1028">After 40, oh, well, well over 40 years now.</span> <span id="s1029">Still the fear is in us that it will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Do you find yourself talking about that-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: All the time, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: ...and when you get together...</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1034">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Do you ever dream about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Many times, yes.</span> <span id="s1037">Many times, many times.</span> <span id="s1038">It’s packing like we packed towards the last day, last day of Pesach, we didn’t have a chance to put away the, the Pesach dishes and this, these things always come especially around Pesach time.</span> <span id="s1039">It’s very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1040">Very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Knowing that that time it happened and it could happen here, too.</span> <span id="s1043">If it will, it will be Pesach time.</span> <span id="s1044">I don’t know why it’s still in us!</span> <span id="s1045">Can’t get rid of the, the thought of, of this!</span> <span id="s1046">Many, many times we keep telling each other...Pesach, we so worried about Pesach all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: If you felt that way, wouldn’t it make more sense to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: You mean to stay, you mean for good?</span> <span id="s1049">(inaudible) In this age, in this stage of our lives for (?)</span> <span id="s1050">what, I mean, what would Israel ah, have from us being there.</span> <span id="s1051">Alright, we would spend some money, naturally, because we’d have to eat and buy clothes.</span> <span id="s1052">But that’s all.</span> <span id="s1053">I mean, what else is there?</span> <span id="s1054">Young people, it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And you have your family here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Not much family.</span> <span id="s1057">On my side, only my brother, my sister, and my daughter.</span> <span id="s1058">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1059">And there, my, oh, the whole family is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: If the Holocaust happened in America...Israel wouldn’t be too safe a place either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: No.</span> <span id="s1062">Definitely.</span> <span id="s1063">Definitely.</span> <span id="s1064">But then again, us survivors, we have something in our heads that since Israel has a bomb that when it comes to that again, and we know if, if America wouldn’t help Israel, then the only solution would be not to Israel to did-to disappear, from the earth- the whole world would disappear.</span> <span id="s1065">Because we, we can’t have that again that only the Jews to be killed and hurt.</span> <span id="s1066">You understand what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: I think about it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s1069">So this is in our minds, and that keeps us going, that this is what will happen.</span> <span id="s1070">Let’s hope it will never happen.</span> <span id="s1071">But then again, just to know and hopefully, maybe you come up with, with more and more new things because let’s face it.</span> <span id="s1072">Us Jews, we are smart people.</span> <span id="s1073">Don’t you think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: ...we’re still around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1076">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: You made it through that time in Auschwitz...and when you think back about it, what reason was there...what was it that made it possible for you to make it through that terrible time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Uhhh, the will of, of making it.</span> <span id="s1079">To, to see our parents, number one, number two, to show the goyims that we didn’t die.</span> <span id="s1080">We are here.</span> <span id="s1081">And we could question you- ‘where did you put our furniture from our homes?</span> <span id="s1082">We find them empty, just like here.</span> <span id="s1083">An empty house.’</span> <span id="s1084">We MUST survive!</span> <span id="s1085">We MUST go home.</span> <span id="s1086">And that helped a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: You mean, you thought about that as you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1089">(she whispers) Seeing that chimney.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Did you really think that it would all end?</span> <span id="s1091">Didn’t it look so hopeless?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: No.</span> <span id="s1093">No.</span> <span id="s1094">No.</span> <span id="s1095">No.</span> <span id="s1096">Because one week when we left Auschwitz, we had to go into a small room.</span> <span id="s1097">A very tiny room where there was the, uhm, gas in the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1098">We just had to open it somewhere, I don’t know where, from the outside, I think.</span> <span id="s1099">Forty of us in that small room, like sardines, standing all the clothes were already taken off outside.</span> <span id="s1100">We had to leave it outside.</span> <span id="s1101">I looked around and I saw a small window.</span> <span id="s1102">I said to myself, ‘if they gonna gas us, at least we gonna keep hitting that window that the air to come in’ but it wouldn’t work because that window wasn’t a window.</span> <span id="s1103">That was something strong that they put.</span> <span id="s1104">After I find out- afterward.</span> <span id="s1105">And all of a sudden, we are staying there about 20 minutes, and we hear somebody outside, a woman’s- an S.S. woman’s voice said, ‘we ran out of gas.’</span> <span id="s1106">So we weren’t killed.</span> <span id="s1107">When when we went from Auschwitz to Danzig, they they, had to give us a, uhh, shower to be clean, you know, to go from one place to the another, and this, we KNEW that that’s going to be a shower.</span> <span id="s1108">But this, they were ready to kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: You mean they weren’t really going to give you a shower?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: No.</span> <span id="s1111">No.</span> <span id="s1112">(whispers) When we heard that, that somebody does that in German that we went out (whispering) of the gas- - the Hashem were with us, okay?</span> <span id="s1113">And this, this is the way we survived, KNOWING that we ARE GOING to survive!</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: You mean you thought that if you were saved from that, you almost feel that nothing can happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1116">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1117">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1118">Yes.</span> <span id="s1119">Yes.</span> <span id="s1120">(voice drops down to a near-whisper).</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: What about all those who didn’t make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: When you think of G-d, when you think of the explanation.</span> <span id="s1123">(heavy sigh).</span> <span id="s1124">The only explanation I could have that, uh, if that’s true, that that was written for all those, all those tzaddicks, all those, those very, very frum people.</span> <span id="s1125">It was, it was written.</span> <span id="s1126">It was- that the way it was bersherit.</span> <span id="s1127">That, it, its, this should happen and this many people will survive, and that many will die.</span> <span id="s1128">I wa- I was always thinking to, to go to a very, very well known rabbi.</span> <span id="s1129">To give us some explanation.</span> <span id="s1130">Something.</span> <span id="s1131">But then again, in Germany, yes, in Munich, there was a very well known rabbi.</span> <span id="s1132">And when Yom Kippur came, he came to shul and we ALL ran to him.</span> <span id="s1133">And all that questions.</span> <span id="s1134">‘Kindlelach, frey gornished.’</span> <span id="s1135">That’s was his answer.</span> <span id="s1136">So I was afraid, if I’m gonna go here also to a rabbi who used to be my father’s rabbi, and now his grandson is in Boro Park.</span> <span id="s1137">The Sepinke rebbe...my father’s rebbe, to go to him and he’s gonna give me this answer, so, so what, why should I go?</span> <span id="s1138">For what?</span> <span id="s1139">To listen to, to hear this, uh, this much: ‘Don’t, don’t ask any questions’ or, or ‘Be, be glad and be happy that you are here today.’</span> <span id="s1140">But I still believe.</span> <span id="s1141">I believe SO-o-o deeply.</span> <span id="s1142">Because going through seeing these, these girls my age, they just, from hunger, they couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s1143">Everywhere I look they’re DYING.</span> <span id="s1144">They, they just about moving.</span> <span id="s1145">And here I am coming home, not even a scratch.</span> <span id="s1146">So go and explain this.</span> <span id="s1147">That is this?</span> <span id="s1148">My father did everything to, uh, ask Hashem to, to save us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: But then when you ask about your own parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1151">Exactly, exactly, why, why?</span> <span id="s1152">They have no answer.</span> <span id="s1153">(heavy sigh) They don’t have answer to this.</span> <span id="s1154">Why?</span> <span id="s1155">Never.</span> <span id="s1156">Never.</span> <span id="s1157">Oh- the way I, I explained it, those of us who survived, we were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s1158">Like many thing in life.</span> <span id="s1159">Luck.</span> <span id="s1160">Am I right?</span> <span id="s1161">So this, this- this was luck.</span> <span id="s1162">That’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Did you ever feel though, that when you were in the camp, that you did anything actively to help yourself?</span> <span id="s1164">...</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: The only thing I did was when we were going from that camp and the, the people, the, Jews who worked in the kitchen, naturally they looked better because they, they had food, they were cooking for the Germans, the S.S., and when we went and we walked about 3 or 4 towns, and then the S.S. said that ‘now’ I think he was tired- not us.</span> <span id="s1166">He was tired.</span> <span id="s1167">And he says, ‘now this is a, a, uhm, a place where the, the horses and cows are, and you are going in there, and you gonna sleep over, and next morning we will continue.’</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t know where he went.</span> <span id="s1169">In the meantime we heard the, the, the bombs be-behind us, the the Russians, the Russian.</span> <span id="s1170">So we knew that the Russians weren’t too far away, but the S.S. wouldn’t leave us, naturally, so we went and slept over- but before, the, the, the Polish goy (?)</span> <span id="s1171">came in and said, ‘make sure to sit down, because I’m going to shut the light, and you won’t see anything.’</span> <span id="s1172">So I saw these people, his girls, when they came from the kitchen, that the packages that they brought with them, all food, and here is my sister next to me and dying of hunger, and the goy shut the light, I, I knew, which area they are, these girls with the food, and I stole one bag of food.</span> <span id="s1173">I don’t feel guilty.</span> <span id="s1174">I NEVER felt guilty because I not only gave that food for my sister, but the people around me, that night in the dark, I FED THEM and told them, ‘You have to be STRONG!’</span> <span id="s1175">And believe me, that food helped us to survive.</span> <span id="s1176">We read, ‘it’s never enough whatever we went through.’</span> <span id="s1177">(Uhhh!)</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: What do you think if anything could be done to prevent something like this from happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: The only thing, uhh, as I said that, uhh, our people our Jewish, uhh, men and women to, to seek for a higher jobs constantly to, to go as high as they can just to, just to see and hear everything as far as Jewish- us Jews are concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Do you think education helps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1182">That’s, that’s the only way we could climb the ladder don’t you think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: I mean, educating people about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Oh, yes, that’s a must!</span> <span id="s1185">That’s a must!</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Did you ever speak to any groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1188">As a matter of fact, I was interviewed in the Jewish Community Center and they sent a tape to one of the schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Who interviewed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: ...a woman, she’s very active in the Federation...and then I was interviewed in the Holocaust gathering in Washington.</span> <span id="s1191">That was filmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Did you all tape?</span> <span id="s1193">(??)</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: ...my sister and her children, the second generation, yes.</span> <span id="s1195">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Oh, and they did it, the second generation group did the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes, they did the interview.</span> <span id="s1198">Yes.</span> <span id="s1199">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: It’s very good that people do these tapes, it’s very important...</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1202">(said ‘yes’ in a whisper.)</span> <span id="s1203">This was a film!</span> <span id="s1204">This was a film.</span> <span id="s1205">The tape was in Bridgeport in, in the Jewish Community Center that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Yale also did interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1208">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1209">As a matter of fact, they were asking us to go to school and speak with the, uh, children to tell of our (?</span> <span id="s1210">inaudible) and we did go.</span> <span id="s1211">A few of us, we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Everybody tries, if they feel they’re in possible danger they try to do something to prevent something from happening to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Do you, in a way, live with ‘your bags packed?’</span> <span id="s1215">in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: The only thing, yes.</span> <span id="s1217">The only thing that the fear like, uh, I was left with a house.</span> <span id="s1218">I’m, I’m living there because I don’t know what to do with my life after I’m, I’m out from there.</span> <span id="s1219">I’m afraid that something will happen and here I am in a house alone, and I couldn’t sell any more, because the something happened with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1220">I mean, I’m not dreaming.</span> <span id="s1221">This is, uh, this is, uhh-ummm, I’m sitting and thinking of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Well, it happened once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: It happened once?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: It happened in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Oh, Europe!</span> <span id="s1226">Naturally, naturally.</span> <span id="s1227">But I mean here in this country, and, and that fear in me, ‘I must, I must get rid of this house!</span> <span id="s1228">I must sell before anything happens!’</span> <span id="s1229">(she lowers her voice) I mean, isn’t it terrible after so many years, you still thinking in, in this term, that something will happen and, and then that that fear in us constantly!</span> <span id="s1230">Day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Did you ever talk to a social worker or somebody about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1233">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Did it help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Not much really, not much.</span> <span id="s1236">Because, you know to say that you have to put these thoughts out of your mind.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, it doesn’t work like that, you know?</span> <span id="s1238">- just take it out!</span> <span id="s1239">You know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Was this person Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1242">Yes.</span> <span id="s1243">Jewish.</span> <span id="s1244">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: What prompted you to talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: I just thought that maybe it’s a good idea to help us to how to get rid of all this, this terrible thought and thinking that, let’s say, since my, um, my daughter’s husband, is, um, has an Irish background, he has an older mother, she will, she will be dead and I will have her papers, I mean, I’m even ashamed to tell you this.</span> <span id="s1247">Okay?</span> <span id="s1248">All these things that I, I have in my mind.</span> <span id="s1249">And at times I think, ‘Am I, am I crazy?’</span> <span id="s1250">Or, this is something that will stay with me the rest of my life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">( Interviewer assures her that her thinking is not unusual.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: It’s not unusual?</span> <span id="s1253">Ohhh.</span> <span id="s1254">I’m glad to hear it because at times I think I’m really crazy- to think like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">(Interviewer continues assuring her, telling her that there are some survivors who won’t even leave the house.</span> <span id="s1256">Her response:)</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Still, still, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">(Interviewer continues reassuring her- tells her about another survivor who felt he was always being followed, her response was of continued relief:)</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Uhhh- you see.</span> <span id="s1260">Alright so I’m not the only one- even to come here (at the resort) and seeing these, these, the waiters and the waitresses, and I thought, ‘Ohhh.</span> <span id="s1261">These people, they, they will get mad or, or jealous to see that, ‘Look at the Jews!</span> <span id="s1262">We are workers here.’</span> <span id="s1263">And they will do something terrible, when the, the hotel will be FILLED with people!</span> <span id="s1264">You know, how these pe- it’s terrible to live like this!</span> <span id="s1265">just awful, to live like this.</span> <span id="s1266">Or, when a, when the Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur comes, we have to have police outside to watch who’s coming.</span> <span id="s1267">I mean, it’s, it’s, it’s, just-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: That’s the one advantage of living in Israel...there, you’re in the majority, not the minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1270">That’s true.</span> <span id="s1271">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: ...I suppose, when you said to me, ‘I would have rather gone to Israel because-.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: All the young people.</span> <span id="s1274">All the young people to end up in Israel!</span> <span id="s1275">To live, and, and go and do everything what is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Do you ever think that, let’s say in a hotel...you don’t like something the waiter did, or the busboy, do you ever think that you don’t want to say something to him because you don’t want he should get a bad impression of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Exactly- Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: But you don’t want to ask him to go back to the kitchen and get you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1280">I’d rather go myself- yes- and smiling at them, and, and just don’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s1281">Just leave us alone!</span> <span id="s1282">And don’t think of us, that, that we are terrible people.</span> <span id="s1283">Yes.</span> <span id="s1284">Many, many times.</span> <span id="s1285">Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: We’re smart people- do you think we’re good people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yeh, why not?</span> <span id="s1288">Yes.</span> <span id="s1289">We are.</span> <span id="s1290">We are.</span> <span id="s1291">We are good people.</span> <span id="s1292">We just, just to have that feeling that, uhh, that what is this that against all these people against us.</span> <span id="s1293">Why?</span> <span id="s1294">Because we are smart, we could use our heads to do things to, to be aggressive, for, for, for things that to better ourselves.</span> <span id="s1295">And, and they see, ‘Oh, the Jews!</span> <span id="s1296">Look at what they have!’</span> <span id="s1297">I even told my husband when he bought the house in Fairfield, in an area of, err, um, those days when we came to this country, er, Jews weren’t allowed to, to, to buy a house there.</span> <span id="s1298">I says, ‘Can you imagine I will buy a house there and some day- OHHH!</span> <span id="s1299">- do you know what they can do to us?</span> <span id="s1300">You see, it’s, it’s something that it, it’s, it’s ALWAYS, ALWAYS will be with us.</span> <span id="s1301">I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1302">I’m afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: You live in Fairfield or Bridgeport- it’s on the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: ...Park Avenue, the right side is Bridgeport, the left side is Fairfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: I suppose you...dreamt about what happened in Europe when you came and through the years-,</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: How many times!</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Do you dream about it more now than---in the 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: No.</span> <span id="s1309">No.</span> <span id="s1310">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Was it stronger then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: ...yes.</span> <span id="s1313">Ohhhhh!</span> <span id="s1314">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1315">We used to scream.</span> <span id="s1316">Used to holler.</span> <span id="s1317">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1318">Terribly nightmares.</span> <span id="s1319">And that’s why when all these friends of mine, they collecting from the, from the German government- I couldn’t go through with that.</span> <span id="s1320">‘Cause I had to tell them from the very beginning and I just couldn’t go through with it.</span> <span id="s1321">I said, ‘Uh.</span> <span id="s1322">I don’t want their money.</span> <span id="s1323">I don’t want their money.</span> <span id="s1324">I, I, I don’t want to go to the German doctors there.’</span> <span id="s1325">I wasn’t strong enough, that’s all (heavy sigh- soft moan),</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: But you were strong enough to make your life again here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1328">Yes.</span> <span id="s1329">Number one, we were young.</span> <span id="s1330">Thank Hashem, we were healthy.</span> <span id="s1331">That was a big help.</span> <span id="s1332">And, naturally we knew that uh, we have to make our lives there, uhh where we, where we were- when where we settled, you know, and naturally they will help the shul and all the organizations, so, so had to, we had to do something- that, eh, not just help ourselves.</span> <span id="s1333">Help others too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: When you think back about your life, what are you most proud of?</span> <span id="s1335">What are you most pleased with, what achievement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: The achievement, financially, the achievement that, uhhh, we had-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">End of Tape #1, Side B Tape #2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: That you gave her (daughter) a Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: A Jewish education plus the, uhh, 4-5 years of college because she went for her master’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: At Boston U also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Boston, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1342">And very proud of her as far as education is concerned.</span> <span id="s1343">Otherwise I’m still mad at her in my heart.</span> <span id="s1344">And she knows that.</span> <span id="s1345">And many times when holiday, high holiday comes she makes such a big thing that everything should look like she, she had it had home, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: But does she feel...</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Ohhhh (heavy sigh).</span> <span id="s1348">It doesn’t help much.</span> <span id="s1349">(her voice drops-) It doesn’t help much.</span> <span id="s1350">(oh, ?</span> <span id="s1351">G-d)</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Is she interested, though, in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: She’s a teacher, she has to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1354">She’s, she’s a History teacher and English, naturally, and then, so- everything she teaches.</span> <span id="s1355">The Holocaust and they have all the, uhh, the, the tapes, the, uhh, Genesis.</span> <span id="s1356">Everything.</span> <span id="s1357">She shows the, the, uhh, the students about it and teaching them as much- you can imagine, a Jewish teacher, you do anything and everything to make sure that, their, her students, to, to know and to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1358">And she asked many questions.</span> <span id="s1359">Her father was able to tell, but I, I could never sit down and, and, and first of all, I didn’t want to scare her.</span> <span id="s1360">And second of all, for some reason, I wasn’t strong enough to, to tell her from A to Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Do you regret that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Today, yes.</span> <span id="s1363">Now you know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Do you go on vacations?</span> <span id="s1365">...here- do you go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeh, I went last year to Israel for Pesach, the year before to Miami, but when my husband was alive, this time was the, the busiest season for the goyims, uh, Easter and, and the Jewish Pesach.</span> <span id="s1367">So we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1368">Summertime, when we closed up for the week, we ended up in the Catskills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Where do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: What year?</span> <span id="s1373">In the 7-60’s, 70’s</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: I would say you went to the Pioneer or the Pine View.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: No.</span> <span id="s1376">Stevensville- because we have, uh, a Greenspan family in Fairfield and their son is a rabbi and we asked him, ‘what do you think for us-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: He said it’s kosher, it’s okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1379">And we did enjoy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Was it the right decision that you feel, to go to Bridgeport, C.T.?</span> <span id="s1381">Should you have stayed in NYC?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: No.</span> <span id="s1383">No.</span> <span id="s1384">It was a very, very- the only thing that, uhm, when my daughter was interviewed to go to Yeshiva University, she came home so upset, ‘mother, they ask such terrible personal questions, uhh,- if you have a boyfriend, you, you, you have sex with your boyfriend-‘ and, you know, she was, she was really a real typical VIRGIN!</span> <span id="s1385">‘This question-OHHHH- I was so embarrassed over-‘ and that was the reason she didn’t want to go to them.</span> <span id="s1386">But believe me, I, I was hoping and and praying that she should go there.</span> <span id="s1387">But then again, who knows.</span> <span id="s1388">She went to Boston University also a lot of Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1389">She meet a lovely boy.</span> <span id="s1390">So it could happen, it could have happened in a, Yeshiva University, too, that she would meet somebody and divorce.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: I guess she doesn’t have this feeling that you described- maybe it’s because she wasn’t born in Europe that when it comes to goyim, it’s hard to trust them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Kept on telling, she was 5 years of age when I keep saying.</span> <span id="s1393">She went to Nursery school.</span> <span id="s1394">When she graduated from grammar school, a, uh, a little, uhhh, shaygetzly ask her to go to the prom with him.</span> <span id="s1395">And, she, she came home and she was so scared.</span> <span id="s1396">‘You know what, mother?’</span> <span id="s1397">I said, ‘NO way.</span> <span id="s1398">You CAN”T DO THAT!’</span> <span id="s1399">And we, we explain to her.</span> <span id="s1400">Alright, so finally she, she had a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1401">But she cared for this, this Christian boy.</span> <span id="s1402">Ohhh (heavy sigh).</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: It’s American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yes, American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Has she ever been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: No (whispers) this was my problem because, uhm, every, every time she was ready to go, always something was going on, and as a mother I was worried, you know.</span> <span id="s1407">‘Don’t go this time, you go next time,’-alright?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Do you feel you tried to protect her too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1410">Much, too much.</span> <span id="s1411">And that’s no good.</span> <span id="s1412">No good.</span> <span id="s1413">Now I, now I see it’s no good.</span> <span id="s1414">When it’s too late-Ohhhh!</span> <span id="s1415">(heavy sigh).</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: ...why do you have a photograph of the Lubavitcher Rebbe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">AS: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1418">I feel very close to him, to the Lubavitcher organization.</span> <span id="s1419">Very close.</span> <span id="s1420">And when this was a booth in the airport in, in Israel, and I went there, and I had some money left over, Israeli money.</span> <span id="s1421">So, ‘I’m not gonna take it home, so I’m gonna buy something.’</span> <span id="s1422">In the meantime, uhh, they didn’t have change, so I said, ‘I’m gonna pick up change and I come back.’</span> <span id="s1423">They probably thought I would never come back.</span> <span id="s1424">So, uh, ‘what shall I buy?’</span> <span id="s1425">I kept looking, looking.</span> <span id="s1426">So I says, ‘you know what?</span> <span id="s1427">You have those little, um, candelabras,’ you know when we travel, to light candles, wherever I go.</span> <span id="s1428">So I said, ‘Give me two, for me and two for my daughter.</span> <span id="s1429">And here is all the money, and you do whatever you want with it,’ So, ‘No, wait a minute I give you a picture, also.’</span> <span id="s1430">So- it’s with me ALL the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: That picture, you have it in your-purse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: And I feel so safe, no matter where I go.</span> <span id="s1433">Isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s1434">(she laughs.)</span> <span id="s1435">Conclusion of Interview (See notes next page).</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Interviewer Notes I made a decision to interview Mrs. Gevirtz quite by accident.</span> <span id="s1437">What happened was that I was taking a walk with Henny and a woman from England approached us and introduced Mrs. Gevirtz to us as her roommate here, and told us that she thought that it would be very interesting for Mrs. Gevirtz to tell her story.</span> <span id="s1438">I asked Mrs. Gevirtz if she would do so.</span> <span id="s1439">And she replied, ‘Yes’ although not with a great deal of enthusiasm.</span> <span id="s1440">It was almost as though it was an afterthought for her.</span> <span id="s1441">She was doing it because I asked her.</span> <span id="s1442">Mrs. Gevirtz presents herself as a very refined, intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s1443">You can see that she was once very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1444">She dresses impeccably.</span> <span id="s1445">She is very well groomed.</span> <span id="s1446">Her clothing is of high quality.</span> <span id="s1447">And when she was interviewed she responded in a very polite manner.</span> <span id="s1448">She was prompt.</span> <span id="s1449">She showed up at the interview.</span> <span id="s1450">And yet, there is a great sadness in her big blue eyes.</span> <span id="s1451">A great sadness that reflects all the years of suffering that she has had.</span> <span id="s1452">But there’s also a certain brutal frankness you have the sense that here’s a woman who has deep feelings, deep emotions and who is very serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">End of Tape #2, Side A Conclusion of Interviewer Notes</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">PAGE USHMM Archives
