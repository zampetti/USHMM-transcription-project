normal, nice life.</span> <span id="s128">We knew each other.</span> <span id="s129">It was friendly.</span> <span id="s130">It was welcome.</span> <span id="s131">We never had a door locked.</span> <span id="s132">The doors were always open and unlocked.</span> <span id="s133">And we had a lot of friends among the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s134">That they were always welcome in the

outings and every, every so often meetings.</span> <span id="s143">I, there was a library.</span> <span id="s144">I was working in the library.</span> <span id="s145">When it was open to public, two days a week.</span> <span id="s146">But, there was always people, it was all kind of organizations.</span> <span id="s147">We had the Bittah, we had the Ashomerits(ph) ______, we had the Zionist, other organizations.</span> <span id="s148">People were coming for meetings.</span> <span id="s149">We had always speakers coming from other towns together.</span> <span id="s150">And it was always meetings and there was almost, if we would have, we didn't have more time because in the time that we were in school, there was not time.</span> <span id="s151">And later on, we were going from, we used to go this town there is something going on.</span> <span id="s152">A kid knows this town there is something.</span> <span id="s153">People used to come to our town, always we go to other towns.</span> <span id="s154">And it was, we knew the surrounding, around small towns always, too.</span> <span id="s155">It was a very friendly way of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Were you aware, before the Germans came in, of what was going on in Germany and, did you know about Hitler, did you know about any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes, we knew because we always had a newspaper in the house from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s158">We didn't have a newspaper printed in our town, but we used to have the newspaper from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s159">It was a Jewish newspaper.</span> <span id="s160">We knew, but we would, we would never believe that can something happen.</span> <span id="s161">There can be a change in our life.</span> <span id="s162">We would never believe it.</span> <span id="s163">I, even the day when it happened, we did not believe what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s164">There was, it's a very, I would say like this, when you live in a home that you got everything, nothing is missing except, I said, we missed our father very much in life.</span> <span id="s165">That nobody can chase us out of the house.</span> <span id="s166">Nobody can take away from us anything.</span> <span id="s167">It's ours.</span> <span id="s168">It belongs to us.</span> <span id="s169">And we have such good neighbors and we have such good people around us.</span> <span id="s170">All our workers in the tannery, they were so devoted to us.</span> <span id="s171">And even, we had a maid, she was 16 years with us.</span> <span id="s172">She raised us, she spoke Yiddish just like we did.</span> <span id="s173">And we were so, we were so well known in town.</span> <span id="s174">That we couldn't understand that something could happen to us.</span> <span id="s175">And the day that the war broke out, we were having a good time in our garden.</span> <span id="s176">We were all sitting, boys and girls, we were having a good time.</span> <span id="s177">And all of a sudden they come and they say the war, a war broke out.</span> <span id="s178">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s179">We ran home to the houses and we couldn't understand what happened here.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: When you say the war broke out, are you talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: 1939.</span> <span id="s182">September, 1939.</span> <span id="s183">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s184">We weren't ready for it.</span> <span id="s185">We weren't, we didn't know there is, we didn't know what a war means even.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So, maybe you can tell me what happened.</span> <span id="s187">What you did at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, everybody went to their house and I came and everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s189">They were afraid, for example, we won't have any news what's going on because they were confiscating the radios.</span> <span id="s190">And I went into the Commandant from the town, which was a neighbor and he was, we were very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s191">And I asked him, please see they should not take away our radio.</span> <span id="s192">This is a coincidence, I can never forget it, and he said, okay, I'll let you have it.</span> <span id="s193">And my brother was crying, they wanted to take away his motorcycle.</span> <span id="s194">He was the only one in town he had a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s195">And they wanted to confiscate it, his motorcycle, to mobilize.</span> <span id="s196">And he said, let him hide, I'll stay behind.</span> <span id="s197">It was a lot of things that happened, but we had the privileges to benefit from people that we knew that they will help us.</span> <span id="s198">And that's when, but, it didn't take too long when the Russians marched in.</span> <span id="s199">Then we started to feel problems.</span> <span id="s200">Because we knew that we will be the ones who will suffer more than anybody else.</span> <span id="s201">The day of Forshoshona(ph), we were all in the temple, did not know what's going on.</span> <span id="s202">And we came out from the temple, we see tanks are coming in, armies coming in and they are Russians.</span> <span id="s203">So, of course, then we started to feel war, we were confused, we didn't what is going, what will be with us.</span> <span id="s204">And we had a lot of certain experience without, without protection.</span> <span id="s205">Because they did send out the police and the Commandant and everything, they send them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s206">And we had nobody, no protection over us, to watch us.</span> <span id="s207">So, there was a lot of certain bad experiences.</span> <span id="s208">But we did overcome that until it became worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Well, you were under the Russians for two years almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: It became, they gave it to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s213">We became Lithuanians, we not no more Poles.</span> <span id="s214">The Lithuanians took it over.</span> <span id="s215">And they forced us to go to learn, if anybody did not speak Lithuanian, if you got any problems, they really used to beat us up.</span> <span id="s216">And we started to study, but the language, before Lithuanian, we started to study Russian.</span> <span id="s217">And then in no time, we became Lithuanian, so we had to learn Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s218">The Lithuanian language and there was, a very, very hard language to learn.</span> <span id="s219">So, there was a very, very hard, but there was freedom.</span> <span id="s220">We still, people used to travel overseas.</span> <span id="s221">People could, I could, we could travel.</span> <span id="s222">We were going to Vilna, we were going to Kovna(ph), Kovna was before we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s223">We could travel all over.</span> <span id="s224">And then it started a lot of coming from other towns because they that from Lithuania you can leave the country for travel, for going farther if you wanted to go to the United States or something.</span> <span id="s225">It wasn't easy, but you could make it yet.</span> <span id="s226">Which, where the Germans were occupational, where the Russians were occupied, you could not travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So, the Russians weren't in control?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: A very short time, a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So, how did this affect your life?</span> <span id="s230">Your family was fairly affluent and under the Lithuanians and the Russians, did they allow all of this privilege?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No.</span> <span id="s232">My, the whole family, from the time that the Russians were, my family did not sleep at home.</span> <span id="s233">I was the only one, we were raising a little boy from our cousin from Vilna, he had to study to be Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s234">So we brought him to our house, it was a open house.</span> <span id="s235">Always family, always people.</span> <span id="s236">And we were teaching him the Bar Mitvah, to be.</span> <span id="s237">So, I'm the only one with him, I slept, we slept in the house.</span> <span id="s238">Because the police department was very close to our home.</span> <span id="s239">And I used to stay up until 2:00 and if I didn't see a stationwagon near the police, it means they are not going to come for us.</span> <span id="s240">Then I used to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s241">But I used to cry a lot and the little boy used to always come to me and comfort me.</span> <span id="s242">Mira, why are you crying?</span> <span id="s243">Why are you crying?</span> <span id="s244">I said, it's okay, I want to cry because mother is not home.</span> <span id="s245">Or my mother will come, I won't cry any more.</span> <span id="s246">So, they used to sleep always in different places.</span> <span id="s247">My two brothers and my mother, and I used to stay home and watch the house.</span> <span id="s248">And that time, that was a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s249">We didn't know that can come worse.</span> <span id="s250">And, that was very hard.</span> <span id="s251">We knew that any day we'll be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s252">We knew it.</span> <span id="s253">And it wouldn't take long, if they would stay longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So, they took away your business, the tannery?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: The tannery, yes.</span> <span id="s256">They nationalized the tannery.</span> <span id="s257">They, everything was sold out quickly.</span> <span id="s258">They, when the Russians marched in, the next day, when we got up, we saw a line that we thought they will push away our house.</span> <span id="s259">They were all lined up to get in to buy the merchandise.</span> <span id="s260">The leather.</span> <span id="s261">And we were used that everybody comes in to buy what they need.</span> <span id="s262">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s263">You can't even, they would like to buy, they didn't have it.</span> <span id="s264">So, they told us there is things, they want as much as they could take.</span> <span id="s265">Take it.</span> <span id="s266">So, it didn't take too long to sell out everything, in a couple of days, it was all empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Now, who bought this?</span> <span id="s268">The Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: The Russians.</span> <span id="s270">Until, this was when, until, then after, Lithuania was no problem.</span> <span id="s271">Business was going on as normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So, how soon did the Russians actually move in?</span> <span id="s273">Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It was in September, I don't remember the date exactly.</span> <span id="s275">But I know that as we came out from the temple, and we saw the Russians marching in and we didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s276">What are they doing?</span> <span id="s277">There was going to be a war with the Germans.</span> <span id="s278">How come the Russians are marching in?</span> <span id="s279">Because they took it over before, in Warsaw the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s280">The Poles were still fighting with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So, this was 1940, the fall of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s283">This is still in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: The Russians came in in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s286">They marched into our place, to our, right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So, you weren't under the Lithuanians very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s289">We were from '40 until '41.</span> <span id="s290">Until '41 we were Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s292">So, you're considering the Lithuanians and the Russians the same?</span> <span id="s293">This is where I'm getting confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: When you say you were under the Lithuanians and that wasn't bad, and then the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s297">The Russians came before Lithuania.</span> <span id="s298">The Russians marched in when the war on Poland was still fighting.</span> <span id="s299">There was, the war started in September, and it was before the holidays, our holidays, and then in, I don't know exactly the time, but in a few weeks they were there.</span> <span id="s300">In a week or two weeks, the Russians marched in.</span> <span id="s301">And then they gave it to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s302">After they moved, they did not move out, but they were going farther to Lithuania and they actually, the ones that remained is the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s303">Only Lithuanians, no more Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: But was Lithuania...</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Under the Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Now, when your town was under the control of the Russians and the Lithuanians, could you continue practicing your religion?</span> <span id="s307">Was that a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No problem.</span> <span id="s309">We could practice religion, we were, we could, the temples were open.</span> <span id="s310">The schools were open.</span> <span id="s311">It was a normal life.</span> <span id="s312">We could travel.</span> <span id="s313">There was, the only, maybe the poor people could feel it more because there was a scarce in food product.</span> <span id="s314">There was a problem with exchanging food.</span> <span id="s315">If you had something worth to exchange, you got the food, whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s316">Because the farmers used to come to town and bring food.</span> <span id="s317">But you had to give them something, they did not want to take money.</span> <span id="s318">They wanted exchange.</span> <span id="s319">And the problem was for the poor people.</span> <span id="s320">So this is what for some other ones, it was a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s321">I remember we had a cow always in the house.</span> <span id="s322">Now, when we milk the cow, we always used to take it to take to everybody of the neighbors, annoying some people that they need it, to give it away.</span> <span id="s323">To help them because they could not buy it.</span> <span id="s324">This was for some people a little, they felt that people, the poor people felt it more than did people that were well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: But on the other hand, your mother and your brothers had to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Not for the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s327">For the time of the Russians, but they weren't too long with us.</span> <span id="s328">It was long enough because we knew we are afraid, it was long enough.</span> <span id="s329">But, not, they weren't too long.</span> <span id="s330">The Lithuanians took it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So, do you remember how long the Russians were, their presence was there?</span> <span id="s332">Was it a few months, a few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, a few months.</span> <span id="s334">A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And then after they left, your mother could come home?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: We were home all day, just at night we didn't sleep, because most of the taking out of people sent to Siberia, was at night.</span> <span id="s337">In the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s338">But during the day, we were always watching ourselves.</span> <span id="s339">Always looking in the back, but not, it was normal.</span> <span id="s340">The only problem was because we knew that at night, someday we will have to disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Do you remember what you talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: We tried not to talk too much, because we couldn't trust, it's a very funny situation, you could not trust your neighbor.</span> <span id="s343">You could not trust anybody.</span> <span id="s344">Because there were meetings constantly, for example, in the, in town.</span> <span id="s345">In the Piatza(ph).</span> <span id="s346">And when they used to come to talk, if we didn't go out to listen, they used to say, oh, it's too good for them.</span> <span id="s347">They don't even come to see it.</span> <span id="s348">To listen.</span> <span id="s349">And if we went, we always had somebody in the back watching us.</span> <span id="s350">If we clap our hands proper.</span> <span id="s351">If we are happy.</span> <span id="s352">And if we were happy, they used to say, they are still happy.</span> <span id="s353">It's, they're still better off, they're still happy.</span> <span id="s354">Whatever we did was wrong, we couldn't know which direction.</span> <span id="s355">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">End of tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: When you said, it'll be a minute before we start, but, when you're talking...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">I'm rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: You're rolling?</span> <span id="s361">Okay.</span> <span id="s362">You were saying that you would go out in the square and people were watching you.</span> <span id="s363">This was the Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: The Russians.</span> <span id="s365">The time of the Russians.</span> <span id="s366">For the time of the Lithuanian, I'll tell you an incident for example.</span> <span id="s367">The border between White Russia and Lithuania was only three kilometers from our town.</span> <span id="s368">My brother, the youngest brother, loved animals.</span> <span id="s369">So, he asked to one Pole if he can bring him a nice horse.</span> <span id="s370">And since our tannery was right on the border, it was easy to sneak it in.</span> <span id="s371">And he brought him a horse.</span> <span id="s372">And he went to pick up the horse and bring it to the barn near the house.</span> <span id="s373">I almost, I forgot it, I just, recently when I was in Brazil where my brothers lived, my brother did remind me, do you remember how you saved my life?</span> <span id="s374">And I said what did I do?</span> <span id="s375">He said, don't you remember when I was bringing the horse home and a Lithuanian policeman came up to him and said he wants, where did you get the horse?</span> <span id="s376">Did you bring it from over the border?</span> <span id="s377">And he said, no, I bought it from the tannery and I'm bringing it to the house.</span> <span id="s378">Which was true, he picked it up from the tannery.</span> <span id="s379">But, he said, no, it's a too beautiful horse.</span> <span id="s380">You got it from over, and he wanted to take it away.</span> <span id="s381">And I didn't know what's going on, I was standing in the house in the window and all of a sudden I see he's standing, my brother stays with the horse and he's arguing with the policeman.</span> <span id="s382">And the policeman was grabbing his gun to him.</span> <span id="s383">So, I ran out and I jumped on the policeman and I grabbed, I almost grabbed the gun out of him and pushed him away from my brother.</span> <span id="s384">And then I started, give him the horse, let him take the horse, we get into the house.</span> <span id="s385">There were certain things, some are forgotten and some things come, some remind you of whatever was during the war, certain incidents.</span> <span id="s386">But we were a normal life, we used to go for an evening school, in evening schools we were going, studying the languages.</span> <span id="s387">Until, of course, the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Did you have the business during the Lithuanian occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: The tannery was nationalized.</span> <span id="s390">So, we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s391">But, we did have, we still were going on with some business.</span> <span id="s392">Hidden, there was hidden business, it was not, because my brother used to go to Vilna and bring certain merchandise that we used to sell, but maybe, maybe it would normalize and we would maybe get into business again.</span> <span id="s393">But the business was kind of not normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: But everything else went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah, it could have, eventually we would have a normal life with the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s396">And we would maybe be better off if we would understand each other more.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What about anti-Semitism during the Lithuanian period.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: There was.</span> <span id="s399">We always felt it.</span> <span id="s400">We always did.</span> <span id="s401">But, we always, we used to translate it maybe because they don't understand us.</span> <span id="s402">But, the Lithuanians always they had a record of being anti-Semitists.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: How would that manifest itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: We always had to watch, to know that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s405">We always had to know about it.</span> <span id="s406">That we are not, we are second-hand citizens.</span> <span id="s407">We're told the privileges that we had.</span> <span id="s408">We are not, we weren't too much at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Was that troublesome?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I, yes, because, but we did not feel it as bad because a lot of refugees were coming in, every night, every night, they used to come in and stop in our house.</span> <span id="s411">They were running away from the occupation of where the Germans occupied already.</span> <span id="s412">And they used to tell stories that, what we felt was nothing.</span> <span id="s413">We still were in our homes, we had our belongings, we were, we lived a normal life and we happy we could help them.</span> <span id="s414">There wasn't a night that people should not come in from the borders.</span> <span id="s415">So, our trouble wasn't as bad as the other ones, what we felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Tell me about how all of this changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Well, you've been saying that this wasn't so bad until the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Until the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s420">Because the Germans, in 1941, that was in June, and we saw all of a sudden, a big movement in our town because our town was the main road from Vilna Lider(ph), from Lithuania to ______________.</span> <span id="s421">And all of a sudden we see a lot of movement, that a lot of trucks are running through our town and we did not know what is going on.</span> <span id="s422">And we, of course, any truck that stopped, we went to ask them what is going on.</span> <span id="s423">And they say, you don't know?</span> <span id="s424">The Germans declared war.</span> <span id="s425">And they are, they were running back to Russia, because Lithuania was full of Russian people.</span> <span id="s426">They were under their command.</span> <span id="s427">And so we knew that, we actually found out that there is going to be a war again.</span> <span id="s428">There was news that the Russians, that the Lithuanians are killing the Russians.</span> <span id="s429">They are throwing them into the ocean.</span> <span id="s430">Because they actually want friends, they didn't like them.</span> <span id="s431">It was just superficial that they lived in harmony.</span> <span id="s432">They were, they wanted to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s433">And they, and the war, early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in.</span> <span id="s434">Because, and I remember I had a cousin that was in the Polish Army and we didn't sleep that night.</span> <span id="s435">We were standing and talking, what will it be, what will he do?</span> <span id="s436">What is going on?</span> <span id="s437">We did not know what to expect.</span> <span id="s438">And we heard, I heard, like somebody would play with rocks, the noise like you throw rocks, so I says, but what is this noise?</span> <span id="s439">Do you hear?</span> <span id="s440">What is it?</span> <span id="s441">They said, they are throwing parachutes.</span> <span id="s442">And he said, you'll see.</span> <span id="s443">Because he knew, he was in the army, he understood better than we did.</span> <span id="s444">They are parachuting some people here.</span> <span id="s445">And in no time they will march in.</span> <span id="s446">And it didn't take too long, and in the morning, the Germans started to march in.</span> <span id="s447">So, we left the house and we went to some of our workers.</span> <span id="s448">We stayed there all day.</span> <span id="s449">And then we decided we have to go to our house.</span> <span id="s450">To see what, what will it be with us?</span> <span id="s451">Of course, in those times there was no, no camps, no death camps, nothing.</span> <span id="s452">They just, well, people lived under the German occupations.</span> <span id="s453">It was scary.</span> <span id="s454">There was a lot of things going on.</span> <span id="s455">But, we did not expect what we had later on.</span> <span id="s456">And, but we came home and we lived for awhile.</span> <span id="s457">On the second day, for example, I was standing in the window and a couple of Germans walked up to us and one German looks up and I had a watch in my hand.</span> <span id="s458">And he said, give me the watch.</span> <span id="s459">I'm in my house, why should I give him the watch?</span> <span id="s460">I couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s461">So, I said, no.</span> <span id="s462">And my brother heard it and came, he said, take off the watch and give it to him in a hurry.</span> <span id="s463">Don't you know what this is?</span> <span id="s464">He takes a Jew in a minute.</span> <span id="s465">You'll be dead.</span> <span id="s466">Give him the watch.</span> <span id="s467">So, of course, I took off the watch and I give it to him.</span> <span id="s468">But I still thought, yeah, we are somebody in our homes, I don't have to give it to him.</span> <span id="s469">And then it didn't matter, they could take whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s470">But, we were in one way lucky.</span> <span id="s471">Because our house was in the middle of the town and it was very big.</span> <span id="s472">It was a two story and as they were coming in more and more, they occupied for the main stop, for the main office, so the Germans, the very important Germans used to stay in our house.</span> <span id="s473">And right away they put up a note, that nobody is allowed to come in there.</span> <span id="s474">So, we actually did not suffer too much.</span> <span id="s475">In a way, they used to take out some people.</span> <span id="s476">For example, if a man with a beard, they used to follow him if he went to the temple, and then cut his beard off or beat him up or something.</span> <span id="s477">We did not feel it in our house because nobody was allowed, the access wasn't allowed to come into our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So, it was the German army that was sharing part of your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s480">The army, the main, from the main lines of their, until the year, they stayed until they almost marched into Leningrad.</span> <span id="s481">Our house was occupied.</span> <span id="s482">And, as a matter of fact, there were certain things I had to make for them, like cut up vegetables and this.</span> <span id="s483">But, we felt kind of, we didn't feel what some other people, get the problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Now, when you went out of the house, was there a big German presence on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Not big, not big.</span> <span id="s486">But there were always Germans, yes.</span> <span id="s487">And, at that time, was formed the _____________.</span> <span id="s488">And people had to go to work.</span> <span id="s489">There was not specially, but they had, they had to give somebody something to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: You?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I didn't, I did not have to go, but I volunteered to go.</span> <span id="s492">I did.</span> <span id="s493">I didn't want to be any different.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Cleaned the street, pull out grass.</span> <span id="s496">Go, there was _____________, but they had to employ people.</span> <span id="s497">Just to sit in the sun and burn yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Was there any brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: There was in town.</span> <span id="s500">There was.</span> <span id="s501">We did not, we did not get to it, but there was brutality.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Did they close the synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: As far as I remember, they were not closed.</span> <span id="s506">But, I know there was incidents where they took out and I think this is because there was, if anybody from the Poles that had, was mad at you, they used to get together to transfer to the Germans, and they used to come to this and this house, where was mad somebody, and take them out, for example, to the cemetery and shoot over his head.</span> <span id="s507">Just, just to, they did not kill anybody, but to torture them.</span> <span id="s508">To put a fear in them.</span> <span id="s509">This I know.</span> <span id="s510">I heard it.</span> <span id="s511">We used to hear a lot about it.</span> <span id="s512">Is they cut the beard off this, they did this, just torturing certain people.</span> <span id="s513">But, there was no, were no casualties in those times, until the day came.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Were there special rules that were put in place?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s516">We had to put on the yellow _________ on our arms.</span> <span id="s517">We could not walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s518">And as this progressed further, the Poles were not allowed to come to sell us anything.</span> <span id="s519">We couldn't, we were not allowed, they weren't allowed to bring to sell something to Jews.</span> <span id="s520">We, especially, did not feel it as much because we had so many friends around the Poles, that even if they had to risk their life, they used to bring us anyway.</span> <span id="s521">The war would go on and out of 20 years, we would have plenty of food in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So your Polish friends didn't turn on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No.</span> <span id="s524">No.</span> <span id="s525">Until the last, even the last days, but our neighbor, when my mother wanted to hide one night at our neighbors, and we were such devoted, close friends, she did not let even my mother to sleep overnight.</span> <span id="s526">She said she can't let her in.</span> <span id="s527">She said she can't let her in.</span> <span id="s528">But our workers were very devoted until the last day.</span> <span id="s529">That's very unusual, very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So, when you say the last day, what does that mean?</span> <span id="s531">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: That was the day there was __________________.</span> <span id="s533">In the morning for, before our High Holidays.</span> <span id="s534">This was in 1941.</span> <span id="s535">I and one of our neighbors, we said, we have to clean, they were very much concentrated on clean ______________ in town.</span> <span id="s536">And we had a big yard in front, so we got up in the morning and I said to this young girl, you'll help me and we'll clean the good in front very thoroughly, so tomorrow, we won't have to work.</span> <span id="s537">Because there was, it would have been a big tragedy on _________________ to do something.</span> <span id="s538">We weren't used to.</span> <span id="s539">Everything was closed and everybody were in the temples.</span> <span id="s540">And as we were doing it, one of our relatives came running to the house and she started to cry, oh, my God, oh, what will we do, what will, I says, what happened, what happened?</span> <span id="s541">She said, didn't you see all the notices that are put on the walls who has money, who has gold, who has silver, who has materials, who has leather, whatever it is, they should bring it in to the police.</span> <span id="s542">And this is a sign they are going to do something to us.</span> <span id="s543">They'll make it like nobody told about killing.</span> <span id="s544">They make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s545">And it started a big commotion in town, everybody was running to the police bringing in some whatever they want.</span> <span id="s546">Whatever they could hide, they were.</span> <span id="s547">They were already hidden.</span> <span id="s548">We already gave it away to some among our Polish friends to hide a lot of things.</span> <span id="s549">But, whatever we had, we were going and bringing it in to the police.</span> <span id="s550">And, this was going on all morning, and then a lot of people started to leave town.</span> <span id="s551">And then we heard that two sisters got killed.</span> <span id="s552">They were trying to leave the town.</span> <span id="s553">And they caught them and they killed, and this stopped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s554">But, we still did not, my mother still ordered my two brothers and we had two refugees, young men, that they ran away from the occupation of the Germans where they occupied before us.</span> <span id="s555">And they got dressed a lot of clothes, and she told them where to go, to one of a shoemaker that he used to be a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s556">And it was only about a kilometer and a half from town.</span> <span id="s557">They should go there and stay there until we see what will come out.</span> <span id="s558">We still didn't know what is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s559">And as they, and were sure that they left already.</span> <span id="s560">They got dressed and left.</span> <span id="s561">And my sister, we brought my sister from, my sister was married in White Russia.</span> <span id="s562">We brought her from there with the two children because her husband was taken away right the first week when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s563">They occupied their town and they took away, the took the doctors and the lawyers and the teachers.</span> <span id="s564">He was a teacher.</span> <span id="s565">And they took him right away, they killed him, but we did not know that.</span> <span id="s566">All the time the told, the explanation was they took him for work someplace.</span> <span id="s567">And every day we used to send somebody to, they used to say they're working near Warsaw, so we send somebody near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s568">They weren't there.</span> <span id="s569">They said, oh, they left yesterday.</span> <span id="s570">They transferred them to another place, they transferred them there.</span> <span id="s571">We couldn't find him anywhere, until we, it took a long time until we realized that they killed him.</span> <span id="s572">And so my sister, there was no exchange, they didn't have what to exchange, so she, we brought her to our house and she lived with us.</span> <span id="s573">And my sister, we arranged, my mother arranged that my sister and the children should go to one of our workers to stay there.</span> <span id="s574">And I and mother did remain in the house.</span> <span id="s575">And I was running from one house to another house where there were fathers to see what are they doing.</span> <span id="s576">Maybe they know better than we what we know.</span> <span id="s577">And they kept saying, one said, where can I run?</span> <span id="s578">I have to go to more ask for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s579">So, how can I run?</span> <span id="s580">And others says, how can we run?</span> <span id="s581">Look at my old mother, she can't work, she's in bed most of the time.</span> <span id="s582">I went into another girlfriend, I said, Myrtle, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s583">How can I run?</span> <span id="s584">My daughter is pregnant.</span> <span id="s585">The brought her from Lider(ph), from the bigger towns, they pulled out people and brought to the small towns because they're still, and those were, I'm talking all about the wealthier people.</span> <span id="s586">Where can I run?</span> <span id="s587">Look at her, she is to have a baby any day.</span> <span id="s588">Where can I run?</span> <span id="s589">I'm not running.</span> <span id="s590">I'll stay.</span> <span id="s591">And I was running around like this all day, not knowing what, what will it come out.</span> <span id="s592">And then I came, I got tired, and I came, it was getting a little dark.</span> <span id="s593">I came into the house and my mother was going to light the candles.</span> <span id="s594">And I look out through the window and I see civilian people who _______________ on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s595">So, I got very frightened.</span> <span id="s596">I thought, gee, that's not, that's not normal.</span> <span id="s597">They are not Germans, they are civilians.</span> <span id="s598">So, I kept yelling, I yelled out to my mother, you _____________, let's run.</span> <span id="s599">But we weren't ready, where to run also.</span> <span id="s600">So, we ran, we thought we will go to one of our workers, to get united with my sister and the children.</span> <span id="s601">But, by coincidence, in the morning, we had a lot of money in the house.</span> <span id="s602">And we decided to go hide it where the tannery is.</span> <span id="s603">Because the tannery is in the back of the town.</span> <span id="s604">If we need money, we can sooner dig it out.</span> <span id="s605">Like in town, everybody is watching over you.</span> <span id="s606">As I and my brother were going to take the, with a whole basket of money that we carried, we put a stick in and he carried from one side, I from the other side.</span> <span id="s607">One of the Pole, a Pole that was coming from church, this was on Sunday, and he gets, comes closer to us and says, _________________, I feel so bad, I hear that it's a bad time coming on us, on you.</span> <span id="s608">And if you want, come, run to me.</span> <span id="s609">To my farm.</span> <span id="s610">But we never knew where a farm is out of town, we never went out of town.</span> <span id="s611">We never went anywhere, we didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s612">So, that was in the afternoon, and then at night, we decided, and I said to my mother, let's run.</span> <span id="s613">I knew where we have to run to.</span> <span id="s614">To be united with my sister because my brothers we knew are hidden there.</span> <span id="s615">I, we couldn't run through the front door, we went to the back door.</span> <span id="s616">And I did not look around, I just opened the barn door, and I ran, it was not too far because it was a small town, anyplace was not that far.</span> <span id="s617">My mother looked around and she found my brothers, sitting in the barn.</span> <span id="s618">And she says, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s619">They say they couldn't leave town because there was, there were rumors that they are shooting.</span> <span id="s620">So, we returned back home.</span> <span id="s621">So she said to them, what is my life?</span> <span id="s622">My life doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s623">If you don't save yourself, what does it mean to me?</span> <span id="s624">So, she said, go to the garden, we had a big garden in the, right after the houses.</span> <span id="s625">And she said to them, go in the garden.</span> <span id="s626">Lay down under the leaves from the cucumbers because they are very big now.</span> <span id="s627">And, see, at night if you can get out.</span> <span id="s628">And she did, in the meantime, she didn't, I left.</span> <span id="s629">And when I was running, one of the Poles there, said to me, Mirchka(ph), where are you running?</span> <span id="s630">You'll get shot, don't run.</span> <span id="s631">I'll tell you, I'll get into, where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s632">I was not smart enough, and I told them where I'm running.</span> <span id="s633">I wasn't supposed to say where I'm running.</span> <span id="s634">But, I told them, I'm going to the Vladik's(ph) house.</span> <span id="s635">And he said, well, I'll get into the house, I'll open up the window in my house, and you jump through the window and then cross the street and get in.</span> <span id="s636">So, he did, he went into the house and opened up the window and I went through the window, I jumped over and I crossed the street and I was reunited with my sister.</span> <span id="s637">And there were three, four, four families more, Jewish families that night.</span> <span id="s638">And, of course, I was with three children, my sister and we had the boy, the cousin from Vilna, and there was a big commotion.</span> <span id="s639">This one to eat and this one to drink and all night we were very busy.</span> <span id="s640">And then in the morning, his wife came out and says that you will all have to leave because I don't want to get killed because of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s642">Let's change the tape.</span> <span id="s643">We'll pick up...</span></p> <p><span id="s644">End of tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: So, I said to her, don't worry, we won't stay here.</span> <span id="s647">I will try, I'll take one child and I'll try to move to the factory.</span> <span id="s648">To the tannery, because it's very close there.</span> <span id="s649">It was close to the tannery, he was working for us, all my live I knew him.</span> <span id="s650">And his brothers were working for us, too.</span> <span id="s651">And, if they'll catch me there, all they can do is kill me.</span> <span id="s652">But I am in my own place so we will not cause trouble to you.</span> <span id="s653">And I got into there, to the house, and I was still thinking about the Pole who gave us the idea to run to his house.</span> <span id="s654">And I also knew from another Pole that came about five days before to our house, and he looked up and we were boarding the sister and the children, and he warned us, he said to my mother, why did you bring your daughter and children here?</span> <span id="s655">The Lithuanians wants a clean Lithuania with no Jews.</span> <span id="s656">And in White Russia, the Jews, I don't know how long, but the Jews who still live in Lithuania, they are going to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s657">And we knew that he is from the more intelligent Poles, not just the farmer, it was a very rich farmer.</span> <span id="s658">But he had children, they were very high rank in the Polish army, all officers.</span> <span id="s659">We knew that he knows something, but the way he expressed it, so, we did not want to accept it.</span> <span id="s660">So, after he left us, my mother said, _________________, he came to our house and eats our supper, _________________.</span> <span id="s661">We couldn't believe it, we didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s662">Who is going to chase us out of the house?</span> <span id="s663">It's ours.</span> <span id="s664">It went from generation to generation.</span> <span id="s665">And he was, he gave us also the idea, the only ones that will survive is people that they will hide.</span> <span id="s666">And my oldest brother, later on, went and he stayed with him for awhile.</span> <span id="s667">But, it was very hard to hide because they all had people working for them, and they knew they will talk to those, they are keeping Jews.</span> <span id="s668">But, as I was in the tannery all the day, then I told my sister, if I pass through right, she should come.</span> <span id="s669">But we did not know where my mother is.</span> <span id="s670">My mother wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s671">We knew that my brothers, I didn't know that they are in town.</span> <span id="s672">We were sure that they are protected.</span> <span id="s673">Because the first thing for the protection was the men.</span> <span id="s674">What we looked.</span> <span id="s675">And as I, and I said to the janitor, where is Marisha(ph)?</span> <span id="s676">Marisha was married to him, she was a maid for us.</span> <span id="s677">And I wanted to go to town and find out where my mother is.</span> <span id="s678">We didn't know what, we didn't know what is going on.</span> <span id="s679">That night, they get out everybody to the temple, all the Jews.</span> <span id="s680">But, we did not know what is going on.</span> <span id="s681">So I said, Leder(ph), go and find out where my mother is.</span> <span id="s682">I thought maybe she went back to the house.</span> <span id="s683">And he said, she is not home and I don't want you here.</span> <span id="s684">So I thought, well, we started to feel more and more that we are not wanted anyplace.</span> <span id="s685">We have no place, we have no way, we don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s686">So, I said, no, I will not be here too long.</span> <span id="s687">And there was a slaughterhouse right near our tannery.</span> <span id="s688">I saw a young man coming out, so there was a hope chest standing in this little house.</span> <span id="s689">And there was even some of our things.</span> <span id="s690">I took out a piece of material for a suit and I called him, I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s691">And I said, if you tell me where Kokochan(ph) is, a village, where the Pole told us that if we want, we should run to him, I will give you this piece of material.</span> <span id="s692">He said, I don't want to be killed.</span> <span id="s693">Because if I'll go with you, I'll get killed.</span> <span id="s694">I said, no you won't.</span> <span id="s695">You go from one side and I go from another side, far away from each other.</span> <span id="s696">And, if they catch me, obviously, they will kill me, but I will never say that you are going with me.</span> <span id="s697">I will never, I promise you, I will not give you out.</span> <span id="s698">And he did, and he showed me where Kokochan is.</span> <span id="s699">I couldn't get into his, into this man's house right away because there were, I saw, there is people are driving around with motorcycles.</span> <span id="s700">And, obviously, I didn't think there is only, there must be Germans, and I cannot ______________, I was hiding in a little forest.</span> <span id="s701">And then, and they left, I went there.</span> <span id="s702">But I asked him to go and bring my sister with the other two children, and she'll give you more things.</span> <span id="s703">She'll pay good off.</span> <span id="s704">And he did, and he brought my sister and the children there.</span> <span id="s705">But, there was, at the time of the Russians, this Pole himself, was hiding, because he was a rich farmer.</span> <span id="s706">So, he was afraid that they will send him out to Siberia, too.</span> <span id="s707">So, he had workers, and the workers did not want us.</span> <span id="s708">They want us out and out and out.</span> <span id="s709">So, we told them that we will not stay.</span> <span id="s710">We only want to know where my mother is.</span> <span id="s711">So, and the owner, the farmer, was not in.</span> <span id="s712">He went to ________________ to see what's going on with the Jews.</span> <span id="s713">What kind of commotion is going on.</span> <span id="s714">So, I said, the minute you will find out where my mother is, we are going to be gone from your house.</span> <span id="s715">We will not stay here.</span> <span id="s716">Not knowing where will we go, what will we do, where is anybody?</span> <span id="s717">I, anyway, they kept, we want you out, we want you out.</span> <span id="s718">So, when he came, he gave us a horse and buggy, next day.</span> <span id="s719">And we were going to move to a village that we knew where the Tartars are.</span> <span id="s720">And they are Muslims.</span> <span id="s721">There was only one small village, but they used to buy leather from us.</span> <span id="s722">So, we thought we will go there meantime, if they will accept us, we don't know.</span> <span id="s723">But at least it's close to White Russia, small town Raddan(ph).</span> <span id="s724">If not, we will have to go to Raddan.</span> <span id="s725">And we came there, I did remain to see what, you'll go to town and you'll find out where my mother is.</span> <span id="s726">He did go and he came with the news that my mother went with all the Jews to the temple.</span> <span id="s727">They are all locked up.</span> <span id="s728">And he said, so my place was, I felt I have to go to see what is with my sister and the children.</span> <span id="s729">We went there, but he was, he brought us every day information.</span> <span id="s730">Where my mother is, where my, he found out that my brothers did not leave the town.</span> <span id="s731">They are hiding in a shoemaker's house in town.</span> <span id="s732">Not too, right around the corner where we lived.</span> <span id="s733">And they are there, they're hidden in the barn.</span> <span id="s734">If they will be able to get out, we don't know.</span> <span id="s735">He said, but if they will be able, they will leave.</span> <span id="s736">Tonight or tomorrow night.</span> <span id="s737">I was, went, I was with my sister there, we had what to eat.</span> <span id="s738">Obviously, they gave us what to eat.</span> <span id="s739">And, but, we don't, we did not know what we should do.</span> <span id="s740">We were absolutely, we didn't know where should we turn, where should we go.</span> <span id="s741">And, then he told us, we didn't know what was going on, but we heard that on Wednesday, they took out all the Jews from the temples there and they brought them out a big market which used to be the, the farmers used to bring in their cattle and their food to sell, there was one, like a farmer's market they called it.</span> <span id="s742">Once a week they used to come there with everything to sell to town.</span> <span id="s743">And my mother is there, too.</span> <span id="s744">We told the people.</span> <span id="s745">We did not know what the fate will, what will be with us, we didn't know what will be with her.</span> <span id="s746">My brothers did not come out yet.</span> <span id="s747">But, next night they did come in, they came in.</span> <span id="s748">They came in, but of course, we knew we cannot be there.</span> <span id="s749">So, we moved to another place, another, it was a mother to this worker of ours.</span> <span id="s750">She took us in for awhile.</span> <span id="s751">And, knowing that is the hardest part, with children, we have three small children.</span> <span id="s752">We have a 13 year old, we have a two and a half and a year.</span> <span id="s753">So, we decided, since we have the horse and buggy that they gave to us, we'll send them to my mother's family.</span> <span id="s754">My mother came from a small town, Liptenshoc(ph).</span> <span id="s755">We'll send them there and there was no ghettos yet.</span> <span id="s756">And we'll see if they will meantime be there until we will know what, until we reunite together.</span> <span id="s757">Until we will see, maybe we will all go to live in White Russia.</span> <span id="s758">With my mother's family.</span> <span id="s759">Because my mother had two sisters and she had two, three brothers.</span> <span id="s760">They were all in small towns there.</span> <span id="s761">And in the meantime, we will be around with them together.</span> <span id="s762">But, it took quite awhile until we got all together.</span> <span id="s763">So, we came and we went to Radden.</span> <span id="s764">It was 14 kilometers from our town.</span> <span id="s765">And in no time, they made a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Let me ask you a question here.</span> <span id="s767">Did you find out what happened to the people who were in the marketplace at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s769">My mother came, she knew everything.</span> <span id="s770">They brought them out, they get out Sunday night.</span> <span id="s771">They brought, near us was a small town where a mental institution for mental people, they put them out in a row, but entering the temple, like in the hall.</span> <span id="s772">And every, and then they announced that everybody should come to the temple.</span> <span id="s773">They can bring in what they carry on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s774">They gave them sticks and they told everybody to hit over their heads.</span> <span id="s775">So, they were beating up everybody.</span> <span id="s776">The name of this town was Shiloch(ph), a small little town.</span> <span id="s777">And then, of course, the brought from another, from Walkinik(ph) was a small town.</span> <span id="s778">They brought Jews from Walkinik, also, to the temple.</span> <span id="s779">And it was very crowded and there were people sick, people having children.</span> <span id="s780">No facilities to go out.</span> <span id="s781">But I heard that one of my girlfriends and the Commandant, the Lithuanian Commandant came to the temple, she went out, because we knew him, and she said to him, give us a way of, live with dignity.</span> <span id="s782">Not, there was no bathrooms, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s783">She says, or kill us.</span> <span id="s784">Pick what you want.</span> <span id="s785">Or kill us or give us a way to live like humans.</span> <span id="s786">And he said, we'll see, we'll see.</span> <span id="s787">That was Sunday night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.</span> <span id="s788">They brought all of the Jews, all of them out from the temple in the market.</span> <span id="s789">The market was closed gates.</span> <span id="s790">And they told everybody to sit down, nobody can stand up.</span> <span id="s791">Now, one man, he was asthmatic and he could not breath.</span> <span id="s792">So he stood up.</span> <span id="s793">And they shot him.</span> <span id="s794">So this was the first casualty in this parking place.</span> <span id="s795">And then, in no time, mother was there.</span> <span id="s796">Now, we weren't there, but every day that Polish man used to bring us all the news.</span> <span id="s797">They started to gather, they went through and they picked all the young men and the strong men, young and strong.</span> <span id="s798">And they told them they're taking, their wives, they're taking them for work.</span> <span id="s799">There was a big farm near Ashashoc(ph), where the owner wasn't there already because they sent him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s800">But of course, the ground, the people tried to keep it up.</span> <span id="s801">And they took them there to work and they forced them to write letters to their wives, they are okay and they are alive and they are working.</span> <span id="s802">But, the name was Sacluski(ph), they were working on Sacluski's farm.</span> <span id="s803">That wasn't true.</span> <span id="s804">Because the minute they got them out, they had dug all of the ditches.</span> <span id="s805">Near the cemetery.</span> <span id="s806">And they took them and they shot them there.</span> <span id="s807">They brought us information, for example, that one of my cousins, got out from the grave and he said, if you want, I'll give you the hair off my head, but shoot us right.</span> <span id="s808">Because about, they were all, they made them undress and they were shooting them and they were falling into the graves.</span> <span id="s809">But some weren't shot.</span> <span id="s810">They covered them when they were still alive.</span> <span id="s811">So, he said, shoot us right.</span> <span id="s812">But we still didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s813">And one of our worker's wives came to my mother, to bring her food, and tell her, we want to save you.</span> <span id="s814">Once you are out of here, come, we will save you.</span> <span id="s815">They used to bring food and give it to the people that were watching around there.</span> <span id="s816">And they wanted to save her.</span> <span id="s817">And my mother says, she is not going out.</span> <span id="s818">She is afraid.</span> <span id="s819">Until on the second day, one came and she actually beat up my mother, and she kicked her out with her feet.</span> <span id="s820">She put a big shawl on her and she kicked her so bad that she brought her up to a nearby house and put her up in the, made her go up in the attic and she said, you are going here to lay, I will cover you with straw, but you cannot move until I will come back to you.</span> <span id="s821">And she was hiding there for, in the attic, for the day and at night she heard somebody, something moving there.</span> <span id="s822">So, she didn't know, is it a mouse, it's human or what.</span> <span id="s823">But, she got closer to the place and she touched a hand.</span> <span id="s824">And she said, who are you?</span> <span id="s825">Very quietly.</span> <span id="s826">And she said, I am Sonja Kovaski(ph), which she married, this is my sister-in-law now.</span> <span id="s827">And, of course, they couldn't talk any more.</span> <span id="s828">They heard the Germans drinking and singing and enjoying and everything.</span> <span id="s829">And she didn't know what is going on.</span> <span id="s830">And how long she is going to be there.</span> <span id="s831">No food, no drink, nothing.</span> <span id="s832">But this was Friday, until Friday.</span> <span id="s833">Friday afternoon she came, that woman, took her out from the attic and she says, she dressed her like a farmer, she gave her a pail and a, I don't know, in Polish you call it, kapatchka(ph), but you dig potatoes.</span> <span id="s834">And she says, you are going to follow me.</span> <span id="s835">She dressed her with a scarf and she brought her in the house and they gave her a glass of milk and a piece of bread, and she says, you are going to your children.</span> <span id="s836">I'm going to bring you to your children.</span> <span id="s837">And, but you cannot move, you cannot look around, you cannot do anything.</span> <span id="s838">She did not want to tell her that everybody's killed already.</span> <span id="s839">Because she was afraid in case my mother faints or something, what will she do with her?</span> <span id="s840">So, she says, you're going with me.</span> <span id="s841">And she brought her to Kokochan.</span> <span id="s842">And then he brought her to us because we were in ____________, it was another small village there.</span> <span id="s843">And then she told, she came, she told us what had happened.</span> <span id="s844">That Thursday they finished all the men killing and Friday there were still some women, and where the women are killed, and where the men are killed, and we still could not believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: This was your whole town?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s847">This was, because when my mother, when there was, on the premises where they were, when they told my mother why they want to save her, and they told her where they are killing the Jews, she came up to, there were two doctors, Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s848">And she says to them, what should we do because some young people wanted to revolt against it, they said, let's kill at least some Germans.</span> <span id="s849">We're getting killed, let's kill, they didn't let them because they said, because if you revolt, we'll all get killed.</span> <span id="s850">Obviously, they would have, they killed them anyway.</span> <span id="s851">But, he said to them, so my mother, this is boykavochnik(ph), you are such a smart woman, you are a business woman.</span> <span id="s852">Can you believe that they will kill 4,000 people?</span> <span id="s853">No, it's impossible!</span> <span id="s854">They won't do it, they cannot do it!</span> <span id="s855">And they made her, she is stupid to believe them.</span> <span id="s856">And this is, still when it happened, nobody believed it, that that's going to happen.</span> <span id="s857">We thought, they'll make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s858">We thought they will take away from us everything.</span> <span id="s859">But we could not believe they are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s860">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s861">And that's how we were fooled all the time.</span> <span id="s862">Because we did not believe it.</span> <span id="s863">And later on, in experience, every town was a different way of killing.</span> <span id="s864">It was always before a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s865">There was always a diff, there was always with a different excuse.</span> <span id="s866">There was not excuses, but they were differently that nobody could believe it.</span> <span id="s867">Now, my sister was with my mother's family and, until one day came a selection.</span> <span id="s868">They took out there.</span> <span id="s869">And they put them, they told them to get out in the market.</span> <span id="s870">And they, my sister walked with her two children with no husband.</span> <span id="s871">So, left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s872">And my uncle saw that she goes left and they already heard about what left means.</span> <span id="s873">So, he felt like he was going to faint and they, from the back they pushed him, like there is no time to faint, you go.</span> <span id="s874">Because he was going right.</span> <span id="s875">And that's where my sister got killed that day, but this was in 1942.</span> <span id="s876">She lived from 1941 until 1942, she lived with my mother's family.</span> <span id="s877">And we were hiding.</span> <span id="s878">Until we feel like we cannot do it anymore.</span> <span id="s879">We went to the, in Raddan was a ghetto, we went to the Raddan ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: So, for this year or so, year and a half, you were hiding in different places?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: We found places, yes.</span> <span id="s882">And then it started even worse.</span> <span id="s883">When we went to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Actually, before you tell me about the ghetto, I just have a couple of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How did you know who to trust?</span> <span id="s887">I mean, you seemed to be lucky, a lot of Polish people weren't so helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: We were one of the very, very lucky people.</span> <span id="s889">Because we knew, we, how we did not trust, it's very hard to say.</span> <span id="s890">We had trust, too much, later we found out we should not trust that much.</span> <span id="s891">But in beginning, we trusted because you couldn't understand, how can somebody hurt us?</span> <span id="s892">We were friends!</span> <span id="s893">We lived together.</span> <span id="s894">We were loved!</span> <span id="s895">Among the Poles.</span> <span id="s896">We were loved!</span> <span id="s897">The workers would cut their necks off for us.</span> <span id="s898">They would give everything for us.</span> <span id="s899">They would do everything.</span> <span id="s900">And how can anybody hurt us?</span> <span id="s901">How can you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: And no one double crossed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No.</span> <span id="s904">No.</span> <span id="s905">Until, no, nobody, until they just said we have to leave.</span> <span id="s906">We have to leave.</span> <span id="s907">They _____________, the mayor from the village came one day, and so we were with a widow because she was a widow of, one of our worker's mother-in-law, and she kept us there.</span> <span id="s908">And he came and he told that we have to leave because otherwise the whole village will get killed.</span> <span id="s909">So, of course, we did not want to do them any harm, and we said, okay, we are going to leave.</span> <span id="s910">And my brother went to Raddan, the youngest brother, went to Raddan to find out where can we go?</span> <span id="s911">What should he do?</span> <span id="s912">He came there and they surround, they were looking for people they did not have White Russian passports.</span> <span id="s913">And they found, because we didn't have, we were Lithuanians already.</span> <span id="s914">And they found, the caught about 10 people.</span> <span id="s915">It was my brother and one of my cousins and some more and they brought them into the police and they beat him up so badly and we found out what is going on in Raddan.</span> <span id="s916">We were still in the village, so we notify that Polish man, he was friendly with the mayor of this town of Raddan, and he went there and he intervened with them and they let him out.</span> <span id="s917">But, my brother came to the village, for a week he couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s918">He could not move.</span> <span id="s919">His back was all black, beaten up so badly.</span> <span id="s920">And then we realized that whatever will be, we have to go to Raddan, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s921">And we went to Raddan, we went, finally, we all get up and we went to Radden to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s922">I and my mother and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s923">And until we were in the ghetto, it was very uncomfortable, until one night, it was on Saturday night, the Polish man came into the ghetto at night and he said, and he got scared, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s924">______________ is not allowed to get into the ghetto, is not allowed to drive, is curfew at night.</span> <span id="s925">And is there only one that protects us, that takes interest in us already.</span> <span id="s926">And we were, we didn't want him to, he should get out, he should get killed because of us.</span> <span id="s927">He said, I went to sleep and I had a bad dream.</span> <span id="s928">And I want, I came to take you out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s929">I said, we'll all get, so you'll get killed and we'll get killed.</span> <span id="s930">You'll take us out at night to a village?</span> <span id="s931">He said, yes, I have prepared a village for you.</span> <span id="s932">And I'm going to take you there.</span> <span id="s933">Because the dream was a bad one.</span> <span id="s934">He was a great believer.</span> <span id="s935">And he took us out and he brought us there.</span> <span id="s936">It was a widow with children, her husband went to the war and didn't come back.</span> <span id="s937">And he told us we have to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">End of tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: ...continue when we start again.</span> <span id="s941">I wanted to ask you...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">You can start.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: We weren't there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: In Raddan?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: In Raddan.</span> <span id="s946">We weren't there too long.</span> <span id="s947">Life was consigned to the room, we had one room.</span> <span id="s948">We still had food to eat because the people used to come and bring us food.</span> <span id="s949">We did not know what any more can give.</span> <span id="s950">What they all can give.</span> <span id="s951">We did not.</span> <span id="s952">We just existed.</span> <span id="s953">Nothing, we did not know a thing, what there will be, what we have to expect.</span> <span id="s954">Where we are.</span> <span id="s955">But, we weren't there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: A few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Maybe less, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s958">I just remember that not too long.</span> <span id="s959">And then when they took us out, so, then we never returned any more to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: In this ghetto, was this a big ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No, because Raddan was smaller than Ashashoc.</span> <span id="s962">It was a very small town.</span> <span id="s963">They had a big Yshiva(ph), they were famous for a big Yshiva.</span> <span id="s964">Famous for the biggest rabbi in the, his name, they used to call him the Rapofitzheim(ph), but there were not, I don't know the population, but it was a very, much smaller than Ashashoc.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: And was the ghetto, were there Germans in the ghetto or was it all self-patrolled?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: The Germans always were patrolling it.</span> <span id="s967">Because it was a curfew, you couldn't go out at night.</span> <span id="s968">The minute that it used to get dark, you were locked up in the houses.</span> <span id="s969">In the daytime you could jump from one house, maybe to the next, to talk a little.</span> <span id="s970">To talk to some people.</span> <span id="s971">To see people who were hiding from our town, who came there from our town.</span> <span id="s972">And, but it was very little conversation there, very little, we didn't know what will be with us.</span> <span id="s973">We didn't have any hope for better, we did not have any hope, we existed, we didn't know what to think even what will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Do you remember your conversations with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: We had friends that, before the war my mother used to help them a lot, they were poor.</span> <span id="s976">And I, one night, we were in the villages, yet, it was before the holidays.</span> <span id="s977">I said, I'm going to get a prayer book.</span> <span id="s978">And I risked to go to the town from the village with, of course, with the woman's daughter.</span> <span id="s979">But she had to go on one side, we always arranged it, that if they catch us, they should not, people should not suffer from us.</span> <span id="s980">And I came to these people and they say me, they couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s981">They were, where is everybody?</span> <span id="s982">Who is alive?</span> <span id="s983">Because they knew that we, that they already killed our town.</span> <span id="s984">And I say, we are all the family, except my sister's husband.</span> <span id="s985">And, what can I do for you?</span> <span id="s986">We had nothing, I just ran out from the house like I stayed, with nothing, I didn't even have time to put on a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s987">I took the shoes with me and ran out in a pair of slippers.</span> <span id="s988">So I said, no, nothing, I really don't, I want a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s989">Forget about toothpaste, a toothbrush and a little salt to be able to brush our teeth.</span> <span id="s990">So, she says, no, but you don't need any underwear or nothing?</span> <span id="s991">I said, no, a little towel and a dishtowel.</span> <span id="s992">So she brought me and I, and she gave me a prayer book and I went back.</span> <span id="s993">But, that's all we wanted.</span> <span id="s994">I felt, I always had my prayer book with me.</span> <span id="s995">Even when we were warm, the minute I heard the German's boots walking by the house, I took, I used to grab the prayer book and pray.</span> <span id="s996">And we were, we were still believe that there would come a miracle.</span> <span id="s997">Another day, another day, there will a miracle for us.</span> <span id="s998">We, something God has to do for us.</span> <span id="s999">It was, but the day never came.</span> <span id="s1000">It never came.</span> <span id="s1001">The only one that was right is the Polish man that took us out that night because this was Saturday, Friday night and on Sunday, they surround Raddan and they went from house to house and we did not have White Russian passports, the took him and they killed him.</span> <span id="s1002">And we would have been in this part because we did not have Russian passport.</span> <span id="s1003">And he had the feeling of fear and he took us out at night.</span> <span id="s1004">It's like a prophet.</span> <span id="s1005">It's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: So, during this period, instead of being resentful, you prayed harder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1008">We prayed harder.</span> <span id="s1009">We prayed harder and believed there will come a miracle.</span> <span id="s1010">Every holiday that what, how did we know it's a holiday?</span> <span id="s1011">We had no calendars, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1012">By the sun, by the moon.</span> <span id="s1013">And we used to _______________, it must be a miracle, it must be a miracle.</span> <span id="s1014">It never came.</span> <span id="s1015">Now, this woman that we were hiding, the first one that he brought us from Raddan, I and my mother did not eat ___________, we did not eat meat.</span> <span id="s1016">We only had bread or potatoes and she was afraid that we are going to die in her house.</span> <span id="s1017">So, she went one day to the ghetto and went into a rabbi and asked what should she do.</span> <span id="s1018">She is hiding Jews and she is afraid we are going to die there.</span> <span id="s1019">What should she, what can?</span> <span id="s1020">So, he gave her a prayer book and he told her, you bring it home to them and tell them, they, occasionally they feel weak, they should eat meat.</span> <span id="s1021">No bones, not any of the bones, just eat a piece of meat for survival.</span> <span id="s1022">But the future, we did not, I don't think we were thinking hard.</span> <span id="s1023">I don't think we had the ability of thinking what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s1024">What should we do?</span> <span id="s1025">Where should it go?</span> <span id="s1026">What, we didn't, but we felt like whatever they advised us, this, the first farmer, the one that had the sons that they were hiring in Polish army and everything, we felt that they are right.</span> <span id="s1027">The only way we can survive is by hiding.</span> <span id="s1028">And I was very much fed up and I was against it.</span> <span id="s1029">I kept telling to my brother, why do we have to be different?</span> <span id="s1030">Everybody, all my girlfriends are killed.</span> <span id="s1031">Everybody is killed.</span> <span id="s1032">Why do we, why do we have to be stubborn and want to leave?</span> <span id="s1033">What purpose?</span> <span id="s1034">What?</span> <span id="s1035">What, they are all killed, nobody is here around us.</span> <span id="s1036">And he said, I want to live to tell the world what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s1037">And I used to scream, why do we have to tell the world?</span> <span id="s1038">The world doesn't think about us, they don't help us.</span> <span id="s1039">And he said, I want to live it through.</span> <span id="s1040">He had a vision, he wanted to leave and I was giving up because the prayers did not help.</span> <span id="s1041">And this is our, then it started.</span> <span id="s1042">Of course, this Pole had a big vision and he told us how we can hide.</span> <span id="s1043">He made hiding places for us in the houses, but the Poles had a smell, somehow they used to feel, that this and this family is hiding somebody.</span> <span id="s1044">They had a very funny feeling.</span> <span id="s1045">If they saw an extra from the chimney, extra smoke is coming out, she is baking bread more than normally she would bake for herself.</span> <span id="s1046">This is how they used to find out.</span> <span id="s1047">And if one knew, right away they started the other one, they're starting to talk.</span> <span id="s1048">And then they used to come to the homes and find and kill them.</span> <span id="s1049">It was every day that we hear those stories.</span> <span id="s1050">But, this man watched over us, with making a good hiding place.</span> <span id="s1051">And he started to have food, and my youngest brother was always very daring to go out at night and bring food in.</span> <span id="s1052">And we lived with the pigs, with the horses, with the cows.</span> <span id="s1053">It's all we, you could talk to them and asking them to why are they so lucky?</span> <span id="s1054">That they are free and we are mice.</span> <span id="s1055">We are mice.</span> <span id="s1056">And, but we had to, then we were changing places from one place to another place.</span> <span id="s1057">He also always divided us.</span> <span id="s1058">He said if in one place they will catch, he wanted so badly we should survive, that he was, he had a better vision that we did.</span> <span id="s1059">That we will hide separately then if one part get killed, the other one will survive.</span> <span id="s1060">And then he brought us into a place and we had a very good hiding place there.</span> <span id="s1061">We could not hide in his house because himself was hiding already.</span> <span id="s1062">He was sentenced to death from the Poles, he was sentenced to death from Lithuania, from the Germans, everybody wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s1063">Because they said he, they called him the Jewish Botchkadik(ph), Father of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1064">And they caught him once in Ashashoc and they beat him up so badly, they brought him in to the, then at night they put him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1065">And they were going to shoot him next day.</span> <span id="s1066">The doctor's wife knew that he is taking care of us and she came in at night to his room and she said, I am going to leave the window open, I want you to run away because they are going to shoot you tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1067">And he didn't know how he can, he couldn't move, he had no clothes, he couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1068">But, somehow, he get up his strength, and he got out, the cold, through the garden, and he came into one of our neighbors, and he told them what had happened to him and they brought him clothes and they let him rest there for a day or two and they, and he came back and since then, he was hiding himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: What motivated somebody like him to take such risks for other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I would say, he wanted to show the world what he'd accomplished.</span> <span id="s1071">He was a believer because his mother, his father was dead, and his mother used to, we always used to hear, Kashmish(ph), what will it be?</span> <span id="s1072">You'll get killed.</span> <span id="s1073">Why do you have to do it?</span> <span id="s1074">And Maria was always hanging on the, the picture was always hanging on the wall.</span> <span id="s1075">And he used to say, he used to say, darn you and start praying.</span> <span id="s1076">And he says, mother, I have to do something.</span> <span id="s1077">I want to, they are good people, I want to save them.</span> <span id="s1078">And she was begging him, give up.</span> <span id="s1079">Give up.</span> <span id="s1080">You'll get killed because of them.</span> <span id="s1081">And the minute he used to start with such a belief the he was, he believed that he will pull it through.</span> <span id="s1082">And we brought him here.</span> <span id="s1083">He used to pray every day, my husband used to take him to every church, anyplace he wanted, he believed.</span> <span id="s1084">And he wasn't considered for a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1085">For a rough man.</span> <span id="s1086">But, he sounded like he wanted, he started, he wanted to fulfill his mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: What did you do all day long when you were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: I don't, I really can't, and I came to the United States, I'll tell you nights, I used to think, what did they do, what did we do?</span> <span id="s1089">I had work, I had work, because I had worked for the ladies.</span> <span id="s1090">I helped them in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1091">But the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s1092">How did we survive?</span> <span id="s1093">Not having a tomorrow, not, we had to think, obviously, what tomorrow will bring us?</span> <span id="s1094">We didn't.</span> <span id="s1095">What did we do?</span> <span id="s1096">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1097">I used to get up in the morning, if we set, if we were in the house, I used to help her peel potatoes, make the pancakes for, the men used to come from the field.</span> <span id="s1098">I used to wash everybody's laundry, whatever, if you want to call it, but, I don't know what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: So, you weren't just in some hiding place?</span> <span id="s1100">You had a little bit of movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Not only, not outside, never outside.</span> <span id="s1102">Only, I was in the kitchen in certain places.</span> <span id="s1103">In some places, I didn't, we were there day and night.</span> <span id="s1104">It depends which place.</span> <span id="s1105">We were once in a place that everybody died from typhus.</span> <span id="s1106">And we were still there in that house and we didn't catch it.</span> <span id="s1107">Only one child survived.</span> <span id="s1108">The father and the mother and the sister, they all died from typhus.</span> <span id="s1109">They were in their house and we were in a small, in a very small corner that you could not even move like this.</span> <span id="s1110">It used to come a holiday, people there used to come to visit sometimes.</span> <span id="s1111">We were sitting in certain cellars, sitting, could never move.</span> <span id="s1112">We couldn't turn over from one side to another side.</span> <span id="s1113">We had to sit like this.</span> <span id="s1114">Was there a little, some food is okay, for two, three days we never could move.</span> <span id="s1115">There were times, but we, I can't understand today, what, how we did it.</span> <span id="s1116">I can't.</span> <span id="s1117">It was winter, it was a very cold winter.</span> <span id="s1118">We had no clothes.</span> <span id="s1119">We had no water to, in times that we were in a barn that we did not have to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s1120">But she used to bring in one pail of water for 10 people, for example, sometimes more.</span> <span id="s1121">So we had one cup of water for each one.</span> <span id="s1122">So, one cup we used to drink and the other cup we used to just wash ourself a little.</span> <span id="s1123">How can a person survive like this?</span> <span id="s1124">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1125">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: How long did you stay in one place?</span> <span id="s1127">You said you had to move around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: In one place we stayed about a year, more than a year.</span> <span id="s1129">Until her brother came.</span> <span id="s1130">When we were there, it was okay.</span> <span id="s1131">We had a very good, like here is the stove and under the stove was the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1132">And the minute that the Germans are passing by, we used to run there, close, and it was good.</span> <span id="s1133">But she wanted, some more people came to her for help.</span> <span id="s1134">And she was a very, she was a widow, she had four children, and they came in, this was a place that we stayed a long time.</span> <span id="s1135">This is the place.</span> <span id="s1136">That I am skipping some other places before.</span> <span id="s1137">That she, they came, this was the White Poles, not the Germans.</span> <span id="s1138">We left there.</span> <span id="s1139">Her brother came to tell that we should leave because they are talking about that she has Jews.</span> <span id="s1140">And this is when he found out about the smoke of the chimney.</span> <span id="s1141">The smoke is going out too often, that means she is baking bread for some Jews.</span> <span id="s1142">And, we, the Polish man came, the one that took care of us, and he transferred us to another place.</span> <span id="s1143">But there did remain still 10 people.</span> <span id="s1144">Two of my cousins, one with the family, his wife and child and another one.</span> <span id="s1145">And day they came, the White Poles came in on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1146">The boys weren't there, they were just two little, two small girls, a 10 year old and an 8 year old girl.</span> <span id="s1147">And they said you have to show us where you hide the Jews.</span> <span id="s1148">And she says, I have no Jews.</span> <span id="s1149">And she said, we know you have, you have to tell us where.</span> <span id="s1150">And she didn't.</span> <span id="s1151">And they looked all over and they could not find them.</span> <span id="s1152">Because this was really the best hiding place.</span> <span id="s1153">And she, and all of a sudden, he took his rifle and he hit it on the floor and it discharged.</span> <span id="s1154">And he hit himself, blood started to go from his chin.</span> <span id="s1155">And the girls were afraid, they saw blood, it is killing the mother, so they said, come on, I will tell you where the Jews are.</span> <span id="s1156">And she went and she showed.</span> <span id="s1157">And they took him out.</span> <span id="s1158">It was in January, on the snow, and they laid him out and they killed him.</span> <span id="s1159">Except my cousin and his wife and his child.</span> <span id="s1160">He was raised on a farm close to there, close to where they were, he was raised in, this was in Debinik(ph), they, this village, and he was raised in Paradna(ph), a small, and the __________ of the White Poles was in Paradna.</span> <span id="s1161">And they took him there and they kept them three days and tortured them.</span> <span id="s1162">They should say where, he should tell them where we are.</span> <span id="s1163">Because they knew that we are helping him with food and everything.</span> <span id="s1164">And he did not tell.</span> <span id="s1165">On the third day they killed him.</span> <span id="s1166">And he was such, so beloved among the Poles.</span> <span id="s1167">He was in the Polish army, he was raised on a farm together with the farmers.</span> <span id="s1168">It didn't matter, they killed him.</span> <span id="s1169">But the main thing was to them to find us.</span> <span id="s1170">Because they were so stupid, they thought that where we are, we have the money with us.</span> <span id="s1171">So they were going for money, too.</span> <span id="s1172">But this, and then after, we were in a place that apart, I was with my brother and my cousin, with his mother and father in another place.</span> <span id="s1173">And we were at also a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1174">But we could see that if nobody comes into the house, we could sit in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1175">Actually, the whole household was in one room.</span> <span id="s1176">There was no such a thing as a kitchen or a bedroom or something.</span> <span id="s1177">There were beds near the wall and the stove and the table and that was everything.</span> <span id="s1178">And under the stove, we had our hiding place.</span> <span id="s1179">And when we were not in the hiding place, we had somebody sitting in the window and watching.</span> <span id="s1180">And my cousin was on the watch that moment, and all of a sudden he turns around and he says, let's hide.</span> <span id="s1181">I see, I don't know, they look to me like women, but they have long coats, it was winter.</span> <span id="s1182">And what happened, he couldn't see from far away.</span> <span id="s1183">But, my brother went to the window and he gives a look and he said, hurry up, let's run and hide, let's run and hide, because they have guns.</span> <span id="s1184">They have rifles under their coats.</span> <span id="s1185">If they are Germans, if they are Poles, we did not know.</span> <span id="s1186">But, as we ran and were hiding and she put the chickens under the stove and my brother was sitting near the little door and he was, he heard them coming in and speaking to her in Polish.</span> <span id="s1187">And he said to us, like we should say goodbye to each other.</span> <span id="s1188">That's it.</span> <span id="s1189">We are gone.</span> <span id="s1190">They catching us.</span> <span id="s1191">And they were poking and poking all over.</span> <span id="s1192">And then they said, let's go to the barn.</span> <span id="s1193">The couldn't find.</span> <span id="s1194">So, the noise of the chickens also threw them off, the noise, because they were disturbing the chickens.</span> <span id="s1195">And they went to the barn and they were beating her, her husband wasn't home, and the children, lucky that the children were not home.</span> <span id="s1196">And she kept saying, I don't have Jews, I'm not hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s1197">I don't know what you want from me.</span> <span id="s1198">And they looked all over, they didn't find us and they left.</span> <span id="s1199">This was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1200">If you want to know a miracle, this was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: These were Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Poles.</span> <span id="s1203">But other ones, also by the Poles, got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: And there were Germans around, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: There were the Germans.</span> <span id="s1206">They never came in the village.</span> <span id="s1207">Occasionally, they used to pass by.</span> <span id="s1208">I know once, I was by myself in one place and they said they are expecting the Germans and they send me out to a forest to hide.</span> <span id="s1209">And I went and I found a tree that leaves, the needle tree was almost underground and I laid down under the tree.</span> <span id="s1210">And I had to wait until somebody will come and give me notice to come out.</span> <span id="s1211">So I was laying in that place, I will never forget it, I was talking to my father all the time.</span> <span id="s1212">Help me, help me.</span> <span id="s1213">I'm in great danger and I'm all by myself.</span> <span id="s1214">Because the family was in a different place.</span> <span id="s1215">We were supposed to be settled in this woman's house, and I was supposed, I was the first one, but since the hiding place wasn't ready and they were expecting the Germans to pass through the village, they didn't know what they will do.</span> <span id="s1216">If they will stop down at, then she was afraid and she sent me out there.</span> <span id="s1217">And then it was getting dark, the came and they said I can get out.</span> <span id="s1218">They just passed by the village, the did not get into the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: So you were more afraid of the Poles?</span> <span id="s1220">Than the Germans?</span> <span id="s1221">They seemed to be around...</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Just the same.</span> <span id="s1223">Just the same.</span> <span id="s1224">Because one day, I and my oldest brother, we were passing through, we had to go to change places and it was in the daytime, we were dressed like peasants, and we're both going, and it was in the middle of the day.</span> <span id="s1225">That was very daring, of course, to do it, but we thought, well, it's the middle of the day, the farmers are already going home to rest, because they always worked until about 11, 12 o'clock, and then they go rest.</span> <span id="s1226">And then we'll not have too far to go, a few kilometers.</span> <span id="s1227">And as we are going, one man was working and we don't look even at that side, and he stops us, _____________, he said, do you have leather to sell?</span> <span id="s1228">So, we got very frightened.</span> <span id="s1229">We said, no, we have nothing now.</span> <span id="s1230">We have nothing.</span> <span id="s1231">And we just kept on going.</span> <span id="s1232">But, we especially could not hide, because everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s1233">We could not go, like some people used to work from one place to another as long as they did not look like Jews.</span> <span id="s1234">We could not.</span> <span id="s1235">Everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s1236">One day...</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Let me stop you here so we can change the tape.</span> <span id="s1238">And then we'll pick up there, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">End of tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Tape 5 ...was in the Partisans, because thanks to him, my husband survived, because my husband was in Partisans, one Jew in the Russian Partisans.</span> <span id="s1241">And he was a doctor there.</span> <span id="s1242">Originally was a dentist, but he's a doctor, so they did need him.</span> <span id="s1243">They were afraid to kill my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Now, I'm not, do we remember where we left off?</span> <span id="s1245">I usually write it down, but I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: It was the 10 people that were in the hiding place where we were over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1248">Actually, I do have a question.</span> <span id="s1249">Are we, we're going?</span> <span id="s1250">Okay.</span> <span id="s1251">I do have a question.</span> <span id="s1252">Now, this man who came and took you out of the Raddan ghetto, did he help you find all of these hiding places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1254">All the places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: So, he took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1257">He took care of us until the end.</span> <span id="s1258">But, end, we got free from his house.</span> <span id="s1259">Because nobody, there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1260">When they burned, and the place where I told you where we left, we changed places.</span> <span id="s1261">And there were 10 people left and the Poles came and they found them.</span> <span id="s1262">The woman, you know, the children told them where the hiding place and they killed them and they took her down to the basement and they burned everything.</span> <span id="s1263">They burned their life and all of the wealth, she was a very wealthy woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: This is the widow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: The widow.</span> <span id="s1266">And they burned her with everything.</span> <span id="s1267">The children, the little girls that survived and, lucky that the men, the two boys weren't home.</span> <span id="s1268">Because if they were home, if they would be home, they would kill them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Now, is this the place where you also met other people who were in hiding?</span> <span id="s1270">The _______________ family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: When we got out from there, after the fire, and every places where only Jews were around, they will send out.</span> <span id="s1272">We got out in the middle of the night, in the fields, not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s1273">We were standing and praying somebody should come and shoot us.</span> <span id="s1274">Get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1275">Just, we were all got out with whatever we had on our backs, a few things.</span> <span id="s1276">And we did not know what we have to do.</span> <span id="s1277">So, the only way to go, is to go to this Pole's house.</span> <span id="s1278">And we knew he is not home, but he should let us into the barn, because people will not think that he is hiding Jews now in the house.</span> <span id="s1279">So, we can get into the barn and just digging ourselves, because there was a lot of _______, a lot of things, and until ____________ made to go to Raddan, because he is hiding himself.</span> <span id="s1280">The mayor of Raddan is a good friend of his.</span> <span id="s1281">So, he is around them, hiding them himself.</span> <span id="s1282">And notify him, they know where he is, and notify them that we are in his house, we have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1283">Take us to the Partisans, or he should shoot us, or to do whatever they want to do with us.</span> <span id="s1284">That is the end, we cannot do anything more.</span> <span id="s1285">So, when we came, as we were standing, two Jews passed by and they found us and he said, I'll give you a place.</span> <span id="s1286">So, they took us up to a place, the name was Doomlay(ph), or Dorman(ph), I don't remember that name.</span> <span id="s1287">And they notify him where we are, when we dug into the barn when we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1288">Next day he came and he said, okay, we'll make a place to hide here.</span> <span id="s1289">And you'll stay here for awhile.</span> <span id="s1290">And we'll see what will be, but he said, it's, the war will come to an end.</span> <span id="s1291">We don't know when, but it's going to, the Germans are, the Russians are defeating the Germans.</span> <span id="s1292">And he came, when he dug out a place for us and we were there, 10 people.</span> <span id="s1293">Next morning comes in the man, he says, you told me only 10 people, there is 20 here.</span> <span id="s1294">We said, no, count.</span> <span id="s1295">Count us, we are only 10.</span> <span id="s1296">No, there is 20, there is 20 people, I can't keep you.</span> <span id="s1297">Anyway, we beg him, of course, we paid a lot of money for these places.</span> <span id="s1298">And he...</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: So you still had money with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1301">We had.</span> <span id="s1302">One of our workers dug out our money and he brought, to a penny, didn't touch one piece of gold or one dollar.</span> <span id="s1303">He brought, they were so devoted to us, he brought us the money, but we never carried it with us.</span> <span id="s1304">We always used to hide it someplace, wherever we were.</span> <span id="s1305">And for the places, this Pole that took care of us, did not take money from us.</span> <span id="s1306">But the other places were paid with gold.</span> <span id="s1307">So, we were there a couple of days and all of a sudden we get up one night, we are all flooded.</span> <span id="s1308">That place.</span> <span id="s1309">It was, water came in.</span> <span id="s1310">Almost drowning ourself in the water.</span> <span id="s1311">Anyway, we got out and we notified him again, what should we do?</span> <span id="s1312">So, he said, there is, I'll come and I'll find something what we can do.</span> <span id="s1313">He went to the woods and he brought in young trees and they spread it out, that went like a _______________, and he dug out where our feet are.</span> <span id="s1314">He dug out a ditch and the water used to get into one place and a couple of times during the night, we had to get out and take out the water and that's the way we were sleeping and getting up, sleeping and getting up.</span> <span id="s1315">Until he said, you have to go.</span> <span id="s1316">I can't keep you.</span> <span id="s1317">I'm afraid.</span> <span id="s1318">So that time, we decided to go to his house and that's the end.</span> <span id="s1319">Take us to the Partisans, or kill us, or do whatever you want, it must come to an end.</span> <span id="s1320">And my brother, we had a gun with one shell.</span> <span id="s1321">My cousin was tall so he took a stick pretending that he has ammunition.</span> <span id="s1322">And we were standing in the field and my cousin and my brother, the youngest brother, because my older brother was always afraid.</span> <span id="s1323">He knew one thing, he want to survive.</span> <span id="s1324">He did not know what to help, but he did not find, think what he can help, but only, he wants to survive.</span> <span id="s1325">So it means if nobody sees him, he'll survive.</span> <span id="s1326">My younger brother and my cousin went to the window and they knocked on the window, and they asked the possessors, that's the help that he left to do his ground.</span> <span id="s1327">They should let him in and they said they will not let him in.</span> <span id="s1328">So my brother said to them, you know, look at the gun.</span> <span id="s1329">I'm going to kill you if you won't let me in.</span> <span id="s1330">So you have to let us in.</span> <span id="s1331">If you don't want us, we will not stay, but we have to have that you should go to Raddan and bring Kashmish(ph) here and he has to help us to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s1332">Maybe he can transfer us to the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1333">Because we were not too far from, they call it Natchaputche(ph), where the Partisans were there.</span> <span id="s1334">And we have no place to go, you must do for us something.</span> <span id="s1335">So, we came there.</span> <span id="s1336">And they were afraid for the gun, which obviously, could not shoot.</span> <span id="s1337">And they, he said, you don't have to let us into the house.</span> <span id="s1338">Just let us in the barn.</span> <span id="s1339">Let us in where the cows, let us in where the horses are.</span> <span id="s1340">Let us in where the pigs are.</span> <span id="s1341">Anyplace, a corner that we can get in.</span> <span id="s1342">And she was afraid and they let us in.</span> <span id="s1343">But we did not know that the same night that we were, they opened the door and told us to go out, the same as where Yaffa(ph) was with her family, hiding.</span> <span id="s1344">Because the house was burning and the woman was burned alive.</span> <span id="s1345">So they opened up the doors and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Yaffa Elliach(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yaffa Elliach with her family was already in his house.</span> <span id="s1348">They were already there, but they were in, there was a hiding place in the house.</span> <span id="s1349">So, they were there, but they did not tell us.</span> <span id="s1350">So, they let us into the barn.</span> <span id="s1351">The next day he came home and he said, I cannot let you go to the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1352">Because the war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1353">The news are going to be showing much better the Russians are defeating the Germans.</span> <span id="s1354">And they and you have, and I want you to survive.</span> <span id="s1355">So, what we'll do, I'll build, nobody think I have Jews now.</span> <span id="s1356">They wouldn't think I do because I'm hiding myself.</span> <span id="s1357">I'll make a new hiding place where the horses are.</span> <span id="s1358">And you'll hide there and we'll see what will be.</span> <span id="s1359">I want you to survive.</span> <span id="s1360">And we dug over night a hiding place and we were sitting there and then the ____________ came out and they introduced themselves.</span> <span id="s1361">They are there, too.</span> <span id="s1362">And another couple of Jews are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: And you knew that from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: It's my cousins.</span> <span id="s1365">Yaffa's father was real cousins because his mother and my father were sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s1366">But in the beginning, of course, everybody wants to survive.</span> <span id="s1367">Nobody wanted to identify.</span> <span id="s1368">Except, I'll tell you, my mother.</span> <span id="s1369">My mother until the last minute was still looking maybe she can save somebody.</span> <span id="s1370">Maybe she can bring somebody and save somebody.</span> <span id="s1371">And the more she brought people in, the less chance we had to survive.</span> <span id="s1372">And the less money we had to buy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Where was she finding people to bring in and save?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: We took out from Vilna(ph) ghetto, three people.</span> <span id="s1375">We found _______ from the labor place, we found my cousin, that he was with us.</span> <span id="s1376">And my cousin, the other cousin, with his wife and child, one he did not give us out where we are.</span> <span id="s1377">He could have tell where we are because he knew where we are.</span> <span id="s1378">And they would go right away and catch us.</span> <span id="s1379">But we paid for it.</span> <span id="s1380">The night before they got killed, my brother was there bringing him food.</span> <span id="s1381">And they beg him he should stay overnight there.</span> <span id="s1382">And he said, no, I'll go back to my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So, you're telling me that, while you were hiding, you were still able to help other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: That's amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: That was my mother.</span> <span id="s1387">That was my mother.</span> <span id="s1388">She did not look that she won't have it for tomorrow, but she has it today and it was still looking, we had a cousin, he was an engineer in a small town near Ashashoc.</span> <span id="s1389">We sent four times for somebody to bring him.</span> <span id="s1390">And he kept delaying.</span> <span id="s1391">He couldn't believe that they cannot run the factory, it was a paper factory.</span> <span id="s1392">That they will not be able to run the factory from him because he started it in Germany and he was working there all his life.</span> <span id="s1393">That how can they, they won't run and they won't kill him.</span> <span id="s1394">But it came when we sent the last time, he was gone already.</span> <span id="s1395">It was too late.</span> <span id="s1396">We had a druggist in Liptenshoc, that they left him alive.</span> <span id="s1397">They killed everybody and left him because they did not have another druggist in the town.</span> <span id="s1398">So they let him.</span> <span id="s1399">We kept begging him, we'll take him out.</span> <span id="s1400">And until it came a day that we sent again, next week, next week, the next week didn't come.</span> <span id="s1401">It came a day that he was gone.</span> <span id="s1402">They killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: So you would try to help people, your Polish people would help you get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1405">For every time they went to town to bring somebody, was paid off very well.</span> <span id="s1406">________ gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: You were starting to tell me that at one point you had to go into one of the towns and you went into a church.</span> <span id="s1408">What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1410">This was when I wanted to meet this mayor of this town.</span> <span id="s1411">And see what he can do for us.</span> <span id="s1412">Maybe he can help us.</span> <span id="s1413">To hide as Poles was impossible because our accent wasn't good.</span> <span id="s1414">To go deep in Poland.</span> <span id="s1415">To stay here, it was impossible, everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s1416">So, but, we wanted to take out the children, my sister and the children from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1417">Because we knew there would come a day they will get killed.</span> <span id="s1418">Besides that, we didn't know tomorrow brings us either.</span> <span id="s1419">So, we, we decided he'll take me to this, Schmigera(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s1420">We'll meet him in church and we'll talk to him and see what he can do for us.</span> <span id="s1421">That night I was resting in the attic, I and my mother I remember, I had a dream.</span> <span id="s1422">I had a dream, ______________.</span> <span id="s1423">And I highly believed that this can come to something.</span> <span id="s1424">You know, you start believing in things which, you know, we never did.</span> <span id="s1425">We believed in dreams.</span> <span id="s1426">We believed, there was a lot of superstition going on.</span> <span id="s1427">And I thought, that dream means something because the translation is, there'll come a day that a bear will leave together with the ship, kavish(ph).</span> <span id="s1428">And maybe there will come a peace that they'll want us to leave.</span> <span id="s1429">So, I will go to the church because I've never been to a church and, accordingly, we were not supposed to enter the church, believers.</span> <span id="s1430">And I went with him, I was dressed like a peasant, and we came into ___________ house and he introduced me that I am a cousin from another place, he brought me, and we are going to church.</span> <span id="s1431">And we went and I told him, I'll fail because I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1432">Whatever I'll do, you go after me, you do.</span> <span id="s1433">And then ______________ came to us in church and he said he cannot talk to us now.</span> <span id="s1434">But they are building a new church at the end of the town.</span> <span id="s1435">I should, after we get through here, he should take me there and he will talk to me.</span> <span id="s1436">So we met him and I told him the story so he can make us out Polish papers.</span> <span id="s1437">All of us.</span> <span id="s1438">And maybe we can survive as Poles, but we have to go away from this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1439">So, I said no, because our Polish accent will give us out right away.</span> <span id="s1440">Because we spoke Polish more like the White Russians, not like in Warsaw, like _____________.</span> <span id="s1441">So I said about to give away the children, then we'll take at least the sister with us.</span> <span id="s1442">So he said, I'll try.</span> <span id="s1443">I'll try everything because I will not forget what you did for me.</span> <span id="s1444">During the Russian occupation, that he was hiding, his wife was already sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1445">This Pole was his cousin and he used to come during the market day [phone ringing].</span> <span id="s1446">After the church, we went there and we met him.</span> <span id="s1447">And he told me what he can do, he said, alright, he will see what he can do about the children.</span> <span id="s1448">And next day he gave us an answer.</span> <span id="s1449">He gave us the answer that he has a very good place, and we knew, because we knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1450">And I knew that this is, it cannot be it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1451">It was a big, rich farmer, they were very good people.</span> <span id="s1452">Very nice.</span> <span id="s1453">And they will take the two children to raise them.</span> <span id="s1454">And we notified my sister.</span> <span id="s1455">Everything wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s1456">Because everything got, _______________, there was no communication, no telephones, nothing.</span> <span id="s1457">And she said she is not giving the children, she wants to die wherever the children are, together.</span> <span id="s1458">So, we failed on this.</span> <span id="s1459">Then I went into the ghetto and I met some people from our home town.</span> <span id="s1460">And they were talking and they told me what they suffer from this man.</span> <span id="s1461">And to us he is an angel.</span> <span id="s1462">So, and I should talk to him.</span> <span id="s1463">And I talked to him and he told me why he wants, he does not take revenge from all the Jewish people, only ones, the people that they, it was their fault to send his wife to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1464">But, anyway, he got, he was, he really was better.</span> <span id="s1465">Because, as I said, we did him a lot of favors, by not giving him out to the Russians, by, I used to open up the back door and let him in to meet his cousin.</span> <span id="s1466">I gave him a warm, and meals, also, if they want, I used to always leave something for them to eat in the room and they used to see it and talk and then disappear.</span> <span id="s1467">All our life was like this.</span> <span id="s1468">And that's what, we went again from place to place.</span> <span id="s1469">We went into hiding and my sister, that was in 1942 when my sister got killed, in May, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: What was the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Vasilishoc(ph).</span> <span id="s1472">Those pictures we just looked at were Vasilishoc.</span> <span id="s1473">They were, all the towns were connected, they were not connected like here, for example.</span> <span id="s1474">You get out it's Pasadena, ____________, but they were not a lot of distances, just, you know, maybe seven kilometers, maybe 14 kilometers from each other.</span> <span id="s1475">And, but they were all small towns.</span> <span id="s1476">Ashashoc was the best, was famous because we had a good communication between Vilna, Lider, Gordna(ph) and we had the bus passing through.</span> <span id="s1477">It was like a freeway going through town.</span> <span id="s1478">But, otherwise, those small towns didn't have a bus coming in.</span> <span id="s1479">They didn't have a taxi.</span> <span id="s1480">We didn't have taxis, either.</span> <span id="s1481">Right before the war, some taxis used to pass through town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: When you went into this church, were you nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s1484">Very much.</span> <span id="s1485">Because I was afraid that God is going to punish me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: You were afraid God was going to punish you for going into the church, not of getting caught by the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: No, I wasn't, I knew there, I am in good hands.</span> <span id="s1488">Because I'm not exposed to the, to out around the public, just in church.</span> <span id="s1489">And I was dressed just like a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1490">Couldn't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: But you were afraid you were going against your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Faith, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: You didn't feel forsaken by your faith at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No, but, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1495">We were, and we weren't that religious, in our house.</span> <span id="s1496">We weren't that religious.</span> <span id="s1497">We kept all the, you know, everything kosher and this and that, but we weren't very religious.</span> <span id="s1498">But I always am with people today, very religious.</span> <span id="s1499">I felt like if we would have a father, we would probably be also as religious as my friends, because my friends were very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Did you have any contact with Partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No.</span> <span id="s1502">But we knew that they exist.</span> <span id="s1503">We knew who are the head of them.</span> <span id="s1504">Because we knew them.</span> <span id="s1505">We knew where they are because one time, I and my youngest brother and my sister were a short time in a place, they were right in the pasture, in that, where the Partisans are.</span> <span id="s1506">We were there in the middle.</span> <span id="s1507">And that was a very good place to hide.</span> <span id="s1508">Because his son, that Polish man, his son went to work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1509">He was a policeman, he got killed.</span> <span id="s1510">So nobody would ever believe that he has Jews in his house.</span> <span id="s1511">But, there was once, they call it a blava(ph), they surround, the Germans surrounded the, this, the woods and were trying to kill, some people got killed during it.</span> <span id="s1512">And this ___________ was just moving around, going forth and back from the bombs and from the grenades and from everything.</span> <span id="s1513">And then we decided to leave, I did not, we didn't want to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: So there was a big, strong German presence and you were very aware of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Oh, we were aware, they had, there were Polish people that they told the, used to be in contact with the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1516">There were some.</span> <span id="s1517">The Polish people, when they organized against the Jews, but not all of them.</span> <span id="s1518">They were not, there was a cousin of this Polish man that we were survived by him, this ______________.</span> <span id="s1519">That he was called to join the White Partisans.</span> <span id="s1520">And we were afraid, he was, he ran away from a big town, came to survive in this village because the Germans, the Germans or the Russians, I don't know, did something to his parents, and when he was called to join the White Partisans, he, we were afraid, the risk, this __________ Jews, and he could not lie.</span> <span id="s1521">He was a very honest and not smart man.</span> <span id="s1522">And we knew that he will tell, yes.</span> <span id="s1523">So every night we used to bring him into our hiding place and he used to ________________.</span> <span id="s1524">You have to go, obviously, they call you.</span> <span id="s1525">Otherwise, they will kill you.</span> <span id="s1526">But, if they will ask you, what will you tell them?</span> <span id="s1527">_________________, I will never say that.</span> <span id="s1528">I will not, I will never give, but we couldn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1529">And every night we used to like, bother him, what will you do?</span> <span id="s1530">And he kept saying, always crossing his heart and saying, cross my heart, I will not say, and he finally went and he did not.</span> <span id="s1531">He did not tell that we are hiding there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: He checked on you all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: No, after he left to the Partisans, he never came, we never saw him.</span> <span id="s1534">Now, I know where he is now.</span> <span id="s1535">We write, we exchange cards for Christmas, when the Polish man was here, I sent him money.</span> <span id="s1536">I met his sister one day in Israel, but two years ago, almost three years, I met her in Israel.</span> <span id="s1537">Sent him money, he is an engineer.</span> <span id="s1538">Very intelligent man, but I never saw him.</span> <span id="s1539">Like this Polish man, Edward(ph) Shepard(ph), now he was, at that time, probably 10 or 12 years old, maybe less.</span> <span id="s1540">We never saw him.</span> <span id="s1541">I only saw his silhouette.</span> <span id="s1542">Standing near the kettle and watching them in a big coat, dressed.</span> <span id="s1543">And I never saw him in his face.</span> <span id="s1544">Because we were hiding, not Yaffa or the other ones, they saw him because he used to come in to eat in the house.</span> <span id="s1545">But we were in the barn, we never came into the house.</span> <span id="s1546">So, now he is alive.</span> <span id="s1547">We write to him.</span> <span id="s1548">Send him money.</span> <span id="s1549">We are in contact with him.</span> <span id="s1550">But, I never knew who he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Do we need to change the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">End of tape 5.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: They would kill him just as they would kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Because he was harboring Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Because he was, yes, because they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Was he the one, who, oh, don't stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Because the difference from this boy to the other ones, the other ones couldn't even sign their names.</span> <span id="s1559">They couldn't write.</span> <span id="s1560">He came from a big town.</span> <span id="s1561">And he came because he had no way, all the family was sent out someplace.</span> <span id="s1562">And he was intelligent.</span> <span id="s1563">He used to go with the polk(ph), how do you say in English, plock(ph), you know, to work on the, to work the ground.</span> <span id="s1564">Everybody that came to this farmer's, they had to work, they had to know how to work on the farm.</span> <span id="s1565">And he was going with his book.</span> <span id="s1566">He was holding in one hand the book, he was studying himself, he was learning himself, and he was working in the field.</span> <span id="s1567">And we always used to make fun of him, how could he do it?</span> <span id="s1568">And at night he used to teach himself algebra and he was, he was, he was a different breed, because some, like the shepherd, the shepherd couldn't even sign his name, he never saw a school.</span> <span id="s1569">So, we knew he was different, but what we knew, he is such an honest man, he cannot lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: And this is the cousin of your savior?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Yes, of our savior, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Now, during all this time, how much information did you have about the outside world and what was happening in the camps?</span> <span id="s1573">Did you know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: We did not know.</span> <span id="s1575">We didn't know what is going on with the death camps.</span> <span id="s1576">We did not know what day is today.</span> <span id="s1577">Except just looking by the moon we knew what, if it's the beginning of the month or the end of the month or whenever it is.</span> <span id="s1578">And the only thing we knew, Yaffa kept, the first time when we met, she says, do you still have your prayer book with you?</span> <span id="s1579">Because every place I went, I went with my prayer book.</span> <span id="s1580">And by the end, I lost it in the Pigonne(ph).</span> <span id="s1581">And I saw her the first time in the United States she said, do you have your little prayer book.</span> <span id="s1582">And I said, no I don't have it, I left it in the house and everything was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: What else?</span> <span id="s1584">You were in hiding, really from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: From '41 until '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Any other aspect to all of that you want to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Do you want to know about _______________ after the war when we came back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: I do, but first, I want to know how you found out you were liberated.</span> <span id="s1589">But, in the hiding, in all these places, you hid in different places and you basically had somebody who helped you find places and some of them you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: We couldn't, we could not do one thing without him.</span> <span id="s1591">We didn't, everything was his, now one time I got sick and my foot swelled up very badly and he came to visit us and he almost fainted when he looked at my foot.</span> <span id="s1592">Because I asked, what will it be?</span> <span id="s1593">You have to kill me.</span> <span id="s1594">I can't run to hide.</span> <span id="s1595">It was red and swollen.</span> <span id="s1596">And he said, I will see what we can do.</span> <span id="s1597">He went to one of our friends, an old lady that her son was a shoemaker and he, we knew him.</span> <span id="s1598">And he told her what had happened to me and she went to the river and picked some leaves from the lilies, the white lily leaves and she gave him to bring it to me.</span> <span id="s1599">And a piece of old linen and white flour and she said, let her put on the leaves and this will take off the redness and the swelling a little and then it will start itching, I should put on.</span> <span id="s1600">He wasn't satisfied that this can help me.</span> <span id="s1601">He went to the doctor in Ashashoc and he told him that he knows that we are hiding.</span> <span id="s1602">And the doctor was a German, his name was Leah(ph), but he was, we knew him, we knew him.</span> <span id="s1603">It's different with people that they know everybody.</span> <span id="s1604">And he said to me, he said, I will give you an ointment and you take it out to her.</span> <span id="s1605">And he brought it to me and my foot healed up.</span> <span id="s1606">Otherwise, I, I said, the only survival, the only help we could have, I said, shoot me.</span> <span id="s1607">Because I don't want other people should get killed because of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Do you think there was any difference in your experiences because you were a girl instead of a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: No.</span> <span id="s1610">I was more help than almost a boy.</span> <span id="s1611">I could wash the laundry, I cut their hair with the not scissors, with the scissors they cut the sheeps, I wouldn't be able to hold it in my hand now.</span> <span id="s1612">Cut their hair, washed, make something to eat for them, mend, I was doing everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: And no one tried to take advantage of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: No.</span> <span id="s1615">No.</span> <span id="s1616">We were all in the same house.</span> <span id="s1617">I didn't have, for example, a dress to change.</span> <span id="s1618">And there was men around, what do you do if you have to wash it?</span> <span id="s1619">I had an apron.</span> <span id="s1620">I used to put on an apron in front and just go all the time to the front where the apron is.</span> <span id="s1621">Until it dries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: I mean, I'm just curious, women have things they have to take care of and then when you're in such unusual circumstances, it must be difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: It, I don't know, we didn't feel so difficult.</span> <span id="s1624">The only thing what we, what was difficult is when it was very cold.</span> <span id="s1625">And we did not have warm clothing.</span> <span id="s1626">This is then we were all, we were sleeping 10 people together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Did you have your period throughout this whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: For a long time I didn't have a period.</span> <span id="s1629">It disappeared.</span> <span id="s1630">For a long time, maybe about a year and a half or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Maybe it was nutritional or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1633">Our gums, in about a few months after we left the house, our gums started to bleed.</span> <span id="s1634">Now what should we do?</span> <span id="s1635">We don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1636">So the farmer advised us we should eat onion and garlic.</span> <span id="s1637">My brother got out and he bought a sack of garlic and a sack of onion and if we had bread, we used to take, that's what we used to eat, a piece of bread with garlic and onion.</span> <span id="s1638">Because there was no food, there was no, absolutely nothing, especially for us that we did not want to eat meat.</span> <span id="s1639">But by the end we, I and my mother, started to eat meat.</span> <span id="s1640">But the meat was, we didn't have enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Coming from a home that was very, very comfortable, you had to adapt a lot.</span> <span id="s1642">I mean, you were not a farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: What was the most difficult thing to adapt to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: The most difficult thing was for me once, he brought me to a place on the way to Vasilishoc, it was a farm, there was a widow there with children and he said he wants, he was doing a transaction that he wanted to separate the family in three places.</span> <span id="s1646">To find three places to have us.</span> <span id="s1647">And he told me, this Polish man, he brought him there and he said, I am a relative and I had a fight at home and I want to run away from the house and he'll leave me there for a short time.</span> <span id="s1648">And being there and since I am from a farm, I have to know how to feed a cow, how to feed a horse, how to milk a cow, how to work in the barn to make the grain come out from, you know, you have to work with this.</span> <span id="s1649">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1650">I got out at night and I'm going with them to feed the cows with a younger daughter because, obviously, she's, the younger daughter is younger than I am, the daughter, but she knows what to do.</span> <span id="s1651">And I am afraid to go near the horse and I am afraid to go near the cow.</span> <span id="s1652">The cow we had I would maybe cope with it, but I don't know how to milk a cow like they milk.</span> <span id="s1653">And I insist I have to learn, I have to do it.</span> <span id="s1654">So, it didn't take long, next day I was feeding the cow, I wasn't afraid for the horse, I went to them in the morning to the woods to cut trees down for, because there was no men in the house, it was all women.</span> <span id="s1655">And young children.</span> <span id="s1656">To cut the trees, but I'll tell you, every tree that I cut that ground was soaked with my tears.</span> <span id="s1657">This I remember.</span> <span id="s1658">There was so much tears in that forest that I tell, this is how we are, be cutting us down.</span> <span id="s1659">Like I should not cut the trees because why do I do it to the trees when we've been cut down like this?</span> <span id="s1660">This I can, I don't, I never I think repeated it, but I couldn't take to cut down a tree.</span> <span id="s1661">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1662">And I was going and I was cutting down the tree and I was crying bitterly and came home and make dinner for them.</span> <span id="s1663">I was there, and then on Sunday, I had to hide myself because they were already, the girl was probably 14, 15, and boys are coming.</span> <span id="s1664">And I was afraid to be there.</span> <span id="s1665">Maybe they will recognize that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1666">So I used to tell them that I am very sick and I'm very tired and I used to get into the barn and dig in myself all the way on the bottom and hide.</span> <span id="s1667">Until one day a doctor was passing from, walking from Vilna to Gordna and this was on the road from Vilna to Grodna, that village.</span> <span id="s1668">And I made a soup with milk and he was very hungry and he stopped and, of course, they used to give people to eat because he was, constantly people were passing by.</span> <span id="s1669">And he said, and after he ate he said, oh, I haven't had a meal like this in a long time, who made that meal?</span> <span id="s1670">And I heard him talking, I disappeared, of course, right away from the house, but I thought it over and I said, I'll never make another meal, there was little bowls from potatoes with milk.</span> <span id="s1671">And, obviously, on the farms they did not make it.</span> <span id="s1672">That was a Jewish meal.</span> <span id="s1673">And I never did it again.</span> <span id="s1674">I said, no.</span> <span id="s1675">Until I did not, I was not secure there.</span> <span id="s1676">I thought something will happen to me by the end there.</span> <span id="s1677">There was too many people, I learned how to make the grain, I learned how to make _____________ out of, I learned everything, I learned, and in a very short time, but I felt someday they will recognize that I am not doing like they are doing.</span> <span id="s1678">And we notified him he should come and pull me out, I cannot be by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: In a situation like that, when you were separated from your family, were you worried that you might not see them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1681">Yes.</span> <span id="s1682">We never knew what the hour can bring us.</span> <span id="s1683">We never knew about it.</span> <span id="s1684">Now, for example, when I left that place, I had, at that time I had a sack with some clothes already.</span> <span id="s1685">He picked up, this man picked up, I told him where they were hidden, but they were dressy clothes, I couldn't wear it anyway, there was wool dressed and I couldn't wear it.</span> <span id="s1686">I wasn't allowed to wear it.</span> <span id="s1687">She told, and I was, when he came to pick me up, she said, the clothes disappeared, somebody had stolen the clothes.</span> <span id="s1688">Of course, I did not bring up to a thing that's a tragedy, I said, okay, it's alright.</span> <span id="s1689">To them it meant something, to me it doesn't even mean anything.</span> <span id="s1690">I left everything, as long as I got out alive from there.</span> <span id="s1691">Because I was sure I will not get out alive from there.</span> <span id="s1692">After that man recognized that the food is not the same and they are coming in constantly, boys to the girl and I disappear in that time, by the end they will come out, who is she?</span> <span id="s1693">Who is she?</span> <span id="s1694">It's a mystery, I'm there and I'm not there.</span> <span id="s1695">But ____________ thinking, I don't know, we didn't, if we would have the brains to think a lot, I think we should have commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1696">And you know, nobody committed suicide, very little.</span> <span id="s1697">Unless they knew the Germans are going to kill them, they were waiting for to be definitely killed.</span> <span id="s1698">Otherwise, there was very little suicide.</span> <span id="s1699">But I was thinking, why didn't we do it?</span> <span id="s1700">Why did we have to suffer?</span> <span id="s1701">Like this?</span> <span id="s1702">You're completely not a human being any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: You must have had a strong will to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: My brother, my brother said he wants to be the one to tell the world what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s1705">And he's the one, he was like a rabbit hiding and nothing, did not do anything.</span> <span id="s1706">My younger brother was the main supplier.</span> <span id="s1707">He is the man that, he is the one that was risking his life for everybody to bring these people food and these, and get out and get the food, because we had no problem getting the food, there was just the risk to go out to get it.</span> <span id="s1708">The Polish people would give us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: How old were your brothers at the time, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: My older brother, it's 1942, or 1941, '42, he was born in 1910, so he was 30 some years, 30 years old.</span> <span id="s1711">And then the second one was my brother that died from leukemia and the third one was my sister, and I was the fourth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: And then your younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: My younger brother was, oh, we were all a year and three-quarters.</span> <span id="s1714">My mom, that's what mamma, actually, I don't even know when I was born.</span> <span id="s1715">I just, Yaffa just got some documents so she will find out.</span> <span id="s1716">Because when I asked, when I came to the United States, I asked my mother, when is the date that my birthday is?</span> <span id="s1717">She said, when we were all picking berries.</span> <span id="s1718">So I took it in June.</span> <span id="s1719">Because this is the time that we pick berries.</span> <span id="s1720">Because we, I had, some of my girlfriends had birthday parties, not too many, occasionally.</span> <span id="s1721">And I used to come home and ask my mother, why can't we have a birthday party?</span> <span id="s1722">My mother used to always say, you don't have a father, there's no holidays.</span> <span id="s1723">She gave us everything what we wanted and we helped in the business, I used to go to school and excuse myself at 12:00 and be home and work in the business.</span> <span id="s1724">My brothers stopped schools, they were in the business.</span> <span id="s1725">Everybody was helping.</span> <span id="s1726">We got, I could get any amount of money I want, everything was open for us.</span> <span id="s1727">We had beautiful clothes always, made, everything, but when it came to holidays, she always let us know, we don't have a father.</span> <span id="s1728">And my mother could have remarried very easily, very easily.</span> <span id="s1729">But she did not want another father for us.</span> <span id="s1730">Because she only lived with him 10 years.</span> <span id="s1731">And he passed away from the epidemic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Tell me how liberation came about for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: We were sitting in a barn and he came from Raddan that day.</span> <span id="s1734">And he said, the news is very good, because the mayor used to get newspapers.</span> <span id="s1735">Now, he didn't get a thing, because he couldn't read a newspaper anyway.</span> <span id="s1736">He wouldn't, he didn't bring it to us.</span> <span id="s1737">So, but we heard at night, every night we used to hear airplanes running.</span> <span id="s1738">Because, as a matter of fact, Yaffa's mother got, was pregnant and she had a baby.</span> <span id="s1739">And they brought her, they were hiding in the house.</span> <span id="s1740">So they brought her to our hiding place to have the baby.</span> <span id="s1741">And we didn't know what to do with her.</span> <span id="s1742">Because the minute the baby will start crying, we have to hide, we have to, we are finished.</span> <span id="s1743">So that night he came from Raddan, that Polish man, and my brother and her father took the baby, picked it up in a basket and we thought, who is the righteous, who is the best man in the villages around, and they took the baby and they went there at night and they tied it up under the ceiling and they left the baby and there was a note, take him to the church and christen him.</span> <span id="s1744">And they were so foolish, they, some of the pilots, but we heard every night, Russian planes passing by.</span> <span id="s1745">That one of the pilots was a woman and she had a baby and they dropped the baby.</span> <span id="s1746">They did not think it is a Jewish baby.</span> <span id="s1747">And they raised the baby and the baby was okay until it got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: When you heard these Russian planes, did it give you hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Hope.</span> <span id="s1750">We have, we had hope, but we were afraid for the day when they will come.</span> <span id="s1751">We did not know, how can we get out and show our faces?</span> <span id="s1752">How can we face the world, how can we look at people that they wanted to kill us?</span> <span id="s1753">That they robbed us.</span> <span id="s1754">For what?</span> <span id="s1755">I have some pictures that one of our workers brought us in the ghetto and brought us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1756">He found the pictures on the floor, whatever he found, he got into the house because we had a little dog and the dog didn't want to leave the house and constantly sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s1757">So he came in to get a blanket, something from the house to take him to his house, and he found the pictures and he brought them to the ghetto to Raddan.</span> <span id="s1758">And we couldn't understand how can we go on living to look at people that, some were good and helped us, some just wanted to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s1759">That was the hardest part that we did not know how we will survive, how we can go on in life.</span> <span id="s1760">And that, we didn't think it will be so fast, but that night a lot of airplanes were passing above us.</span> <span id="s1761">And he came in, he came home that time.</span> <span id="s1762">And he came into our barn and he showed us that in case they bomb and the barn catches on fire, there was insurance, so the grass was high, he took out a rock from the, and we should get through there and run to the fields.</span> <span id="s1763">This is what he prepared for us.</span> <span id="s1764">On Saturday morning, afternoon, we see the Germans are coming into the village and starting to station themselves.</span> <span id="s1765">Put up their equipment, to put the fence, and I thought, here, this is the day that we are dying.</span> <span id="s1766">We got to, we lived to and that is the date we are going to die.</span> <span id="s1767">Because no way will we survive.</span> <span id="s1768">The village will catch on fire, we have no place to run.</span> <span id="s1769">We can run through the grass, but that will be hot, too.</span> <span id="s1770">But that's the end of us.</span> <span id="s1771">In about half, they had just started like you put out now, the equipment, they started to settle and in no time came an order they have to leave.</span> <span id="s1772">They left, they were about, they stationed themselves only about five kilometers from there and in about half an hour we saw all the village there is on fire.</span> <span id="s1773">It's burning.</span> <span id="s1774">This was luck, this was luck, you have to call it fate.</span> <span id="s1775">That was luck.</span> <span id="s1776">And of course, next morning we knew that they are all gone.</span> <span id="s1777">That for us was the end of the war but we were afraid to go to town.</span> <span id="s1778">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1779">But we knew if we will stay longer and they will think that he has Jews in the house, we'll be killed there from the White Poles.</span> <span id="s1780">So my brother and Yaffa's father, they went to Ashashoc because it was only three kilometers we were hiding from Ashashoc.</span> <span id="s1781">And they went there and they met some people and they met some Russian people, Russian soldiers and they told them to wait another couple of days because it's insecure to come right now.</span> <span id="s1782">Because they are ________ right now and a minute later Germans can retreat and come back.</span> <span id="s1783">So we waited a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1784">Of course, we did not sleep, we did not eat, we were alert all the time and then we decided we must go because we cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1785">And we went to town, we came in to our house, I want to think about the three kilometers walking to the house.</span> <span id="s1786">And imagining the town with Jews, without my friends, without everybody.</span> <span id="s1787">And I don't know how we made it, I think we were numb.</span> <span id="s1788">We did not think what we are doing.</span> <span id="s1789">We were numb.</span> <span id="s1790">And we came into our house and it an elderly couple living and they got very scared and we told them not to be scared.</span> <span id="s1791">They'll have to move out eventually, but they can still stay until they find a place to stay.</span> <span id="s1792">Of course, there's nothing there.</span> <span id="s1793">We bought some lumber and we made some little beds and picked up a few pillows and we were about 20 people in our house, all single people.</span> <span id="s1794">Anybody that was single came to my mother.</span> <span id="s1795">My mother was their mother, everybody.</span> <span id="s1796">We ourselves did not have yet what to eat, but we knew we will not be short on food.</span> <span id="s1797">They will bring us food.</span> <span id="s1798">Everybody will bring us food so we won't, we didn't worry.</span> <span id="s1799">And did remain in the house until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: So how long did you remain in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: We came in June.</span> <span id="s1802">It was the holidays, we had a ______________.</span> <span id="s1803">We had Russian soldiers stopping in the house, we made a prayer, we took one, we were praying there.</span> <span id="s1804">We had an incident, we got poisoned from food.</span> <span id="s1805">I and my brother almost died that night.</span> <span id="s1806">One night, it was innkeeper night.</span> <span id="s1807">Until when was the pogrom?</span> <span id="s1808">I, October, from the 19th to the 20th.</span> <span id="s1809">We lived at home, there was only about four or five ________ from Jews, but we had a lot of people in our house, coming, going, coming, going.</span> <span id="s1810">My sister friend, Abe's wife used to come, she was left alone, all the parents died, got killed, they were in the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1811">And she was the only one alive, everybody was in our house.</span> <span id="s1812">And in the morning, one woman brought us laundry and she said, you know, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1813">Be aware, the White Poles are going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1814">I would suggest you should not sleep at home.</span> <span id="s1815">But, except, again, we were the only family they would tell us.</span> <span id="s1816">And I got very scared and I was alerting everybody, let's not sleep at home.</span> <span id="s1817">We have nothing, what do we have in our homes, nothing.</span> <span id="s1818">Let's try and see what, how we can protect ourselves.</span> <span id="s1819">Why we need protection?</span> <span id="s1820">There was no, the Russian army, because they were, the Germans were moving, they were moving more to Russia, they were almost near Minsk(ph), they were past Minsk, they were already near, they were deep in Russia.</span> <span id="s1821">And the deeper they were, the more, the main police used to go with them.</span> <span id="s1822">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Finish your sentence please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: So, she, we didn't know what to do and we, and I was, I kept walking from one house to one house to the other house, would tell them, let's not sleep at night, because that's what she told me.</span> <span id="s1826">And they said, I'm off my mind.</span> <span id="s1827">You got off your mind, you are crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">End of tape 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Tape 7</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: So, you tried to warn people and they all thought you were crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Crazy.</span> <span id="s1832">And I said, I'm not going to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s1833">I'm going to sleep in the garden.</span> <span id="s1834">We had a big garden right at the end of the house.</span> <span id="s1835">I'm going to stay there all night and I'm not going to sleep.</span> <span id="s1836">All of a sudden, my younger brother wasn't home with his wife and my older brother wasn't home.</span> <span id="s1837">They were in Vilna, Yaffa's father was in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1838">So, and it was getting to afternoon, Yaffa's father and my brother and three Russian people in a stationwagon, they're coming in.</span> <span id="s1839">So, here I run to, it was getting a little darker and I run into the house and I said, what will we do?</span> <span id="s1840">Did you tell, Tegula(ph), her name was Tegula, did you tell your husband what we are expecting?</span> <span id="s1841">And she said, you are crazy, go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1842">You are crazy, go to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: This was Yaffa's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: And their house was near yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Yes, right, it was our house in the center and theirs was like in the corner.</span> <span id="s1847">And I got very upset with her that she didn't even, she didn't tell him what is going on.</span> <span id="s1848">And she said, look, here we have protections, we have three soldiers, one was a high ranking soldier and two, I don't know, one was a chauffeur and the other one, and they are sleeping in our house, when we are having our dinner, and we are not afraid.</span> <span id="s1849">I went home and I talked to my oldest brother and my oldest brother said, yes, I am agreed that you are crazy.</span> <span id="s1850">Go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1851">I said, I am not going to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1852">Go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1853">I said, I am not.</span> <span id="s1854">So they said, you know what we'll do?</span> <span id="s1855">We had a two story house, we'll put, we'll change guard, all night, one will stay upstairs near the door and watch.</span> <span id="s1856">And who did they choose?</span> <span id="s1857">We had a boy, a young boy, 15 years old that lived with us from Vilna.</span> <span id="s1858">He was not a smart boy, obviously, because three, four years he is without parents and from one place to another place, and I went to sleep and I dozed off and all of a sudden I hear, my room was downstairs, and I hear like soldier boots are going, they are passing by my window.</span> <span id="s1859">And I jumped up and ran upstairs and I see a circle of people speaking Polish.</span> <span id="s1860">I put, I laid down on, they should not see me standing up, I laid down on the balcony and I hear them, exactly what they were talking.</span> <span id="s1861">And I started to wake up everybody and nobody moving.</span> <span id="s1862">They say, you are crazy.</span> <span id="s1863">You imagine things.</span> <span id="s1864">I said, come out, give a look, they are right in front of our house.</span> <span id="s1865">Would they go to our house?</span> <span id="s1866">As many people as are here?</span> <span id="s1867">Nobody would get out alive.</span> <span id="s1868">Because we wouldn't be able to run, they would surround the house or they, like they did there, they throw a grenade.</span> <span id="s1869">We wouldn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: When you heard them talking, what did you hear them saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: I didn't, not exactly, but they were debating, they planned to go to our house and they, then they between themselves decided, but then they better go to Sonneson's(ph) house because there are the Russians and they can take their documents and their ammunition.</span> <span id="s1872">And they went there and in no time, we heard a grenade.</span> <span id="s1873">And then everybody started to run.</span> <span id="s1874">Everybody started to run that I even forgot that I have to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s1875">My brother, I ran out with Petkofski(ph), one from our home town, he just testified something, too.</span> <span id="s1876">And we ran, we didn't know where to run, we ran to the gardens and we ran into a ditch and then another one.</span> <span id="s1877">The Smarts(ph) came also to the same ditch, but not knowing where we are, if we are there or what, and we were hiding there and not knowing what we are hiding, what should we expect, but it came to my mind, my mother.</span> <span id="s1878">Where is my mother?</span> <span id="s1879">And, but there was no way to go look back or nothing.</span> <span id="s1880">In the morning we were sitting there and mice were running on our hat, and we couldn't move, we were sitting there in the ditch.</span> <span id="s1881">In the morning, we got through the night, we don't know, should we go out, should we sit there?</span> <span id="s1882">What should we do?</span> <span id="s1883">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1884">We only, I heard shooting, but I didn't know what is going on.</span> <span id="s1885">Anyway, it came about 8:00 probably, we have to go out, we can't sit, whatever will happen to us will happen.</span> <span id="s1886">I walked out to the house, it was not too far from the house, and I heard screaming.</span> <span id="s1887">It was her father, crying and screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Whose father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Yaffa's father.</span> <span id="s1890">And I said, when we get close to, we were afraid even to give a step someplace, and he said, my Fagalese(ph) is dead, they shot my wife and the child.</span> <span id="s1891">And we were begging her all the time, not to pick up the boy.</span> <span id="s1892">The boy is in good hands, let's know, we knew we were not secure.</span> <span id="s1893">We knew it.</span> <span id="s1894">But we couldn't believe ourselves that somebody will do us harm.</span> <span id="s1895">And then he said, I said, I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it.</span> <span id="s1896">And in no time, we left, we left all, we went to Raddan, stayed there over Shabbas(ph).</span> <span id="s1897">And came back, the next day we left to Vilna, I never came back to the town again.</span> <span id="s1898">My brothers went a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1899">I never did.</span> <span id="s1900">We stayed in Vilna until they started to arrest my brother all the time to interrogate him.</span> <span id="s1901">He should tell, they wanted him, he should testify that the Poles did not, that the Poles, a father or something, I couldn't understand what, I really don't, but I know I went, we didn't, and they warned us, we had the mayor that came after to our town, I have his name written, advised us not to go any more to the town because we will get killed.</span> <span id="s1902">So, definitely, we definitely did not think to return any more.</span> <span id="s1903">We were in Vilna, but we knew we cannot be any more on this ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: You found your mother?</span> <span id="s1905">She came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1907">We got all together and we all left for to leave, to run and then we moved to Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Let me ask you a stupid question.</span> <span id="s1909">When you heard these soldiers come in, before you started warning everybody, how were you absolutely sure they were Polish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: I heard them speaking.</span> <span id="s1911">I didn't know, I couldn't hear what they are speaking, but I heard them speaking, that they are having a conversation, they were advising each other, should they go to our house, should they go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: And it wasn't German, it was absolutely...</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: No, definitely not German, definitely heard Polish and the woman told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: What woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: The woman that came in the morning that brought us the laundry, she told us that the White Poles, but I heard them speaking Polish.</span> <span id="s1916">There was no Germans, that was way past the time from Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Were you surprised?</span> <span id="s1918">Here you had survived all of this, you were liberated, you went back to your town, and you were still fighting a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: But we had twice that we almost got killed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1920">So it was not a surprise either.</span> <span id="s1921">Because at _________________ house the Poles killed.</span> <span id="s1922">At _____________ when we were sitting there, when they came they didn't find us, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s1923">So we knew that they are against us, we knew, but, like we did not believe that the Germans were going to kill everybody, like the doctor said to my mother, you are such a smart woman, Mrs. Kabachik, are you going to tell me that they will kill 4,000 people?</span> <span id="s1924">That's the same with us, why should they kill us?</span> <span id="s1925">What did we do wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: And Yaffa's family was very distraught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Yeah, you survive, she had killed, one baby killed, one baby in the ghetto when there was the selection, and she said she will never want to be a killer for another baby.</span> <span id="s1928">And here, why?</span> <span id="s1929">What did we have?</span> <span id="s1930">So whatever we had, they robbed.</span> <span id="s1931">Whatever we had was left and they robbed it and that's why we knew they would need it because they found the clothes that was left, all the things that was left to us, they found it.</span> <span id="s1932">They were finding it in the, he was a janitor in their slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s1933">He is the one, he showed me how to go to Corcochan(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: And he is one of the people who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: He was, he was involved in that, I don't, I cannot tell who shot them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1936">But he was also involved in this bunch of people.</span> <span id="s1937">And that's what we decided, while we are still in Vilna and we wanted to know where did her father disappear?</span> <span id="s1938">Yaffa was a little baby, my mother wanted to take her.</span> <span id="s1939">Her uncle didn't give us the children.</span> <span id="s1940">Because he said, I am the brother, they belong to me.</span> <span id="s1941">And we, I could not speak Russian.</span> <span id="s1942">I spoke Russian, I understood, but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1943">I took my cousin, which spoke a beautiful Russian, and they told us there is one mayor, Pukavnik(ph) Straffski(ph), we should go, he is a Jew and he is a very high rank officer, we should go to him and tell him the story and let him help us to find where Moishe(ph) Sonneson is.</span> <span id="s1944">At least to know where he is.</span> <span id="s1945">So, when I told him the story, he woke up, he was never a Jew, but he woke up, his heart, with such a killing, he started to cry.</span> <span id="s1946">He heard the story what had happened in our town, after we got through the war, after we got survived, and why did they do it now to us?</span> <span id="s1947">So, I, and he grabbed the telephone and called up the Porkoror(ph) Belehoov(ph), and I heard him talking and telling him the story.</span> <span id="s1948">And we have to find out where Sonneson is.</span> <span id="s1949">I did it on my own, Yaffa did not know, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1950">And he said, he'll come three days later and I will tell you what we can help you.</span> <span id="s1951">And we came, I went with my cousin and three days later and he said, I am sorry, I am sorry that I'm involved in that, I'm sorry, I'm in trouble.</span> <span id="s1952">I am in trouble.</span> <span id="s1953">That, they killed, they killed her because, Moishe put her out to be killed because he wanted to rob the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1954">And we became very good friends with this Pukavnik, he used to come in to Vilna to our house because we had a piano in the house and he liked music so he used to come to play.</span> <span id="s1955">And he said there is no place for us.</span> <span id="s1956">Because there were constantly people got killed on the streets.</span> <span id="s1957">We never went out in Vilna from the house too far.</span> <span id="s1958">We were assigned to that room, we were four families in one apartment and never moved out, never nothing.</span> <span id="s1959">And one day he said, run.</span> <span id="s1960">So we made papers, I and my brother, we couldn't make it to run all together so they were making papers for me and for my brother and got into a cattle train.</span> <span id="s1961">And we were hiding there with the cattle and we came to Lodsch(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: How long did you stay in Vilna, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Until, from October until March, about four months, maybe, or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: And you still felt like you were in hiding still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1966">We were all the time in hiding.</span> <span id="s1967">We were only, this Polish man used to come to us and his cousin used to come to us in Vilna, but we were never secure.</span> <span id="s1968">We never knew if tomorrow is another day for us.</span> <span id="s1969">And then we came to Lodsch and they told us they have a room for us in Lodsch, but we cannot go out on the streets because there is pogroms every day.</span> <span id="s1970">So we got into a room and we were waiting for the family to come.</span> <span id="s1971">Until the family came and then we found out there is an organization that is pulling out all the Jews, we'll go on the way to Israel.</span> <span id="s1972">That's what we thought.</span> <span id="s1973">We never knew we'll end up in the United States.</span> <span id="s1974">We thought we are going to be, to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: How did you know to go to Lodsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: There was an organizer, how did we go to go to Lodsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: How did you decide to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Because we had to run away from Lithuania and that was Poland.</span> <span id="s1979">Lodsch was Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: But the White Poles were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Yes, but there nobody knows us.</span> <span id="s1982">And there was places where we were assigned to go.</span> <span id="s1983">We didn't go anyplace to rent our room.</span> <span id="s1984">There were places where they had assigned, an accumulation of all the people who were running from Lithuania, from White Russia, that's where they were supposed to be settled.</span> <span id="s1985">It was organized by Israel.</span> <span id="s1986">____________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: So you were told, you were informed that everybody was heading towards Lodsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: So the problems after liberation were with the Poles and the Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1992">I just wanted to understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: So we came there and then one day they said we have to move.</span> <span id="s1994">We have to go farther, we have to be going closer to where we can go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1995">We never knew where we are going.</span> <span id="s1996">There came an order, tonight we are leaving.</span> <span id="s1997">We packed our packs on our shoulders and that's all we could take and we are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Do you know which organizations were helping you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: There was ______________ and we never saw who was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s2000">We never knew what we are doing, we just took, they gave us orders, for example, we got documents that we are Greeks, by the way, and we are coming from a camp to go home.</span> <span id="s2001">So when we came to Czechoslovakia, here we are on a train, we go to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Krakaw, Warsaw, all these towns and we come to Czechoslovakia and there was no communication right away so we get off of the train.</span> <span id="s2002">And the orders was for us, who speaks Hebrew?</span> <span id="s2003">Could speak Hebrew _______________, if anybody, Russian soldiers show up, because they were under the occupation of the Russians, should sit down and pray.</span> <span id="s2004">And if somebody comes to talk to them, they have to pretend they don't hear.</span> <span id="s2005">They have to pretend they don't see and who speaks Hebrew, should speak Hebrew between themselves.</span> <span id="s2006">Here are coming in a few Russian soldiers, we were sitting waiting for a train and he says, who are these clowns?</span> <span id="s2007">Who are these clowns?</span> <span id="s2008">And we understand what they are talking and we pretend we don't understand.</span> <span id="s2009">So he says, well, they show me their documents, they are Greeks, they are going from the camp home, let's go in the town there is a Greek and we will come, we will bring him and he'll find out from them who they are.</span> <span id="s2010">He'll know how the speak the language.</span> <span id="s2011">The first best train that came, didn't know where it is going, what it is going, we were on the train, on top of the train, on step of the train, didn't matter if we will fall, only to kill ourself, no matter what, we were on the train.</span> <span id="s2012">We come on the train, it gets a little dark and we heard them, what we heard, notified us that we are going to Budapest from there.</span> <span id="s2013">And we hear coming up that soldiers are there and they are talking to themselves, look, if they are coming from a camp, how come they have backpacks?</span> <span id="s2014">When they will fall asleep, we'll grab their backpacks and we will throw them down from the train.</span> <span id="s2015">What do you do?</span> <span id="s2016">So here we are sitting holding each other tight and we are not sleeping when you are sitting like this on the train.</span> <span id="s2017">Waiting the night should get over and we should survive the night.</span> <span id="s2018">We did.</span> <span id="s2019">And we're coming into Budapest and they pack us, not a car, how do you call it, the communication, it was a streetcar.</span> <span id="s2020">And they pack us and I had a fair cold, a ______________.</span> <span id="s2021">And I hear one saying, she's coming from camp, how does she have a cold like this?</span> <span id="s2022">They didn't have in camps this kind of colds.</span> <span id="s2023">Let's find out who they are.</span> <span id="s2024">And I whispered the man that I thought he is the leader, I didn't know for certain but I thought maybe.</span> <span id="s2025">And I said, I have to, the minute that streetcar stops, I have to get off.</span> <span id="s2026">And we have to change to another one to run into another one and there they will tell us where we have to go.</span> <span id="s2027">Anyway, they were not one, there were probably several, one remained, the other ones jumped off with me and we changed to another streetcar and we came to the camp where we are assigned.</span> <span id="s2028">And we never could get out from the camp.</span> <span id="s2029">That's where we had to stay until we was transferred.</span> <span id="s2030">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2031">One morning, we were 60 people in a room, sleeping all the way on the floor, no pillows, nothing, whatever we would cover or something.</span> <span id="s2032">One woman comes on and she goes and looks around and looks and looks and she's, you could see she's an elderly person but she's so desperate.</span> <span id="s2033">So I stopped her, I said, lady, what are you looking?</span> <span id="s2034">She says, my daughter, they took her away, the Germans and maybe with so many people coming, maybe she will be there among them.</span> <span id="s2035">And you look so much like her.</span> <span id="s2036">So, I says, no, I'm not her.</span> <span id="s2037">She says, be my daughter, so I said to her, I have my mother here.</span> <span id="s2038">Anyway, she used to come every day to the camp and she used to take me out.</span> <span id="s2039">I used to go, take something, I had embroidery a lot, which I used to embroider and I picked it up from hiding places.</span> <span id="s2040">Used to go to the market with her and we used to sell something, a little something, and we used to bring food in the camp for my mother and in no time, they told us to move.</span> <span id="s2041">We have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Where was this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: In Budapest.</span> <span id="s2044">So again, we take the streetcar and we don't know where we are going.</span> <span id="s2045">We have to go.</span> <span id="s2046">We are going to the train, that's what he said, but nowhere, where we are going, we did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: And how long do you think you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: We were there about two months probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: In Lodsch you were there how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Lodsch was so blank to me, Lodsch was really blank to me.</span> <span id="s2051">Because it was terrible there.</span> <span id="s2052">So at Budapest at least I went out, I saw, the first time we saw food, the first time we saw corn, we can buy a corn to eat.</span> <span id="s2053">And because otherwise in the camps was just soup and bread.</span> <span id="s2054">So, I, they pack us on a streetcar and I was the last one, everybody got in and I was standing on the step holding on to the handles.</span> <span id="s2055">And I fell back and I remain myself, the streetcar goes, leaves.</span> <span id="s2056">And I don't know where to go and I don't know the language and I don't know, I knew just few words that I learned from her.</span> <span id="s2057">And I don't know and it's getting dark.</span> <span id="s2058">And I got so many stories that people were caught on the street and they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s2059">Because the Russian soldiers were obviously around there.</span> <span id="s2060">I only knew that the camp must be like in the back, I have to go back and undid it.</span> <span id="s2061">Like on the north side of the street is a big building and there is the camp, the camp obviously was always locked, we couldn't go out when we wanted.</span> <span id="s2062">But I, I don't know how I made it.</span> <span id="s2063">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2064">I saw it's getting dark and in Buddah, I was never in Buddah because I knew Buddah is in the mountains and I see lights coming up and it's so beautiful and now life is finished, my life especially is finished.</span> <span id="s2065">I don't know where to go.</span> <span id="s2066">Anyway, I took a streetcar and I went and as I went I noticed that camp and I jumped off and I went into the camp and I told them what happened to me and I don't know where they went and I don't know what I can do.</span> <span id="s2067">Anyway, in the early morning, almost like in the middle of the night, my brother showed up, my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s2068">My mother came in the station there and she saw I am not there so she started to scream and cry, she is not moving any place until they find me.</span> <span id="s2069">And they did let her, they said you have to go.</span> <span id="s2070">So my oldest brother said, I am going to find her.</span> <span id="s2071">I'm going to.</span> <span id="s2072">I'm not going with them.</span> <span id="s2073">And he forced them to take him back to the camp and he found me in the camp.</span> <span id="s2074">And the next time they did bring us, they brought us to a station and there one of my cousins got very sick.</span> <span id="s2075">We had to go past, it was by Yugoslavia because I heard speaking there.</span> <span id="s2076">In four hours we had to make it to that station where we were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s2077">People broke their feet, people broke their arms, there was up and down, there was mountains, there was, we made it.</span> <span id="s2078">We were carrying each other, we were holding on to each other, we made it in four hours.</span> <span id="s2079">And my mother, we made it, we came there, but where we were so close together and there they packed us and took us to Italy.</span> <span id="s2080">We came to Italy, we went to Venice and then we went, very short, I just, barely saw the birds and the water and they transferred us to Patawa(ph).</span> <span id="s2081">And from Patawa I remember we were so hungry, we had no food and we went out and we bought a piece of herring, and we didn't see herring all the time from the war, and we ate with bread and then they told us they're sending us to near Milano.</span> <span id="s2082">Not, now I'm blank, I can't remind myself where it is the camp.</span> <span id="s2083">Because I got married there.</span> <span id="s2084">And we were there in a camp with 80 people, who wants to sing in the middle of the night, who wants to get married and fight with their wife every middle of the night, who wants to, and here we are there in the middle.</span> <span id="s2085">Anyway, by that time, on the last stop, when we came to go to Italy, this I missed, we were there and my legs were very swollen and my brother always, he was very tall, he was six foot tall, he liked to hear stories.</span> <span id="s2086">We were so bitter we didn't want to hear anything, not to see anything, who cares what it is, let the world come to an end already.</span> <span id="s2087">And he goes out and the tell him and he overhears a story that this and this name, Norman Shulman, Schlemovitch(ph), not Shulman, Schlemovitch, they caught him on the border with some young people.</span> <span id="s2088">Everybody ran away, he did not run away because he felt like he is not guilty of anything and he's in jail there.</span> <span id="s2089">And there's nobody to help him because there is no family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: I have to stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">End of tape 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Tape 8</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: We stopped, your brother had told you that, this Norman...</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2095">So Norman came to us, I was in bed, and he said to my mother, do you know who is here?</span> <span id="s2096">Your brother's relative, this and this, and we knew him because we knew the whole family.</span> <span id="s2097">Because in the town that he was born, my mother had two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s2098">And, of course, we used to go to visit my uncle in Liptenshoc and we always used to meet, I used to meet his sister, I used to meet his two sisters, and I knew every one of them we knew.</span> <span id="s2099">Because his mother used to come there on vacation, too.</span> <span id="s2100">So, we decided, tomorrow morning, we decided, in the prison that he is, is nothing, is just like upstairs, he comes to the window and you can talk to him.</span> <span id="s2101">So the whole family takes, in the morning we go there to see what we can do for him, obviously.</span> <span id="s2102">We come there and he tells us his story, that he is innocent.</span> <span id="s2103">There were people crossing the border to, on the way, it was from Italy to Germany, I don't even know where the border was.</span> <span id="s2104">Some were smuggling money in at that time, but he had nothing.</span> <span id="s2105">He had, he was innocent, he just was going with them.</span> <span id="s2106">And they put him, of course, he didn't run away.</span> <span id="s2107">They ran away, he didn't run away.</span> <span id="s2108">And they put him in jail.</span> <span id="s2109">And, you can save me.</span> <span id="s2110">You go tomorrow to the authorities of the Germans and tell them that you are my wife, you survived in a camp and I didn't know where he is and he doesn't know where I am.</span> <span id="s2111">And try to see they should let me out.</span> <span id="s2112">Because I am, I did not do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s2113">So, next, we go there, we come to the office, they told us where to go.</span> <span id="s2114">And I come to the office and she listens to me and I tell her, but of course, I have to lie.</span> <span id="s2115">And I was very much afraid.</span> <span id="s2116">I was shivering.</span> <span id="s2117">I was so shivering that I could not talk.</span> <span id="s2118">And I said, out to the secretary, how would you feel when you lose everybody, you lose, I lost, I didn't know where my husband is and that's all I want.</span> <span id="s2119">I want to be reunited.</span> <span id="s2120">Please let him out, don't ask me too many questions, I can't answer.</span> <span id="s2121">And I said, I am really very sick right now and I show her my legs.</span> <span id="s2122">And my knees were very swollen.</span> <span id="s2123">So she said, okay, come tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2124">I come tomorrow and I am shivering, I really shiver.</span> <span id="s2125">Because I know I'm lying.</span> <span id="s2126">And she tells me, what date did you get liberated?</span> <span id="s2127">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2128">I didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s2129">So I started to cry and I said, why are you asking me questions?</span> <span id="s2130">Did we have a calendar?</span> <span id="s2131">Do I know where I am?</span> <span id="s2132">Do I know what I can, what happened to us?</span> <span id="s2133">We are just lucky by a miracle.</span> <span id="s2134">We survived.</span> <span id="s2135">And I found out my husband survived, so that's all I want, just reunite me with him.</span> <span id="s2136">And she said, alright, she told me the date.</span> <span id="s2137">And she marked down and she said, okay, stop crying.</span> <span id="s2138">Go home, go to your kin, take care of your legs, we'll let him out.</span> <span id="s2139">And a few hours later he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: What was the name of this camp in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: It was, I think, Villa(ph), I think it was Villa.</span> <span id="s2142">Now, this wasn't in Italy.</span> <span id="s2143">It was on the border of Italy and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: You mean this prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: This prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: But your DP camp was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: The next, then we crossed the border and we went to Italy.</span> <span id="s2148">We went to Italy together already.</span> <span id="s2149">We came to Italy and he was with us in camp and then he told my mother that he would like to marry me.</span> <span id="s2150">And my mother did not want to hear.</span> <span id="s2151">He had a wife, he had two children that he lost.</span> <span id="s2152">He's much older than I am.</span> <span id="s2153">And she did not want, and my brothers did not want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: And I was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s2156">I had several boyfriends there.</span> <span id="s2157">And I was disappointed seeing people, they get married and they fight at night and they divorce next day.</span> <span id="s2158">And I was afraid for a stranger.</span> <span id="s2159">So I said, and he was very intelligent, my husband.</span> <span id="s2160">Very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s2161">I liked this intelligence.</span> <span id="s2162">I didn't look at anything.</span> <span id="s2163">I didn't finish studying.</span> <span id="s2164">I didn't, I felt like, I like a person like this.</span> <span id="s2165">And I said, I would like to marry him.</span> <span id="s2166">But they said no.</span> <span id="s2167">And if mother said no, it's no.</span> <span id="s2168">Anyway, he got mad and he went and picked up himself, and we didn't have too much what to carry to move.</span> <span id="s2169">And he went to Rome.</span> <span id="s2170">In Rome there was the Macahs(ph), which remains all the organizers of our _____________, refugees.</span> <span id="s2171">And he got an offer.</span> <span id="s2172">They knew that he knows Hebrew, he was never a teacher, but he knew, whatever he knew he remembered.</span> <span id="s2173">And they knew it very well.</span> <span id="s2174">So, he should organize the Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s2175">Because there is children coming from Hungary, from all over the world, from Russia, everybody of a different language.</span> <span id="s2176">Children picked up from the war raised by Poles.</span> <span id="s2177">They would only speak Polish.</span> <span id="s2178">People from all over the world, there is different languages.</span> <span id="s2179">Everybody is waiting.</span> <span id="s2180">We didn't plan about another way but to get to Israel.</span> <span id="s2181">But, we had to get illegally to Israel.</span> <span id="s2182">And we started to get rumors that they are drowning the boats.</span> <span id="s2183">The boats that leaves to Israel, is illegal, and they are drowning a lot of people which were afraid to move, too.</span> <span id="s2184">Anyway, so they said, you know _______ that you can do it.</span> <span id="s2185">So, they gave him, and he organized the school.</span> <span id="s2186">He was the only one teacher, he was the only one everything.</span> <span id="s2187">And he taught everything in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2188">Geography, arithmetic, he taught, not being a teacher.</span> <span id="s2189">And, I'll show you the pictures later from this, from this school.</span> <span id="s2190">And he organized and it was going very beautifully, but he felt that just teaching is not enough, they have to have acting, they have to have singing, they have to have a little fun, the children.</span> <span id="s2191">They didn't live yet, they didn't have any fun.</span> <span id="s2192">So there came a friend of his that he knows, that he was an author, a singer in Warsaw and he also was a Cantor(ph) in Vilna.</span> <span id="s2193">And he took him in.</span> <span id="s2194">He said, I'll teach you the Hebrew, every night what you have to teach tomorrow, but you occupy the children in _____________, it means in acting and other things.</span> <span id="s2195">And he did.</span> <span id="s2196">And little by little he organized another teacher, another, he had three, four teachers already.</span> <span id="s2197">And the school was going beautifully.</span> <span id="s2198">And it was good, no this is when he started, and then he called me up and he says, oh, we get married, or forget about me and I'll forget about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Now, you were still where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: We were still in Kermorna(ph).</span> <span id="s2201">This, I jumped a little bit.</span> <span id="s2202">Ahead of time.</span> <span id="s2203">And I said to mother that, I said, I want him, he should come.</span> <span id="s2204">And he came and my mother and my brothers were eating.</span> <span id="s2205">They were going on, we will not let you get married.</span> <span id="s2206">And I said, I want to marry him, I do.</span> <span id="s2207">So, anyway, in a couple of days, they wrote the invitations, they are to a few people, and we got married.</span> <span id="s2208">And we left next morning to Rome.</span> <span id="s2209">He had a room near the Vatican, and there were not allowed to be married people there.</span> <span id="s2210">But since the landlady liked him very much, so she let him stay two weeks with me there.</span> <span id="s2211">Now we took our nephew with us.</span> <span id="s2212">He was 17 years old, we took him out from the camp.</span> <span id="s2213">My mother, of course, did not want him to leave.</span> <span id="s2214">But, we told there is a better life, you will study, he's 17 years old, he has to study, he was caught in the war when he was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s2215">We have to take him.</span> <span id="s2216">But, where should we put him.</span> <span id="s2217">We are not allowed to stay there in the room, so how long, and what we'll do.</span> <span id="s2218">So, we used to, we had two beds, we slept, the three of us, and in the morning we used to put him in the closet or in the ____________ under the door to hide him and then he used to go out during the bell, he just came in to us.</span> <span id="s2219">Anyway, it came two weeks, we had to move, we found a room to stay.</span> <span id="s2220">There was no lights, nothing, it was dark all day.</span> <span id="s2221">No food, the packages we got, they used to eat it up in about a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s2222">I did not, I lived on bread and food.</span> <span id="s2223">And then he was tutoring, ____________'s children, two boys he had.</span> <span id="s2224">They came from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2225">And he was the main authority in the Macahs, in the where all the workers for the benefit of the Jewish refugees is.</span> <span id="s2226">And he said to him, you know, I'll pass on the room to you, where I'm living, because I'm getting an apartment.</span> <span id="s2227">And that was, we had a hope that we are going to start living.</span> <span id="s2228">He passed on the apartment, one room only.</span> <span id="s2229">But again, we had our nephew with us.</span> <span id="s2230">So again, we had to hide him.</span> <span id="s2231">And he got tired of it, we were, we didn't say anything, I didn't say anything, because that was my mother's eyeballs, you know, he's from the old family, one.</span> <span id="s2232">And then he started to, he didn't want to go to his school, to my husband's school.</span> <span id="s2233">He used to take, go on the streetcars, 17 years old and coming late home and it was very not good.</span> <span id="s2234">We felt like we had, are not doing justice.</span> <span id="s2235">So, we decided, we were in a kibbutz near the ______________, it's near Rome, and there's a lot of young people, and they teach him in a different, there's no adults, there's more in his age, 17, because Norman's students were young, up to 12, 13, not 17.</span> <span id="s2236">And we decided, and he agreed with us, he will go to this kibbutz with the young people.</span> <span id="s2237">And he left just like this, and I told him, in the daytime I will wash your clothes, what we had there.</span> <span id="s2238">And we'll bring it to him tomorrow morning, I'll go at the wash yard and I will it to him.</span> <span id="s2239">That night they surrounded camp and they took out all the young people and they put them on a boat and they sent them to Israel illegally.</span> <span id="s2240">And when my mother found out that he is sent to Israel illegally, I thought that's the end of my life.</span> <span id="s2241">She would never forgive me.</span> <span id="s2242">She was giving on like I would take the life away from her.</span> <span id="s2243">It happened a miracle, to make it short.</span> <span id="s2244">And David __________________.</span> <span id="s2245">They had returned the boat and they didn't harm them, but they returned the boat, not to Naples, near Naples was a port and we found out they returned the boat.</span> <span id="s2246">And of course, promptly my mother and one of my brothers and I and my husband and we are running there to get him off the boat.</span> <span id="s2247">At that time we found out that my husband, my husband knew he has a brother in the United States.</span> <span id="s2248">He knew he has a brother in Argentina.</span> <span id="s2249">But he did not know the addresses, did not know where they lived.</span> <span id="s2250">But he put a ad in the paper and he thought _______________.</span> <span id="s2251">And he ask, he wrote his name, that Norman Kabachik is looking for his brother and this.</span> <span id="s2252">His brother did not read the Jewish Press already, but one of, an old lady from his town read it and she came, she knew his brother and came early in the morning.</span> <span id="s2253">Knocked on the door and she said, hurry, hurry, you have a brother who is alive.</span> <span id="s2254">And he was the youngest.</span> <span id="s2255">His brother, his mother birthed 16 children, some never lived, they died at birth, but he was the youngest, he was the second from the youngest, the youngest was a sister.</span> <span id="s2256">His name is Norman and he is in Italy and she gave him the address and everything.</span> <span id="s2257">And we got right away, a telegram and $50.</span> <span id="s2258">So here we have $50.</span> <span id="s2259">We pick up the $50 and we go to take him off of the ship.</span> <span id="s2260">And my mother there, we come there, and he said, no, I'm not getting off.</span> <span id="s2261">You are waiting to get to Israel, you don't know where, we didn't plan to go to the United States at that time.</span> <span id="s2262">And we just got through hell, we did not have no food, no water for three days.</span> <span id="s2263">I used to turn out, he showed us how he turned out his pocket and looked for a crumb.</span> <span id="s2264">And people were dead on the, a couple of people on the trip.</span> <span id="s2265">And I have the certificate to get in legally to Israel now, they gave them, and I can take 8,000 liras for it if I want to sell it.</span> <span id="s2266">I don't want the money, I want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2267">We can get in legally.</span> <span id="s2268">You said to us, you may have to get through the same way he just got through.</span> <span id="s2269">And I don't want to go through over again, that.</span> <span id="s2270">And I'm going.</span> <span id="s2271">We took out the $50, we gave him, and I bought him some clothes to change.</span> <span id="s2272">And they left to Israel.</span> <span id="s2273">So he did remain in Israel and we already got in touch with his brother and his brother sent us right away papers.</span> <span id="s2274">But there was a toss up, the Argentina brother wanted us to come and this wanted us to come.</span> <span id="s2275">But he had chosen the United States.</span> <span id="s2276">And that's what, it didn't, it wasn't easy to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Now, when did you come over here?</span> <span id="s2278">To the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: We came here in 1948.</span> <span id="s2280">March, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: So you were in Italy about two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: More than two years, over two years, almost three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Mostly in Rome?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: In this camp, Kromona(ph), you were not there so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: No.</span> <span id="s2287">No, we were just there about two or three months, maybe.</span> <span id="s2288">Until I decided I am not going to listen to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: I just want to ask you real quickly, because this is, I'm going to let you continue.</span> <span id="s2290">But this camp Kromona, were there only Jewish refugees there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Yes, in Kramona were only Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Was it okay there?</span> <span id="s2293">Was it decent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: There was about 80 people in the room, a lot of quarrels, a lot screaming, a lot of uncomfortable things.</span> <span id="s2295">The kitchen was still only soup and bread, but we had, my brothers knew how to make leather.</span> <span id="s2296">So they found, they got in contact with some people that they wanted to learn how to make leather.</span> <span id="s2297">And they worked with them, they were teaching them, so they started to have some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Was the camp, were you sealed in, or could you come and go as you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: We could come, in Italy we could come and go.</span> <span id="s2300">No problem.</span> <span id="s2301">Italy, we learned to be free.</span> <span id="s2302">When I came to Italy, to Rome, in Kromona we weren't that much going out.</span> <span id="s2303">Going out sometimes to buy a piece of fruit or something.</span> <span id="s2304">But when I came to Rome, and I used to go onto the street and you know the Italian how they speak with their hands and they scream?</span> <span id="s2305">I used to get frightened and run home right away and come to my landlady and tell her that people were, I saw people fighting and I was very much afraid.</span> <span id="s2306">And she taught me how to free, she said, you have to learn how to be free, it's free.</span> <span id="s2307">They are not fighting, they are talking like this.</span> <span id="s2308">That's the way Italians talk.</span> <span id="s2309">That's the way, once the DP, the MP, were looking for somebody and they knocked on our room at night in our house.</span> <span id="s2310">And they came in, they were just looking for a certain, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s2311">I fell out of bed when I saw a man, somebody in a uniform.</span> <span id="s2312">I got so hysterical that I thought, well, this is the end of us.</span> <span id="s2313">I couldn't, until now, I can't, I can't cope with uniformed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: How long did it take you to feel somewhat comfortable?</span> <span id="s2315">Somewhat safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Until we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2317">I lived with my sister-in-law and lived, they picked us up from the station, we came by train from New York.</span> <span id="s2318">But we started to feel we are free.</span> <span id="s2319">And we, at that time we didn't have locked windows, we didn't have locked doors.</span> <span id="s2320">We weren't afraid to go at night.</span> <span id="s2321">We had no car.</span> <span id="s2322">My husband got a job.</span> <span id="s2323">We thought he will be a teacher, but he said he is not going to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s2324">He doesn't want to leave, to remain a teacher.</span> <span id="s2325">He'll remain a teacher, he said, I'll teach, I'll have my cellar, that's it, I want to do something in a hurry that we can go on living like everybody is living.</span> <span id="s2326">They have a car, they have a home.</span> <span id="s2327">The dream to have your own home, you know what it is?</span> <span id="s2328">To have, maybe a car, I didn't dream to have a car.</span> <span id="s2329">But, maybe to have a car.</span> <span id="s2330">My niece and nephew, Norman's brother's two children, they lived very close to us and I could walk to them.</span> <span id="s2331">I used to go in the daytime to one niece and the other, then I started to help my niece, my niece was very sick, so I was helping her with her baby, she had a year old baby.</span> <span id="s2332">And I was pregnant with my daughter at that time.</span> <span id="s2333">And I used to help her, but everything was just in the mind to dream, someday, maybe.</span> <span id="s2334">I did not, I was a pessimist.</span> <span id="s2335">I didn't think we would ever, I didn't think, I didn't, but my husband had a feel to get out and accomplish what people did in the, when they were young, he has to do it in a hurry.</span> <span id="s2336">And that's why he said, I am not going to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s2337">And the children were very disappointed.</span> <span id="s2338">Because they, and I wanted, because the atmosphere, the friends would be different.</span> <span id="s2339">When we go in business, _____________ and have to learn the language.</span> <span id="s2340">My husband picked up the language very easily.</span> <span id="s2341">Not, first thing he started school right away.</span> <span id="s2342">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s2343">I, and he had, he comes from a family that language is ____________ to him, it's easy, very easy.</span> <span id="s2344">He went less than a year and the teacher wanted to give him a diploma that he finished high school.</span> <span id="s2345">But he wasn't interested in the papers or something, as long as he can go on working and get out on our own, not to live with my sister-in-law because we lived with her.</span> <span id="s2346">And she did not have any children and here I am pregnant and I have a baby and her mother used to say, why don't you give the baby to my daughter, you're young, you'll have another one.</span> <span id="s2347">And I was frightened for it.</span> <span id="s2348">Because she has a home, she has everything.</span> <span id="s2349">I have nothing.</span> <span id="s2350">And how can I be secure that I won't have to give up my baby?</span> <span id="s2351">So we wanted, and we couldn't find a place to rent.</span> <span id="s2352">It was impossible in '49, '48, '49, to find a place to rent.</span> <span id="s2353">Until, luckily, we found a little house in the east of Los Angeles and I moved out.</span> <span id="s2354">And we started our life on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: So you're, the brother lived in Los Angeles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: And you took the train from New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: But, his brother died in December.</span> <span id="s2359">And they did not tell us.</span> <span id="s2360">The sister-in-law wanted so badly, and the children, that we should come, that they decided they will not tell us.</span> <span id="s2361">We got, I probably was the only on the ship that we got a telegram that my sister-in-law wrote in the telegram, she'll be the happiest woman in the United States when we will come there.</span> <span id="s2362">And did not tell us that he is not here.</span> <span id="s2363">So, obviously, this is what was, we were, wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2364">And we came and he was dead already three months.</span> <span id="s2365">He died in December, we came in March.</span> <span id="s2366">And that was a big disappointment for my husband.</span> <span id="s2367">Because we could have gone to Argentina and have the brother.</span> <span id="s2368">That's all he wanted, to have a brother, from such a family.</span> <span id="s2369">So, but, we stepped forward, we didn't look for the, we didn't look back.</span> <span id="s2370">We were, we would do everything, any way at a job and then he got fired from the job because he was planning to go in business with somebody and, again, was no money to live on.</span> <span id="s2371">We were offered help, but we would not accept.</span> <span id="s2372">We lived on $25 a month, paying rent and everything and a new child.</span> <span id="s2373">And doctors and dentists and we made it.</span> <span id="s2374">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2375">We made it.</span> <span id="s2376">We moved out from Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s2377">We met a woman.</span> <span id="s2378">After he was fired and he was looking to go to business, in business, we met a woman that she worked for his brother.</span> <span id="s2379">And everybody that knew his brother was crazy about him.</span> <span id="s2380">Nothing but praises.</span> <span id="s2381">And she said, I have a very hard time living here because we worked, we opened stores and we got broke, if you are planning to go in business, try a small town.</span> <span id="s2382">And she offered where they just opened a business.</span> <span id="s2383">And I, as we were talking to her, I said, Mary, I can't see myself, where do I have to go, I have nobody.</span> <span id="s2384">At least my husband has a niece and a nephew, which they loved me dearly, they would do everything for me.</span> <span id="s2385">But I have here nobody.</span> <span id="s2386">She said, Miriam, she looked up at me, she says, Miriam, from now you are my sister.</span> <span id="s2387">You are my adopted sister.</span> <span id="s2388">And she was.</span> <span id="s2389">She was my sister all the way until she died.</span> <span id="s2390">As a matter of fact, it was this night I dreamed about her.</span> <span id="s2391">They were so devoted when my husband was sick.</span> <span id="s2392">We didn't have a car, we lived in Los Angeles yet.</span> <span id="s2393">And they, we used to drive with them, they had a truck, we used to drive in the truck with them to Monrovia(ph) every day.</span> <span id="s2394">They, they guided us, and then we wanted to rent a house in Monrovia, I had two children already and we couldn't, they wouldn't rent two children a house.</span> <span id="s2395">So we were driving, first was the rent.</span> <span id="s2396">My mother was in Brazil, she went to the brothers to Brazil from me to live.</span> <span id="s2397">And I was pregnant, I had a lot of problem with swelling in my hands and my feet.</span> <span id="s2398">And we felt if my mother would come, she could help me, not to use so much water, and I would be able to help my brother, my husband because he was opening a business in Monrovia where she advised.</span> <span id="s2399">And then I would go help him, not knowing anything about that.</span> <span id="s2400">And we moved to Monrovia, we finally found a house that he wanted to buy and I went to see it and I said, I can't move to the house, my mother was too old, and I said, my mother wouldn't be able to straighten out.</span> <span id="s2401">She has to go _____________, because there was something, $8,000, and I said, I can't do that to my mother.</span> <span id="s2402">We'll live in the east of Los Angeles near the temple, she'll go Saturday to the temple, she speaks Yiddish there, she never learned English, what will I do to her?</span> <span id="s2403">I cannot do it to her.</span> <span id="s2404">Anyway, then my sister-in-law came to visit us one day and I said, come on, I want to show what my husband wants to do to my mother.</span> <span id="s2405">To buy a house like this.</span> <span id="s2406">So, she went with us and she says, because this was without a down payment we could buy.</span> <span id="s2407">And she says, do you see anything else?</span> <span id="s2408">I says, yes, today the real estate man showed me a house, but we need $3,000 down payment and I don't want my niece, they could give us, because they gave us some money for the store to open, but we paid them right back.</span> <span id="s2409">And she said to me, so I said, I don't have the down payment.</span> <span id="s2410">She says, here is $3,000, go buy the house.</span> <span id="s2411">I said, in January, this was in the beginning of September, you'll have it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">End of tape 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Tape 9</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: So, we bought the house and it was near a school, of course, and I started to work in stores because my mother was with me and she was taking care of the children.</span> <span id="s2415">But they were driving me crazy.</span> <span id="s2416">My mother should leave because she came on a visit from Brazil.</span> <span id="s2417">And this was a big tragedy to me if my mother is to live.</span> <span id="s2418">Because my mother wanted to live with me.</span> <span id="s2419">Even she has there the two sons and the sons were very good to my mother.</span> <span id="s2420">Very good.</span> <span id="s2421">But she wanted to live with me, not to go back to Brazil.</span> <span id="s2422">The life there was terrible when they came in.</span> <span id="s2423">The snakes used to come in, they lived in a house there was no windows, the snakes used to come into the house.</span> <span id="s2424">And the mosquitoes and the, and then, so, she didn't.</span> <span id="s2425">We worked very hard and we couldn't make her stay, so she went to New York and one of my cousins introduced her to a rabbi and he married her.</span> <span id="s2426">And I could not go see her because I didn't have the money, but a friend of mine was coming from Israel to Los Angeles and she stopped to see her, and she came in and she says to me, Mirali(ph), you must borrow money and go see how your mother lives.</span> <span id="s2427">Queen Elizabeth doesn't have this respect what your mother has from that rabbi.</span> <span id="s2428">He worships every step she gives and every place she sits down.</span> <span id="s2429">You must.</span> <span id="s2430">But I didn't borrow.</span> <span id="s2431">And, unfortunately, less than a year, he died in his sleep.</span> <span id="s2432">So then she came back to me.</span> <span id="s2433">And she lived with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: So you built up a life in Southern California.</span> <span id="s2435">You had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: I had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s2438">In coming to this country, was it difficult to begin a new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: It was difficult.</span> <span id="s2440">There was difficult, not speaking English.</span> <span id="s2441">Lucky that one of my nieces spoke Hebrew a little because her mother was a Hebrew principal here when they came.</span> <span id="s2442">And I was very well liked in the family.</span> <span id="s2443">So there was, I would say, I shouldn't say there was, I was still lucky.</span> <span id="s2444">Lucky.</span> <span id="s2445">Because a lot of people came and they had problems to adjust well with this.</span> <span id="s2446">We adjusted beautifully with our relatives.</span> <span id="s2447">And they were trying to be very nice.</span> <span id="s2448">In American way.</span> <span id="s2449">Ours was different, but we could go on until we started on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Well, other than the language, what was the most difficult for you?</span> <span id="s2451">Was there sort of a culture shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: No, I'll tell you, they did.</span> <span id="s2453">We came from the train today, and next morning I got up to my sister, Laura(ph), and I said, look, I realize we are coming from a different country, different culture, different upbringing.</span> <span id="s2454">I want you to teach me.</span> <span id="s2455">I want you to make a remark whatever I do wrong.</span> <span id="s2456">I want you to teach me how to help you because you are just a widow a few months.</span> <span id="s2457">How to help you, how to help somebody that needs my help, and teach me.</span> <span id="s2458">Don't be afraid to tell me anything.</span> <span id="s2459">I'll take everything what you tell me.</span> <span id="s2460">She took me around, she kissed me, and she says, I would never believe that I can have a sister-in-law like you.</span> <span id="s2461">She said, this is what I will do.</span> <span id="s2462">I will be with you.</span> <span id="s2463">But, there was a big difference, as it was going on, because she wanted to remarry.</span> <span id="s2464">And we felt uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2465">We wanted to get out and here we couldn't get a place.</span> <span id="s2466">But, as it was going on, it developed that we had our own place and we, then we have the children and we moved away.</span> <span id="s2467">And we became, we were friends all the time.</span> <span id="s2468">We were friends.</span> <span id="s2469">There were some things that we were a little, always said in her heart, but she did not do certain things.</span> <span id="s2470">But we never brought it up.</span> <span id="s2471">Whatever she did was wonderful for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: How long did it take you to stop thinking about all that you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Because I was very busy.</span> <span id="s2474">I worked in the store from eight until, sometimes until 10:00 at night.</span> <span id="s2475">We did not go to restaurants to eat.</span> <span id="s2476">We cooked.</span> <span id="s2477">And I was a very clean housekeeper so there was a lot of work at home.</span> <span id="s2478">My mother started to get ill, so I was busy with her very much.</span> <span id="s2479">There was no time to think.</span> <span id="s2480">This is a big ________________, no time.</span> <span id="s2481">But, if I, when we brought the Polish man to the United States, I could not speak for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2482">I was, I couldn't, I could not speak a word Polish.</span> <span id="s2483">I felt bad.</span> <span id="s2484">Well, I still cannot speak Polish.</span> <span id="s2485">And I just, I did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s2486">I didn't.</span> <span id="s2487">We were two weeks, thank God with my husband and my cousin, ____________.</span> <span id="s2488">He and his wife, they were accepted, we picked them up from the train, they brought him to his house and people started to call us to help and we signed up to the Congress of the Polish Survivors and they did a lot to help me with him.</span> <span id="s2489">To take him out, he was honored in Temple, there was 1,500 people.</span> <span id="s2490">We were invited by Fox Studio to _____________, and then to give a tour of Fox Studio.</span> <span id="s2491">And we were invited by a writer, Brown, in Pacific Palisade and took us out.</span> <span id="s2492">And everybody tried to be nice and help him.</span> <span id="s2493">It was before the parade in Pasadena, the Jewish Agency sent us tickets that we should have a place to take him because they have places.</span> <span id="s2494">He had, he could have a lot more honor here.</span> <span id="s2495">Why I was so afraid for him, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2496">I was so overprotective of him that I did, I was afraid to let him go in public places.</span> <span id="s2497">Everyone that called us, I used to investigate like, who he is, what he's, God forbid somebody would not do something to him.</span> <span id="s2498">That was a very big mistake for me.</span> <span id="s2499">But he had a good time here.</span> <span id="s2500">He had, we took him to Disneyland and my niece bought him, everybody bought him beautiful presents and he used to get up, things he never saw in his life.</span> <span id="s2501">___________________, they gave him a silver cup and he said, what do I do?</span> <span id="s2502">And my niece bought him a watch.</span> <span id="s2503">So he got up in the morning like a baby play with a doll, that's how he played with that watch.</span> <span id="s2504">And we bought him a car.</span> <span id="s2505">And we bought him a tractor here.</span> <span id="s2506">And clothes and he was in ______________, we took parties, we were to a New Year's party together with him.</span> <span id="s2507">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2508">But then he said, he want to go to New York.</span> <span id="s2509">Because he had the saloms(ph) which survive from him, and he had Yaffa.</span> <span id="s2510">And he went to New York.</span> <span id="s2511">They were not stupid like I am.</span> <span id="s2512">They won't overprotect.</span> <span id="s2513">They took him, the mayor gave him the key of the town and he was on television and he was all over.</span> <span id="s2514">He could have been here, too.</span> <span id="s2515">I didn't, I was afraid to let him do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Did you quickly resume your observance of religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2518">It was hard for me because since I come from an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s2519">And there the temple was conservative.</span> <span id="s2520">So, when you have to drive to the temple, God, how can you drive on Shabatza(ph)?</span> <span id="s2521">So, because I used to walk to the store, I worked, but I would walk to the store.</span> <span id="s2522">So, my mother used to stay near the temple and go there to the temple.</span> <span id="s2523">And little by little, once the cousin, the rabbi got sick on Yontif(ph).</span> <span id="s2524">And my husband used to go to the temple.</span> <span id="s2525">And I stayed home.</span> <span id="s2526">Prayed in the house.</span> <span id="s2527">So, my mother, after Yontif, my mother comes and she says to me, _____________, the rabbi did not show up and they asked your husband to conduct the services.</span> <span id="s2528">And everybody just hung on me, congratulating me, what a wonderful service they had.</span> <span id="s2529">They never had heard something like it.</span> <span id="s2530">And how lucky she has such a son-in-law.</span> <span id="s2531">So my mother came home and she said to me, you have to start going to the temple and see a man that he had made up his mind that if he will survive, he is going deep in Russia, he will never observe Judaism.</span> <span id="s2532">He doesn't want anybody to know that he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s2533">And he'll never, he wants to be lost.</span> <span id="s2534">And look what had happened.</span> <span id="s2535">So little by little, I started to go to the temple, to drive the temple, and we became members.</span> <span id="s2536">And we had, of course, the money to help.</span> <span id="s2537">My husband was 20 years a treasurer in temple.</span> <span id="s2538">And we build a temple.</span> <span id="s2539">We brought the cornerstone from Israel for the new temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: Something that I'm always curious about.</span> <span id="s2541">You went through so much difficulty and trauma because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s2542">Some people like the man who went into Russia, probably decided they didn't want to be Jewish any more.</span> <span id="s2543">For you this was important?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: For me it was important.</span> <span id="s2545">And our children, from the first possibility they could do, were brought up in Camp ___________, for example the year that my mother died, I thought I cannot send them to Camp ___________, we did not have the money.</span> <span id="s2546">Because the hospital and the burial and the debt of my mother was absolutely outrageous for me.</span> <span id="s2547">I didn't think I can cope with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: 1961.</span> <span id="s2550">And the rabbi came to visit us and my brothers flew in from Brazil and he asked me, are the children going to camp?</span> <span id="s2551">And I said to the rabbi, I don't know what to tell you.</span> <span id="s2552">Right now, I can't send them, but I'll see.</span> <span id="s2553">And he said, I'll see ____________, don't keep them away because they wanted, they wanted, they liked to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">Q: Why was religion so important to you?</span> <span id="s2555">Or why is it, I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: We didn't know any other way.</span> <span id="s2557">And because we suffered, because we suffered, I was once in the hospital after surgery in, it was in Glendora(ph), it was run by nuns.</span> <span id="s2558">And once, they always had a priest there, and he came and he started to talk to me.</span> <span id="s2559">You suffered so much, I understand, why don't you become a Catholic and you won't have every to suffer from religion.</span> <span id="s2560">And I said, something about it, the more you become strong about the religion.</span> <span id="s2561">We are brought up this way and I like the religion and I want to be, I want to remain this.</span> <span id="s2562">He used to come every day to talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s2564">Clearly, having gone through this, impacted you later on.</span> <span id="s2565">How you lived your life, your values, maybe how you raised your children.</span> <span id="s2566">Can you talk about that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2568">I could.</span> <span id="s2569">The minute we used to, my mother said one thing, the minute you'll make for a trip, first thing you go see the brothers how they live in Brazil.</span> <span id="s2570">Because she felt always sorry that here we have a nice, very modest home, very modest.</span> <span id="s2571">Because we didn't look for anything, we just looked, we had to support my nephew in Israel because he was by himself.</span> <span id="s2572">And he did need support.</span> <span id="s2573">And we felt like nothing means to us but to educate the children about Judaism and to learn Hebrew and even my husband was teaching them Hebrew at night.</span> <span id="s2574">But they did not have enough respect to study with him.</span> <span id="s2575">So they used to fall asleep on the table because it didn't, it's better to play football than to study.</span> <span id="s2576">But we took a Hebrew teacher from Israel that he used to come twice a week and teach them Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2577">And we started, as they got older, of course, first was Camp _________, and then we started to send them _________ to Israel.</span> <span id="s2578">And then when my daughter, where she went to school there was two and a half Jews.</span> <span id="s2579">For under 50 children graduated, there was only this couple of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s2580">I always used to tell her about to be aware that she will have to marry a Jew.</span> <span id="s2581">She cannot intermarry.</span> <span id="s2582">And it came to high school, the graduation, she had to go to overnight parties and she wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2583">And she got some boys there that she brought home and she gave them Jewish names and she comes in and she introduces me, they are Jewish, and I, this is Paul and this is this and this is this and I said, what's their last name?</span> <span id="s2584">And she says, ____________, I know it smart, she's read it all in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s2585">I know this.</span> <span id="s2586">She says, mother, I want to go, I don't want to miss this fun and I'm going with one.</span> <span id="s2587">So and then, the other parties she used to bring some from the temple, some of the boys.</span> <span id="s2588">And she went, and then when she got married, she moved to New York.</span> <span id="s2589">And her children, she started to bring up in the schuls(ph), in Hebrew schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: You mentioned that, you know, you see somebody in uniform even today, and it alarms you.</span> <span id="s2591">Are there other things like that that bring back these memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: I always see the Poles standing in front of my house.</span> <span id="s2593">I see it all the time.</span> <span id="s2594">Day and night.</span> <span id="s2595">This does not go away from me.</span> <span id="s2596">I see the German when he came and I took off my watch.</span> <span id="s2597">I see the day that I was sent out to hide by myself, because it seems like I was with my mother or with my brother, one of them, because we were always in different places, but I had somebody with me.</span> <span id="s2598">And I that, as I said, in Italy, when my landlady used to teach us to be free, not to be afraid, but it still was a fear for us.</span> <span id="s2599">Very much.</span> <span id="s2600">But I thought, United States, in this time that we came is so lucky, I was sure that ___________ are dying from hunger because nobody drinks here.</span> <span id="s2601">Nobody steals here.</span> <span id="s2602">We used to go to my niece, walk, 12:00 at night, 11:00 at night, in the middle of day, whenever we used to walk between the two nieces, the niece and nephew and where we lived on Sawyer(ph) Street, and we want to ________.</span> <span id="s2603">We used to walk out, ____________ walk in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s2604">Robertson(ph) Boulevard wasn't built yet.</span> <span id="s2605">We were only two houses, on Sawyer Street, Beverlywood(ph) was not built yet.</span> <span id="s2606">And we want to _____, we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s2608">Certain values that you learned as a child from your mother, they really stick with you and, not only may they help you through all of this, it was the way you lived after you were free?</span> <span id="s2609">Certain things that are important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">A: Giving.</span> <span id="s2611">Help people.</span> <span id="s2612">To help.</span> <span id="s2613">And it was upon a time that when we survived, that I said, I will never help people.</span> <span id="s2614">Because from certain people, which I don't want to mention, we did not, we had a little disappointment.</span> <span id="s2615">And, but, if you learn it at home from childhood, it won't go away from you.</span> <span id="s2616">I love to help people.</span> <span id="s2617">And I love to do for people.</span> <span id="s2618">And I'm known here in the building.</span> <span id="s2619">That's why it helps me now to pull through the debt of my husband.</span> <span id="s2620">I have here family, some have moved away, they went to retirement places.</span> <span id="s2621">But I am like the sister, some says I'm their mother, some tell me I am their doctor.</span> <span id="s2622">I am, I live very close to the people and I love people.</span> <span id="s2623">I cannot leave to see to one evening that I would get crazy.</span> <span id="s2624">After my husband died, I could not sit down at a table and eat.</span> <span id="s2625">I used to stand at the sink and eat, Friday night especially.</span> <span id="s2626">But if my neighbors went to temple, I was called to come.</span> <span id="s2627">I was welcome to come there and eat with them, but I didn't want.</span> <span id="s2628">I said I have to learn to live by myself.</span> <span id="s2629">And, but to go, anybody that calls me, anybody they says, I'm going, and they think about me and they care about me.</span> <span id="s2630">This is the whole idea, they care about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">Q: What year did your husband die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">A: In 1992.</span> <span id="s2633">Four years, on the Fourth of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: When you came over here, did you openly talk about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s2636">I talk now more than I used to.</span> <span id="s2637">Now if we come together, we always find a way to talk about survival.</span> <span id="s2638">Unless my friend is up here.</span> <span id="s2639">And tell them things.</span> <span id="s2640">And everybody is interested.</span> <span id="s2641">It's funny.</span> <span id="s2642">Everybody wants to know.</span> <span id="s2643">It's not, they are not running away because I tell them.</span> <span id="s2644">And I found it necessary that they should know because a lot of people are telling me that we lived here and we didn't know what you got through.</span> <span id="s2645">We didn't know what was going on in this world.</span> <span id="s2646">We were busy, we had small children, we were busy and we never knew what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s2647">We didn't know about the war that much.</span> <span id="s2648">So this is important that they should know.</span> <span id="s2649">And it's nothing to be ashamed, we didn't choose it.</span> <span id="s2650">This is the idea.</span> <span id="s2651">And my children want to know about it.</span> <span id="s2652">And my grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: Was it easy to tell them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: In the beginning it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s2655">But later on we did.</span> <span id="s2656">But we still, I don't think we told them everything.</span> <span id="s2657">I don't think we told them everything.</span> <span id="s2658">Because my husband always used to see, he said, I was locked up in a building and I saw the way they put my wife and children on the truck.</span> <span id="s2659">Now, I did get this, true.</span> <span id="s2660">But I, because when my sister got killed we were in very big danger, so we didn't grieve even as much, because we knew that we are going to be killed, too.</span> <span id="s2661">Didn't think any other way.</span> <span id="s2662">But he always said it in his, and he always was screaming at night.</span> <span id="s2663">I, I don't think there was a night when I didn't have to wake him up, Norman, why are you screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: For many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: For many, many years.</span> <span id="s2666">For many years.</span> <span id="s2667">It never went away from him.</span> <span id="s2668">Because he saw things that, we maybe were scared, but he saw it, he saw it.</span> <span id="s2669">There was shooting in front of him, they were shooting people.</span> <span id="s2670">And even in the Partisans, being one Jew that he could have been killed.</span> <span id="s2671">He was one Jew in the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: You've been very gracious with your time.</span> <span id="s2673">Is there anything else you want to add and then we'll finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: No more wars.</span> <span id="s2675">No more wars.</span> <span id="s2676">But the Polish know that they did contribute a lot to our agony and killing and everything.</span> <span id="s2677">They did.</span> <span id="s2678">They should not say that they did not.</span> <span id="s2679">Not 100%, but a very small percentage.</span> <span id="s2680">When the Polish man came to us, I went into a ______ once with him and he said, see, they tell that Polish people did not help.</span> <span id="s2681">Here, he himself said, maybe one or two percent, maybe less.</span> <span id="s2682">This is sad because we lived with them and we could live in harmony and everything.</span> <span id="s2683">This is a deep, why?</span> <span id="s2684">Why?</span> <span id="s2685">Because we were born Jews?</span> <span id="s2686">So, that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">USHMM
