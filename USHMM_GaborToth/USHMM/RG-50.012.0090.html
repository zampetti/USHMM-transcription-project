<span id="s9">I was born in Oudshoorn, Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q:In what part of Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A:It was in the center of the big cities such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s12">It wasn't even a town; it was a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s15">I was the third of 12.</span> <span id="s16">They're still alive except one who died in a car accident twenty years ago.</span> <span id="s17">Three of the eleven are still alive live in Canada; the rest live in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">0185</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: He had a feed and grain store that supplied farmers nearby in the cities and in….</span> <span id="s21">In1925,when I was14 years old, we moved to Frieschland at the top of the Kurthee(ph).</span> <span id="s22">He brought a milling business, which was quite different than the one in Oudshoorn.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What type of a place was Frieschland?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: We lived in one of the eleven cities of Frieschland, called Fneke.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: In Oudshoorn, were there any Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">0214</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes there were.</span> <span id="s28">But it was unobserved; it was never talked about.</span> <span id="s29">I was very small, so I don't recall if there were Jews there or not.</span> <span id="s30">But if there were, they were just ordinary citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q:In Franeker?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: The same thing.</span> <span id="s33">I only met Jews later on when I started working on my own.</span> <span id="s34">From 1930 to 1939, with a break in between, worked with Phips.</span> <span id="s35">There I had Jewish boys twice.</span> <span id="s36">Both times were not very nice.</span> <span id="s37">I wouldn’t class them as the Jews.</span> <span id="s38">They were quite ruthless both of them.</span> <span id="s39">One escaped to the U.S.</span> <span id="s40">One belonged to the National Council of Jews in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s41">He escaped the Holocaust and went to Israel.</span> <span id="s42">When the Jews had to wear the stars later on after they left Philips, I recognized one of them in…,but he pretended not to know me.</span> <span id="s43">I went up to him and said if he was in any trouble to come to my place.</span> <span id="s44">I gave him my address.</span> <span id="s45">But I never heard anything from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">0268</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What type of business was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Philips was the big incandescent lamps radio plant.</span> <span id="s49">There was some sort of falling out between Ari and the department.</span> <span id="s50">He had to be reinstated in another department.</span> <span id="s51">My experience with the Jews at that time wasn't very good, but that didn't matter at all.</span> <span id="s52">Later we realized these people had to be helped; otherwise they'd be gone.</span> <span id="s53">My brother-in-law had been a black market dealer When the…came when the Jews were rounded up, my brother-in-law said that the was scared that the Jews he associated with would tell the police about his "dealership" when they started squeezing information out of the Jew.</span> <span id="s54">This was ridiculous because the Germans could careless Sol went there three times and convinced them they Jews should break up instead of staying there like sitting ducks.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">0315</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: This is

<p><span id="s73">A: My father.</span> <span id="s74">I was never close to my mother.</span> <span id="s75">As a matter of fact I didn't love her.</span> <span id="s76">She didn’t love me for a very peculiar reason, I was named after my father’s father, who was a bad guy in her opinion.</span> <span id="s77">Very poor businessman and short temper.</span> <span id="s78">So that meant that I was short tempered and a bad businessman.</span> <span id="s79">They had this crazy idea about all twelve kid.</span> <span id="s80">We were supposed to be like the people we were named after.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you know your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes and I admired him very much.</span> <span id="s83">He was a very good man.</span> <span id="s84">A poor

you?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s100">There was a teacher in Grade 3.</span> <span id="s101">He taught me self-esteem.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">0499</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: When were you finished with school?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I went through Grade 10.</span> <span id="s105">After that I went to a technical school practically at the level of

trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s110">I was an electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s111">I was a technologist at first because I didn’t pass the exams necessary.</span> <span id="s112">Now I am equivalent to college-educated.</span> <span id="s113">One of the reasons I left Holland was that it was too much work to go back to take all the tests.</span> <span id="s114">In Canada I could study on my own and pass the exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: When did you first become aware of the what Germans were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: In 1942.</span> <span id="s117">It was clear because they had the solution to solve the problem.</span> <span id="s118">The end was quite clear.</span> <span id="s119">My wife was a teacher at a school near the camp of Westerbork(ph).</span> <span id="s120">It was very close to the railroad.</span> <span id="s121">Then we saw that the people were loaded…standing room only.</span> <span id="s122">They threw cars out of the window in hopes that somebody would them and stick them in the mail.</span> <span id="s123">They didn’t go there to work--you give them a crumb so they get there…But this was obvious that this was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: When did you marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: 1936.</span> <span id="s126">In1968, my first wife died.</span>

id="s129">0635</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: When did you begin to act?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I had gone from Philips to Helmond where I was working as an industrial engineer in Vlisco.</span> <span id="s132">There were no Jews there that I know of…just a couple.</span> <span id="s133">Most people did not expect the worst.</span> <span id="s134">My brother-in-law asked me to take some people so he wouldn’t be blamed [for being involved in the black market]</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: You saw what happened at Westerbork but essentially you didn’t know what to do because you didn’t know any Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Your brother-in-law came to you.</span> <span id="s138">He had these people called the Winters.</span> <span id="s139">Now where did he get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">0694</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: They had come from Germany.</span> <span id="s142">He was a merchant in Lotbach(ph).</span> <span id="s143">In 1935 they crossed over to Holland.</span> <span id="s144">He had a business…in Weindhoven (ph).</span> <span id="s145">They managed to survive, but then they had to wear stars and had to disappear.</span> <span id="s146">My brother-in-law asked if I could get rid of them.</span> <span id="s147">So I went down to Weindhoven to tell him to get lost because Winters didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s148">He didn’t expect to be picked up by the Germans, so he asked us to take his father with a few belongings in a cardboard box and his14 year old daughter.</span> <span id="s149">She was with us on and off.</span> <span id="s150">Our solution was not to hide them.</span> <span id="s151">We just left the door open so they could come and go.</span> <span id="s152">It was safer to have the door open than to hide anything.</span> <span id="s153">We had young kids, too, so it wouldn't work otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Winters stayed with you himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span> <span id="s156">Winters and his wife never stayed with us permanently for any length of time.</span> <span id="s157">They had developed some contacts in Le Peel(ph), a marshy area east of Helmond.</span> <span id="s158">He had places to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: When w as your first child born?</span></p>

the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: W as he in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span> <span id="s166">Just the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: How did the Winters get in touch with your brother-in-law ?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Winters was working in the black market, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Did he ask your brother-in-law for help?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">0831</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No.</span> <span id="s172">My brother-in-law came to me and said get…of this guy.</span> <span id="s173">He was just sitting there to be picked up and my brother-in-la w thought if the police squeezed him enough, they would get him too.</span> <span id="s174">But the Germans didn’t even care.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So you saved the Winters to help your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No.</span> <span id="s177">I couldn't care less about my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s178">I did it to save the Winters.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Winters came to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s181">He ca m e sometimes.</span> <span id="s182">W hen Le Peel was closed, he'd come for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s183">My wife was very strict with him.</span> <span id="s184">She wrote out his schedule: up at 8; eat then; 9 o’clock, you go to the library and you study there until, etc., etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did he or his daughter look Jewish?</span> <span id="s186">W ere they Semitic looking?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Jews?</span> <span id="s188">You could smell them a mile away.</span> <span id="s189">Especially Ruth &amp; her mother, too.</span> <span id="s190">A big surprise came just before Pentecost, 1943.</span> <span id="s191">My wife was late.</span> <span id="s192">There came three people walking in the middle of the road to our house.</span> <span id="s193">It was Mrs. Winters and two daughters of the N.S.B Nazi leaders.</span> <span id="s194">They lived a couple houses down.</span> <span id="s195">She [Mrs. Winters] had lost her way and had asked the girls where the…lived in German of course.</span> <span id="s196">So we asked what the Heck did you do?</span> <span id="s197">We told you never to ask anyone where we lived.</span> <span id="s198">If you get lost, you go into a Roman Catholic Church, and they will help you.</span> <span id="s199">So that night, I went to all of my friends before curfew, and none of them wanted to take the lady for the night.</span> <span id="s200">(Visitors had to be reported to the City Hall) The [Nazi] girls must have been struck with blandness because this lady was as Jewish as they come.</span> <span id="s201">If they only opened their eyes, they would have seen what was going on.</span> <span id="s202">So the next morning I tried to find somebody to take her.</span> <span id="s203">I wasn’t going to take a chance.</span> <span id="s204">I found somebody who had done work for me before and told him I had an aunt in Rotterdam who had been bombed out, and could she stay with you for a couple weeks?</span> <span id="s205">He took her in after the boarding costs were paid.</span> <span id="s206">Then the danger was over in Le Peel and she went back.</span> <span id="s207">I don’t understand the conclusion of honor; this was something particular with me.</span> <span id="s208">The Lord promises His protection.</span> <span id="s209">If you read Psalm 34, it’s a question of doing what He wants you to do, then you can trust the Lord to protect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: But there were very pious Jews, too.</span> <span id="s211">Why weren't they protected?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I can’t answer that.</span> <span id="s213">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s214">There are many mysteries.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">1029</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: The whole Holocaust is a mystery.</span> <span id="s217">I think a great deal of your strength came from what you believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes, but it wasn’t a hard thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: But so few did it.</span> <span id="s220">Did the Germans ever come to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No.</span> <span id="s222">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: The Winters stayed with you from 1942 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: On and off until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s225">We didn't…thing down.</span> <span id="s226">We have our memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Were you under a lot of stress and tension at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s229">I was under a lot of stress.</span> <span id="s230">I had a lot of eczema at that time.</span> <span id="s231">It was a combination of harbouring Jews and the whole situation of the time.</span> <span id="s232">I had to scrounge to get food and work.</span> <span id="s233">The Dutch boys had to and work in Germany so they stayed at our place temporarily.</span> <span id="s234">I worked with the underground to get them cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">1087</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So you also worked to get false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">I falsified the identification cards for the Winters, too.</span> <span id="s239">He became a cattle dealer, and his wife, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s240">If people died, we got their IDs.</span> <span id="s241">We did this through the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did your minister know you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s244">He was in on the plot.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: How many others?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I only know of one.</span> <span id="s247">The father of one of the guys who didn’t want to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Was your wife under a lot of stress/tension at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s250">It shortened her life.</span> <span id="s251">She died in 1968 of complications to rheumatism.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What about your children who were born during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: They knew what was going on and didn’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did they have normal childhoods?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And the Winters' daughter: did she fit in?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">She wasn’t a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: You had many people in and out.</span> <span id="s260">How many would you say would you feed in any 2-day period?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: At the most there were three or four extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Did you know anyone else in the neighborhood harboring Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, but I’m sure people did it.</span> <span id="s264">You didn't talk though.</span> <span id="s265">The less you knew the better you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did any of your brothers and sisters help?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No.</span> <span id="s268">I wouldn’t have helped had I not been asked.</span> <span id="s269">It was just the circumstances.</span> <span id="s270">It was our duty to say yes as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">1190</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: W as this tim e good at 811?</span></p>
