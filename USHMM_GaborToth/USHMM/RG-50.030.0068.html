id="s11">01:00:47</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My real name is Morris Engelson, but that's an anglicized version of...in Polish it would be Mosha Englczyn, but any how, what's in a name.</span> <span id="s14">My Hebrew name is Moshay, and I come from a small town in the vicinity of Vilna, which is in the news now in Lithuania, of course.</span> <span id="s15">The town is called Popberezha or Podgrada in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s16">Now, the name would be Pograder which would be the Lithuanian version of the Polish name for Popberezha.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born in mid 1935, so I am just about 55 years old now, and that made me 6 years old in 1941 when the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Before the Germans came in, what do you remember of your very early years and I guess when the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">I remember a pretty happy sort of carefree childhood.</span> <span id="s22">Although it turned out we were not rich.</span> <span id="s23">In fact we were quite poor for a certain reason that happened earlier which is germane to this story.</span> <span id="s24">But Popberezha is a beautiful scenic area.</span> <span id="s25">It's a resort town.</span> <span id="s26">People came there for vacations.</span> <span id="s27">It's well known as a vacation spot.</span> <span id="s28">I remember people talking about...oh, this famous person came and that person came and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s29">So it's a beautiful area on two rivers.</span> <span id="s30">With bridges across the town or city as we call it.</span> <span id="s31">It's a small town.</span> <span id="s32">Roughly half Jewish and half mostly Polish people.</span> <span id="s33">Maybe 5,000 people altogether, about 2,000 Jews in the area.</span> <span id="s34">And there was a small place.</span> <span id="s35">It was a very safe place.</span> <span id="s36">The Jewish area was sort of by itself but not any significant amount of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s37">The Jews and the Poles got along reasonably well together which is unusual.</span> <span id="s38">And I remember it as a happy place and an enjoyable place with games and playing and running by the river and all kinds of adventures or misadventures.</span> <span id="s39">Stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">01:03:08</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Tell me about your parents.</span> <span id="s42">What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s44">My father was in business similar to his father in dealing with buying grain from farmers and reselling it, so he was a grain merchant he would call it.</span> <span id="s45">A total of seven brothers and sisters that he had, so I am dealing here on his side an extended family.</span> <span id="s46">They were all married.</span> <span id="s47">He was one of the youngest in the family so we're dealing with an extended family about 50 odd people.</span> <span id="s48">And my mother's family, she had a sister there.</span> <span id="s49">That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World War I and they came to this area after that but my father's family had lived there for many, many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different places.</span> <span id="s50">In fact, one sister was in another place called Soly, which helped us out later.</span> <span id="s51">But my father's family comes from an old Misnagid [non-chassidik] family .</span> <span id="s52">The whole area was Misnagid because of the Wilner Gaon and so forth.</span> <span id="s53">And my grandfather, Alav haShalom [may he rest in peace] was a very very staunch you might say stern type individual, but a very honorable person who believed in doing everything by the book if I can say it that way.</span> <span id="s54">Well known individual who paid for it in a certain way, but the Nazis when they came in they usually picked on somebody who they considered the leader of the community.</span> <span id="s55">I don't know why they picked on my grandfather because he was not the Rav [rabbi] but we have eye witness accounts that he was the one picked on.</span> <span id="s56">They beat him.</span> <span id="s57">They ripped his beard out, and they blinded him before they shot him.</span> <span id="s58">So that was not a good way to end your life at the age of 81.</span> <span id="s59">But he also was a grain merchant, but when I knew him he was very, very, very poor because something happened 20 years prior to that that made him poor.</span> <span id="s60">And that's an important story I have to tell you because that's what saved our life.</span> <span id="s61">It happened that he used to buy and sell grain from the local farmers.</span> <span id="s62">Local farmers in that area were very poor.</span> <span id="s63">They were sharecroppers because the primary ownership of land in this feudal society in Poland was from the large landowners a form of nobility.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">01:06:00 However, there was one farmer who for some strange means had acquired his own land and acquired a little bit of a farm and he was considered rich by those standards.</span> <span id="s65">And my grandfather used to do a lot of business with this man.</span> <span id="s66">One day it seems 15 years before the war or something like that, Grandfather decided that the way to...to really go was to become not only a merchant but a miller because the real money to be made was in turning the grain into flour.</span> <span id="s67">There were three mills in our town, all water-operated mills on the rivers.</span> <span id="s68">When one mill became available, he decide to buy it.</span> <span id="s69">And so he bought this mill and he spent everything he had...everything he could borrow to buy this mill and he had no money to buy grain.</span> <span id="s70">So he went to this particular farmer with whom he had dealt many times before and he made an agreement that he would buy the grain on credit.</span> <span id="s71">I don't know what the deal was, how much extra he paid him, but the farmer trusted him and he sold him the grain on credit.</span> <span id="s72">And the grain came in and it was put into the mill.</span> <span id="s73">It was all filled up and then according to the story apparently it was arson but nobody proved anything because the idea was the other two millers were jealous because they were afraid that he would become too much of a competitor.</span> <span id="s74">The mill caught fire and it was on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s75">And it was on the river and people could have put it out.</span> <span id="s76">They started to put it out, but my grandfather came out and he said, "There is nobody in there.</span> <span id="s77">No lives are involved.</span> <span id="s78">You will not put it out.</span> <span id="s79">It's Sabbath.‚Äù</span> <span id="s80">And he forbade them to put out this fire and the mill burned to the ground and all the grain with it.</span> <span id="s81">So he was bankrupt and he owed this farmer for all the grain.</span> <span id="s82">Now the farmer could have probably taken him to court or something, but I don't know what he could have done.</span> <span id="s83">In any event, my grandfather then walked about 20 miles or whatever the distance was to the farmer's house, the farm and he told the farmer that he would pay him back everything no matter how long it took.</span> <span id="s84">And it took something like 10, 15 years.</span> <span id="s85">Everything he had, everything he could get, and there were some...there was a son in the United States who sent money home.</span> <span id="s86">Everything the family went to this farmer to pay back for the grain.</span> <span id="s87">That's why the family was poor.</span> <span id="s88">Now, the critical issue is that after the Germans came in we escaped.</span> <span id="s89">Many Jews escaped.</span> <span id="s90">Those who had no money they usually did not survive because they couldn't pay anybody and people were not that altruistic because it was very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s91">Those who had money they did not survive either because eventually they came in contact with somebody who killed them for their money because it was very easy to kill a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">01:09:00 There were no penalties whatsoever.</span> <span id="s93">So anybody who wanted to kill a Jew and take their money, they just did it.</span> <span id="s94">We had no money.</span> <span id="s95">Nobody would kill us for our money.</span> <span id="s96">But what we had is the honor of the family that spent 15 years paying off.</span> <span id="s97">And this farmer's sons hid my father with the belief that if we survived they would be rewarded, and they knew that he meant it.</span> <span id="s98">So through this mill that burned down and my grandfather spending 15 years paying this farmer and his sons knowing that my father was the son of this man, they were willing to take the chance.</span> <span id="s99">So in a way he was paid for letting this thing burn down because he said you do not do work on Sabbath.</span> <span id="s100">(Long Pause) There's a reason for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Indeed.</span> <span id="s102">Alright.</span> <span id="s103">Thank you.</span> <span id="s104">Let us go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Let us go back to when the Russians came '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Tell us what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I remember that extremely well.</span> <span id="s110">I was standing by the road and my mother was screaming at me to come inside and it was the most fascinating sight that I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s111">This is a little town with dirt roads, not even paved, you understand.</span> <span id="s112">When we say roads it was the place where carts went, wagons.</span> <span id="s113">And I had never seen more than one automobile per month before and here were these cars, tanks, armored carriers, whatever, going for hours and hours on end.</span> <span id="s114">Non-stop!</span> <span id="s115">And I just couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s116">I didn't understand where these things came from.</span> <span id="s117">It was like magic, and it was just so fascinating to stand by the road and the dust and these things rumbling and making noises and so forth and finally she came and snatched me away because she thought it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s118">It wasn't dangerous.</span> <span id="s119">These people weren't doing anything.</span> <span id="s120">And they seemed to be going on for days.</span> <span id="s121">It wasn't.</span> <span id="s122">I am sure it was hours, but it seemed as if there were millions and millions of these tanks just non-stop continually going and going and going and going.</span> <span id="s123">And the Russians came and took over the place and russified it or whatever the right word is.</span> <span id="s124">They changed the administration.</span> <span id="s125">A lot of people were rounded up and sent to Siberia, the so-called wealthy and the landowners and the anti-communists and whoever they feared.</span> <span id="s126">Our life didn't change much because we were not rich to start with, as I told you the story and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">01:12:00 And we had a house, but that didn't make us into landowners.</span> <span id="s128">And life went on as before, and no significant changes of any kind except there was a lot of tension, the fear.</span> <span id="s129">You could sense different behaviors.</span> <span id="s130">Of course, there were stories which I didn't understand at the time about the atrocities in Poland, in the German occupied part of Poland.</span> <span id="s131">There were refugees that were coming through telling horrifying stories that nobody believed.</span> <span id="s132">I mean it couldn't possibly be that bad, you know, and so forth.</span> <span id="s133">But on the whole, it continued to be peaceful and most of what I remember of the town...in fact, about what it looked like and...and it's beauty and so forth I think is more from that time than before '39 because I was very young, only 4 years old in '39.</span> <span id="s134">It's hard to remember precisely.</span> <span id="s135">There is one memory that I am certain is before '39 because I fell into something, almost got killed, but anyhow.</span> <span id="s136">It was a childhood accident.</span> <span id="s137">But otherwise, the Russians didn't do anything to us, but there were various changes in the atmosphere which was more of World War II than the Russians themselves.</span> <span id="s138">And then in 1941 in June very suddenly...it happened very quickly as I assume it happened everywhere.</span> <span id="s139">The Russians were there one day, and then they weren't there.</span> <span id="s140">There was hardly any fighting.</span> <span id="s141">There was no front.</span> <span id="s142">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s143">All of a sudden there were no Russians and there were Germans.</span> <span id="s144">And we knew they were there because right out from this town was a very large military camp, a big military base barracks where military were stationed.</span> <span id="s145">They lived there.</span> <span id="s146">They had barracks there.</span> <span id="s147">Right out side of Popberezha, about couple of kilometers.</span> <span id="s148">A very, very large camp and the soldiers used to come into town sometimes.</span> <span id="s149">All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were there.</span> <span id="s150">The Russians came in and the Russians took over that camp and made it into a Russian military camp.</span> <span id="s151">And all of a sudden, the Russians weren't there and the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s152">So the Russians interlude was sort of a beginning and an end and sort of no middle to me.</span> <span id="s153">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Tell me about the Germans and what happened.</span> <span id="s155">How did life change.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, the Germans came and the Jews were...two basic orders.</span> <span id="s157">One was a location order and since the Jews tended to live in a certain area anyhow there wasn't really that much relocation.</span> <span id="s158">Some people had to move and it got a little bit more crowded, but it didn't crowd us all that much.</span> <span id="s159">They just adjusted the boundaries of the Jewish quarter because the Jews and the Poles did not intermingle all that much even though it was a combined Jewish-Polish town.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">01:15:09 The Jews lived in one area, and the Poles lived in another area.</span> <span id="s161">And so the few Jews who lived outside of this area were forced to come in and find places with friends, relatives, whoever it may be, and it got a little bit more crowded.</span> <span id="s162">The other thing, of course, was that there were curfews and you could not leave this quarter.</span> <span id="s163">There were boundaries but no real fences, no barbed wire, no real guards to speak of.</span> <span id="s164">You had to be there, and the penalty was harsh.</span> <span id="s165">If you were found outside it, you were shot.</span> <span id="s166">And they did do a lot of shooting of people.</span> <span id="s167">Terror killings.</span> <span id="s168">They came in and just took little groups here and there.</span> <span id="s169">And no rhyme or reason.</span> <span id="s170">Presumably they were leaders or whatever, but many people that were killed, they were not leaders.</span> <span id="s171">I don't understand what the rationale was.</span> <span id="s172">Maybe just to generate enough fear that people would obey orders and not argue about it.</span> <span id="s173">And people had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s174">You had to wear two stars, one front and one back.</span> <span id="s175">And if you were caught without a star, the penalty was death.</span> <span id="s176">So you had to wear the star to be identified fully as a Jew.</span> <span id="s177">And you were not permitted to go outside the Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s178">Life became more difficult in terms of food and making a living because all the relationships and business things, and whatever the case may be...those could not exist anymore.</span> <span id="s179">So people lived off of accumulations and savings or whatever.</span> <span id="s180">But that was of no consequence because we're dealing with only 3 months and I am sure the people had enough capital or whatever to live for 3 months.</span> <span id="s181">So there was no real transition to Jew(ish) ghetto situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How did you feel the change as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: The change was a different life style.</span> <span id="s184">It's a tension, and it was very clear...the kids understood it very well.</span> <span id="s185">There were no arguments about the curfews and not being able to go to certain places that you used to go and so forth.</span> <span id="s186">It was very clear that this was serious.</span> <span id="s187">This was real.</span> <span id="s188">This wasn't just parental whim...no, you can't go here because whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s189">This was very clear that the kids almost...it's almost like a law of nature.</span> <span id="s190">At that age you understand that you don't jump off the roof because it is dangerous and it isn't just that your parent is afraid.</span> <span id="s191">You really don't jump off the roof because you may get hurt and you're old enough and smart enough to know that you don't want that to happen to you.</span> <span id="s192">It was almost that kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s193">It was not an issue of somebody telling you.</span> <span id="s194">You knew you did not do these things.</span> <span id="s195">It was almost as if it was a physical law.</span> <span id="s196">You didn't cross this barrier because something horrible would happen.</span> <span id="s197">sothere was no issue about dis...disobeying anybody or...or trying some childish tricks about these rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">01:18:05 You stayed where you were supposed to stay.</span> <span id="s199">You wore the yellow star like you were supposed to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s200">It was a very strange experience in terms of growing up.</span> <span id="s201">There was a jump of years.</span> <span id="s202">I would think that normally a child would not acquire that kind of mental outlook till later.</span> <span id="s203">And in my case I was 6, and it happened very fast and I don't know exactly how the adjustment was made, but I do recall that all of a sudden I had this outlook that this is normal.</span> <span id="s204">This is how you were supposed to do and it wasn't a matter of somebody telling me.</span> <span id="s205">I believed it.</span> <span id="s206">So there was some kind of mental adjustment.</span> <span id="s207">I had no idea how it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You were an observant family I understand it...Jewishly observant family.</span> <span id="s209">Did that...did the curfew affect that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No.</span> <span id="s211">Our family, my grandfather was extremely Orthodox.</span> <span id="s212">Mine was not that much in those areas.</span> <span id="s213">Here in the United States it would be considered.</span> <span id="s214">I mean it depends.</span> <span id="s215">Everything is relative.</span> <span id="s216">But it wasn't any big deal.</span> <span id="s217">All the Jews were observant in one form or another.</span> <span id="s218">Those who were not observant were what you call it extremely traditional.</span> <span id="s219">But Lodz(???)</span> <span id="s220">and the other areas we were hardly Yiddishist related.</span> <span id="s221">We had many people there in our own family too that were involved with Yiddishkeit not Jewish historical, but the Yiddish language and the Yiddish literature.</span> <span id="s222">Vilna, as you know, was the place of the YIVO, the Jewish what do you call it?</span> <span id="s223">"Wissenschaft" Jewish knowledge institute, the Jewish Knowledge Institute or whatever the proper translation would be.</span> <span id="s224">And it was a modern type movement dealing with current events as opposed to historical Judaism, and dealing with the Yiddish language as a force and the Yiddish literature as a force.</span> <span id="s225">And many of these people were totally unobservant in the sense of holding to the Mitzvoth because they believed (not) in the Torah.</span> <span id="s226">But that was a way of life and it would be very fine for these people not to follow through.</span> <span id="s227">So they were traditional in the sense of this is how a Jew lived whereas those who were observant were this is how a Jew lived and this is how a Jew must live.</span> <span id="s228">It's a very fine distinction in that case.</span> <span id="s229">Today, of course, the distinctions are much greater.</span> <span id="s230">So I don't think there was any impact in terms of the behavior of the town because that's how Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">01:21:00 And all of the stuff was internal anyway.</span> <span id="s232">It isn't as if you went across the street to a Polish friend and had a ham sandwich.</span> <span id="s233">So if you are talking about kosher food it was all Jewishly created in any event and the fact that the Germans were around us that didn't change anything.</span> <span id="s234">At least I don't recall it.</span> <span id="s235">I mean this is a very poor perspective from a 6 year old, but that's how I recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: How did things change?</span> <span id="s237">When did things change?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, things changed a couple of months after the Germans came really....significantly in that places started disappearing.</span> <span id="s239">I don't know how else to say it.</span> <span id="s240">All of a sudden a certain place wasn't there.</span> <span id="s241">There were no Jews there.</span> <span id="s242">It as if it was pulled off the map and shipped off to Mars or something.</span> <span id="s243">Somebody would come in, "I escaped.</span> <span id="s244">All the rest are gone.‚Äù</span> <span id="s245">"Where are they gone?"</span> <span id="s246">"They're dead.‚Äù</span> <span id="s247">"Why are the dead?"</span> <span id="s248">"I don't know.‚Äù</span> <span id="s249">"Did you see it?"</span> <span id="s250">"I didn't see anything.</span> <span id="s251">I escaped.</span> <span id="s252">Nobody knows anything.</span> <span id="s253">Can't find them.</span> <span id="s254">They're dead.‚Äù</span> <span id="s255">And it was clear that they're dead.</span> <span id="s256">The question is why?</span> <span id="s257">And there were all kinds of theories.</span> <span id="s258">People ascribed some very specific rationale, logical reasons for why the Germans were doing these things as opposed to just pure spite or hatred or some manifestation of a pagan religion that made it necessary to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s259">So people tried to ascribe logistical war reasons.</span> <span id="s260">They wiped out this town because they needed for a military base and they weren't going to bother to relocate the Jews because they don't care about Jews anyhow so they killed them.</span> <span id="s261">But they don't need our place for a military base.</span> <span id="s262">And later when we, my mother and father, escaped to Belarussia (Belarus), the whole rationale was they're killing all the Jews here but the Belarussia is alright because that's across the border.</span> <span id="s263">So places started to disappear and because the they were places of like kind in terms of borders and location and other things, there was a general feeling we too were on the list.</span> <span id="s264">The question is what do you do about it.</span> <span id="s265">And we couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s266">So there's a great deal of uncertainty, a great deal of fear, a great deal of wondering what would happen and that people were very jittery.</span> <span id="s267">It's like living in San Francisco after the earthquake recently and wondering what...when the aftershocks going to hit.</span> <span id="s268">Do you run?</span> <span id="s269">Do you stay?</span> <span id="s270">Do you come home?</span> <span id="s271">Are the walls going to crumble down?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">01:24:00 Except you couldn't go any place.</span> <span id="s273">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s274">People wonder why they didn't escape or anything like that.</span> <span id="s275">There was no place to escape.</span> <span id="s276">There was absolutely no place to go.</span> <span id="s277">Those people who escaped...there were some who managed to escape as the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s278">They escaped in front of the Germans and they went into Russia.</span> <span id="s279">They escaped with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s280">Those people really had some place to go.</span> <span id="s281">They had the foresight and they went.</span> <span id="s282">But anybody who stayed, the front was so far behind us or rather front of us, which ever way and the Germans were practically in Moscow.</span> <span id="s283">There was no place to escape.</span> <span id="s284">So the change was more of the same kind in terms of a general feeling of I won't say fear.</span> <span id="s285">Uncertainty and dread.</span> <span id="s286">I think dread is a better word than fear.</span> <span id="s287">Not knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: What happened is that in September of 1941 on the Friday before Sabbath Shuva which was on the 20th of September German groups...soldiers came and organized various local men villages, primarily civilian.</span> <span id="s290">There may have been some Poles in those groups but I am not aware of any, and it is my understanding it was one of the Einsatzgruppen came to finish off Popberezha.</span> <span id="s291">There were about 2,000 Jews in Popberezha and surrounding vicinity there were little towns or farm communities or whatever and just lived all over the place.</span> <span id="s292">It happened that one of the local police functionaries was friendly with a certain Jews because of some prior favors that they had done to each other.</span> <span id="s293">And he knew that these people came in and they were organizing various things.</span> <span id="s294">He didn't know precisely why but it was quite obvious.</span> <span id="s295">And so he came to his Jewish friend and he said, "Something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s296">You have hours before the place will be surrounded and nobody will be able to get out.‚Äù</span> <span id="s297">This man sent out the alarm.</span> <span id="s298">Most people (a) didn't believe it and (b) had no idea what to do anyhow.</span> <span id="s299">They weren't going to leave children.</span> <span id="s300">They weren't going to leave parents, and they had no place to go and they said, "If I am going to die, I might as well die right here.‚Äù</span> <span id="s301">Many people such as my father believed it more or less but they wouldn't go because in prior times there had been false alarms and there was a great deal of looting and people were afraid of losing their few possessions because really you were not going to have a chance to work or do anything useful to gain more possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">01:27:00 But there was some work I should say.</span> <span id="s303">The Germans put the Jews to work in slave labor and it was very hard work.</span> <span id="s304">In fact, my father worked at slave labor and he fell down.</span> <span id="s305">It wasn't deliberate.</span> <span id="s306">He fell off a..</span> <span id="s307">.</span> <span id="s308">a scaffolding or something and he broke two of his ribs.</span> <span id="s309">So at that time he had taped up ribs and...and that was the situation.</span> <span id="s310">But anyhow my father decided to send my mother, brother and myself out.</span> <span id="s311">We...we agreed where they would go and he said he knew the area very well.</span> <span id="s312">He was a strong man.</span> <span id="s313">He was a very, very strong physically, my father in spite of his broken rib, and he felt confident that he could get out no matter what they did because he knew the area extremely well and he would be able to hide and sneak through.</span> <span id="s314">He said, "I am going to stay home and if there's looting I'll stop them.</span> <span id="s315">If something is happening I'll come meet you there next day.‚Äù</span> <span id="s316">So we packed up some food.</span> <span id="s317">It was the Sabbath food, some chicken I remember and a few other things in a bundle, dressed up as peasant woman and took off the yellow stars and we walked right out of town.</span> <span id="s318">Nobody stopped us.</span> <span id="s319">There were no guards.</span> <span id="s320">There was no nothing.</span> <span id="s321">The problem was we had to walk right by the military barracks.</span> <span id="s322">And that scared us because we were sure that these people would do something.</span> <span id="s323">But they didn't.</span> <span id="s324">They had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s325">Those were ordinary soldiers.</span> <span id="s326">The Einsatzgruppen group were the SS, and the soldiers were soldiers, and we were just peasants walking by.</span> <span id="s327">We walked right by the barracks a couple of miles out of town where there's a little road to the side where all these Germans...the soldiers were staying, and we saw them coming and going and we just kept walking.</span> <span id="s328">And it was nothing.</span> <span id="s329">And so we kept walking.</span> <span id="s330">And we had a couple of hours walk to get out of town to a certain farm of a woman that our family knew, had done some business with her.</span> <span id="s331">Fine lady presumably.</span> <span id="s332">She was a widow, had a teenage son.</span> <span id="s333">I would guess 15, 16 years old.</span> <span id="s334">And we came there and she was at home and mother told her something is happening and we need to hide.</span> <span id="s335">The woman was very fearful.</span> <span id="s336">She didn't want us there, but she couldn't turn us away.</span> <span id="s337">So she said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s338">I won't let you in the house.</span> <span id="s339">I am afraid.</span> <span id="s340">Go stay in the barn.‚Äù</span> <span id="s341">There was a barn, and there was hay in the barn, and we crawled up in the loft and the hay, and the barn walls were not wood.</span> <span id="s342">They were kind of straw and we could see through the chinks in the matted straw.</span> <span id="s343">And during the night we started hearing shooting.</span> <span id="s344">So it was bad.</span> <span id="s345">It was clear that something was really going on.</span> <span id="s346">It was a lot of shooting.</span> <span id="s347">And father was supposed to come during the night if something would happen.</span> <span id="s348">He didn't come.</span> <span id="s349">And so we were sure that he couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s350">That was the end of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">01:30:00 In the morning we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s352">But before we could do something, a Lithuanian local auxiliary came to the house and he wanted to know if any Jews were in the area and the woman, "I haven't...I don't know anything about Jews.</span> <span id="s353">No Jews in my house.</span> <span id="s354">If you want, come in and look.‚Äù</span> <span id="s355">And he says, "There are other areas.</span> <span id="s356">What about your barn?</span> <span id="s357">Jews have sneaked into the barn.‚Äù</span> <span id="s358">She said, "Silly, what would Jews be doing in a barn?"</span> <span id="s359">"Listen, you have been working very hard," she says, "it's been a horrible day.</span> <span id="s360">They're working all night chasing these terrible Jews.</span> <span id="s361">Come in and have something to eat and you can chase some more Jews.‚Äù</span> <span id="s362">He says, "Okay," so they went into the house.</span> <span id="s363">And she gave him breakfast.</span> <span id="s364">I don't know what.</span> <span id="s365">He was eating breakfast and her teenage son came into the barn and we heard this and this was very close so we could hear them talking.</span> <span id="s366">We saw him with a gun, a bolt action rifle.</span> <span id="s367">I remember it.</span> <span id="s368">You had to pull the bolt, an old type rifle.</span> <span id="s369">And the son came in and he said, "I'm going to get you across the river.</span> <span id="s370">Come quickly.‚Äù</span> <span id="s371">Now Popberezha is on two rivers as I said.</span> <span id="s372">One is a major river called the Lyna [this river is far west from Vilnius!]</span> <span id="s373">which you will find in all the big maps I think.</span> <span id="s374">It was the Lyna that was going over there or it could have been the other one.</span> <span id="s375">I can't swear to it.</span> <span id="s376">Anyhow he came with a boat.</span> <span id="s377">We got into the boat and he was rowing us across the river and we were about two-thirds across and for whatever reason this person saw us through the window.</span> <span id="s378">He got up, he stretched or whatever.</span> <span id="s379">He saw us through the window.</span> <span id="s380">He dropped his where the .......??</span> <span id="s381">is gone.</span> <span id="s382">He ran out and he pointed his gun at this young man and he started shouting for him to come back or he would kill him but this fellow continued to row for about another half a minute.</span> <span id="s383">We were close.</span> <span id="s384">If we were not close, I don't know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s385">He continued to row.</span> <span id="s386">We got to this shore.</span> <span id="s387">We jumped out and then this fellow, I think, he shot one shot or something like that.</span> <span id="s388">This guy turned around and he came back.</span> <span id="s389">He came back.</span> <span id="s390">He got him in the boat and rowed him across so the Lithuanian rode across and he was about 5, 7 minutes behind us.</span> <span id="s391">He got out of the boat and we were near the woods.</span> <span id="s392">There were some woods there.</span> <span id="s393">And he starting shooting at us.</span> <span id="s394">And we just kept going into the woods and he was right behind us.</span> <span id="s395">And I don't know how he missed us, but he missed us.</span> <span id="s396">Now we couldn't go very fast because we were in the woods and there were trees and there were branches ripping us up, you know, and I was not running too fast.</span> <span id="s397">I'm a little kid.</span> <span id="s398">And we were not woodsmen people.</span> <span id="s399">We're towns people.</span> <span id="s400">So we kept running in the woods and he was behind us shooting at us all the time.</span> <span id="s401">And this woman was sure that we were dead.</span> <span id="s402">I mean it's impossible that we would escape.</span> <span id="s403">And she never saw him again.</span> <span id="s404">He just went wherever he went.</span> <span id="s405">And she never saw us.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:33:00 She didn't go into the woods to look obviously.</span> <span id="s407">Anyhow, he didn't kill us.</span> <span id="s408">So we were in these woods and we're running in the wood and finally, we knew we lost him.</span> <span id="s409">But we're lost in the woods.</span> <span id="s410">We don't know where to go or anything.</span> <span id="s411">Just lost in the woods.</span> <span id="s412">And we're wondering around the woods in circles or whatever...just going in the woods.</span> <span id="s413">Finally, we're up on a hill or something and in the distance we saw the spire of a church.</span> <span id="s414">Very tall.</span> <span id="s415">So we needed a direction to go.</span> <span id="s416">Now a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s417">Many of the priests in that area were illiterate priests.</span> <span id="s418">They were peasants themselves, and they were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s419">I have to say this.</span> <span id="s420">They were illiterate and they believed the Jews killed God.</span> <span id="s421">The Jews crucified Jesus and they preached it.</span> <span id="s422">And not as badly in other places but they preached it and there were plenty of anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s423">The towns people themselves were not bad.</span> <span id="s424">Strange deal.</span> <span id="s425">This church that we saw, this priest was not only not anti-Semitic, he was, you might call, philo-semitic.</span> <span id="s426">He really believed that the Jews were a good people and that it was his christian duty to protect the Jews.</span> <span id="s427">He was very friendly with the Jews.</span> <span id="s428">And we got to this church and a woman came out...the housekeeper or whatever.</span> <span id="s429">She says, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s430">The priest is not here.</span> <span id="s431">They're killing the Jews in town and he went to see if he could help.</span> <span id="s432">But he left word if any Jew managed to come to this area I am to do certain things for you.</span> <span id="s433">Here is some food.‚Äù</span> <span id="s434">And what she gave us is milk, something to drink.</span> <span id="s435">"And I will lead you to where you can escape.‚Äù</span> <span id="s436">And she sent us off to a farm.</span> <span id="s437">She told us where to go.</span> <span id="s438">And we had not known about this thing at all.</span> <span id="s439">It was an old smuggling network.</span> <span id="s440">The area is on the border between Poland and Lithuania and it changed hands many times and the people in this area, they didn't feel the border was real.</span> <span id="s441">I mean sometimes it's Poland, sometimes Lithuania.</span> <span id="s442">Who cares about customs.</span> <span id="s443">There was a whole bunch of people, a gang or whatever you call it who were smugglers.</span> <span id="s444">And the commodities they used to smuggle was saccharin (it) was a very big commodity because it's small, and it was very precious.</span> <span id="s445">Substitute for sugar because sugar was very hard to get.</span> <span id="s446">And cigarettes.</span> <span id="s447">That was their big thing.</span> <span id="s448">Saccharin and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s449">Anyhow, so she got in touch with this gang of smugglers.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">01:36:00 Now they were not altruistic and they were not anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s451">They enjoyed crossing borders and taking risks if they got paid.</span> <span id="s452">So whatever money Mother had she paid up, and we went from hand to hand to hand to hand...a 2 week walk at night and they would hand us off to the next station of this smuggling network.</span> <span id="s453">And on the road on the way lots of other Jews got involved in this.</span> <span id="s454">Pretty soon there was anything...20, 30 people, sometimes coming and going, each one looking to get to a certain place.</span> <span id="s455">And we were looking to get to Colsol in Belarus where mother had a sister and she figured that's where she could go where she knew somebody.</span> <span id="s456">So he told them where she wanted to go and they said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s457">We'll move you on this way.</span> <span id="s458">And this people were going to move you that way.‚Äù</span> <span id="s459">Was a whole network of these people.</span> <span id="s460">And along the way, each one you gave a little bit of money.</span> <span id="s461">As long as your money held out you were alright.</span> <span id="s462">They gave you food.</span> <span id="s463">During the day we were hiding and at night we were walking through fields, across barbed wire fences and all kinds of stuff and it was pitch dark and they knew all the holes and all the ditches and they would say, "Stop here.</span> <span id="s464">There's going to be a big ditch.</span> <span id="s465">Hold hands cause you'll fall down.‚Äù</span> <span id="s466">And we would hold on and walk across.</span> <span id="s467">And we walked for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s468">And pretty soon we were on the outskirts of this place and they said, "That's it.</span> <span id="s469">Our job stops here.</span> <span id="s470">You're on your own.</span> <span id="s471">Do whatever you like.‚Äù</span> <span id="s472">And all of a sudden they weren't there.</span> <span id="s473">And so we were down to nothing.</span> <span id="s474">My mother had two wedding rings.</span> <span id="s475">She had her own wedding ring and her father's wedding ring with her.</span> <span id="s476">Everything else was given away to these people, and we had to get to this place.</span> <span id="s477">And it was far away and also dangerous.</span> <span id="s478">And there was a farmer with a wagon driving by so she came to him and she asked him if he would drive us to this ghetto if he knew where it was.</span> <span id="s479">He said, "Sure.‚Äù</span> <span id="s480">"Would you drive us?"</span> <span id="s481">He said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s482">Pay me.‚Äù</span> <span id="s483">So she decided she would pay him with her own wedding ring and hold father's because this was a memento.</span> <span id="s484">She was sure father was dead.</span> <span id="s485">So she gave him her wedding ring and he drove us right to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s486">Was no problem.</span> <span id="s487">In the ghetto we came right in and I have to say this because there's feeling I have.</span> <span id="s488">I am unhappy with certain historians and other analysts who claim that the leaders of the ghettos and the Jewish police were all nasty and hoodlums.</span> <span id="s489">Clearly, there were some nasty people there as anybody who rises to power and in the major ghettos there were some tyrants.</span> <span id="s490">But all my experiences this one and others as I'll tell you, these people did an exemplary, selfless job in extremely different circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">01:39:00 We came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s492">They didn't know us.</span> <span id="s493">They didn't owe us.</span> <span id="s494">They took us in.</span> <span id="s495">They created papers for us as if we were members of the ghetto so we could live there.</span> <span id="s496">They shared their food.</span> <span id="s497">They shared what they had.</span> <span id="s498">We became members of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s499">We were fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s500">They took us in.</span> <span id="s501">There're other incidences when we escaped from this ghetto where we had to go some place.</span> <span id="s502">The same deal.</span> <span id="s503">In my experience, this is a baseless (ALL SOUND STOPS AT THIS POINT.</span> <span id="s504">I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ON THIS TAPE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF TAPE LEFT AND THIS ENDING DOES NOT MATCH THE START OF THE NEXT TAPE).</span></p> <p><span id="s505">INSERT there are nine typewritten pages of insert at this point that must be somewhere.</span> <span id="s506">I have accuracy checked the transcript.</span> <span id="s507">mschwarz</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s509">We are back on camera, and they are bringing you to where your father is.</span> <span id="s510">Can you describe that reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: That was an emotional reunion.</span> <span id="s512">I have to say.</span> <span id="s513">I really don't remember that much.</span> <span id="s514">There was a lot of hugging and holding and Father hadn't slept for 2 days, of course.</span> <span id="s515">He was just walking around, pacing.</span> <span id="s516">He was a nervous wreck, but as soon as we saw him, he said, "I knew everything would be alright because I saw the snow.‚Äù</span> <span id="s517">When he saw the snow he knew everything was alright.</span> <span id="s518">And then 2 months later, this was in December 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">02:01:30</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Before you go to 2 months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Where were you brought?</span> <span id="s523">Where was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: My father was in this place, the farm where these people lived.</span> <span id="s525">And arrangements were made that we would stay there too but we would hide in a barn.</span> <span id="s526">We did not stay there very, very long it turned out.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">02:02:00 Somebody saw us or maybe they didn't see us, but there was a suspicion that somebody saw us, and there was a great fear.</span> <span id="s528">But I think somebody did see us because there was some searches going on.</span> <span id="s529">There was a great fear that we were betrayed and we would be caught.</span> <span id="s530">So we had to escape and there was no place else to go, and this was not 2 months later but about 4 months later.</span> <span id="s531">It was already toward the spring, toward the middle March, April of 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And you had been hiding how in the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It was sort of a barn and we kinda lived there.</span> <span id="s534">That was not a big thing.</span> <span id="s535">There was another barn later which was a major thing to me.</span> <span id="s536">This barn was transitory and I really don't have any great recollection because we moved around.</span> <span id="s537">Sometimes we're here, sometimes we're there.</span> <span id="s538">Sometimes we were in the house behind the oven.</span> <span id="s539">There was a little, kind of cubicle except that it was very hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">02:03:00 It was a big brick oven that also was used to heating the house and it was very hot, but when we were presumably betrayed by someone we had to escape from the house.</span> <span id="s541">And we went into the field.</span> <span id="s542">A lot of it was potato country, and when they harvested potatoes they stored them in holes under ground in the field.</span> <span id="s543">They would dig a big hole and that's where the potatoes were kept because of cold air and so forth.</span> <span id="s544">Well, we hid in a little hole underneath the potatoes in the big hole, which was a very unpleasant place because there were all kinds of worms and things and animals in there.</span> <span id="s545">It was just a big hole in the ground and potato bugs and whatever, and it just drove my mother crazy.</span> <span id="s546">She couldn't stand those things.</span> <span id="s547">She was almost willing to go and be caught.</span> <span id="s548">My father just about forcible put her in there because, you know, she's not afraid of the Nazis, but she's afraid of the potato bugs.</span> <span id="s549">Obviously she went down eventually, but it was not a pleasant place to be.</span> <span id="s550">It's damp and eventually I got sick.</span> <span id="s551">I became very sick and some kind of bronchitis and they thought I would die.</span> <span id="s552">My father went out in the middle of the night and he went to a farm someplace...don't know where...and he stole.</span> <span id="s553">I mean that's the only words for it.</span> <span id="s554">In a sense he stole.</span> <span id="s555">He milked a cow, and he brought back warm milk.</span> <span id="s556">The only warm thing we could have because there was no fire or anything.</span> <span id="s557">It was cold.</span> <span id="s558">And that's what I drank.</span> <span id="s559">And I don't know if the milk helped, but I became better.</span> <span id="s560">So he stole some milk.</span> <span id="s561">Not a terrible crime.</span> <span id="s562">Anyhow, after that we could not stay there anymore, and then we moved to another family.</span> <span id="s563">Whereas the first family had some relationship and they had some reasons and they had reason to believe that we would really reward because my father promised and the grandfather and all that stuff, which was all true.</span> <span id="s564">This other family, we kinda knew them, but there was no special relationship.</span> <span id="s565">And this other family was very poor.</span> <span id="s566">They had a lot of kids and they were very poor.</span> <span id="s567">They didn't have enough to feed themselves and they took us in.</span> <span id="s568">No ulterior motives.</span> <span id="s569">They didn't ask for anything.</span> <span id="s570">And these are the people that we really gave everything we could, even more than the other ones.</span> <span id="s571">There were two families.</span> <span id="s572">Okay?</span> <span id="s573">Andamazing people.</span> <span id="s574">Sienkowitz and Bagdanowski.</span> <span id="s575">I should say the names.</span> <span id="s576">These are important people.</span> <span id="s577">Two families.</span> <span id="s578">Sienkowitz and Bagdanowsky.</span> <span id="s579">And we hid in a barn over there.</span> <span id="s580">We were in a loft in a hidden compartment in the loft and that was what I remember the most of the hiding and it was, for a young kid I didn't realize it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">02:06:10 As an adult I really don't understand how I survived it and be half-way normal because it was tremendous sense of deprivation.</span> <span id="s582">It was dark.</span> <span id="s583">Everything was closed.</span> <span id="s584">There was some light from the chinks in the slates in the roofs but it was dark during the day and during the night.</span> <span id="s585">And there were always people, strangers whoever, so you could not speak out loud.</span> <span id="s586">So for over a year I was in the dark and I didn't speak.</span> <span id="s587">And that's a crazy environment.</span> <span id="s588">And I don't know.</span> <span id="s589">I can't say I'm completely normal, but I don't think I'm very peculiar.</span> <span id="s590">And so maybe that's a good sign that people can overcome all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s591">And we stayed there for just about a year.</span> <span id="s592">Now I need to back track one thing what kept us going and what kept these people going which is what happened about 2 months or so after we reunited with Father.</span> <span id="s593">You will recall from history that when (General von) Paulus was surrounded and captured in Stalingrad in January of 1943, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s594">I would have to look it up.</span> <span id="s595">And the Russians made a big propaganda deal out of it.</span> <span id="s596">They dropped leaflets all over...not Germany maybe, but all over the prior Russian territories.</span> <span id="s597">Not only telling about it, but with complete pictures so it could not argued that it's a fake.</span> <span id="s598">Or from Paulus and his bedraggled remnants of army or whatever thousand they captured...I don't know...300,000 that were there showing that they really were captured.</span> <span id="s599">This was a tremendous celebration for us.</span> <span id="s600">Father was convinced everybody that we talked to...all the...all the Gentiles were convinced that there's no question who would win the war.</span> <span id="s601">It was no longer a issue of which side am I going to be on because I don't want to be in trouble with the victors.</span> <span id="s602">The victors were going to be the Allies.</span> <span id="s603">The Germans were going to lose the war.</span> <span id="s604">There was just no doubt.</span> <span id="s605">No matter what the Germans said, no matter what they did.</span> <span id="s606">Once when Paulus was destroyed in Stalingrad, as far as we're concerned, it is a matter of how long will it take.</span> <span id="s607">Made life a lot easier.</span> <span id="s608">All the uncertainty was gone.</span> <span id="s609">All we had to do is stay alive.</span> <span id="s610">And these people were certain if we were alive, eventually we would be liberated and if we could do something for them because they were poor people...these last ones and the previously ones were not so poor, but even so we would keep our word.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">02:09:00 So it changed everything.</span> <span id="s612">That victory in Stalingrad had special meaning for me because it really was the turning point as most historians say of the war in Russia, but also the turning point of belief in what was coming among those people who had to survive...the remaining Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Tell me a little more about life in the attic and how the farmer helped you particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s615">Yeah.</span> <span id="s616">I don't know how the deal came about, but my parents...my father used to go out and work sometime on the farm.</span> <span id="s617">If somebody saw him, they could get away with it.</span> <span id="s618">His hair had turned completely grey.</span> <span id="s619">I mean completely grey, prematurely grey.</span> <span id="s620">And so rather than use his regular name which himself was not necessarily a Jewish name his name was Wolf and in Polish it's Ulfa so it could be maybe not a Jew, but it's sort of Jewish.</span> <span id="s621">So they started calling him Stary.</span> <span id="s622">Stary in Polish means the old one because of his grey hair.</span> <span id="s623">And so he acquired the nickname Stary and on that basis nobody would know who he is.</span> <span id="s624">"Who's that?"</span> <span id="s625">"Oh, that's Stary.</span> <span id="s626">He came to help us.‚Äù</span> <span id="s627">Or something.</span> <span id="s628">And so he could go out during the day.</span> <span id="s629">My mother could go out sometimes.</span> <span id="s630">Her Polish was quite decent.</span> <span id="s631">My brother's Polish was not wonderful, but not too bad because he had gone to school prior.</span> <span id="s632">I didn't know any Polish.</span> <span id="s633">I could only speak Yiddish, and I never went to local school.</span> <span id="s634">My Polish was just words that I picked up, you know.</span> <span id="s635">You live in a town you pick up Polish, but it's not as if you live in the United States, where you live here you speak English from birth no matter what your ethnic heritage.</span> <span id="s636">Over there if you were Jewish you spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s637">Who spoke Polish unless you went to school or when you got older.</span> <span id="s638">So my Polish was just awful.</span> <span id="s639">I don't know any Polish to this day.</span> <span id="s640">I know Russian because this...this one and a half years was really Russian...Russian school so I..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">I have some decent knowledge of Russian.</span> <span id="s643">My Polish is just useless.</span> <span id="s644">My brother's Polish was not that terrible.</span> <span id="s645">He could go out.</span> <span id="s646">I could not go out.</span> <span id="s647">It was dangerous.</span> <span id="s648">If somebody saw me and said something to me, as soon as I opened my mouth there was no question I was not a Pole.</span> <span id="s649">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s650">And I couldn't pretend to be Lithuanian either because the accent was just wrong.</span> <span id="s651">So they made a deal or agreed or whatever, one night the farmer came and he said, "We're going for a walk.‚Äù</span> <span id="s652">So wonderful.</span> <span id="s653">"Come on, We're going for a walk.‚Äù</span> <span id="s654">And so we went for a walk.</span> <span id="s655">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s656">Just him and me.</span> <span id="s657">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s658">Still who knows who would see us?</span> <span id="s659">It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s660">There were rewards for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">02:12:00 The reward was salt.</span> <span id="s662">I hadn't seen that written any place.</span> <span id="s663">The reward was salt.</span> <span id="s664">I don't remember how many kilograms of salt.</span> <span id="s665">Salt was a great commodity.</span> <span id="s666">Very hard to get.</span> <span id="s667">Very precious.</span> <span id="s668">People wanted salt more than sugar.</span> <span id="s669">And if you handed in some Jews you got salt.</span> <span id="s670">People looked for the reward and there were nasty people who would do it for the reward.</span> <span id="s671">They would do it out of spite.</span> <span id="s672">While we were hiding there, there was a family hiding in the woods and one day, some so-called great patriotic partisans who were fighting for the country...Poles in this case...found them.</span> <span id="s673">They took them out.</span> <span id="s674">They shot them...saw it through the roof a little bit.</span> <span id="s675">And they came into the house.</span> <span id="s676">They asked for some to drink, and they told the farmer, "Go bury those people.‚Äù</span> <span id="s677">And they were sitting there talking in the house talking next door to the barn where we were and then they left.</span> <span id="s678">And they were Poles, Army Krajowa from London.</span> <span id="s679">There were other partisans, mostly Russians.</span> <span id="s680">One day my father was caught by them and he was sure they were going to kill him.</span> <span id="s681">And then they looked him over and they decided he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s682">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on them.</span> <span id="s683">He stumbled on their camp going through the woods.</span> <span id="s684">And then they looked him over and they decided that he's a Jew.</span> <span id="s685">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on their camp going through the woods.</span> <span id="s686">And they said to him, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s687">We're not going to hurt you.</span> <span id="s688">We're just like you.‚Äù</span> <span id="s689">In Russian "Vi tozje takoje" which means we are also like that.</span> <span id="s690">Those are the exact words they said because Father repeated it, so I'm repeating you what he said.</span> <span id="s691">And in fact they said, "Do you have any food?"</span> <span id="s692">He says "No.‚Äù</span> <span id="s693">"Come here.‚Äù</span> <span id="s694">They had shot an animal.</span> <span id="s695">Don't know where.</span> <span id="s696">Maybe...probably a farmer's animal, and they gave him a quarter of beef to take with him.</span> <span id="s697">They sent him on his way.</span> <span id="s698">Didn't hurt him.</span> <span id="s699">They were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s700">The Russian prisoners of war were treated abominantly by the Germans.</span> <span id="s701">There was a prisoner of war camp not far from Soly and obviously the Jews were all eventually, they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to Ponari near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated, but none of them survived.</span> <span id="s702">The living conditions in the ghetto were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s703">The Jews used to give them food if they could.</span> <span id="s704">They were starved to death and worked to death, those Russian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s705">And when they escaped their hatred for the Germans was something unimaginable.</span> <span id="s706">They would very glad die as long as they could take some with them.</span> <span id="s707">And many of them became very sympathetic to the Jews, especially if they came from a camp like the one I described where the Jews in the ghetto tried to help.</span> <span id="s708">So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews, the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">02:15:00 And this particular band helped my father.</span> <span id="s710">We learned later that this band was wiped out.</span> <span id="s711">They got into a fire fight with somebody, and they were all killed apparently.</span> <span id="s712">Don't know.</span> <span id="s713">But anyhow, so we lived in this little place and about once a week or so, from then on, we was determined we go for a walk for a hour or so at night always, look at the stars, talk a little bit.</span> <span id="s714">Was not a very imaginative conversation because my Polish was not that great.</span> <span id="s715">They were wonderful people because one day there was a big scare that somebody had seen us there too.</span> <span id="s716">And we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s717">So we decided...they decided...this was a tremendous chance.</span> <span id="s718">I can't understand how these people decided to do this.</span> <span id="s719">It was totally insane.</span> <span id="s720">We would just integrate with the family because if they found us in this place clearly we were strangers.</span> <span id="s721">And I remember he put me in bed with his daughter.</span> <span id="s722">And it was at night because somebody was supposed to come searching and we crawled into bed together as if we were, you know, living together because I was young enough.</span> <span id="s723">She was a little kid, but I think younger than me, so it was considered alright under those conditions because the family was very crowded.</span> <span id="s724">And the only thing I remember is the giant bed bugs.</span> <span id="s725">They were about this big.</span> <span id="s726">(Laughter) Huge red things, which we did not have in the barn.</span> <span id="s727">In that respect the barn was better.</span> <span id="s728">We had rats or mice and they were not good things to have.</span> <span id="s729">They were scary at night.</span> <span id="s730">But these bed bugs bit and they were big.</span> <span id="s731">They made hugh holes in your flesh, and, of course, there were lice and other things.</span> <span id="s732">We suffered from dysentery and lice and all kinds of intestinal parasites.</span> <span id="s733">And there was no...very, very bad sanitary conditions and the local people suffered from the same thing.</span> <span id="s734">It wasn't just us.</span> <span id="s735">It was local conditions were that way.</span> <span id="s736">So that made a big difference, the...the walks at night.</span> <span id="s737">And then eventually the Russian Army came in and we moved right with them.</span> <span id="s738">We didn't stay.</span> <span id="s739">Nobody stayed.</span> <span id="s740">Anybody who survived didn't stay.</span> <span id="s741">We ended up as refugees just moving from place to place.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Can you back up one second because we had been left with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Bed bugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Bed bugs and you were in bed with this child.</span> <span id="s745">Tell me about the German search.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s747">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s748">It was either a false alarm or whatever.</span> <span id="s749">Apparently, there was a search in surrounding farms.</span> <span id="s750">They didn't come to us, but there was a search in the surrounding areas and some Jews were actually taken.</span> <span id="s751">But in this case we had no place else to go.</span> <span id="s752">We couldn't go in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">02:18:00 We had no place to go, and they decided if there's going to be a search, we would all commingle and the German's wouldn't know who is who.</span> <span id="s754">And so we just totally became one big family...was a big family lots of people.</span> <span id="s755">They had...I don't know...seems like a thousand kids.</span> <span id="s756">I think was something like 8 or 9 children.</span> <span id="s757">Was a very poor family.</span> <span id="s758">Staunch Catholics.</span> <span id="s759">And they saved us.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: What did you do in the attic all these days?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Father educated me.</span> <span id="s762">He taught me reading, writing, mathematics...whatever he could oral.</span> <span id="s763">That's how I got my primary education.</span> <span id="s764">It wasn't a bad education because I did manage to survive high school and university here and so forth and apparently it worked, but it was a very difficult time because we couldn't speak very loudly and not all that much.</span> <span id="s765">Most of the time I either slept or looked out through the little holes in the roof.</span> <span id="s766">That's it you could not do anything else.</span> <span id="s767">You couldn't move, no exercise.</span> <span id="s768">You just sitting waiting.</span> <span id="s769">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s770">The mind turned off.</span> <span id="s771">I don't have that many memories of what I did cause I didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Think now.</span> <span id="s773">The Russians have come.</span> <span id="s774">Can you describe that?</span> <span id="s775">What do you mean when...that the Russians came.</span> <span id="s776">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: All of a sudden somebody...I don't know who, said, "It's all over.‚Äù</span> <span id="s778">That's it.</span> <span id="s779">It's all over.</span> <span id="s780">There was no fighting.</span> <span id="s781">There was no shooting again.</span> <span id="s782">Just like the first time, the Germans left and the Russians came.</span> <span id="s783">Before the Russians left, the Germans came.</span> <span id="s784">They just...the Germans ran off, and the Russians rolled right through.</span> <span id="s785">A lot of turmoil.</span> <span id="s786">Nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s787">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s788">We liberated a house.</span> <span id="s789">Gave it to one family, with all the possessions we could gave it to the other family.</span> <span id="s790">Everything we could find.</span> <span id="s791">And we left.</span> <span id="s792">It's a graveyard.</span> <span id="s793">And we just followed the Russians.</span> <span id="s794">We kept moving and they were moving more fast than we were and pretty soon we were in Germany.</span> <span id="s795">And then we just ended up in the American zone and then we were in a displaced persons camp and then it's no big deal.</span> <span id="s796">Just four years of waiting for a visa from my father's brother to the United States because we were displaced persons.</span> <span id="s797">02:21:00 And once we got to the United States we really could do something.</span> <span id="s798">Then we continued correspondence with these families and we shipped them money and packages as much as we could because we were also poor just starting with nothing.</span> <span id="s799">But to them it was a great deal.</span> <span id="s800">And then suddenly these people disappeared.</span> <span id="s801">We don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s802">I think some bad things probably happened because these people were very individualistic and did not take too well to authority so I don't know what happened, especially the...the so-called rich farmer.</span> <span id="s803">I don't know if they did something to them.</span> <span id="s804">This is still during the late...late days of Stalin, and some crazy things happened during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Both families just disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: All of a sudden they...within one year they both disappeared.</span> <span id="s807">They didn't answer any of the letters or anything.</span> <span id="s808">Couldn't track them down in any way.</span> <span id="s809">So I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s810">But anyway that's the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Tell me if you would again.</span> <span id="s812">You were a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Can you describe the DP camps.</span> <span id="s815">You were very young and</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: What it was like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: The DP camp was a carefree time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: By the way, which DP camp?</span> <span id="s820">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: First we were in Berlin, and then we moved out of Berlin on the airlift in 1948 so that was my first airplane ride in a military transport.</span> <span id="s822">And then we ended up in, I think it was Bavaria.</span> <span id="s823">Yes...in a camp called Gaubersee ?</span> <span id="s824">in a location.</span> <span id="s825">There were several camps.</span> <span id="s826">There were schools.</span> <span id="s827">There were decent schools.</span> <span id="s828">I think the schools were good so it was the same as any other child.</span> <span id="s829">You had an apartment, and you lived there.</span> <span id="s830">My parents did some minor work.</span> <span id="s831">The thing was boredom for the parents because you really were not permitted to have real work.</span> <span id="s832">Some amount to just survive.</span> <span id="s833">Filling out millions of papers.</span> <span id="s834">Great introduction to bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s835">But for the kids it was quite good because there was a great deal of freedom from.pressures from outside.</span> <span id="s836">There were schooling.</span> <span id="s837">A great deal of education.</span> <span id="s838">The teachers were enormously dedicated because this was the first chance to maybe raise a survived generation so there was a lot of dedication and input more so than a normal situation might call for.</span> <span id="s839">Children were precious so you could get away with all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s840">And it was not a bad time from a child's point of view.</span> <span id="s841">Of course, it was not the greatest from other aspects in terms of a settled life and knowing what's going to happen to you and having a place that's your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">02:24:05 It really wasn't our own.</span> <span id="s843">We were not citizens.</span> <span id="s844">We weren't going to live there.</span> <span id="s845">We weren't going to settle in Germany.</span> <span id="s846">It was just a transient camp and you couldn't call it home, but in terms of living conditions and friends and so forth I feel it was nice.</span> <span id="s847">The adults were very nice to the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: How did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s849">What were the circumstances?</span> <span id="s850">How did you manage to actually come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, eventually a visa came because, as I say, my father had a brother here and he vouched for us.</span> <span id="s852">He signed us up so we came under the displacedpersons act.</span> <span id="s853">I think it was the second one President Truman signed.</span> <span id="s854">I am not sure which one, but we did not come as pure refuges in that sense.</span> <span id="s855">We came as sponsored refugees because there was a relative who sponsored us, who vouched we would not become wards of the state and so and so forth so there was a quota...the displaced persons quota permitted us to come sooner maybe than 50 years later.</span> <span id="s856">I don't know how long the quota would have lasted, but we came as part of a normal quota of sponsored people.</span> <span id="s857">Alright.</span> <span id="s858">And so we went on a ship.</span> <span id="s859">First big ship.</span> <span id="s860">First airplane, then first ship.</span> <span id="s861">Terribly seasick.</span> <span id="s862">I still get seasick.</span> <span id="s863">Airplanes are fine.</span> <span id="s864">Ships are not good for me.</span> <span id="s865">We came United States, (Chuckle) and that in itself is an interesting story because I did not speak any English.</span> <span id="s866">And I was old enough to go to high school.</span> <span id="s867">Well, there're no tricks.</span> <span id="s868">No "Kunsten" as we say in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s869">You supposed to go to school, you go to school.</span> <span id="s870">So we signed up and I went to high school.</span> <span id="s871">Don't speak English.</span> <span id="s872">Well, that's no matter.</span> <span id="s873">And you know what I did.</span> <span id="s874">Maybe with an accent, but I think I speak a reasonable English.</span> <span id="s875">So I came here and I went to high school and that's it.</span> <span id="s876">And as far as I'm concerned, I'm an American because that's where my real primary education came from...my real education...the only real schooling that I have had.</span> <span id="s877">Other schooling was all in bits and pieces and in very peculiar circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Can you tell me about that first year for you.</span> <span id="s879">It must have been.</span> <span id="s880">.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: In high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Not easy.</span> <span id="s883">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Well, it was not easy, but I'll tell you I was very naive.</span> <span id="s885">Of course, I was not used to any big cities or towns or anything of that nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: What city?</span> <span id="s887">Where are we?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: This is in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s889">We're in Brooklyn, New York.</span> <span id="s890">Nice place.</span> <span id="s891">We're in Brooklyn, New York, in New Utrecht high school if you wish to know the exact place.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">02:27:00 And the people were nice.</span> <span id="s893">The teachers were understanding.</span> <span id="s894">At least I thought so.</span> <span id="s895">If I wanted to be cynical I would say they were uncaring because they didn't care what happened to me and they let me do whatever I did and they passed me maybe when they shouldn't have.</span> <span id="s896">They just passed me along.</span> <span id="s897">All I can say, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s898">They understood my circumstances or they didn't make it hard for me.</span> <span id="s899">I don't know which.</span> <span id="s900">I had a better background in certain areas than the kids that came there.</span> <span id="s901">Mathematics, history, other areas, the home education, and the education in the camps was very, very good.</span> <span id="s902">Was a very high level education.</span> <span id="s903">I had only one problem.</span> <span id="s904">I couldn't speak English.</span> <span id="s905">So I had terrible trouble in English, English language and other areas that require good facilitive language.</span> <span id="s906">History, English history, social studies where you have to understand what the teacher says.</span> <span id="s907">The other disciplines were no big deal.</span> <span id="s908">Mathematics is mathematics.</span> <span id="s909">Two plus two is four.</span> <span id="s910">The symbols are symbols, and I knew all that.</span> <span id="s911">I was ahead of my class.</span> <span id="s912">In the other areas I did not do well to start with, but I think the teachers really were understanding rather than careless.</span> <span id="s913">They gave me barely passing grades at first, and that was because my content was good, but the execution was terrible.</span> <span id="s914">And it's amazing how well you can learn a language if you live among the people and you speak it and you interact.</span> <span id="s915">I am not a great linguist.</span> <span id="s916">My brother is the linguist.</span> <span id="s917">He speaks a half a dozen languages quite well.</span> <span id="s918">I know other languages, but only because I lived and...and used them, but in terms of learning languages directly from books, it's very hard for me.</span> <span id="s919">But it's not that difficult.</span> <span id="s920">By the time I was a junior I was a pretty decent student.</span> <span id="s921">And so I made friends, peculiar friends who were willing to be friends with this strange kid like me.</span> <span id="s922">But as you interact and you learn the language, fine.</span> <span id="s923">The big problem was I had to learn some new tricks.</span> <span id="s924">My lunch money was taken away from me and a few other little things.</span> <span id="s925">Nothing personal.</span> <span id="s926">It was normal.</span> <span id="s927">That's how it works.</span> <span id="s928">Then I learned how to protect myself.</span> <span id="s929">But initially, I think a lot of the special ed classesand so forth, today may be doing it all wrong, from my own experience...and there's too much recognition of the differences.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">02:30:00 I think what's needed is to mainstream the kid to have normal intelligence and to be patient with their difficulties.</span> <span id="s931">Give them a chance.</span> <span id="s932">But let them learn in whatever magical way people absorb knowledge just like little children do unless they're old...too old to do that, but I found at 14 it still worked.</span> <span id="s933">Probably wouldn't work if I was 24 something.</span> <span id="s934">So I was just mainstreamed, left to my own devices, and just by interaction I learned that l-i-o-n is lion and Lyon (is a city) and after a few corrections you remember and that's all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s937">Something that has nothing to do with my own experiences but there is very little talk of German re-unification right now.</span> <span id="s938">And I don't think I have a unique perspective but I will tell you something that bothered me greatly.</span> <span id="s939">And it is not that unification is coming, because it has to come.</span> <span id="s940">I would prefer that it be 20 years from now.</span> <span id="s941">The generation that did these things is not around any more, and I have nothing against the new generation.</span> <span id="s942">I don't believe in collective guilt or anything like that.</span> <span id="s943">It bothers me greatly that the loss of memory.</span> <span id="s944">That's why I am so happy to be here.</span> <span id="s945">I was watching a news cast two months ago, 6 weeks ago.</span> <span id="s946">There was this huge rally.</span> <span id="s947">Chancellor Kohl was giving a rally.</span> <span id="s948">Okay.</span> <span id="s949">Lots of signs.</span> <span id="s950">"Ein Deutschland, ein Volk", various things like that.</span> <span id="s951">Legitimate.</span> <span id="s952">And people were saying how horrible it was.</span> <span id="s953">That they couldn't be unified and so forth.</span> <span id="s954">It happened the same day our local newspaper had pictures of the same rally.</span> <span id="s955">And the same day I was reading Newsweek.</span> <span id="s956">It had pictures of the same exact rally.</span> <span id="s957">Very strange coincidence.</span> <span id="s958">And everything was fine.</span> <span id="s959">I was a little upset about this big rally because I am worried about reunification.</span> <span id="s960">That's immaterial.</span> <span id="s961">Then I saw the name of where this rally is held, and I was sick.</span> <span id="s962">And the thing that I still think about is that I have not heard a single commentary or mention of it any place.</span> <span id="s963">The rally was held in Erfurt.</span> <span id="s964">Now people should know that Toppensohn who built the crematorium of Auschwitz was from Erfurt and if you don't know the history actually, that Toppensohn had the same problem that all contractors have with Government, that it didn't work right in the first place.</span> <span id="s965">And they protect themselves.</span> <span id="s966">You know it's only a science.</span> <span id="s967">You don't understand it.</span> <span id="s968">You know the mechanics of hugh piles of human flesh and the convection currents.</span> <span id="s969">You don't understand.</span> <span id="s970">But you know you run some experiments and we promise you, we will fix it, and production will be pretty close to 10,000 a day,</span></p> <p><span id="s971">02:33:00 and you know great German engineering, they fixed it.</span> <span id="s972">And when the Hungarians were brought in, and they had this big emergency.</span> <span id="s973">They were able to run production at 20,000 a day.</span> <span id="s974">Why is it that nobody would say, you know we are having this great rally in Erfurt, and we will reunify because things are different now.</span> <span id="s975">And we know that we will not permit another Toppensohn to come into this world.</span> <span id="s976">That would be a great rally.</span> <span id="s977">.</span> <span id="s978">Not a single commentary that I have seen in all the news media mentioned the existence of Toppenson but the revisionist historians say those were chimneys they were baking bread.</span> <span id="s979">That bothers me greatly.</span> <span id="s980">It really upsets me.</span> <span id="s981">So even though I was not in Auschwitz and I cannot have any recollection of it, when I saw those pictures all of a sudden all the banners and everything changed and it wasn't people, it was just chimneys and stuff.</span> <span id="s982">Because it was Erfurt.</span> <span id="s983">And I have no idea if Toppensohn or his son or his son's son are around any more.</span> <span id="s984">I really don't care.</span> <span id="s985">That has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s986">But there is a saying about knowing some relationships and somehow, those have disappeared.</span> <span id="s987">I don't understand why.</span> <span id="s988">Surely people want a little bit more history than that.</span> <span id="s989">I am not a great historians.</span> <span id="s990">I know that Erfurt is Toppensohn, that is my comment.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Thank you for having me.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span
