id="s426">A: The war was over.</span> <span id="s427">You know, needless to tell you the details if you've heard</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: No, we don't need to.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: of that</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: because they used to artillery barrages into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: The ghetto into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s434">There was no ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: No, not by that stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Ghetto was formed in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s438">And your family didn't have to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Did you have to accept other people into the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: How many people moved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: My uncle, Moshe, with his wife and two let's see.</span> <span id="s443">One and they had two children.</span> <span id="s444">Siskind (ph) and, oh, God, Sarelou (ph).</span> <span id="s445">Little babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: And then there was another family.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: So two families moved in.</span> <span id="s450">We had we had enough room, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s452">And because of your father's success</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: in in business and that sort of stuff, were you able to live okay in those first years?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Well, we were able to do at first, but then they see, the Germans had squeezed the rations.</span> <span id="s456">It started look, they had a plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Hmm, hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: They followed their program.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: So it didn't nothing happened immediately</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: at one clip.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: It was slow, lulled in.</span> <span id="s465">And now everybody with any brains, who didn't have any money, who didn't have any who wasn't doing well escaped over to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s466">The, what do you call it, border between occupied Poland and Russia was only about 40, 50 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: So they managed to go north to Bialystok or to we heard stories that the people were filth, dirty, they have no food, they have excuse me.</span> <span id="s469">So my father wouldn't hear of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: He's going to let his kids...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: But your</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Anyway</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: But your brothers escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: My brothers, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: My brothers were still with us.</span> <span id="s478">Everything was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: As soon as we began hearing and things got much worse, you know, as far as food was concerned, as far as money was concerned, my father could not conduct any business slowly, that in November of 1940, we will have a ghetto formed in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s481">And we were lucky to have the what do you call it, our building in the ghetto, right inside in the corner of the ghetto, which was right next to the gate where the bridge was from one small ghetto to the large ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: We were in the small one.</span> <span id="s484">So my brother went to Otvosk.</span> <span id="s485">That's where my family is from, my father's side of the family.</span> <span id="s486">Otvosk was down in, I'd say about 30 kilometers, 40 kilometers.</span> <span id="s487">That was the area where people used to go for the summer, I mean, the ones who could afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Yes, like a __.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Like a line.</span> <span id="s490">Right, right.</span> <span id="s491">The whole Wisnia clan lived in that area.</span> <span id="s492">So my father's brother.</span> <span id="s493">And that's where my brother went to because it made it easier, because in the suburbs it was much easier to get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: In our Warsaw, you had to live by the rations they gave you.</span> <span id="s496">So when they closed the ghetto, it was first staffed by gendarmerie, German gendarmes, not SS.</span> <span id="s497">You see, they had</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Locals.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They were planned.</span> <span id="s500">It was planned.</span> <span id="s501">Gendarmes, German gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s502">German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No SS.</span> <span id="s505">Everything was fine.</span> <span id="s506">I was still going to school on occasion.</span> <span id="s507">I don't remember if it was every day.</span> <span id="s508">To Dluga we could walk.</span> <span id="s509">Trolley cars with stars of David on it.</span> <span id="s510">So everything was still fine until they attacked Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: June or July 22nd or something like that</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: All hell broke loose after that.</span> <span id="s519">We know we saw there was something wrong because the army that was guarding the ghetto changed completely.</span> <span id="s520">SS took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s522">Because the rest of the army, the normal army would have been sent to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Tell me, before we get into the</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: the details of that particular period, do you remember any cultural activity that you experienced in the ghetto</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: In the ghetto itself, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: between '39 and '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s530">As a matter of fact, I sang on the radio.</span> <span id="s531">I sang on Polish radio.</span> <span id="s532">I don't remember anymore what.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Was that during the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Actually, it was I must have my dates</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: That must have been before.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah, must before, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: But tell me, did you go to any theater?</span> <span id="s540">Because there was a thriving Yiddish theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: There was a Yiddish theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And there was a Polish theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: There was a yes, we we did un infrequently.</span> <span id="s544">You see, they squeezed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: So it was a question of there were many people who had enough food, and majority of people did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: So it started I don't remember really details, but all I know, it was not a good situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: We saw it was wrong.</span> <span id="s551">[cough]</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Gesundheit.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: But the whole situation changed</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: as soon as they attacked</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: My father used to go out, as a matter of fact used to go out to the airport.</span> <span id="s560">He knew carpentry because that was part of his</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: His trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: What do you call it?</span> <span id="s563">Trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: So he went to the airport and he befriended one of the the airport that was bombed the first day.</span> <span id="s566">And there was the Luftwaffe sergeant over there who befriended him.</span> <span id="s567">And he used to bring home all kinds of goodies because he used to do some work for him over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s570">So everything was still fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: And each I think day or two days or three days a week, they used to have like a truck that used to come to the komena, komenda,</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: okay, on Grzybowska, which was only about three blocks away from us.</span> <span id="s575">And they used to go by bus by bus by truck over to the airport.</span> <span id="s576">They used to bring him back.</span> <span id="s577">Okay.</span> <span id="s578">One beautiful day, I don't remember exactly when, I guess it must have been August or September of 1941.</span> <span id="s579">My father did not feel exactly the greatest one morning, and he said why don't I go to the airport.</span> <span id="s580">Same Wisnia.</span> <span id="s581">By the way, because of that, I get paid from</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: From the Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: the German government,</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: for being</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: would you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: They had the record.</span> <span id="s588">They have names.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: It's absolutely unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s592">So you went to the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: I went to the airport to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: When I came back</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Everyone was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Let alone was everyone, I couldn't get into the house, the whole block.</span> <span id="s598">There's no record of this anywhere.</span> <span id="s599">They tried from what I found out from the people when I finally got the word to our section, it's called (falitsuv?)</span> <span id="s600">Krochmalma.</span> <span id="s601">Okay.</span> <span id="s602">Our building, 43, I couldn't get over to the building.</span> <span id="s603">Why?</span> <span id="s604">Because I heard there was was all blocked off by, what do you call it, Polish police, Yiddi Jewish police, SS on the outskirt, because they tried what they call resettlement.</span> <span id="s605">So used to drive in with a truck, give a square block or a building or two buildings do you follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: a certain number of minutes to pick up their belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: And get out.</span> <span id="s610">They were going to take them this was the</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Like a (schpira?)</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: talk this was the talk of resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s614">And I assume that your family all went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s615">Or was it Treblinka</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: They weren't going.</span> <span id="s617">They weren't going anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yeah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: They just tried to find out how long it was going to take.</span> <span id="s620">Because they didn't take anybody.</span> <span id="s621">That must have been a trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: But my father, if I remember if I know if I remember my father, he was a wise guy.</span> <span id="s624">He probably wouldn't listen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: You follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I found my father, my mother this is tough.</span> <span

It's okay.</span> <span id="s634">That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Ahhh.</span> <span id="s636">I finally made it into the building.</span> <span id="s637">And on the outside, there was a group of corpses.</span> <span id="s638">I found my my mother __.</span> <span id="s639">I didn't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">I'll be all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I didn't think it would still do it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And I ran.</span> <span id="s645">I didn't know what to do, I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s646">I remembered across the street from our house, there used to live on 44 Krochmalna two Polish girls.</span> <span id="s647">It wasn't a Jewish area.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s649">What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Only I know the first.</span> <span id="s651">I wish I knew their last name.</span> <span id="s652">I've been searching for them for 60 years and was never able to find them.</span> <span id="s653">Vonda (ph) and Yadja (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s654">There were two young girls on the first floor.</span> <span id="s655">We were very friendly.</span> <span id="s656">Used to play, used to anyway, I tried desperately to remember where I knew that Vonda they had to move out, you know, when the ghetto was formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yes, of course, because.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I knew they moved to Praga</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: which was a suburb of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s662">Non Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: And the other side not of course.</span> <span id="s664">Of course.</span> <span id="s665">Non Jewish.</span> <span id="s666">And I made it.</span> <span id="s667">I took a trolley car.</span> <span id="s668">Nothing.</span> <span id="s669">I didn't know really what the hell I was doing, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: So I got out of here.</span> <span id="s672">I had to get away from here.</span> <span id="s673">So I figured maybe they want to kill the whole area or whatever was going to happen, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s674">So I made it to the place, to Praga where she was.</span> <span id="s675">I knew that Vonda, the older one she was about two years older I guess than I was working as a waitress in a restaurant in Praga.</span> <span id="s676">I knew that from before; how, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s677">I went there, she was working.</span> <span id="s678">She saw me through the window.</span> <span id="s679">She motioned to me to wait in the little garden there.</span> <span id="s680">She finally came out.</span> <span id="s681">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s682">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s683">I told her my family is no longer.</span> <span id="s684">I says, I have to get out of here.</span> <span id="s685">She says, Where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s686">I says, I want to go to Sochaczew.</span> <span id="s687">I didn't even think fast.</span> <span id="s688">There were no Jews in Sochaczew.</span> <span id="s689">Why the hell was I going to go to Sochaczew?</span> <span id="s690">I figured I had to get away from here.</span> <span id="s691">So she at the end of it took me to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Bought my ticket to Sochaczew.</span> <span id="s694">Put me on the train.</span> <span id="s695">And I went to Sochaczew.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Okay.</span> <span id="s697">I came to Sochaczew.</span> <span id="s698">We had a big three story actually threeandahalf story apartment house in Sochaczew that my grandfather and father together as partners built.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I didn't know there was curfew.</span> <span id="s701">Was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s702">It was about 11 o'clock at night that I got to the station in Sochaczew.</span> <span id="s703">I walked from the station to Staszica, which was the street where our building was.</span> <span id="s704">And as I approached, somewhere I guess how could I think straight, anyway, at that point.</span> <span id="s705">I see the facade of the building is still there at 17 Staszica Street.</span> <span id="s706">But the whole inside is burned out.</span> <span id="s707">The Germans burned out all the Jewish buildings.</span> <span id="s708">Only the skeleton remained.</span> <span id="s709">You know what I'm talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I reached closer, there's no nobody there.</span> <span id="s712">I started knocking on doors.</span> <span id="s713">I knew all the Christians there.</span> <span id="s714">Remember, I grew up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s716">You you you were</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: And we were very, very friendly and everybody knew my grandfather</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And you were a personality</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: musically.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: but the Christians even knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: So I started with the you know what a mangel (ph) is?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: I knocked on the door of Schmiguelska (ph).</span> <span id="s728">I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s729">She says, Davidek, she says.</span> <span id="s730">Little David.</span> <span id="s731">She says, Get out of there.</span> <span id="s732">There are some Germans over here.</span> <span id="s733">I can't do anything for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">I sat there, I want to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s735">Anyway, I started moving around to some people until finally somebody took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: And this</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: A person by the name of Prusky.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: P R U S K Y or I. I used to play football with the kids.</span> <span id="s740">She took me in, the mother, and gave me some food.</span> <span id="s741">And what happened, I told her the story.</span> <span id="s742">She says, David, you can't stay here because in this building there are some Germans and they're going to denounce you, they're going to kill you and kill me too.</span> <span id="s743">So but, she says, you know who lives around the corner from here, she says, and she told me how to go.</span> <span id="s744">There's a fellow by the name of Milesky, Vladik (ph).</span> <span id="s745">He knows you since you were a kid.</span> <span id="s746">He used to work for your grandfather.</span> <span id="s747">I found Vladik.</span> <span id="s748">And I'll never forget that man.</span> <span id="s749">If you talk about a righteous gentile.</span> <span id="s750">When he found he cried his heart out when he found, he says he says he walked out of his wooden bed that he had.</span> <span id="s751">He says, You sleep here.</span> <span id="s752">I'll sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s753">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s754">In the morning, he says, I'm gonna take you across the bridge.</span> <span id="s755">The Bzura River is there, right there in Sochaczew .</span> <span id="s756">B Z U R A. Take you across the bridge.</span> <span id="s757">It's guarded by gendarmes, Germans.</span> <span id="s758">He says, But you'll go with me, a big hat, you know, like the what do you call it ?</span> <span id="s759">The poy the poylish, you know.</span> <span id="s760">He says nobody and besides, I was blond anyway, so...He says, I'll take you across the border.</span> <span id="s761">He says, It's about five miles from here.</span> <span id="s762">I'll take you you have a cousin living in the ghetto in Czerwinsk.</span> <span id="s763">That's how I got to Czerwinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: He led me across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I'll never forget when I saw the first I'm trying to remember, was Friday night.</span> <span id="s768">I saw candles in the window and I walked over, knocked on the first door when I got into Wyszogrod, which is the town before right after the border.</span> <span id="s769">He went back to Sochaczew, and I he told me to go to Czerwinsk.</span> <span id="s770">He said it's only about a kilometer or two from here.</span> <span id="s771">And you have a cousin over there.</span> <span id="s772">You'll be able to stay in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s773">It's okay.</span> <span id="s774">Because I didn't know.</span> <span id="s775">It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">I came to the first house and I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s777">And when I opened up the door, I saw the picture of Jesus in the __ and I said, Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s778">I didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s779">You know, you're supposed to say certain things when you walk into somebody's house in Poland, particularly (fabrenta?)</span> <span id="s780">Catholics, really.</span> <span id="s781">And I I don't know how I excused myself.</span> <span id="s782">I says, I need to go my Polish is fluent, of course.</span> <span id="s783">Big deal .</span> <span id="s784">It's my language.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: So I go to, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s787">I want to go to Czerwinsk.</span> <span id="s788">She must have realized that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s789">So she told me how to go and I went to Czerwinsk.</span> <span id="s790">The only problem to cut this story short, the problem when I got to Czerwinsk, I didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s791">And in a ghetto particularly, this was</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: No rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Germany.</span> <span id="s794">No rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Most people you tell it to, they don't know what you're talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s798">You got no papers, you got no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I couldn't eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Couldn't eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: So they had to report me to the police.</span> <span id="s804">They reported me to the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I stayed with them for a number of weeks, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s807">I started singing over there.</span> <span id="s808">You know, singing saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: What did you sing, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen.</span> <span id="s811">You know that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s813">So you were like basking in the street.</span> <span id="s814">Is that what you were doing?</span> <span id="s815">I mean, you were singing?</span> <span id="s816">Or were you just singing for the for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: I was singing for the families.</span>

is the singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s823">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up, you know that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Oy, Yossel, Yossel, won't you</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Yossel.</span> <span id="s828">Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I knew it</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: in English.</span> <span id="s832">You name it.</span> <span id="s833">And then I learned a German song.</span> <span id="s834">I learned what was it?</span> <span id="s835">[speaking German]</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: [Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: I got news for you.</span> <span id="s838">That saved my life in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: We'll come to that after we've had lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: [Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So we're going to break now because we've got to go to another appointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: You gotta so anyway, I was in what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: In Czerwinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: In Czerwinsk for a little bit until they liquidated the ghetto in Czerwinsk and moved everybody into Nowy Dvor.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Yes, on the other side of the river, Mazowiecki.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s848">Okay.</span> <span id="s849">So we were</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: From Nowy Dvor, I was one of the last transports from Nowy Dvor to go to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: My cousin with her two children probably went to either Chelmno or something around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: She want she wanted me to go with her and, I don't know, something told me not to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: That's amazing.</span> <span id="s858">Okay.</span> <span id="s859">We're going to pause</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: here.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Come.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Where did we leave off?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Cantor David Wisnia.</span> <span id="s867">Is it Wisnia or Wisnia?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Wisnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Wisnia.</span> <span id="s870">What was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Wisnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: -- when it was in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: In Polish, Wisnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q:

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Which means cherry, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Cherry tree, because my -- I understand some of my ancestors on my father's side had cherry trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Ah, and that's why.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: And that's -- that's where they got their name, Wisnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: So Nowy Dwor, this is where we finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s886">We got to Nowy Dwor.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: We got to Nowy Dwor, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: And Nowy Dwor was strictly a resettlement operation where each week we didn't stay very long in Nowy Dwor.</span> <span id="s889">After about two or three different transports that they gathered from the whole area, and that was Germany, remember.</span> <span id="s890">That was – that was Germany that annexed that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: They started sending the people, you know, on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: As a matter of fact my cousin, Figulea (ph), with her two children, first -- on the first transport, went her father, who was sort of elderly -- elderly, must have been what, 60 or 70, and at that -- when you're 10 or 15 --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: That's elderly --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: -- or 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: -- that's elderly.</span> <span id="s899">Then Figulea (ph) went.</span> <span id="s900">She wanted me, I was almost tempted to go with her, because she needed somebody to take her.</span> <span id="s901">Her husband had died quite awhile back.</span> <span id="s902">So I was sort of like the protector, and I don't know, for whatever reason, my friend, who lives in Israel now in Haifa, who was with me, whose number is two numbers higher than mine -- mine is 83526; his is 83528 -- came on the same transport.</span> <span id="s903">I knew him from Warsaw, Zlotnick, Zolog (ph) Zlotnick, Israel, living now in Haifa, still living in Haifa, and he said, don't -- don't go.</span> <span id="s904">You stay for the last transport.</span> <span id="s905">You'll go with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">That was my buddy.</span> <span id="s907">So I let her go by herself.</span> <span id="s908">They went to -- I found out later, they went to Heiligenbeil.</span> <span id="s909">They never even had a chance --</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: -- of survival.</span> <span id="s912">Forget it.</span> <span id="s913">I was on the last transport from Nowy Dwor.</span> <span id="s914">Yeah, what I wanted to mention, they went on a passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Which was extremely unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Those were cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Who would have thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: They were going on passenger trains.</span> <span id="s921">They were being resettled to the east.</span> <span id="s922">That was the story of the Germans and we bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Yep, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s925">Look, when you're gradually deprived of your rights, of your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: You forget, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: -- you forget.</span> <span id="s928">You don't think in those terms.</span> <span id="s929">This is the most educated, most erudite people you can think of in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s931">Why would they be doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: They're going to kill little children?</span> <span id="s933">They're going to kill women?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: All the people?</span> <span id="s936">Anyway, last transport, we arrive in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s937">We had no idea after about two or three days --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Where you --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: -- traveling on sealed wagons, you know, the -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Box cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s943">Tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Cattle --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Tell me – what – what – this -- this is '41 -- no, '42, early '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: ’42 --no, that was not early '42.</span> <span id="s949">That was September of '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: September of '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: August, September or October '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s953">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: I don't know where we stopped, we -- no food, no water, no -- horror, 50 or 100 people in there.</span> <span id="s957">Well, you've – you’ve known.</span> <span id="s958">You've seen the --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Yeah, yes, yeah, packed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: All right.</span> <span id="s961">We finally -- we tried to get up there and see, look where we were.</span> <span id="s962">We knew we were going on the side lines of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s963">We knew we were going somewhere to the east from Nowy Dwor, but we certainly didn't know that we were going south.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: When we were -- I think somebody yelled out he saw some kind of an eradam (?</span> <span id="s968">indecipherable?)</span> <span id="s969">I think they saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Which meant going south, but who the heck knew.</span> <span id="s972">We didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: We arrive in Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s975">On the siding of the train there when we arrive, you know, the old rush job, you know, where the SS, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: The dogs --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: -- beating you, get over here with the dogs with the guy with -- where I thought it was Mengele.</span> <span id="s978">It wasn't Mengele yet.</span> <span id="s979">Mengele hadn't been there yet.</span> <span id="s980">I found that out after.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: But it was a guy who looked like, you know -- I says I will never forget the boots for heaven's sake.</span> <span id="s983">I heard somebody say in German -- and I understand German.</span> <span id="s984">I learned German, (?</span> <span id="s985">a lieb en achsen sin lager.</span> <span id="s986">?)</span> <span id="s987">I didn't understand what the hell that meant.</span> <span id="s988">And they start separating the men.</span> <span id="s989">There were still lots of women and lots of children.</span> <span id="s990">There must have been about 1,500 people.</span> <span id="s991">That was the last transport from Nowy Dwor.</span> <span id="s992">Men get over to the right.</span> <span id="s993">Yeah, the women over to the left going on trucks.</span> <span id="s994">Women, children, young kids.</span> <span id="s995">I almost went over to them.</span> <span id="s996">You know, I figured well, what the hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: But I learned my lesson in don't expect any good things from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1001">So if you can walk, fine, and particularly, I moved myself over to the side of the men, lined up in fives, and this guy, about three rows of fives, an SS man leads us in.</span> <span id="s1002">They go away immediately, the men -- not the full, whatever went in.</span> <span id="s1003">I found out of course from my book, out of the 1,500 who came in, 570, which was a high number, because there were mostly men, you follow me, younger --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Younger feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: That was the last transport, on their feet, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: -- went into the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: And that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: -- selected there and the rest of them went on trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Now, we don't know from nothing.</span> <span id="s1012">As a matter of fact, what's his name, Zlotnick (ph), my buddy, his sister was about two years older than him, a gorgeous tall girl, although, they didn't take any women from that transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1015">They ride off into a little forest over there.</span> <span id="s1016">That was a little white house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Some of the guys who came in with their wives, with their families, you know, wanted to find out after we got in, where are the women?</span> <span id="s1018">Where are the children?</span> <span id="s1019">So the prisoners started to laugh at them.</span> <span id="s1020">So you see that big fire out there, outside of the perimeter of the camp?</span> <span id="s1021">They're dead.</span> <span id="s1022">There's the machine gun them to the best of my knowledge, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: And then burn them in pyres of wood with whatever they did, and I think after about two or three months, the crematoriums were finished.</span> <span id="s1025">We were building -- we were helping to build the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Yep.</span> <span id="s1027">So were you processed in – in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: I was processed in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Yep</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: We went into a -- we were tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Tattooed, head shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Tattooed, everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: And all the hair shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: All the hair shaved --</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: And we went into the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Deloused --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: For regular – regular -- we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1044">No.</span> <span id="s1045">There was no gas at that stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No, we received – no, there was no gas yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: We received the -- what do you call it, clothing, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Whatever you could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: You were a big guy, you get short clothes.</span> <span id="s1051">You're a short guy, you get big -- like in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Big shoes, small shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: So with wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s1056">That was the worst, those heavy wooden -- I don't know if you've ever seen them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Yeah, I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: They call them the Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: No socks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: In winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Oh, used to rub on here, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s1063">You could hear – you could hear you coming from ten miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: You know, clank.</span> <span id="s1066">So anyway, we're assigned to cell block 15, must have been about 450.</span> <span id="s1067">The rest of them I think went to a different -- I don't know where -- or maybe the whole 570, I don't know, went into that particular -- in cell block the altestewayouzef (ph) This was the Polish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: The Polish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: He gave us a talk when we got in there and each one got -- we got four men sleeping in one of those, either four or five.</span> <span id="s1070">I don't know, some of them were five.</span> <span id="s1071">I always managed to get one on top --</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: -- immediately.</span> <span id="s1074">Sure.</span> <span id="s1075">I wanted to be on top.</span> <span id="s1076">So and I was only, I would say about two or three days, I was like every other prisoner, because I was assigned to the job of cleaning, you know, picking up the bodies from the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1078">These are people who had committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Committed suicide, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: By electrocuting themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yes --well, what they did know -- let's say this is the perimeter of the camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Yep, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip wire, a ditch, electrified by a wired fence, sentry box.</span> <span id="s1084">So not that they needed an excuse.</span> <span id="s1085">Anybody wanted to commit suicide, very easy.</span> <span id="s1086">You put your foot over that trip wire, which means you're trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1087">The guy would shoot you from the sentry box.</span> <span id="s1088">Many of them, that's what the German transport did, about two months later, when they found out what was going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: So that was my job for the first couple of years [sic], to put the bodies together on two, three guys, you know, heap on a wagon, a wooden wagon, bring it over to a particular cell block, line up and then it went to the crematorium where, crematorium – not the crematorium, the pyre of woods where they did them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: The pyre, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I only did this for about I think eight or nine days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Maybe two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Not even that.</span> <span id="s1097">One night after coming from work in the afternoon, the blockalteste: Is there anyone here who sings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">(?</span> <span id="s1099">Indeciperhable?)</span> <span id="s1100">Sing.</span> <span id="s1101">You sing.</span> <span id="s1102">Everybody, hey, Wisnia, get down.</span> <span id="s1103">Sing.</span> <span id="s1104">I get down from my booksa (ph).</span> <span id="s1105">There was a place about the size of this, the middle of the regular tiers of beds, of those wooden booksas (ph), and that was right there.</span> <span id="s1106">There was a door to a special room for the blockalteste, who was -- he was the boss of life and death really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: And I sang.</span> <span id="s1109">From that moment on, my life changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: What did you sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Buy me a (?</span> <span id="s1112">undeciperhable?)</span> <span id="s1113">.</span> <span id="s1114">Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Hebrew, what did I do?</span> <span id="s1117">He couldn't care less, as long --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Didn't matter what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Didn't matter what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: As long as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I sang.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: -- you entertained him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I sang.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Anything in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1126">(?</span> <span id="s1127">undeipherable?)</span> <span id="s1128">Oh , he loved that.</span> <span id="s1129">That was very popular.</span> <span id="s1130">I knew every song.</span> <span id="s1131">This was my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: So from that moment on, he says, okay, tomorrow you're not going to that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">You're going to stay right here in the -- it was like a revelation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: And you were the stubendienst?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: I became a stubendienst.</span> <span id="s1137">Actually, I couldn't become a stubendienst because the stubendienst had some pull from somebody.</span> <span id="s1138">So I became the assistant to the stubendienst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">You talk about -- what do you call it, protect ya.</span> <span id="s1140">Oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Then they came to select people for the various commandos, you follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: I don't remember how often I went out to work.</span> <span id="s1145">I didn't go out to work very often, but the greatest privilege was when it came to the roll calls, because remember, it was cold as hell all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: And that went for hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Hours.</span> <span id="s1148">People used to die standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: So.</span> <span id="s1151">And they count -- they didn't now how to count.</span> <span id="s1152">They didn't have a system.</span> <span id="s1153">If you read -- what's a her name, Tippy's book, you'll see.</span> <span id="s1154">She's got it tagged right.</span> <span id="s1155">They had no system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: They needed the prisoners to help them with the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: That's why they have a stubendienst, a kapo, a blockalteste, you follow, and if were you in with these --</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: You were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: You were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: And my job, and I really -- believe me, if I ever prayed always one more day, let me, I've got to -- but I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1164">You know, somebody just asked is me, to what do I attribute my survival at one of my speeches.</span> <span id="s1165">It took me a long time to figure it out, but I knew the first day when I got undressed in front of the sauna before we went in for the shower, I was standing in front of an SS man who was about 6'6.</span> <span id="s1166">My eyes fixed in to his belt buckle.</span> <span id="s1167">You can imagine how tall he was.</span> <span id="s1168">To me it looked that tall, right?</span> <span id="s1169">This is in front of the sauna.</span> <span id="s1170">I'll never forget this as long as I live, and I look in, and what does it say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this -- I don't know if you ever heard that, Gott mit uns.</span> <span id="s1171">Okay.</span> <span id="s1172">God is with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Is with us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Swastika here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: -- in the middle and then SS insignia on the side.</span> <span id="s1177">I swear I looked in there, and for a second I had to hold myself back from laughing.</span> <span id="s1178">I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't say that.</span> <span id="s1179">I said not the God I learned about.</span> <span id="s1180">I'm going to do everything in my life to outlive you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Yep, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: I already saw what was going on there, and from that moment on, you will not believe, I said to myself, 750 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York; 723 Gates Avenue, Brooklyn, New York.</span> <span id="s1183">Right.</span> <span id="s1184">I didn't have any pencil.</span> <span id="s1185">I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s1186">I used to be the fancy writer in the house -- in my house.</span> <span id="s1187">So every time we had -- my mother had two sisters here in the States.</span> <span id="s1188">One of them who came in the first world war, elder sister, who lived on the concourse in New York, and the other one who left about six months before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1189">Her younger sister came to her.</span> <span id="s1190">She took her down before the war.</span> <span id="s1191">Her name was Helen Borenstein (ph).</span> <span id="s1192">That played quite a trick on me because I screwed up the addresses.</span> <span id="s1193">Wait till you hear this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Wait for the purse war thing, but yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So that was -- so that was the preservation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: The preservation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: In your – in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: What gave me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: In your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: And I'll tell you something, what gave me, at that moment, I says, it's not what I learned.</span> <span id="s1202">No, God isn't with them, not the God that I know.</span> <span id="s1203">I'm going to try to outlive you.</span> <span id="s1204">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1207">And you know, I used -- somebody asked me why do I come in with it now.</span> <span id="s1208">I had -- I told that story before but I delivered a speech about three months ago, four months ago over here at -- where my granddaughter lives.</span> <span id="s1209">The teachers wanted me to come and tell them about World War II.</span> <span id="s1210">Okay.</span> <span id="s1211">I came in and one of the kids -- you want to hear?</span> <span id="s1212">This is incredible.</span> <span id="s1213">All assembly of the high school, one of the kids gets up – and I'm pretty good at geography.</span> <span id="s1214">So I walked over.</span> <span id="s1215">I wanted -- I like to show them, how did so many Jews get there, to Poland, and I'm a history buff.</span> <span id="s1216">So I know the history of the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1219">And I like a -- what do you call -- a blackboard, and I draw Poland, show them how the Jews got from the -- after the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s1220">It's incredible, and I'll tell you, that's better than any history book, and I show them exactly where Auschwitz was, where Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I tell them after I finish -- I wasn't even finished.</span> <span id="s1221">One of the kids gets up, I ask -- I love to ask, "Any questions?"</span> <span id="s1222">One kid, sitting there, gets up and says, "Sir, if there was something what made you really survive all this?"</span> <span id="s1223">I says, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I prefaced it by telling, "Look, this is a public school.</span> <span id="s1224">I'm not going to tell you, but I had a very good religious background."</span> <span id="s1225">I said, "By religious I don't mean Orthodox, but I know – I know my history," I says.</span> <span id="s1226">And all I learned is something that made me -- the first moment I got in there I told them this story of being – of looking into this SS man's middle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns.</span> <span id="s1227">Listen to this, the kid gets up and says, "You know my grandfather" -- this could have been -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any better.</span> <span id="s1228">"My grandfather came here from the Ukraine and he had one of those, and it says Gott mit uns" -- listen to this -- "one of those belt buckles.</span> <span id="s1229">We erased the swastika and the SS, but Gott mit uns is still on there."</span> <span id="s1230">I almost flipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1233">I didn't know -- I didn't say a word because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1234">I was really hesitant.</span> <span id="s1235">I says --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: -- what happens if his grandfather was an SS man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: How did he get – how did he get this belt buckle?</span> <span id="s1240">Did he get it from -- I'll tell you, the people there, I couldn't have said anything better in my whole speech, because it lent credence to what I told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1243">That's why I'm telling you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: That's amazing.</span> <span id="s1245">Actually, that's an amazing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: This just happened about two months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Over at the -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1249">Pennington High School.</span> <span id="s1250">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1251">So anyway, it did the trick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So now back to after you were doing this job for -- after -- I mean after you became the assistant to the stubendeinst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I got the job in the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: The(?</span> <span id="s1260">undecipherable?)</span> <span id="s1261">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: That was the next job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: They selected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: I was -- we used to use the Zyklon B gas to gas the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: You follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: In the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: To disinfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: In the old sauna, disinfections, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: So we used to put on a gas mask.</span> <span id="s1276">We had an an SS man by the way who was a very decent guy.</span> <span id="s1277">He brought us into -- I looked for him at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1278">I couldn't find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: What was his name, did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: George, his first name, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: That's all, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: He became friends with the kapo of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Of your -- of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Of the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: And I have pictures of the kapo of the sauna with other people, but I don't have a picture of him.</span> <span id="s1287">I looked for him, because we knew when Debruekfeld (ph), he used to come and give us all the political --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: All the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: And he knew.</span> <span id="s1292">He knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: He came back one day and told us that his job was to pour in the gas --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Into the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: -- in crematorium number two from the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: And he said, "I'm not going to do it anymore."</span> <span id="s1299">He started to throw up, and he said, "I'm going to probably not be here.</span> <span id="s1300">They're going to send me to the Russian front."</span> <span id="s1301">He was scared to death.</span> <span id="s1302">They never did.</span> <span id="s1303">He never did it after that.</span> <span id="s1304">Okay.</span> <span id="s1305">So there were decent, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: -- there were decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Otherwise, you wouldn't have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: No one could have survived --</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: -- by themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: -- not with that a system, correct, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: It's not possible, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: So -- so now, there was -- I want to move on to the time -- I don't know how much further this was when you fell asleep and didn’t – and weren't up for apel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: This was -- I was already working in the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: I don't know how long, months.</span> <span id="s1320">I can't tell you the exact dates, but anyway, you're only dealing with about two and a half years, anyway, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: So I know when this happened.</span> <span id="s1323">There was one chamber that was a dry chamber in that sauna, okay, in the old sauna building.</span> <span id="s1324">Okay.</span> <span id="s1325">There was a place where we used to gas the clothes, a place for showers, because the prisoners used to come in about once a month or whatever, you know, for lousing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Yes, delousing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Delousing or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1332">Delousing, right.</span> <span id="s1333">I should get it right, because lousing is different.</span> <span id="s1334">Okay.</span> <span id="s1335">Sundays -- it was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1336">It was very warm in that chamber, and the guys who worked there, there were about three or four other fellas, okay, went in after the morning roll call.</span> <span id="s1337">We had a morning roll call, the apel, which was less than a few minutes, and the 1:00 o'clock was the big apel.</span> <span id="s1338">Wisnia goes to sleep there, and I wake up.</span> <span id="s1339">It got so quiet.</span> <span id="s1340">It must have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's nobody in there.</span> <span id="s1341">I look out the window of the sauna and I can see (?</span> <span id="s1342">indecipherable?)</span> <span id="s1343">the general, with his desk, in the middle of the road of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1344">The whole camp is standing at attention so to speak.</span> <span id="s1345">They're looking for Wisnia.</span> <span id="s1346">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s1347">They didn't know yet who it was, but they knew there was one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: -- person missing.</span> <span id="s1350">When I woke up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Well, the number actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: It would have been the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: One number, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: The number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: They had to get the number.</span> <span id="s1357">They knew what cell block, because we stayed all on the outside lined up.</span> <span id="s1358">There was somebody missing from that cell block.</span> <span id="s1359">I woke myself up, and I see everybody, and I started to run from the sauna, from here all the way through the barracks, the side of the barracks down to cell block 15, which is on the left, and I tried to hide in between the people, but they wouldn't let me, because they already found out there was somebody missing there.</span> <span id="s1360">You can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: You talk about luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: The SS man who is doing the count comes over to cell block, blockalteste tells him that, you know, this is the fella's here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: He's arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Brings me up to the center road.</span> <span id="s1367">There's the desk with the general taking the count, right, from all the cell blocks.</span> <span id="s1368">You realize, there must have been 50,000, 40,000 prisoners.</span> <span id="s1369">I'm talking about men, just men.</span> <span id="s1370">The women's camp is on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1373">He takes me, and guess who is the SS man reporting to the -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: The one who drops the canisters in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: No.</span> <span id="s1376">George.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: George, that's what I mean, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: George.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: The one who was -- who was your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: George is the SS man who is taking me over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: The sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: And he winks to me.</span> <span id="s1383">I'm standing next to the ditch, it was sort of like water, with his gun in one hand and with his hook, like a meat hook, and he goes over to me, and says, "You make one move and you're dead," and there's the general standing right there.</span> <span id="s1384">He's saying it for his benefit.</span> <span id="s1385">He's winking to me.</span> <span id="s1386">Okay.</span> <span id="s1387">I didn't move.</span> <span id="s1388">All right.</span> <span id="s1389">I knew I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s1390">I immediate -- I knew that was the end.</span> <span id="s1391">I got sick after that, right, a couple of -- I had a regular trial in the schreibsteube, you know, where they do the records and I was sent in for three -- to three months in the strafkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Which is hard labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Which is -- it's like -- I'll tell you, it's a -- they would have killed -- if it was anybody else, they would have killed them immediately.</span> <span id="s1394">They just would have shot them.</span> <span id="s1395">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">I could see it.</span> <span id="s1397">He's like punching me or -- I'm standing up, figured oh-oh, Wisnia you really did it now.</span> <span id="s1398">About -- I got -- I don't know if you call it typhoid.</span> <span id="s1399">They put me in cell block number seven.</span> <span id="s1400">I guess a combination of everything, that did it, and the boys from the sauna used to send in all kinds, to make sure that I was okay.</span> <span id="s1401">Remember, I wasn't a regular prisoner anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1403">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: I was working in the sauna, that was a quite a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: A privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Quite a privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1409">And I didn't live by the rations.</span> <span id="s1410">We could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: We could organize.</span> <span id="s1413">We could steal anything we could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1415">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: -- from the clothing that came.</span> <span id="s1417">You have no idea what people brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1420">So after I got a little better, I come out and go back to the -- to my sauna job.</span> <span id="s1421">I don't think I stayed there for three months.</span> <span id="s1422">I think I stayed for only about six weeks or seven weeks.</span> <span id="s1423">I had to go out to work and that wasn't fun, you know, being in the strafkommando.</span> <span id="s1424">They gave me a mock hanging when I walked in, put me on kleea (ph), you know what I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: On a noose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: -- on a hole regular, and then did the trap door.</span> <span id="s1427">I fell straight through.</span> <span id="s1428">That was the initiation into the -- but the kapo from the sauna must have said something to the blockalteste from the strafkommando, take care of this kid, I mean I don't want him to die here because I was his boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: So the wind up, I come back to the sauna and I only -- it only got better as I went along.</span> <span id="s1431">One of these days, one of those days, Tippy comes on an excursion to the sauna, you know, to check on the system there, whatever, with her SS people, and she sees me on the side, and I was in very good shape, and we start exchanging glances and we start saying a few words, and a romance develops.</span> <span id="s1432">Okay.</span> <span id="s1433">I didn't know how old she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Look, to me, it's a woman.</span> <span id="s1435">She was a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: So she came quite -- I think we must have -- that was '43, throughout '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1439">You met regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1441">Whenever she could get away or come to the new sauna.</span> <span id="s1442">We moved, by the way.</span> <span id="s1443">That old sauna was moved to a new location between crematorium four and five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">They built a new sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Must have made a whole big deal.</span> <span id="s1447">It's there, still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: But we met, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Something about singing saving your life in that strafkommando?</span> <span id="s1453">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Where?</span> <span id="s1455">I did in strafkommando too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: You sang there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: That -- that helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1460">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: And who did you sing for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: The blockalteste, the same.</span> <span id="s1463">Remember the man in charge of the cell block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: The kapo or the blockalteste?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1466">The blockalteste.</span> <span id="s1467">He was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Life or death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Life or death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Yep, yep.</span> <span id="s1471">And so this strafkommando liked music well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Strafkommando, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And he -- and he -- and he would request music as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Sure, would request --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Was he -- was he a Pole?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: He was a Pole -- no, no, he was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: He was an German.</span> <span id="s1478">A politico?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: He was -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: He was a green?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: He was a green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: He was a green badge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: He had a black uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1487">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1488">So he was a criminal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1490">He was a criminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: To me, there weren't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: He wasn't so bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Yeah, well, I mean he -- like he -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: I'm sure he must have beat everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: It was -- this wasn't a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: It's not a holiday.</span> <span id="s1500">It's not a holiday camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1502">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1504">What did you -- so back to the sauna, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Fast forward to 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1507">So fast forward to 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: You're having -- you're meeting Tippy regularly.</span> <span id="s1510">You're working back in the sauna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Working in -- we moved over from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: You moved to the new one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: -- the regular camp to the new sauna.</span> <span id="s1516">I have my own office in the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I have quite -- I was an old prisoner --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: -- who knew everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Even the Germans.</span> <span id="s1523">You follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Even the SS men, when they looked at my number, I'm here.</span> <span id="s1526">They said he must know somebody.</span> <span id="s1527">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Yeah, that's how the system worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: There was a kapo, the kapo of the Bekleidungskammer, Klauser, who was an Austrian, never knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1530">As a matter of fact, my friend Shia Kaulfus (ph) went to his funeral in Austria.</span> <span id="s1531">He was Catholic but he had a Jewish ancestry so he was a taken in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: I used to sing for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: German songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: I was -- German songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: For him.</span> <span id="s1539">He liked German songs?</span> <span id="s1540">(?</span> <span id="s1541">indecipherable?)</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: He liked German --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Sort of the like the popular stuff or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I'm trying to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: It's little difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: But you know, it was mostly popular stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: But it is singing that saved, there's no question about it.</span> <span id="s1553">It was -- it singled me out as different from anybody else, and I was.</span> <span id="s1554">Consequently, of course, I got more food.</span> <span id="s1555">I got different food.</span> <span id="s1556">I got access to everything I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: As a matter of fact, when I used to meet Tippy in one of the blocks that was lined up with clothing and there was a special place, a hiding place about a story high where there was clothing.</span> <span id="s1559">We used to get in there through the side so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Tell me, when the crematorium, was it four or five --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: I can't remember which one was blown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Four.</span> <span id="s1565">That's when, I'm guessing was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: That was '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: That was the end of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: And transports had already stopped by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Hold it, no.</span> <span id="s1571">Transports stopped in November of '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: November, so yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Well, let me tell you, when I -- fast forward to '44.</span> <span id="s1574">We're beginning to hear artillery, you know, at night.</span> <span id="s1575">We learned to distinguish, ba-boom, ba-boom.</span> <span id="s1576">We knew it wasn't</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: It would have had to be -- we were closer to the Russian side of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: You know where Auschwitz is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Near the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Going in that direction.</span> <span id="s1590">We're beginning to hear, and we figured survive another week, another month.</span> <span id="s1591">You know, that was the whole point, try to survive.</span> <span id="s1592">Eventually, we knew, and George told us they're going to lose the war.</span> <span id="s1593">He knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: He knew it.</span> <span id="s1596">As a matter of fact, he used to tell us, the Russian front is -- it's about 50 or 60 miles away, and they were scared to death of the Russians.</span> <span id="s1597">Well, because of what they did to the Russians, you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: It's no surprise.</span> <span id="s1600">So that was the greatest fear among the SS is that they were going to be sent to the Russian front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Because they knew that had they done that, anything out of the __, that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">So are you all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1605">I'm just checking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: So at one of the liaisons with Tippy, she -- we agreed and we made up our mind if we're going to survive, at the end of the war, let us meet in front of the Jewish Community Center in Warsaw, (?</span> <span id="s1607">undecipherable?)</span> <span id="s1608">and I figured -- I don't know why I figured it was going to be there.</span> <span id="s1609">I figured let's meet over there.</span> <span id="s1610">Okay.</span> <span id="s1611">I go on the transport, on the death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: To Gleiwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: To Gleiwitz, on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: This is what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: On one of -- this is in December of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: 1944.</span> <span id="s1617">Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: They stopped gassing -- I remember the uprising, because the sauna was right next door to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1619">I remember the boys running around and the machine guns were set up, and they locked up our areas so that they shouldn't come into our -- we knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: So the windup was that after they finished that, they actually stopped the gassings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: What do you call it, this was after the large transports, after the Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: After the (?</span> <span id="s1625">indeciperhable?)</span> <span id="s1626">transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: The whole -- I remember (?</span> <span id="s1628">indeciperhable?)</span> <span id="s1629">bit when they took them -- they were supposed to go to the train station but they went to crematorium five.</span> <span id="s1630">Oh, it was -- I knew the whole story of what was going because I was privy.</span> <span id="s1631">I wasn't a</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">(?</span> <span id="s1633">indeciperhable?)</span> <span id="s1634">you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: So I knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: The windup was that we -- on the march, the march was not good.</span> <span id="s1639">I escaped from the march.</span> <span id="s1640">That was my first attempt to escape, but they rounded us up and again they didn't shoot us, because we are strafed, you know, and then when we tried to walk --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: By Russian bombers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: By the Russian planes, and wait, you're talking about something playing a trick on me, the Russian planes we saw stars, red stars, right?</span> <span id="s1643">Who cared, red stars, green stars, as long as it wasn't the swastika, right?</span> <span id="s1644">They attached themselves, and believe me, there was something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs.</span> <span id="s1645">They used to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column.</span> <span id="s1646">Remember, you're talking about thousands of people marching.</span> <span id="s1647">Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s1648">That was in a different place.</span> <span id="s1649">Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot.</span> <span id="s1650">Then they put us on a train -- open train to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1655">From the open train, I escaped with about 12 other guys.</span> <span id="s1656">We made our way, I don't even know where, but we saw there was chaos.</span> <span id="s1657">There was a, what do you call it, a strafing or bombing.</span> <span id="s1658">We didn't know who, by whom.</span> <span id="s1659">Anyway, an SS men starts searching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we get back on the train.</span> <span id="s1660">Why he didn't kill us, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1661">Okay.</span> <span id="s1662">We go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1663">We arrive in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1664">No point in going into details.</span> <span id="s1665">Open cars, freezing.</span> <span id="s1666">God almighty.</span> <span id="s1667">January.</span> <span id="s1668">February, probably.</span> <span id="s1669">You can imagine in Germany.</span> <span id="s1670">Okay.</span> <span id="s1671">We wind up -- I come into Dachau.</span> <span id="s1672">If you ever saw when I came into Auschwitz, no comparison.</span> <span id="s1673">This was ten times worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Why?</span> <span id="s1676">No place to sit.</span> <span id="s1677">No place to stand.</span> <span id="s1678">No place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1679">No place to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Typhoid rampant.</span> <span id="s1681">From all over, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: -- they got the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: And I knew already then, if you could only again survive a little bit, you know, you might make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: I talked to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: So the windup, I hang around the schreibestube of, what do you call it, Dachau, around there, the closest barracks on the side.</span> <span id="s1690">I don't know how long we were in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">But in Dachau itself, I saw -- this was worse than Auschwitz, for me it was worse.</span> <span id="s1692">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1693">One day I see a sign up there, must have been about a couple of days or something like.</span> <span id="s1694">Anybody who can carry a -- is it 50 or 75-pound -- not pound, kilo of something, of cement, report.</span> <span id="s1695">We need to work -- they were – they wanted to work on the underground hangars for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s1696">It is now -- must be February.</span> <span id="s1697">Okay.</span> <span id="s1698">Everybody's strong enough.</span> <span id="s1699">I'm strong enough.</span> <span id="s1700">I want to get out of here, because I'm not going to be able to survive here.</span> <span id="s1701">I don't know anybody.</span> <span id="s1702">No longer privileged prisoner.</span> <span id="s1703">You can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: I mean you're in better condition than most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Having already been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Well, many.</span> <span id="s1710">There were – there were some.</span> <span id="s1711">This was a group from all over the place, remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1713">So there might have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: So they get together, I think -- I don't remember exactly how many, and we're put on a train and they're going to take us to Muhldorf.</span> <span id="s1715">Do you know where Muhldorf is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Muhldorf was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Going a little further south, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Yeah, into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: On the way to Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1722">I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: -- never in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: So anyway – anyway, that's what they told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Wisnia had enough of that crap.</span> <span id="s1729">So I figured I am strong enough, and if I can hear – and there are -- as we get on the train, about two or three times, I don't remember exactly, we have air raids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: You know, strafing of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Now, who looks at planes, what strafing, right.</span> <span id="s1734">We knew they get us out of the train into the ditches, also supported with clothes, but every day as I looked, the guards became older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: You know, I had a pretty good eye for that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: You know, to see what's going on.</span> <span id="s1739">How do you survive another day?</span> <span id="s1740">So one of these, we made an attempt, a whole group, to run away, but they rounded us up.</span> <span id="s1741">On the next time, I figured I ain't going with a group, I'm going by myself.</span> <span id="s1742">Okay.</span> <span id="s1743">No point in going into the details.</span> <span id="s1744">I had a shovel over there on the side.</span> <span id="s1745">It was one of the guys that was guarding us.</span> <span id="s1746">I smacked him right in the head.</span> <span id="s1747">As he was trying to gather us, there was nobody else and I took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Where do I go?</span> <span id="s1750">It's just beginning, so it's now the beginning, I say, of March -- I would say the end of February, beginning of March, one day it's nice, one day it's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: So I'm going towards the fire.</span> <span id="s1755">I figured the only way -- no compass.</span> <span id="s1756">Don't know my way.</span> <span id="s1757">I know I'm in Germany.</span> <span id="s1758">I'm outside of Munich, Dachau, but away from there because we -- we're closer to Muhldorf.</span> <span id="s1759">Now, from what I understand, we didn't go to Muhldrof.</span> <span id="s1760">We went up north to Merching.</span> <span id="s1761">I found that out from the historian of the</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">101st.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: I wanted to find out where did I the meet you guys?</span> <span id="s1765">Where was this?</span> <span id="s1766">Anyway, I walk only at night, hide in the day.</span> <span id="s1767">It must have been about two or three days in the barns, food, plentiful.</span> <span id="s1768">Whatever the chickens ate, I had more food than I wanted.</span> <span id="s1769">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">I get up one morning to find a place to hide and the whole war stopped.</span> <span id="s1771">I didn't realize how important I was.</span> <span id="s1772">There was no fire.</span> <span id="s1773">I walked towards the artillery fire.</span> <span id="s1774">There was no fire.</span> <span id="s1775">I figured well, the war is over.</span> <span id="s1776">Well, let me pull up.</span> <span id="s1777">I get up on a little hill.</span> <span id="s1778">I look down.</span> <span id="s1779">There's the most gorgeous highway, but I'm trying to find a place for the, you know, for the day to hide --</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: -- because I wouldn't walk anywhere.</span> <span id="s1782">I look down and I begin to hear a roar of tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">If I ever prayed in my life, I sure prayed that time and said oh, God, don't let there be a swastika or don't let there be a black cross that they used to have on the tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: The column comes closer and closer and closer, and I see the first tank.</span> <span id="s1786">There's a column of about 15, 16 tanks with trucks with a lineup, really, and I see the white star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Now, to me, I thought it was Russian, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: It's a star</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: -- I was used to seeing the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Yeah, the red star, yeah, white star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Never dreaming that it could be American, really, couldn't have -- somehow it went completely out of my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: So I start to run down from that incline.</span> <span id="s1796">I have a note here from Sergeant -- Staff Sergeant Ballou.</span> <span id="s1797">He says, "I still remember you coming down the hill."</span> <span id="s1798">I start running down.</span> <span id="s1799">The only thing that gave a me away, I didn't have much hair, but I had civilian clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: So you didn't have stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1802">I had gotten rid of that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: -- a long time ago --</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: -- before we went to Gleiwitz, I had already gotten rid of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1809">I had civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1810">I come down and didn't have enough strength to get in front of the tank.</span> <span id="s1811">Right at the ditch alongside -- I didn't know how important I was.</span> <span id="s1812">The whole column stopped.</span> <span id="s1813">The war, it stopped for Wisnia.</span> <span id="s1814">You think Wisnia is important, right?</span> <span id="s1815">Out of the hatch crawls out a -- first tank stops, crawls out a Captain James L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Walker from South Carolina.</span> <span id="s1817">I mean I knew words in English because I had learned words.</span> <span id="s1818">You know, you don't learn sentences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: You learn words, right?</span> <span id="s1821">He crawls out.</span> <span id="s1822">He immediately knew I escaped from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1823">I go over to him.</span> <span id="s1824">I says, "You, Russian?"</span> <span id="s1825">He says, "No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1826">merican."</span> <span id="s1827">I said, oh-oh, they're trying to trick me.</span> <span id="s1828">I says, "You, Russian?"</span> <span id="s1829">He says, "No, American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Where ya come from" -- you know, with that southern -- I never heard such English in my life.</span> <span id="s1831">I never heard English in my life, but not like this.</span> <span id="s1832">He says, "Where you escape?</span> <span id="s1833">Train?</span> <span id="s1834">SS?"</span> <span id="s1835">Something -- I got words.</span> <span id="s1836">I says, "Yes, SS, train."</span> <span id="s1837">He knew I escaped from a train.</span> <span id="s1838">I should take him.</span> <span id="s1839">You follow?</span> <span id="s1840">I should lead the column where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Can't speak to her.</span> <span id="s1842">I have a brain, I'm in the ditch and there's the tank, right, and the whole column is stopped.</span> <span id="s1843">They all stopped.</span> <span id="s1844">So he says -- I said to him, "Any Polish?"</span> <span id="s1845">He got the message.</span> <span id="s1846">I'm looking for somebody I can talk to, Polish.</span> <span id="s1847">He said, "Yeah, we got one.</span> <span id="s1848">Fred Wiltsack (ph), Fred Wiltsack."</span> <span id="s1849">Yells down, and the road.</span> <span id="s1850">You had to see the tanks.</span> <span id="s1851">There was enough room for a jeep to drive by, takes a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1852">A jeep drives up with Fred Wiltsack from Pawtucket, Rhode Island.</span> <span id="s1853">By the way, he came to his bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1854">I got him coming.</span> <span id="s1855">Fred Wiltsack comes up and he goes over to me and he says -- starts talking Polish.</span> <span id="s1856">His Polish was worse than my English.</span> <span id="s1857">I couldn't talk to him.</span> <span id="s1858">Couldn't talk to him.</span> <span id="s1859">They want me take them where the SS is.</span> <span id="s1860">I can't tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Okay.</span> <span id="s1862">Wait.</span> <span id="s1863">I'm not finished.</span> <span id="s1864">I had a brainstorm.</span> <span id="s1865">I figured, you see, I heard the story that there were Germans disguised as Americans, you follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: And I figured, you know, after all, you know, that I saw, I figured that can't be true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1869">You were very suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: Can't be true.</span> <span id="s1871">Can't be true.</span> <span id="s1872">So I said, "Any Yiddish?"</span> <span id="s1873">You see, you don't say Jewish, because in Europe, it's not Jewish, it's Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: It's Yiddish, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1876">So I said to this captain, I says, "Anybody Yiddish?"</span> <span id="s1877">He says, "Yeah, we got one."</span> <span id="s1878">He yells down again, "Harry Weiner.</span> <span id="s1879">Harry Weiner."</span> <span id="s1880">Harry Weiner from Tarzana, California drives up on a jeep.</span> <span id="s1881">The next jeep comes up, you know, like I have to explain to me -- you know what?</span> <span id="s1882">He brought him up.</span> <span id="s1883">It alleviated a little bit of my suspicion.</span> <span id="s1884">And he started talking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1885">The other guy's Polish was bad, his Yiddish was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: He came from Tarzana, California.</span> <span id="s1888">It was a like a comedy of errors.</span> <span id="s1889">Then they did something worse.</span> <span id="s1890">He took me back in the jeep.</span> <span id="s1891">They wanted to continue.</span> <span id="s1892">The war was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: So he took me back.</span> <span id="s1895">He wanted to put me in to check me out, in one of those weapons carriers that had the Red Cross on it.</span> <span id="s1896">I don't know if you saw, the American Army, they had normally following them.</span> <span id="s1897">I refused to go in there.</span> <span id="s1898">I was scared.</span> <span id="s1899">I figured, you know, I heard that that's where they asphyxiate the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: And I still didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1902">I never left them until I came to the States.</span> <span id="s1903">That was a slow process --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Of building up trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: -- with them, building -- not only building up trust.</span> <span id="s1906">What they did is I became the eater of all their Spam.</span> <span id="s1907">I loved their Spam rations, their chocolate.</span> <span id="s1908">They all threw it away; they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1909">Then I got sick eating.</span> <span id="s1910">They put me in uniform.</span> <span id="s1911">They taught me how to use the Thomson, and let me tell you, that became my family, and really, did they become my family.</span> <span id="s1912">I'll show you, __+ you know and by the way this is my grandson's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: -- piece of music that he wrote.</span> <span id="s1915">All right.</span> <span id="s1916">Here's a picture of the ___ Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: This is you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: That's me.</span> <span id="s1919">That's my little baby machine gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: And who is standing next to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: That's another -- I've been searching for him.</span> <span id="s1922">He doesn't come.</span> <span id="s1923">He doesn't show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">That's me and that's me too.</span> <span id="s1925">That's in Zell Am See before we went to -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1926">Burcheskan (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span
