id="s573">A: It’s called Konditorei Mayer.</span> <span id="s574">They were German, but very nice.</span> <span id="s575">They were friends of my parents, cause they had about four stores away from my

<p><span id="s578">A: When they threw me out of school, what do you do at the home all day long?</span> <span id="s579">So, this friend of mine, the – the ha – the Uncle Mayer, they called him, told my father, why don’t you let her come, and she can learn in my bakery, to – to bake and to cook, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: And did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: And then I – yeah.</span> <span id="s582">And when my father came with the idea home, I said, why should I go to learn to bake and to make hors d’oeuvres – you know, the very noble, elegant things?</span> <span id="s583">What do I need it for?</span> <span id="s584">So he said, when you’re going to have later on a cook, cook in your house, then you can supervise better, and you’re going to know how to do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did that make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No.</span> <span id="s587">Now, or then?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Then.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No.</span> <span id="s590">But it was better than hanging around doing nothing.</span> <span id="s591">So I worked there for a few month then.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s593">But just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s595">About a year, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Mm-hm.</span>

id="s607">And when did that come in, fairly –</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: But fairly soon after all of the changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: But I can find out those things for you whatever you – whenever you need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: No, no, I – I’m not so much – sometimes I’m interested in dates and things, but mostly I’m interested in the – the length, the depth of an experience.</span> <span id="s616">So if it happens, if something happens and it only lasts for a little bit, that’s important to know.</span> <span

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And he was working also for – that was illegal, something illegal, Jewish organization, my brother.</span> <span id="s771">And my father was an expert, and he was hired by a company that belonged to the state.</span> <span id="s772">That gave him the privilege to wear the little star.</span> <span id="s773">There were big yellow stars, and little stars.</span> <span id="s774">And the important, working – if he’s in – good enough to work, he had the privilege to work in very little star.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And it – was it so that when you and your mother were arrested, that it was at that point that your father and brother went into hiding with your nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I think so, I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: – really, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s780">And you didn’t know what was going on with them because you were at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: We had no idea, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s783">What was –</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: And after a while, my father got a permission to bring my mother out, and I was supposed to follow a week later.</span> <span id="s785">And she didn’t want to go, she didn’t want to leave me there.</span> <span id="s786">But I was able to communicate with my brother, through the nanny.</span> <span id="s787">You know, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: – somehow were –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: How were you able to do that when you were in the camp yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: We were able sometimes to send out the note.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: When you found somebody who will take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: How was your mother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: And he –</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Uh-huh, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: – he – my brother said then, you can’t come yet, you’ll come probably in a week or two, but we are not sure.</span> <span id="s798">We can’t get it in writing.</span> <span id="s799">So I really – we decided to tell my mother then the permission was promised for me to go, so she would go.</span> <span id="s800">And I – we’d – we – we were told then, if she doesn’t go now, we can’t go any more.</span> <span id="s801">She had to go first.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And she eventually –</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: She eventu – she gave in, yes.</span> <span id="s804">Because if I can’t come a week later after her, then she would have spoiled the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: But I wasn’t sure that I could go, and I – I was glad to get her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Because I knew when she’s out, she would be safe, because [indecipherable] was there, and they will do whatever they can.</span> <span id="s809">And I stayed, and I told her I really – was almost a lie, but I did anyway.</span> <span id="s810">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: So what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: She went home too, and she officially was able to live with my father and – over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Somewhere, I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: They were not in hiding any more, because he had gotten the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: What about your brother?</span> <span id="s818">Was he included in that safe – safety net, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: He was in – he had to make his own.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: But they were somehow in contact, but he had to make his own.</span> <span id="s824">We never talked about the time, never, after the war or anything, never.</span> <span id="s825">It was too painful.</span> <span id="s826">My father – then later on it came to it – then they withdrew my father’s permit of working.</span> <span id="s827">I have somewhere some paper, where the release of him from his employment, he’s now free – the state is now free to deport him, my mother and my brother and me.</span> <span id="s828">Whoever they can find, they can take.</span> <span id="s829">I have it in writing from the – from the Slovak state, but I have to find it, I didn’t really –</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: It would be very interesting to see that document eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: If I can find it, I’ll let you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s833">Do you know what he was an expert in?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: My father?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Yeah, that he –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Tex – textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: So he was hired because of his expertise in textiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: And he was hired, I don’t know what he was hired for.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: I didn’t talk to him about it, because I never saw him any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: How did that – how –</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Then he, my mother and my brother –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: – went to the nanny, into the apartment in hiding.</span> <span id="s847">She had the sister.</span> <span id="s848">She lived – they lived together in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s849">Those two women agreed to save their lives.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s918">And they came in in about 1943, they brought them – transferred them from the military into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: As prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: No, as – yeah, as inmates from the camp.</span> <span id="s921">Never – never saw the pr – yeah, as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s922">Okay.</span> <span id="s923">So, there was a group of young men, and one of them came with typhoid from – but he didn’t come with his group of soldiers, he came from another camp, but that was a political camp, that was not a Jewish camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: He was called Elaver(ph), and there they had political prisoners.</span> <span id="s926">And I knew – we knew his family – I knew from home his family, but he came alone.</span> <span id="s927">His father was a psychiatrist who was killed by one of his patients, but before.</span> <span id="s928">And his name was Janko(ph) Sakay(ph).</span> <span id="s929">And you couldn’t bring him – didn’t bring him in the barracks, so they brought him in a tent.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: And I – I took care of him.</span> <span id="s932">Wasn’t afraid of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: You didn’t catch the typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Did he – did he get better?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s937">He became a editor of a newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Underground newspaper?</span></p> <p><span

war, okay.</span> <span id="s944">So tell me a little bit about your daily life in Novaky.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: When the – when those soldiers came in, they came of – say about 200 – I really don’t know how many came over there.</span> <span id="s946">The camp was divided into three [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s947">Okay, and there was barbed wire, like – like a camp.</span> <span id="s948">I lived on the third one, the third, on top.</span> <span id="s949">And there were over there, barracks for families.</span> <span id="s950">I was in the barracks for families because I came in with my mother.</span> <span id="s951">And then were the barracks for young men, separated.</span> <span id="s952">And the joke was I never went into the barrack.</span> <span id="s953">I didn’t – I wasn’t interested to go into the barrack with all the guys.</span> <span id="s954">And one day, in camp, there was a – for some reason they built a swimming pool in camp.</span> <span id="s955">I think the reason for it was, what they did in Theresienstadt, to – when somebody comes in, some Red Cross or something, they show them how good they treat the people.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s957">That was my interpretation, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s958">And over there, I was a gre – I was a very good swimmer, so – so we swam over there.</span> <span id="s959">And one day I heard – it was on the – I think it was on a Su-Sunday.</span> <span id="s960">Was after work, we were there, and I heard they had brought Gizzy(ph) Fleischman in there, okay?</span> <span id="s961">So I got up in the bathing suit with just like a robe, and I went after her to see if I can help her, because I knew she’s in trouble, because they – they held her separate in a prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: And – okay.</span> <span id="s963">How – who was Gizzy(ph) shl – Fleischman?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Gizzy(ph) Fleischman was the aunt of my brother’s best friend, who lived til about two years ago, in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s966">And how was she well-known, how was she famous?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: She was very, very active in, as you saw, in that c-camp, in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s969">Do you know what her – role she played?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: No.</span> <span id="s971">People didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s972">And I was too young.</span> <span id="s973">I was a [indecipherable] but she was already about 40 years old or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So did you go, and did you find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yes, I found her.</span> <span id="s976">I found her and I – they let me in, the guard, because she was being interrogated, and she was in a separate room held.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: She was not in the barracks with the other people, because she was too important.</span> <span id="s979">And I made her – I met her, she was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s980">And then I said, I see you tomorrow, and find out where you are and what’s going on, and see you – they didn’t let me stay very long.</span> <span id="s981">But she was being treated normally, I mean, not – and then two days later, she was gone.</span> <span id="s982">She was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s983">And this way, at the time when I went down, somebody else walked next to me, a big guy.</span> <span id="s984">It was my future husband – became my future husband.</span> <span id="s985">We met over there because he came in with his military, and his sister was married to a man – next to Novaky, next to the camp, was a city.</span> <span id="s986">There was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: What was the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Prievita(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Prievita(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Prievita(ph), yeah.</span> <span id="s991">There was a liquor and marmalade factory, and he was the director there.</span> <span id="s992">The factory belonged to a Jewish family, they were called Hymar(ph), and my later brother-in-law, they were called Grott(ph).</span> <span id="s993">He was able to pay the guard off, my –</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: This Mr. Grott(ph), was he Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: He was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: – was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: The Hymars(ph) were Jew, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: They were also Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: But how was he able to stay and be director of that marmalade factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: They let them stay for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Because they exported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: They let them stay.</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t know what the deal was over there where it was, but they were there.</span> <span id="s1009">Wasn’t official any more, but he was there.</span> <span id="s1010">He was not officially the director any more, but he was.</span> <span id="s1011">And he was there visiting because his sister was in camp with two boys.</span> <span id="s1012">Her two boys were three and six years old.</span> <span id="s1013">We brought them in 1968 here, because my sister-in-law took them into the home after, because these two boys, the mother with the two boys were caught and taken to be shot.</span> <span id="s1014">But they did not shoot the boys, because the peasant who – there was one woman peasant, there were two little boys, nice looking, good little boys, with the mother, and they were going to shoot them three.</span> <span id="s1015">And the peasant begged the German soldier, give me the boys, I don’t have any children.</span> <span id="s1016">So they told her, take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Like kittens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yeah, take them.</span> <span id="s1019">Shot the mother in front of the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: The six year old remembered, the three year old doesn’t.</span> <span id="s1022">So, now, are we finished with Novaky, or you want to hear more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Oh no, I – I want to know a little bit more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: I want to know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Okay, I worked in two or three places.</span> <span id="s1027">I worked in – there we made – we made the backpacks for the military, and then I worked in the kitchen a little bit.</span> <span id="s1028">The more you worked, the less you were – the more they let you stay, okay.</span> <span id="s1029">So, I wasn’t very scared, I – because I was young and stupid, so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1030">So I stayed there in the barracks, had a lot of good friends, and started to go out with this man I met on the way to the pool.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So this man who followed you to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: He didn’t follow me, he went on the same street, on the same road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Ah, okay, so when you went to see Gizzy(ph) shle – Fleischman, it was by coincidence that he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: By coincidence, and he went to his – to the bra – to the sister of my future brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s1036">The one who was shot –</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: – eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1041">And so you started to date him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: We started to date, yeah –</span></p> <p><span

boyfriends, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Well, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1072">We started to – he used to come – he – he

course, very glad to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s1079">Because my brother in – future brother-in-law had connection with the guards, he gave them money, or whatever –</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: – they let him come visit his sister, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: They were still official legal outside at this time.</span> <span id="s1084">And – what did I want to say?</span> <span id="s1085">That came very – came very good later on when the camp was – when the uprising came.</span> <span id="s1086">But over there in camp, it was nothing special.</span> <span id="s1087">Nobody s – nobody starved to death from hunger.</span> <span id="s1088">It was a difficult life, we worked very hard, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Were – I mean, but were there many selections to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Not any more.</span></p> <p><span

the joke was, it was iodine and aspirin, that you went to buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Because they didn’t give us much medication.</span> <span

mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1172">So how long were you in Novaky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I was in Novaky from – I think it was July, or – July – I think it was July, I’m not sure, ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: To August ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Over two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Had you any news about what was going on with your own family at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Absolutely not, no.</span> <span id="s1182">Then the – what was I going to say?</span> <span id="s1183">Okay, so we were already at that, and BBC news came in, and then in ’44, in August ’44, there was the uprising of the partisans in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: This would have been the communist partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: The communist backed partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Yeah.</span></p>

came and they worked on [indecipherable] and about 200 young men went out to stop the Germans – to stop the German tanks, so not too many came back.</span> <span id="s1192">And I think they knew that, but that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1193">And what we had, my future brother-in-law, from this factory –</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: – had access

the camp.</span> <span id="s1198">Very few partisans, they didn’t stay there, they brought it in, and disappeared.</span> <span id="s1199">And we loaded the trucks with children, and older people, and my friend Paul and I went on – on – on a truck, on the top, with – with guns, and there was a – full of kids and older people.</span> <span id="s1200">And we took them to Banská Bystrica, which was a place where –</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: – have you heard the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A:

<span id="s1207">And they were shooting [indecipherable] away, so everybody jumped up and down, you know, every time they came over a plane –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: – it took down as many people as we can, and in – that was in the city, next to the highway like those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Sort of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: – big holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1213">Sort of trenches that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Tren –</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Trenches, yes.</span> <span id="s1217">And they – they were hiding there, and – and the plane didn’t see people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1218">And one time, the last time when I was on there, I had enough, I didn’t go down, I stayed on, and the – came down, flew over me.</span> <span id="s1219">I saw him, he saw me and he didn’t shoot.</span> <span id="s1220">German pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: And you were right there in his target?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: I was right there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1223">So he was a decent guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: But yet, he was shooting other times?</span> <span id="s1225">Or was it other planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: You don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: – you don’t know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Who knows, something flies over you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: He didn’t shoot me.</span> <span id="s1233">So then we went into Banská Bystrica, the family of Poles had friends there, so we went with them in – they had a house there, so we stayed with them, and they took me along, because when we came out of the camp, we picked up Paul’s whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: So you, more or less, was it like you broke out of that camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: – or had the Hlinka guards disappeared?</span> <span id="s1237">How did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, they – they – they opened it when the partisans came in with the weapons, they opened the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Everybody could go wherever he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1242">So they were losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: They were not lo – didn’t last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s1246">So we were in Banská Bystrica for – for a while, and one day there was a air raid, and Paul’s sister was going to try to serve tea, you know, like to the group of men sitting there.</span> <span id="s1247">And it was dark, so she went instead of the steps up, she went to – the wrong way.</span> <span id="s1248">Flew down the st – flew down the flight of stairs, broke the collarbone and the shoulder, but had a – May, June, July, au – three and a half months old baby.</span> <span id="s1249">So I – I started taking care of the baby.</span> <span id="s1250">Luckily, she was nursing.</span> <span id="s1251">That’s all she could do.</span> <span id="s1252">Put her in the sling –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: And hold her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Put her in a sling and it grew back.</span> <span id="s1255">No doctor, nothing.</span> <span id="s1256">Then we went from there, we tried to go in the mountains, if somebody let us in or not – I have also somewhere in my papers, and I might find it.</span> <span id="s1257">When I find the papers, I’ll let you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: There was a school principal in the village.</span> <span id="s1262">This is all in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1263">And he had the – he took us in for a couple of days, until we found something else.</span> <span id="s1264">He took us in in the – behind in the [indecipherable] same school, the room behind the wall, he had two very badly injured partisans, French partisans, whom he saved the life, yes.</span> <span id="s1265">Was a nine year old boy who had a s – her – his son.</span> <span id="s1266">And he went for food and then the – yeah, and got quiet, didn’t say anything, because he knew.</span> <span id="s1267">There were nine year old kids, non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: One time I remember I went with Paul to look for another place, to another village.</span> <span id="s1270">And as we walked up the hill, there were two guards with – with guns.</span> <span id="s1271">And the question was [speaks German] Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Soldiers.</span> <span id="s1274">And of course we couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1275">We’re not allowed to, I mean.</span> <span id="s1276">We did not know [indecipherable] we knew.</span> <span id="s1277">So just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Can I ask a question at this point?</span> <span id="s1279">Would you say that you th – I don’t know how to phrase it, but some people just put it bluntly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Bluntly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Did you look pa – did you look particularly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Yes, and Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Paul not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Paul was reddish blonde –</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: – six foot tall, and perfectly Slovak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: So he could pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: He went for – then we went to one overnight to a – to a peasant, to another family, and they let us stay overnight.</span> <span id="s1291">And all of a sudden we heard shooting, and there was father and daughter.</span> <span id="s1292">But [indecipherable] and the neighbors came running and said, did you hear the shooting?</span> <span id="s1293">And a peasant to – said, don’t worry about that, they only shoot Jews, they don’t shoot our people.</span> <span id="s1294">So they didn’t know who we were, we were just refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Another little thing that maybe doesn’t make sense to record, or something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: No, it does make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: We had the baby carriage, with the little baby, four months old baby.</span> <span id="s1299">And it was snow, was in the winter.</span> <span id="s1300">And I pushed the ba-baby carriage, because they couldn’t – I mean, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Came by a German car with an officer, very nice guy.</span> <span id="s1303">He got out of the car, he said, [speaks German here] You know, because he saw I could hardly push.</span> <span id="s1304">He got back onto the truck and drove away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: You could probably use some gasoline he’s – is what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Yeah, but I – I’ve – I said – I was stupid, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1307">I probably spoke –</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: – more civilized German than him, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: But that wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: You don’t give off that you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No, I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: That – that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Next what is?</span> <span id="s1318">Next day we found a place where they would let us stay as Slovak refugees.</span> <span id="s1319">They didn’t know we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: So here li – here’s another question so that I’m clear.</span> <span id="s1321">At first you said it was you and Paul who was going from village to village, but it was also – it was a larger group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Was his mother, his sister, her husband, the baby, and the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1324">His mother, brother, sister, baby – so, six of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: I never counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1327">But it – not just a couple.</span> <span id="s1328">In other words, a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: But we went out when we needed to go look for another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1331">So you were kind of like the scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Sometime, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1336">So can we consider that from August when – you know, the – the guards just opened the place of Novaky, you escaped, and now you were in some ways in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: After we did what – after we did what was supposed to be done, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Then we went for his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Yeah, then you went for his family, and then you started hiding, from one place to another, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1343">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Then we went – there was a lit – there was another peasant who must have known, because he was very intelligent, and his wife didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1345">They have a little baby the same as ours, and the baby was very sick.</span> <span id="s1346">And what do you do with a little baby?</span> <span id="s1347">You can’t find a doctor over there in the mountains, they – who knows where he was?</span> <span id="s1348">So I – I decided to put it in – you know, they used to call it – in prison it’s umschlag.</span> <span id="s1349">It was, you put somebody with high fever, a baby, in a sheet with lukewarm water, and it cools it off.</span> <span id="s1350">Cause they didn’t have a bathtub to put it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: And the baby got – got well.</span> <span id="s1353">So there were then the two babies, our baby and their baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: And their baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: How long did this wandering last?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: The wandering lasted from August ’44 to April ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1359">So a good eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: A good – over half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Then we went to another one, I told you.</span> <span id="s1365">Not as Jews, it’s just the Slovak peasants, who had to leave because there was something going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: And there was something very interesting, because how do you have – yeah, somebody wa – became suspicious, and there was an old man, the – the patriarch of the family.</span> <span id="s1368">And he was sitting in a room, and he called me in.</span> <span id="s1369">And he started to ask me questions.</span> <span id="s1370">Either he heard the language, and it wasn’t as good as the others or something.</span> <span id="s1371">And I knew everything.</span> <span id="s1372">I knew my name, from Alice we got Aloyasia(ph) – yeah, I forget to tell you then, in one of the villages, Paul went to the German Kommandatura and got papers for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: How was he able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: He was a Slovak.</span> <span id="s1375">He was a Slovak, so he gave him permission to go from one village to another one, for him and his mother and his – the whole –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1377">Okay.</span> <span id="s1378">So he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: So he wa – he [indecipherable] papers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: But this – this old patriarch of the family didn’t seem to believe that.</span> <span id="s1382">And he called me in a room and he asked me the questions and everything, and the holidays, which I knew exactly because I am very, very versed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So, Christian holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: I am very well versed, yeah, because Nanny taught me.</span> <span id="s1385">She wanted me to know every – both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: And – until he asked me one question.</span> <span id="s1388">He asked me when my name day is, because in Europe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: – the – the religious Catholics didn’t celebrate so much the birthday, but the na – day of naming.</span> <span id="s1391">Now, for example, my nanny was Anna.</span> <span id="s1392">And this – heilig(ph) Anna was on July 26, I knew that every year, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And heiliga(ph) Alice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: [indecipherable] Aloyasia(ph), I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1395">That’s how he caught me.</span> <span id="s1396">So he sent – in a snowstorm he sent his son for the priest.</span> <span id="s1397">The priest came in the night, through the snow.</span> <span id="s1398">And the priest came, and he told him that this – she sam – she seems to be Jewish or something, she’s not a Slovak.</span> <span id="s1399">She’s either a Gypsy or something, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1400">So the priest told him to let me go in a separate room with him, he will ask me.</span> <span id="s1401">So we went there, and he said, I know who you – he told me, I know who you are, I know you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1402">If you can go now, tonight, in the snowstorm, out of here, the snow – you know, when you walk –</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: – okay, you usually leave a trail.</span> <span id="s1405">But when it snows, it’s covered til the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: The priest said, I do not have to go now to the German Kommandatura in the night, because it’s a snowstorm.</span> <span id="s1408">If you disappear from here overnight, I will go in the morning and tell them where you are, in this house, but you’ll be gone.</span> <span id="s1409">So that’s that.</span> <span id="s1410">That’s what we did.</span> <span id="s1411">That was when a Catholic priest saved my life, okay?</span> <span id="s1412">So in a – what else, yeah.</span> <span id="s1413">My father, while my mother was hidden with my brother at the nanny, was in – but that was before, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: That’s okay, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: He had a friend, a professor in the hospital, and he told him too he will hide him in the hospital, as a patient.</span> <span id="s1416">You don’t see, I mean, you’re lying in bed, an older man.</span> <span id="s1417">So he was there, and they came also – the SS came in and checked.</span> <span id="s1418">And one of the people who came in was a young man who was originally from our house, the super’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Who my father found a job in [indecipherable] this carpet store, the oriental carpet store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: And he learned there the business.</span> <span id="s1423">He was – he started as a – he – where you learn it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: – then you become higher and higher and higher.</span> <span id="s1426">So my father was very happy, he saw him, he said, this one is not going to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Betray me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: – betray me.</span> <span id="s1429">He took him, and out.</span> <span id="s1430">He went to Sarrit(ph).</span> <span id="s1431">From Sarrit(ph) he went supposedly to Auschwitz, and from Auschwitz he went to Oranienburg somehow.</span> <span id="s1432">They don’t know if it was Oranienburg or Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1433">That’s what your papers show.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1436">He died somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: And it was because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: A week before liberation, he was alive, that we know.</span> <span id="s1439">Because a friend of his came back, and he told us.</span> <span id="s1440">Then, he was still an optimist.</span> <span id="s1441">He was telling, do you see the fla – see those planes are coming?</span> <span id="s1442">You see the shooting, we can hear already, they coming to liberate us.</span> <span id="s1443">And he – they went back, they went to sleep at night, and by the morning he was gone.</span> <span id="s1444">And nobody knew where, if he tried to escape, or whatever, you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: And it was all because of this – this young man who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yeah, this young man we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: – the super’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Yeah, the young man who – yeah.</span> <span id="s1449">And what else, I wanted to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1450">Maybe I remember, if not, then – yeah.</span> <span id="s1451">While we were in this one person’s house, who knew who we are, and hid us – [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Excuse me just for a sec – [break] Okay, and we’re continuing.</span> <span id="s1453">What were we talking about when the phone rang?</span> <span id="s1454">I think it was that you – we were talking about your father, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: We were talking about my father, yeah.</span> <span id="s1456">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Father, and the super’s son, who betrayed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1459">That was in ’44.</span> <span id="s1460">And yeah, during ar – around Christmas, when we were in the person’s house –</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: – they had a son, and I ask him could he get me some kind of a card, because I wanted to send a Christmas card.</span> <span id="s1463">They didn’t have Christmas cards, but like a postcard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: And I wrote to my nanny.</span> <span id="s1466">I wished her a merry Christmas and told her [speaks German] that was me [German].</span> <span id="s1467">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1468">That kay – what I had in mind – she knew my handwriting.</span> <span id="s1469">She knew it was me who wrote it, but they’re not going to come her, to interrogate her where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1471">You had to think so cleverly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: To survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: I didn’t want her to get in trouble, to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: So, if I translate that, you – you sent her a postcard wishing her merry Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: And then that – and then a message –</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: You do not have to – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Look for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Don’t look any more for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: – Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: She’s shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: She’s a – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: She’s been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: And – and so y-you’re – you were letting her know that you were not shot, that you were alive.</span> <span id="s1488">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: I didn’t know then my mother was there, or my brother was there, but I knew she would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: And after the war, we came back to Beravita(ph), that’s where the aunt let them – left them there, and I went to look for my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Now, the trains were not going yet, because there were still

things.</span> <span id="s1931">And if you can give me the explanation, I would appre – I would really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: I did not talk to my children about it, because I don’t think it should be – children need to know that, when they’re young.</span> <span id="s1933">We have time later.</span> <span id="s1934">And then, my basic idea is, there are two kind of people; people who have feelings and heart, and they’re going to get hurt by these stories; the people who don’t like us are going just to have pleasure from it, and I don’t want to give it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: I can understand that.</span> <span id="s1936">And it’s a complicated way to try and address that.</span> <span id="s1937">The point where you say people who

id="s1950">Q: You finally gave in and – and I think everybody’s going to be grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: Yeah, but I don’t think it’s – really I should have written something down, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: It’s okay, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1953">It is something for them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Cause jumping from one point to another –</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: You know, in oral histories, very often the dates are things people may not remember, but the experiences, those are real.</span> <span id="s1956">Those are ones that you went

was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1980">I was married for 50 years, and I have three wonderful children, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, and if – they were the ones, and also my – my nieces’ children – both nieces – and they were the ones who requested this a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1981">But I never wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1982">But when I was in Washington, D.C., at this ceremony, I realized then they are right, and I was wrong, and I owe it to them to give that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: It’s a real gift.</span> <span id="s1984">And thank you for doing so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Does it make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Yes, perfect sense.</span> <span id="s1987">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A:
