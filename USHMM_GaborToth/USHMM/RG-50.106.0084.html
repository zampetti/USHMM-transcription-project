Could you give us your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My name is George Steven Pick, p-i-c-k.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Is that the name you were born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: The first name is Anglicized.</span> <span id="s17">The original name was György, but I changed it when I became a citizen because nobody could spell it and pronounce it.</span> <span id="s18">George is an equivalent English version of György, which was my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your family name was Pick?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My family name was Pick, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And where were you born, and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes, I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in March 28, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Now let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s24">How long had they been in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My family’s history had been quite intertwined with the Austro-Hungarian empire’s history.</span> <span id="s26">I have records which shows that my family was in Hungary for at least 250 years.</span> <span id="s27">I have actual birth certificates and – and other do – documents which document this.</span> <span id="s28">And I had a very large family.</span> <span id="s29">I did a little bit of genealogical research.</span> <span id="s30">It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire.</span> <span id="s31">And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War, my family sort of stayed to – stayed in the geographical locations they were, but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria.</span> <span id="s32">And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania, so they became Romanian.</span> <span id="s33">And this was the situation between the two wars.</span> <span id="s34">We were a fairly closely knit family.</span> <span id="s35">People were keeping in touch with each other.</span> <span id="s36">And I know, for example, of what my great-grandparents did.</span> <span id="s37">One was on my father’s side, a physician.</span> <span id="s38">And the other one on my father’s side was a merchant, an importer, who imported mostly fruits and spices.</span> <span id="s39">My grand – great-grandparents on my mother’s side, one owned a lumberyard, and the second one was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s40">And so I have quite a bit of – of information about them.</span> <span id="s41">My grandparents of – my maternal grandfather was an engineer, a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s42">Worked as chief engineer of a – of a factory in Hungary, and my grandmother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s43">My other grandfather was a director of a lumber company.</span> <span id="s44">My father was a – an engineer and my mother was a paralegal secretary.</span> <span id="s45">So that’s the background.</span> <span id="s46">I am an only child, I had no brothers or sisters.</span> <span id="s47">I have a number of cousins, I have a –</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What are your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: My father’s original name was Istvan, which is translated roughly to Steven, and my mother’s name was Margit, which is Margaret; that’s what she Anglicized her name to when she came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Her maiden name was Kornhauser, and that’s her father’s name.</span> <span id="s52">Her mother’s maiden name was Spitzer(ph).</span> <span id="s53">And my grandmother on my father’s side, her maiden name was Augenfeld(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And you said your father was an engineer, what kind of engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: He was a – a mechanical engineer, and he worked for a short time as such.</span> <span id="s56">Because of some of the Jewish laws, which came into effect in the late 30s, early 40s, he lost his job in January of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Yeah, we-we’ll get to that in a moment, yeah.</span> <span id="s58">All right, you are born, you said, in 1934.</span> <span id="s59">Did – was your family living in the center of the city, or whereabouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, my family lived in Buda, which is the other side of the – the Danube river, and we lived there until I think I was about six or seven, and then we moved to Pest, my father, mother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you have any memories of Buda, living in Buda?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, Buda is a very – very nice hilly section of the city.</span> <span id="s63">We lived near a – a large square, where – and a – and a hill, Gellért hill.</span> <span id="s64">And my mother took me, when I was a child, walking there to both the – the hill and the square.</span> <span id="s65">And I – I do remember very well the – th-the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Was this a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, it was not.</span> <span id="s68">There was a Jewish neighborhood in Pest, but not in Buda.</span> <span id="s69">And we did – we were very – we were not very religious.</span> <span id="s70">We were fairly – we – we were really –</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yeah, assimilated, I could say.</span> <span id="s73">And were not very conscious of – of living in a Jewish neighborhood, although we – we know that we are Jews, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did your family have any kind of religious observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I th – we – we observed the high holidays, but that was about it.</span> <span id="s76">My father’s side of the family had a number of people who were – who married non-Jews, and they were, I would say, completely non-observant of any religion.</span> <span id="s77">A few of them had converted before the war, but most of them stayed Jewish, but were – were completely secular, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Do you think you knew you were Jewish by the time you were six – up to the time you were six?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: It’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s80">When I was about four or five years old, my mother took me to a little gymnasium.</span> <span id="s81">The gymnasium, in an English sense, was in a Jewish high school, and we went there once a week.</span> <span id="s82">And the teacher was Jewish, and it was a little bit of a physical education type thing.</span> <span id="s83">And on the corner, just across the street from this high school, there was a – a Catholic church.</span> <span id="s84">And I always insisted that we should go into this church, because I liked the way people were – were praying there.</span> <span id="s85">My mother didn’t say anything, and we went there.</span> <span id="s86">However, on – by age six, my mother enrolled me into a Jewish elementary school, and by then I knew very well that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s87">I was also sort of forced into the reality of being Jewish after my father lost his job and he told me that he lost it because we were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, we spoke German, mostly my mother and father and grandparents.</span> <span id="s90">I would say they did, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s91">And they spoke it because they didn’t want me to understand certain things.</span> <span id="s92">I was taught German when I was in kindergarten, and I spoke fairly well for a few years, but then I’ve completely forgotten it.</span> <span id="s93">Hungarian was the main language, essentially.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Was your father, or your parents in any way Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: They were not.</span> <span id="s96">They were not Zionists at all.</span> <span id="s97">There was a – I had an uncle who came to the United States in the late 30s and he first wanted us to come, and sent papers.</span> <span id="s98">This was in 1940.</span> <span id="s99">Hungary was a neutral country until June of ’41, so people could theoretically at least, leave the country.</span> <span id="s100">My uncle, who was a physician when he emigrated, brought – took our papers and sent us some affidavits, but my father was very reluctant.</span> <span id="s101">He – he didn’t want to start again, and the un – my uncle was fairly discouraging as far as the possibilities of employment, because on – he was telling my father that he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a mechanic.</span> <span id="s102">Well, my father was an engineer and a businessman and he didn’t want to step down the ladder, so we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s103">Then in 1940, he offered my mother that he would adopt me, and that he would take me, but my mother declined that offer.</span> <span id="s104">So, because of that, I got stuck in Hungary with my parents, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: When was the first time that you remember hearing the name Hitler?</span> <span id="s106">Granted, you were very young in the 30s.</span> <span id="s107">Do you have any memories up til 1939 of your parents talking about this man, or what was happening, how conditions were changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I have very vivid memories in 1938 of Hitler, because Hitler speeches were broadcast in the radio, and I remember this frightening voice, and – and his yelling and screaming, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: And you were only four and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Correct, but I remember it very vividly because it was frightening me.</span> <span id="s111">I mean, I didn’t understand the language, but the way he spoke was – was very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you say anything to your parents, or do you remember them comforting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I don’t remember them comforting me, I think I – I said to my parents that – that this man was a very frightening person, the way he spoke.</span> <span id="s114">And we had [coughing] excuse me – we had a prime minister at the time who was also a great anti-Semite, and I remember – well, I don’t remember the – the speeches, but I do remember the kinds of – of expressions he – he – he used, which again, were – were frightening to me, although I was only a youngster.</span> <span id="s115">I was a fairly precocious child and I was well aware of some of the politic – political figures, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and all this.</span> <span id="s116">And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me, you know, who was the Prime Minister of England, or who was the president of America, or whatever else, and I always knew the answer, even when I was in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s117">So I was sort of regarded as a smart kid, and I – I was more aware, probably, than an average four or five years old, about what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Okay, let’s move now to 1939.</span> <span id="s119">Is that the year you said your father lost his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s121">In main of – May of ’39, when the second Jewish law came into effect, my father lost his job, but it was more than that, because that particular law, also allowed what they called people who were not trustworthy for the government.</span> <span id="s122">They allowed the government to induct them into labor brigades.</span> <span id="s123">And of course, these groups included communists and Jews.</span> <span id="s124">And because of that, a number of my uncles, and among them, my father as well, was impacted very shortly.</span> <span id="s125">Actually, 1940, my father was inducted into a labor brigade.</span> <span id="s126">And they took him to Carpathia-Ruthenia, which at that time was already occupied by Hungary.</span> <span id="s127">And they sent him to build roads, strategic roads in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: When did you say he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: This – this was in – in September of 1940, 1940.</span> <span id="s130">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: What did he do between the time he lost his job, and being taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured a way to go around the – the laws.</span> <span id="s133">According to the laws, which were designed to squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of Hungary, a Jew could not practice business.</span> <span id="s134">But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who would then take out the business license, and they would work under him.</span> <span id="s135">And in our building where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s136">He was a friend of my f-father’s, and he volunteer – he – he essentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course my father paid him a stipend, and under this – with this arrangement, my father was able to – to do that – some business.</span> <span id="s137">Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f – it was not a formal store.</span> <span id="s138">What – what they have done, and this is a fairly interesting story, is they – they went to coffeehouses, and they met there Jews and non-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and they sold them both things.</span> <span id="s139">My father, being an engineer was more familiar with engineering materials, so he – he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought – bought them as well.</span> <span id="s140">And he had some partners who were – and business partners who were both Christian and Jew, and that’s how he essentially made a living.</span> <span id="s141">And bet – and after ’39, he has done that for – for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s142">As you see, he came back after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time.</span> <span id="s143">But between 1939 and 1944, he was home most of the time, and when he was home, he was doing this, he was practicing business.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: When you were very young, did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I did.</span> <span id="s146">I remember one, I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s147">My grandparents had a little home – a little home, a little yard and a – a small bungalow, about 20 miles from Budapest, which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer – a summer cottage.</span> <span id="s148">And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of ’40, we went there.</span> <span id="s149">My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came out on the weekends and we had some – I had some next door neighbors, little mini-farms, and kids came over, peasant children, and the – we played.</span> <span id="s150">And there was absolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just friends.</span> <span id="s151">And – and as I said, I had a number of them from that – it was a little village called Gerdaler(ph) and we had a next door neighbor, was a Serbian couple, and we were very friendly with them, and some others, also.</span> <span id="s152">The building we lived in in Pest had a few children.</span> <span id="s153">In fact, our next door neighbor had two girls, and the next door neighbor was a professional soldier.</span> <span id="s154">He was a – a – an officer in the army.</span> <span id="s155">And I was extremely friendly with their kids.</span> <span id="s156">I was – if I wasn’t home, I was there, and they sort of regarded me as – as a family member.</span> <span id="s157">When there was Christmas, they had a little gift for me under the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s158">And I have a number of pictures with the – with the two girls.</span> <span id="s159">One was my age, and the other was a couple of years younger.</span> <span id="s160">The next neighbor next door was also very friendly.</span> <span id="s161">They – they had a – a girl who was my age as well.</span> <span id="s162">And the three girls and myself, we were almost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10.</span> <span id="s163">And again, there was very little, to me, was very little awareness of – of what’s the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So you’re saying you didn’t experience any anti-Semitic remarks at that time, during that interval?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I – I wouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s166">What I was saying is that I did have non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s167">We had a number of anti-Semites in the building.</span> <span id="s168">And there was one incident which I remember very vividly.</span> <span id="s169">There was a teacher, who was a – quite an anti-Semite and he disliked me and I disliked him also, and once he asked me something, and I sort of a smart-alecky answer and he gave me a big slap on the face.</span> <span id="s170">And I – that was the first time I have ever ha-had – even my parents didn’t do things like that to me, and I was very upset.</span> <span id="s171">And the interesting end of this story was that a couple of years – couple of days later, this fellow came over and apologized to me that he did this, that he shouldn’t have.</span> <span id="s172">But I know that his feelings were not very friendly.</span> <span id="s173">But he –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Do you think that’s because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I am almost positive that that was the case, that because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well, I think he was a member of some sort of a Hungarian Nazi party.</span> <span id="s178">And he was certainly – he was the warden, the air raid warden there, and he was very gung-ho on – on the war.</span> <span id="s179">This was the first year of the war, when this whole thing happened, in 1941, and I know that he was – he was nationalist at least.</span> <span id="s180">But I – I – I always had the feeling that he was also an anti-Semite.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: What was it like for you as a young child to have your father tell you that he lost his job, his work, because he was Jewish?</span> <span id="s182">Do you remember what your reaction was at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, I – I don’t – I don’t remember what my reaction was, but I remember when he lost his job.</span> <span id="s184">I do not recall whether it was a panic time or not.</span> <span id="s185">But he has lost his job many times during the – the depression, and he always found something to do, and somehow to make a living.</span> <span id="s186">He was a man who could make a living on a – in Antarctica probably as well.</span> <span id="s187">He was a very ingenious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So you don’t remember feeling particularly threatened in 1939 because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s189">A: I did not feel threatened economically, but as I said, I had this – I mean, I heard Hitler and I heard the prime minister of Hungary speak and yell.</span> <span id="s190">I certainly was frightened by this.</span> <span id="s191">Maybe I was not completely conscious as to what could happen.</span> <span id="s192">But just the – the voices were disturbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What kind of relationship did you have with your parents?</span> <span id="s194">Was it a very close one, did you feel you could talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: My relationship with my parents at this time was close to my mother and not very close to my father.</span> <span id="s196">My father was a fairly cold person.</span> <span id="s197">He was not a kind of a person who would – would color, or who would tell me that he loves me, or something.</span> <span id="s198">And he was not a kind of a person who would want to take me to places.</span> <span id="s199">There was always a great disagreement between my mother and father as to how to bra – how to bring me up.</span> <span id="s200">My father felt that my mother was coddling me too much.</span> <span id="s201">He called it a monkey love, and he wanted to make a man out of me, and he felt that I was just too soft.</span> <span id="s202">And over the years, this – this translated into a – a fairly distant relationship between myself and my father.</span> <span id="s203">Even later in my years, I – he felt that I – I just did not meet his expectations in terms of physical prowess.</span> <span id="s204">My family, particularly my father’s family had a number of gymnastic champions and – and great sportsmen.</span> <span id="s205">My uncle was an Olympic – he was a European champion of gymnastics and seven times Hungarian champion.</span> <span id="s206">And both my aunt and my uncle on my father’s side were attending the Los Angeles Olympics.</span> <span id="s207">My uncle also went to the Amsterdam Olympics and Stockholm Olympics as a – as a part of the Olympic team of Hungary.</span> <span id="s208">And with that, of course, with that kind of competition, no, I was – was not able to compete.</span> <span id="s209">My father was, in his younger days, pretty physically active.</span> <span id="s210">In his 40s he was not as active as he was earlier.</span> <span id="s211">But he expected me to follow his footsteps and his brother’s footstep, who was a – a great skier and mountain climber, and I was never able to fulfill these kind of things, so he sort of gave up on me on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Now you said that your family moved away.</span> <span id="s213">Was it in 1939, from Buda to Pest.</span> <span id="s214">Why did they move?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: If I remember correctly, in Buda they lived with my mother – maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s216">This was right after they got married, and they really could not afford to live apart.</span> <span id="s217">In the late 30s, they had improved the financial conditions where my father beg – was working for a couple of years there, and I guess they were able to afford to move away.</span> <span id="s218">They didn’t want to move into a very expensive neighborhood, first they moved into a – a fairly low – middle class neighborhood.</span> <span id="s219">But then later, in 1940, me – we moved into an upper class place in – in Buda – in Pest, in – which at that point was sort of considered a suburbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: And when did you start school?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: I started school in September of 1940, and I went to a Jewish elementary school.</span> <span id="s222">It’s called the Jewish Boys’ Orphanage, but it was not just an orphanage, it was an elementary school for other children.</span> <span id="s223">And it wasn’t even for boys only, it was a coed school.</span> <span id="s224">So we had about 30 students, I guess 20 boys and 10 girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Why did you go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, there were several reasons for that.</span> <span id="s227">One of it is that school was considered very good, and at that point I think my parents became aware that I should be more aware of my – my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s228">And so they decided that this was a – a good school for me.</span> <span id="s229">And indeed it was.</span> <span id="s230">I had met children, both girls and boys, who were – essentially who became lifelong friends.</span> <span id="s231">In fact, I still have a number of them here in this country, whom I known since age six from first elementary school.</span> <span id="s232">And so it was a – a – a great bond, as it turned out.</span> <span id="s233">We had a great teacher Arn(ph) Magda(ph) who was a – a young woman at the time.</span> <span id="s234">And I remember the school as a very friendly school, and as a very friendly place to – to go to.</span> <span id="s235">I also remember that my mother took me every ni – every day.</span> <span id="s236">The school was about a half an hour walking distance from where li – where we lived.</span> <span id="s237">And I always woke up late.</span> <span id="s238">Actually, my mother didn’t have the heart to wake me up early enough, so that we ended up running all the time.</span> <span id="s239">And – and she – I remember very well that she always had my – hand my – held my hand, and we ran through this city park to get to the school.</span> <span id="s240">And I also remember the other teachers, other than just Arn(ph) Magda(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: In the early 40s, did you – or even in late 30s, did you notice any refugees from other countries coming to Budapest?</span> <span id="s242">Jews from Germany, Poland, Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s244">Actually, they were some of my relatives who were able – there was one uncle, his name was Gustie – Gustav.</span> <span id="s245">He lived in Vienna, and after the anschluss he was arrested, and they took him to Dachau.</span> <span id="s246">And for – and I am not sure and I don’t remember how, but after about a year and a half in Dachau, he was let go, and he managed to slip over the border to Hungary, and became an illegal alien.</span> <span id="s247">And I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s248">He – we used to have a family gathering in my matern – paternal grandmother’s and grandfather’s house.</span> <span id="s249">They had a little house, and it was a family tradition that we got together every Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s250">My cousins, my aunts, uncles and ourselves.</span> <span id="s251">And I remember Uncle Gustie came at that time and he was telling us stories about the camp, and his life.</span> <span id="s252">And we sort of didn’t believe him very much.</span> <span id="s253">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s254">I didn’t realize it until after the war that he was a multimillionaire who at the end did not survive, and who left all his houses for nobody.</span> <span id="s255">Ma – on my mother’s side, there were several great-aunts and children and – who lived in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s256">And I remember Ileanor(ph) and her – her 16 year old boy Garbore(ph) and her husband, they were able to slip across the Danube in 1942.</span> <span id="s257">And they lived again as illegal refugees in Hungary.</span> <span id="s258">We, between 1942 and 1944 were able to hide them.</span> <span id="s259">It will – this follows, we had a fairly large family in Budapest.</span> <span id="s260">They – every night they slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s261">And so every week or week and a half, we were the ones who were hiding them, and my mother and grandmother were particularly fairly nervous when they slept in our house.</span> <span id="s262">Had – they had some papers, but they were not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Was this nervousness conta-contagious?</span> <span id="s264">You were eight and nine years old when this was going on, and if so, how did it manifest itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Nervousness was contagious in a sense that I was aware that these people were – were illegals, that they came out of horrible things.</span> <span id="s266">We knew about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, they were telling us about the ghetto, they were there, and the – and that people went into hiding, into forests, and also the – that they were di – taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: All this was believed?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: All this was not believed very much.</span> <span id="s271">We – we didn’t think they were lying, but we certainly didn’t think that it could happen to us.</span> <span id="s272">And so, although we were nervous about their status, and we obviously were family, and we helped them as much.</span> <span id="s273">There was, for example, one uncle who – who was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s274">He was – his name was Louie, and he was a very religious Catholic al – although he was not born Catholic, he was a Jew who converted.</span> <span id="s275">And he was a great family man, and he was the one who got false papers to these people.</span> <span id="s276">Somebody – and I do not know who and why and how, betrayed him, and he went to jail for six months, because he not only helped the relatives, he helped other people in getting false papers.</span> <span id="s277">At that time, there were approximately 10,000 Polish and che – Czechoslovakian Jews living illegally in ha – in Hungary.</span> <span id="s278">Hungary at that time was regarded as some sort of a haven, a safe haven for – for Jews.</span> <span id="s279">Again, the Hungarian government sort of knew about their existence and tolerated them, but that they were still illegal and they had very little possibilities of – of doing anything.</span> <span id="s280">They couldn’t work, they were essentially charity cases for the – for their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: In 1942 and 1943, did you notice any rise in anti-Semitic incidents on the street, or to you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s283">The – in 1943, there was an interesting incident, which really brought home the frightening reality.</span> <span id="s284">My father was – as I mentioned, my father was inducted in 1940 to Carpathia-Ruthenia working on strategic roads.</span> <span id="s285">He was let go three months later, and in 1943, he was inducted again.</span> <span id="s286">This time he was taken to Kluge, Transylvania.</span> <span id="s287">Koloszvár, which is a – was again, part of the occupied territories by Hungary.</span> <span id="s288">He was doing some roadwork there as well.</span> <span id="s289">We visited him, because we had some relatives who lived there, in Kluge, and we the – I remember very well that he was quite lucky, because his commander was a decent man.</span> <span id="s290">His name was Andoor(ph) Altoi(ph), and he was a very humane person.</span> <span id="s291">He recognized this whole thing as being really ludicrous.</span> <span id="s292">And they – the – the men were able to, for example, organize groups.</span> <span id="s293">Some of them we – more well-to-do men paid money into a fund to get furloughs, and that money went to the families of the destitute.</span> <span id="s294">And the – the man who ran, Altoi(ph) who ran this – this brigade, this labor brigade allowed this to happen, and he did not allow the lower, non-com officers to – to hit the Jews or – or – or do any kind of inhumane things.</span> <span id="s295">So in that respect, my father was quite lucky in that.</span> <span id="s296">After he was deactivated, which was in the summer of 1942 – three –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Let’s back up.</span> <span id="s298">What’s it like for a nine year old to see his father in a – you know, taken away and having to do this kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, we had a family tradition, we never went to – to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s300">We always said goodbye at home.</span> <span id="s301">And it was a very traumatic experience, of course, he – I remember his rucksack, his – his thing, he carried his things with him and he bought good shoes and things.</span> <span id="s302">And it was – we were always terribly distraught, because of course, we never knew how long my father would be taken, or if we would ever see him again.</span> <span id="s303">It never – it’s sad, you know, you are inducted, and you have to go to such and such a place within 48 hours.</span> <span id="s304">But we never knew what his destination was.</span> <span id="s305">And then, of course, when we heard from him, when he was taken to a – to Transylvania, it took roughly a month before we knew where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview of George Pick.</span> <span id="s308">This is tape number one, side B, and you were talking about when you would say goodbye to your father at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s309">And then you had also mentioned – when he was taken away – and then you had also mentioned that you and your mother came to visit him one time, and I was just asking what it was like for a young boy to see his father in that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes, as I mentioned to you, our – our family tradition was that we were not – we – we never went to the railroad station, we said goodbye at home and then he went to the railroad station himself.</span> <span id="s311">I – I like to step back in time, in 1942, because it was very important and a very traumatic one.</span> <span id="s312">In April of ’42, when 50,000 Hungarian Jewish slave laborer servicemen were inducted, men between the ages of 18 and 40 were inducted and they were taken to Ukraine.</span> <span id="s313">Among these were three of my uncles.</span> <span id="s314">My moth – my father was lucky because he was one year too old to be inducted, but my three uncles weren’t.</span> <span id="s315">And I want to mention that there was a very large catastrophe which happened to them as well as to the 50,000, as well as 200,000 Hungarian army personnel in January of 1943.</span> <span id="s316">There was an offensive in the middle of the f – winter in the Don – bend of the Don river in the Ukraine, where the Soviet army had a counteroffensive and they – in six days they wiped out 200,000 Hungarian army men, and 50,000 Jewish slave laborers; among them, two of my uncles died.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Their name was – one was Bondi(ph) Kornhauser, and the other one was Yanu(ph) Pick.</span> <span id="s319">And two of my other uncles, Lazlo Kornhauser and Lazlo Pick survived.</span> <span id="s320">We did not know that they did, but – but in fact, they did.</span> <span id="s321">And they came home about a year and a half later, but the other ones died.</span> <span id="s322">And many friends whom we knew who went, did not come back at that point.</span> <span id="s323">So I wanted to mention that.</span> <span id="s324">I also wanted to mention that we found out late in 1942 that the German government asked the Hungarian government to implement the Final Solution in budap – in Hungary, and the Hungarian government refused at that point.</span> <span id="s325">And this, of course, was a – was a great relief for us, and we really believed that the Hungarian government is – is not going to let us go.</span> <span id="s326">We did not know what happened to the rest of – of European Jews.</span> <span id="s327">We were completely ignorant.</span> <span id="s328">And it is interesting because my father and I and my mother listened to the BBC every day, and there was very – there was a lot of news about the war, how the war went, and I remember very well that we had a big map at home, and my father had pins, red pins and white pins and we always looked at the – th-the map, and they were telling us where the – the offensives were, or what kind of battles, and my father was a – a vivid follower of all this.</span> <span id="s329">And there was a Hungarian speaking colonel on BBC, who spoke not very good Hungarian, very accented Hungarian, but he was the – the war correspondent, and he was the one who talked about all this, and we were very – very much listening to what was happening.</span> <span id="s330">There was no word, to my knowledge, which said anything about camps, or labor camps or deportation, or what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s331">Was very little, or nothing, nothing to my recollection.</span> <span id="s332">And in 1943 when – when this [indecipherable] breakthrough occurred, was a great sadness in Hungary.</span> <span id="s333">And I think that even the Jews, of course, felt sad because they knew how many Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s334">And as I mentioned, my next door neighbor was a – was an army officer, and my father and they – and he very often spoke about the – how the war was going.</span> <span id="s335">Now Hungary, of course, was a Nazi ally, and I – today I – I – to-today I – I – I wonder, you know, this man, he really had a great amount of goodwill, because he could denounce my father.</span> <span id="s336">I mean, my father was trying to convince him that the Germans lost the war in 1943, and in the beginning of ’44.</span> <span id="s337">And this man, of course he di – he – he – he talked to my father, but I mean, this was a very dangerous thing my father was doing, and this man was really decent enough not to – not to do anything.</span> <span id="s338">On the other hand, I remember another man who lived in our building, who was a commander of a Jewish brigade, who took this Jewish brigade to the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s339">And when he came home on furlough, he was very proud of the fact that among his Jewish slave laborers, there were a number of extremely Orthodox Hassidim whose beard he personally cut and shaved and taught them the delights of eating pork.</span> <span id="s340">And this man, by name of Drexell(ph), he was – Drexler(ph) rather, he was very proud of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What was his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I – I do not remember his first name, but I remember his last name.</span> <span id="s343">and he was much frightened after the war, because he knew that he made all these statements, and he was particularly frightened when he – when we returned, and he thought we would denounce him; we did not.</span> <span id="s344">Going back to 1943, my father was deactivated, and after that we went to a – take a – a week – one week vacation to the mountains.</span> <span id="s345">And it was a – a luxury hotel, and Jews were allowed to go there.</span> <span id="s346">There was only one hotel, which was not open to Jews, which was open to army personnel, army officers actually.</span> <span id="s347">And it was a beautiful summer and we enjoyed ourselves very much.</span> <span id="s348">One afternoon, my mother and I took a walk in the woods.</span> <span id="s349">And there, in the woods, we saw a large group of men in Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s350">They were the Hungarian Nazis, called the Nyilas, and they had the rally there.</span> <span id="s351">And that was the first time we really saw these people, and they were yelling and screaming and we were really frightened.</span> <span id="s352">And we sort of managed to slip away, but – but this really sort of banged reality to our consciousness in terms of – well, here these people, we – we thought these people were underground wi – they were e – theoretically illegal, they were not allowed.</span> <span id="s353">Their leader was in jail, but yet they were organizing and they were meeting in these places out in the mountains, in faraway places from Budapest, and – and we became more aware that these people were real.</span> <span id="s354">I mean, we – we – we knew the propaganda, we knew that these people existed, but this was my firsthand encounter with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What’s it like to see someone in a uniform like that when you’re nine years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, it was quite frightening.</span> <span id="s357">We – we understood, and I understood what the uniform stood for, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How did you understand?</span> <span id="s359">You’re nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, I have seen a lot of propaganda leaflets, and they have, all over the city they had these – these big propaganda photographs and – about the war effort and how the – these people look in SS uniform, how did the Hungarian uniform look and how did this Hungarian Nazi uniform look.</span> <span id="s361">Particularly the one which we were well aware is the armband which they wore, which were red and white stripes with a – a large Arrow Cross in the middle, green Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s362">And we – we were – we recognized that.</span> <span id="s363">And as I said, it’s just the way they behaved was frightening enough and what they were yelling, slogans, all this kind of things.</span> <span id="s364">They were mostly nationalistic and racial slogans, and they were yelling slogans, you know, death to the Jews and all that.</span> <span id="s365">And of course that was quite, even at age nine, it was quite clear to me that these people were not our friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And how did your parents interpret this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Well, we didn’t talk very much about it.</span> <span id="s368">I knew that my mother was very frightened, and we sort of left, and we tried to sort of not to speak about this.</span> <span id="s369">We thought – we didn’t ignore it, because I remember it, but we did not want to – she didn’t want to emphasize that, look, these people are terrible, and we are going to have terrible times.</span> <span id="s370">We really hoped at that point that the war is turning, that we will be able to survive.</span> <span id="s371">That before anything would happen, the war would be over.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So it’s 1942 - ’43, and you are still going to this Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And then what is the next big change that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Well, the – the – the next big change, what I remember was that in 19 – end of 1943, beginning of 1944, my mother decided that I am now old enough to learn a little bit about music and culture.</span> <span id="s376">And next door we had a lady who happens to be Jewish – happened to be Jewish, and who was a violin teacher.</span> <span id="s377">And we went there – actually it was maybe 1943 when I started violin lessons.</span> <span id="s378">And I never got too far, but what I did get out of it was a love of music.</span> <span id="s379">And I remember that in 1943, my mother decided that we were going to buy some season’s tickets for a musical and opera performances.</span> <span id="s380">All the Jewish performers were thrown out from their jobs in 1940 - ’41.</span> <span id="s381">And in Budapest, in the Jewish community center, there was a cult – there was a – like a hall, culture hall.</span> <span id="s382">Small hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: This is in Pest?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: In Pest.</span> <span id="s385">In [indecipherable] 12, and it’s called the Goldmark Hall in memory of Karl Goldmark, who was a Jewish composer.</span> <span id="s386">And curiously and – and ironically enough, the people who were thrown out for the first class, the best singers, the best musicians.</span> <span id="s387">And so what they did, in order to make a living, they essentially organized their orchestra, and organized their – an opera company.</span> <span id="s388">And almost daily they had concerts and opera performances, and it was a very vibrant and I would – should say a better quality of performance than in the opera house.</span> <span id="s389">So my mother bought tickets, and I remember that my first opera, which I saw, was Rossini’s “Moses.”</span> <span id="s390">And I saw a number of operas, Faust.</span> <span id="s391">And we had opera tickets like once e-every two weeks, on Sundays.</span> <span id="s392">And we had opera tickets for “The Queen of Sheba,” which was a Karl Goldmark opera for the – on the 20 – on the 19th of March, for the 19th of March.</span> <span id="s393">And it was a sort of a birthday present for me because my birthday’s the 28th of March.</span> <span id="s394">So, we never went.</span> <span id="s395">Why didn’t we?</span> <span id="s396">Because on the morning of the 19th, the Germans came in, and the performance was postponed indefinitely.</span> <span id="s397">The school went on for a couple of more – I think maybe a week or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: The Germans came in, what do you remember about that day?</span> <span id="s399">Can you talk about March 19th?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes, I remember the Germans came in, the tanks came in and it was very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What do tanks look like to a 10 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Huge.</span> <span id="s403">I remember the Tigers, they were – they were unbelievably big.</span> <span id="s404">The Tiger tanks were the – the largest German tanks.</span> <span id="s405">And I remember, as they rumbled through the city, and the street – we lived in a s – on a street which sort of led into the center of the city.</span> <span id="s406">It was a wide street, and it was very much – it had streetcars, but it ha – it had enough room for tanks.</span> <span id="s407">I remember also 12 years later in 1956, when the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city.</span> <span id="s408">But on that 19th of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s409">We knew that something terrible had happened.</span> <span id="s410">We heard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more things, saying, you know, orders given to various units.</span> <span id="s411">Hungarian units do this, you know, fari – code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be alert, or bring – bring yourselves to whatever city, and so forth.</span> <span id="s412">And what I remember is the confusion, and the – the disbelief that this could happen to us, and the – an-and the belief that – that now, something which we didn’t think would happen, will.</span> <span id="s413">And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the Germans do?</span> <span id="s414">The Germans came in because – we know why they came in, because the Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want to make sure that the – the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make sure that – that – that it could retreat.</span> <span id="s415">We also knew somewhat earlier that the Hungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with – with the Brits, and that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way.</span> <span id="s416">Well, that all changed on that day.</span> <span id="s417">In three days a new government was sworn in, Döme Sztójay, who was a – p-prior to this was the – the ambassador of Hungary to Berlin.</span> <span id="s418">And he was essentially a – an – he – he didn’t speak very good Hungarian, he was a German himself.</span> <span id="s419">There were these Germans in the west side of Hungary, groups of Germans living there, we called them Schwabs.</span> <span id="s420">They were the – th-the ethnic Germans, and Sztójay was one of them.</span> <span id="s421">And his government was containing the extreme Nazi elements.</span> <span id="s422">The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that the – that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed.</span> <span id="s423">Now, we found out that Horthy was out of the country, and – but he came back later that afternoon.</span> <span id="s424">He was with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was out, that’s when the – they came.</span> <span id="s425">We also found out that a couple of days later, that Eichmann and company also showed up in Budapest.</span> <span id="s426">The reason why I know this is that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still practicing law in 1943.</span> <span id="s427">And the reason why he was – were two reasons.</span> <span id="s428">One is that he was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army, and he was exempt from Jewish law.</span> <span id="s429">And secondly, he was a good friend of the German ambassador, Jakov.</span> <span id="s430">Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in.</span> <span id="s431">And va – before Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was lost in Voronezh, that Paul, things are changing.</span> <span id="s432">But Paul was a Germanophile all his life, a-an admirer of Germany.</span> <span id="s433">Never really believed that anything could happen to him.</span> <span id="s434">He was a prominent Jew.</span> <span id="s435">He was not very religious, but he was very active in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s436">Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he’s on a list, that he should go into hiding.</span> <span id="s437">Well, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s438">In fact, when he got his summons, the first one ha – Eichmann did the same thing as he did everywhere else, he’s – he summoned the prominent Jewish leaders the first three days or four days after this occupation, to a – a interim camp, and my uncle, my great-uncle took his dress uniform, his Hungarian dress uniform with all his medals and went in and demanded to be exempted from all these things.</span> <span id="s439">Well, they didn’t exempt him at all.</span> <span id="s440">In fact, they – they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish leaders were sent to Auschwitz and he died there.</span> <span id="s441">So we knew that things are happening.</span> <span id="s442">We also knew that by the fifth of April – on the 28th of March, my 10th birthday came out a – the law that we must wear the yellow stars in a week.</span> <span id="s443">So by the fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars.</span> <span id="s444">That was sort of my 10th birthday present.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: How does it feel to wear a yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Well, it – it certainly was – was something different.</span> <span id="s447">I was not very easy to accept that now everybody knows that I am different.</span> <span id="s448">I mean, up until now I – people the – we – we lived in a house where – in a building where two or three Jewish families lived, the rest of them were not.</span> <span id="s449">This was not a – an issue, I mean, although anti-Semitism we knew about, but as I said, there were a number of Christians who were friends, and sympathetic.</span> <span id="s450">But now, this was a – a – a huge sign on one’s coat.</span> <span id="s451">It was easy to see who was.</span> <span id="s452">And of course, we did not know who the – the – the enemies were.</span> <span id="s453">Whom, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s454">And it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were you – were you unhappy about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No, I was not unhappy being – being Jewish.</span> <span id="s457">No, at that part – time, I was already very consciously Jewish.</span> <span id="s458">We had the Bible studies and Hebrew in – in elementary school, and I was much more conscious about being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Would you have preferred to be something else?</span> <span id="s460">I’m talking as a 10 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Oh I cert – I would have preferred to be not there, so – for sure, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s462">I – I would say that I was – I was a proud Jew.</span> <span id="s463">I w – I was – probably wouldn’t prefer to be anything but a Jew, but I certainly would have preferred to be not a Jew who is – who is going to be sent to the slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s464">And what – what happened there in the – on the same day when we started to have to wear this Jewish star, my father and other Jewish men from 18 to 60 were inducted again.</span> <span id="s465">So essentially, my mother, my grandmother and I stayed behind, and my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did your mother sew on the Jewish star on your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, and I remember that – that it was in the newspapers, you know, they were – they were telling us exactly how big is has to be, and how yellow and y-you – you could buy this material, but it cannot be orange, it has to be very lemon yellow, and it has to be this big and this wide and all these things.</span> <span id="s468">And I remember how we – we were cutting it on the – on the table, on the dining room table, these things and we were counting how many we need for the outer garments and inner garments, and it was a – and then my mother and grandmother were sewing it.</span> <span id="s469">And we had to wear it on the – right above our hearts on the left side.</span> <span id="s470">But what was really traumatic was – is as I said, is my father had to leave again, and this time, of course, what do we do?</span> <span id="s471">And we didn’t hear from him for a long while, and about a month or so later, we heard rumors that the – that the Jews in the countryside – and I had 150 relatives – are starting to be gathered into ghettos.</span> <span id="s472">And there was an interesting things which happened, which was another lost opportunity.</span> <span id="s473">My mother’s family had a friend, and his – he was a – a romane – he was – he was a Romanian, or he lived in Romania, but he was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s474">And he came to Budapest in April, middle of April, and came to my mother and said –</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Ninte – 1944, correct.</span> <span id="s477">And he said to her, he said, look, things in Romania are come and gone.</span> <span id="s478">I’ll take George with me, and he’ll be safe with me.</span> <span id="s479">My mother refused.</span> <span id="s480">So this was another missed opportunity.</span> <span id="s481">And then he went and we never heard of him afterwards.</span> <span id="s482">We n – we don’t know what happened to him and his family.</span> <span id="s483">But he is a – he was an old friend, and he was a trustworthy friend.</span> <span id="s484">But, whether it would have been better for me to go with him, or not, who knows?</span> <span id="s485">Obviously, in the final [indecipherable] I was okay at the end.</span> <span id="s486">That happened in April.</span> <span id="s487">We didn’t hear about my relatives except these rumors, and these rumors were getting more and more disturbing.</span> <span id="s488">Then we had a lot of different rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s489">We had to submit our radio, our bicycles, our telephone.</span> <span id="s490">And we were cut off from the world, because we had no radio, for example.</span> <span id="s491">So we didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: You had to give up your own bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: I – I – I had to give up my bicycle, I had to give up my – our radios, jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What that difficult for you as a 10 year old, to give up your bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s496">I would say yes.</span> <span id="s497">I – I – it was difficult, and probably more difficult was the radio, because it was a lifeline for us.</span> <span id="s498">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What were you and your other 10 year old friends talking about?</span> <span id="s500">Did you used to talk about the war, or did you just talk about typical children’s things?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh, we would – we talk more – more about typical children’s thing, in the school.</span> <span id="s502">The school was abruptly ending.</span> <span id="s503">By the middle of April, we had no school, it was all finished.</span> <span id="s504">It was the – I completed the fourth grade, I got my paper saying that I completed the fourth grade and – and the Jewish kids no longer were allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s505">I remember the fi – about two weeks after we had the – the red – the yellow star on us, we still went to school, but then it was over and they told us that we should come in October to rigi – to register for the gymnasium, for high school.</span> <span id="s506">October was not a good time to register that year, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s507">At home, there were just too many things happening.</span> <span id="s508">We were listening – the radio we couldn’t listen to, but they had these – these announcements which they mounted on the walls.</span> <span id="s509">And every day there was 20 - 30 different things, you know.</span> <span id="s510">We were rushing around and we were trying to make sure that we have food at home, we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: These are loudspeakers on the street, or in the buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: They were – they were newspaper, mostly the newspaper was used.</span> <span id="s513">There was one thing which I remember in April; my father was still there, before they took him.</span> <span id="s514">It was the first raid on Budapest, bombing – bombing raid.</span> <span id="s515">And my grandfather, as I mentioned, on my father’s side, who lived with my aunt, whose husband was also inducted into the Ukraine, they lived in a small house, not too far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s516">And in this particular raid, their house was hit.</span> <span id="s517">We didn’t know this, but my father, after the raid was over, went – was worried and went over to see what happened.</span> <span id="s518">And it turned out that they were in the basement, and except for my aunt, who got hit by something in the face, and bleeding, the grandparents were okay, and there was also a cousin.</span> <span id="s519">So all – all of them were brought, my mother, my father brought them over.</span> <span id="s520">And my aunt was bleeding.</span> <span id="s521">Her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s522">And in our building, there was a doctor.</span> <span id="s523">And he was visiting – actually was not living there, but he visited his sister and his mother, who lived there.</span> <span id="s524">They were ethnic Germans, and he was an – an SS officer.</span> <span id="s525">And I don’t know how and why so naively my father and mother went over to him, and asked him to help, give first aid help to my – to my aunt.</span> <span id="s526">So, rather naively my father went down to ask this SS doctor to help my aunt.</span> <span id="s527">I was there with him, and – with my aunt.</span> <span id="s528">And this man – I never forget his expression, he had very light blue eyes, and the amount of hatred which – which came out, was incredible and indescribable.</span> <span id="s529">What he said, I’d never forget, he says, you dirty Jews, you think I will help you?</span> <span id="s530">He says, you will – you will die just your brothers and sisters did, very soon.</span> <span id="s531">And then took and slammed the door in front of our faces.</span> <span id="s532">And I was completely flabbergasted, and I was surprised and shocked by this.</span> <span id="s533">We knew his mother and his sister for years.</span> <span id="s534">They lived – they were just a couple of – lived a – lived just a couple of doors away from where we were.</span> <span id="s535">They were never very friendly people, but I – we never realized that, you know, how much of a Nazi they were and he was.</span> <span id="s536">In fact, one of the interesting side – not interesting, tragic, I should say, was that he also at that time – I found out later on that he was bragging that he himself killed 20 Jews.</span> <span id="s537">He was one of the Nazi doctors who did experiments apparently, in the camps.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t know what happened to him after the war.</span> <span id="s539">I know that his mother and his sister survived and stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I – I wish I could tell you the names.</span> <span id="s542">I – I – I – I wrote down the names, but I don’t have it in my head.</span> <span id="s543">It starts with an H. A-As – if I remember, I – I’ll – I’ll let you know later.</span> <span id="s544">But that was right before my father was taken away in – in the middle of April.</span> <span id="s545">Once my father was taken, and as I mentioned, we were in a – in a panic every day because they had pages and pages of new regulations and orders, which in – which affected us.</span> <span id="s546">What we have to – what we cannot use, what we have to give in, and then finally, when we heard these rumors about what happened to the – the Jews in the provinces – you know, these were just slight rumors, and then we got – but we were very busy then, because we – we got the order that we have to vacate our apartment, and we have to move into these special Jewish houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Can we just back up a little bit?</span> <span id="s548">Do you think your parents ever considered getting, as some people tried to do, getting a baptismal certificate?</span> <span id="s549">Do you think they ever thought about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Well, I know that my father never thought of it.</span> <span id="s551">My mother, in April heard that if you get a baptismal certificate, you may be exempt from something, and she talked to my father about it, and my father said, well, go ahead if you want to do it; I am not going to do it.</span> <span id="s552">And I remember that she and I went a couple of times, maybe twice, to a convent not too far from where we lived, where we had these – they call them white sisters.</span> <span id="s553">White sisters’ convent.</span> <span id="s554">And they were giving a group of Jews lessons about the catechism.</span> <span id="s555">And we went, I think, maybe twice, and then my mother saw the futility of it, and she said no, forget it.</span> <span id="s556">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Did it bother you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: It – it didn’t bother me to do it.</span> <span id="s559">I didn’t understand the catechism at all.</span> <span id="s560">I couldn’t understand what – it was like Chinese to me.</span> <span id="s561">But – but the – the sisters were kind, and it was – if it were something which would really help, I would say why – why not to do it?</span> <span id="s562">I mean, a lot of people did it.</span> <span id="s563">It turned out that – that conversions did not help at all.</span> <span id="s564">My – my uncle, who was converted because he believed in Catholicism, by the Primate of Hungary in the early 30s, and who went to church every Sunday, was inducted as a Jew, because both his parents were Jewish and he was Jewish and his conversion was too late, and the only difference between him and my father was that he wore a white armband while my father wore a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s565">And – but he got the same treatment, in fact worse, and he ended up in Auschwitz and he was gassed.</span> <span id="s566">So we knew that – that conversions were, at that point, ineffective, but when in – when you are in a situation like this, you try anything and everything you can.</span> <span id="s567">But it always struck me and it always stayed with me, that despite of the fact that my father was – I don’t think he had gone into a synagogue a half a dozen times in his last 20 years of his life, he still would refuse to do this, and that he was very much of a – a – a Jew.</span> <span id="s568">But he allowed us to, if he wanted to, they gave us this – this – this choice.</span> <span id="s569">So, what happened to us then, May came, and we got the – the order that we have to move.</span> <span id="s570">And we moved in June, toward the end of June.</span> <span id="s571">We were not allowed to take any furniture with us, only beds, and only the most crucial clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s574">This is tape two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: It was June 17 when –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: – 1944 when we had the, essentially the deadline to move.</span> <span id="s578">And my grandmother, myself and my mother moved in – in with my grandmother’s younger sister, who lived about two or three blocks away.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How did you get the order?</span> <span id="s580">How did they notify you?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Well, they – they – they notified by – via newspaper, essentially everybody – the newspapers came out, as I mentioned, with many, many orders every day.</span> <span id="s582">And repeated deadlines, you know, when you have to move out and what houses are available and so forth.</span> <span id="s583">So it was av – a lot of bureaucratic – but very fast.</span> <span id="s584">I mean, the time the deadlines were days instead of weeks or months.</span> <span id="s585">And it was quite lucky for us that we had, in this apartment house where we moved to, we had several relatives living there, on Columbus Street.</span> <span id="s586">We lived in Elizabeth Street, which was a main street.</span> <span id="s587">Columbus Street was like a side street.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did you take anything special with you from your own apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes, I – I took some toys; not very many, because there was just no room for that, because we moved into a two room place.</span> <span id="s590">The si – the three of us occupied one room, and my grandmother’s sister, her daughter, and the – and her daughter’s brother occupied another room.</span> <span id="s591">And then we had a meet – or ev – or almost every apartment had a maid room – maid’s room over the kitchen.</span> <span id="s592">And they took a single woman there, so she was the seventh person living in a two room place.</span> <span id="s593">And the only thing we could take is a – is essentially our beds.</span> <span id="s594">And I remember, the room was not that ver – large, and it was wall to wall beds.</span> <span id="s595">We had nowhere to eat, or we had to sit on a sofa bed to eat, essentially.</span> <span id="s596">And this was the – as I said, the 17th of June, and we heard rumors that things are happening in the countryside.</span> <span id="s597">We did not know precisely what.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Were these houses marked in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: They were – they had the large yellow star, as if to tell people that this – this is a building where, you know, Jews live, or lepers live, whatever you want.</span> <span id="s600">There was one apartment which was occupied by a Christian family.</span> <span id="s601">The man was the super of the apartment, his name was Mr. Vargo(ph), Janus(ph) Vargo(ph).</span> <span id="s602">He was a decent fellow, and as you will hear, the – his actions were quite crucial in saving our lives; both my grandmothers and the relatives there, and my mother’s and mine.</span> <span id="s603">We settled in, essentially in the last week of June.</span> <span id="s604">There were a few young people, I was the youngest kid, there were no kids.</span> <span id="s605">There were a few teenagers, mostly older people.</span> <span id="s606">And almost daily, toward the end of June, we started to have to go down to the air raid shelter, because of air raids.</span> <span id="s607">I remember one particular day very vividly, and that was July the second, 1944; it was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s608">And even before, I was always worried about air raids, because evas – ever since the April air raid, ever since my aunt was hurt, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s609">And I remember once Mr. Vargo(ph) [indecipherable] was on the second of July, he – after everybody was ordered to the air raid shelter, he took me upstairs to the – just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those airplanes are.</span> <span id="s610">And they were, I mean, indeed, huge airplanes coming in, hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s611">And I – I can never forget the – the tremendous number.</span> <span id="s612">I mean, they almost covered the sky.</span> <span id="s613">And we were out there maybe one or two minutes, and then I said no, I don’t want to stay there, I want to go downstairs.</span> <span id="s614">So we did.</span> <span id="s615">And we sat there very quietly for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden we heard this tremendous crash.</span> <span id="s616">At first is a whistling sound, a crash and the whole building shook up.</span> <span id="s617">And I started to scream and everybody else did too, and my mother sort of put my – my head against her – her bosom and trying to put her hands again – in my – on my ears so that I wouldn’t hear this.</span> <span id="s618">And a few minutes later another, even larger sound, and it was like an earthquake.</span> <span id="s619">And we saw – we had these blast do – doors leading to the outside, and – and it’s – this – this is a very heavy steel door.</span> <span id="s620">And along the door you see this brilliant light coming in.</span> <span id="s621">Of course, by then the electricity was gone, and we were sitting in the pitch dark.</span> <span id="s622">And – and this – this was like – like hell.</span> <span id="s623">And it went on for three hours, and we had four more very close hits, and we didn’t think that we were going to survive, and then we did.</span> <span id="s624">And after three hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible.</span> <span id="s625">We had – this building was a three story apartment building.</span> <span id="s626">It was sort of stood by itself.</span> <span id="s627">About a hundred yards behind it, there was a six story apartment building, which was hit.</span> <span id="s628">And the only thing – and it was a Jewish house, with the same yellow star like we did.</span> <span id="s629">The only thing which stayed up there was one fire wall, and everything was down on – in a big heap, and people were dead.</span> <span id="s630">Across the street there was a villa, a private home, before the raid.</span> <span id="s631">Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the – crater in the – on the – on the – on the earth, and you could see body parts.</span> <span id="s632">You could see hands and legs and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s633">And this – the right side had four tennis courts, nothing but a big crater.</span> <span id="s634">And the left side was a – just a vacant lot, and a crater.</span> <span id="s635">So essentially, within a hundred yards of the building, we had four huge bombs hit.</span> <span id="s636">And I could almost feel even today this – this smell of – of – of death there and – and – and everything was smoking, and it was blackened, and purple, the sky was purple.</span> <span id="s637">And some people were optimists.</span> <span id="s638">I – I just can’t believe that people said well, maybe this is the end.</span> <span id="s639">Maybe – maybe this was used as a – as a camouflage to – to drop paratroopers here, and maybe the Brits and the Americans are here, and we will be coming – we’ll be freed.</span> <span id="s640">And of course, that was not the case at all.</span> <span id="s641">What was the real story was that it was the first carpet bombing of Budapest, and 30 percent of the city went – was in ruins, and the Jews were blamed for it.</span> <span id="s642">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: How are the Jews blamed for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, the propaganda, I mean, the – the radios were blaring that it was a Jewish conspiracy, that Jews left their lights on their buildings to show where the – where the city was, because of course we had blackouts at – at night.</span> <span id="s645">Well, blackou – and – and of course, if you were caught with any kind of light seeping through, that was a punishable – death punishable offense.</span> <span id="s646">And when – we were very careful looking around all the time, to make sure that there is no light, because we were accused of – of spying, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Was this the first time you had seen dead bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: It was.</span> <span id="s649">Actually, these kind of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s650">There was one dead body I saw a few days before this.</span> <span id="s651">And this happened because there was a pharmacist who lived in our building and who poisoned himself, he committed suicide, and I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: This was a Jewish pharmacist?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Jewish pharmacist who lived there, and I saw him being taken away in a stretcher and he was – his hands were – I didn’t see his face because it was turned, but his hands were yellow and were sort of hanging down from the stretcher.</span> <span id="s654">And that was the first dead body.</span> <span id="s655">But the number of dead bodies after this raid, they were – they were really huge.</span> <span id="s656">And the first time that I saw this kind of – it’s not just dead, I mean, they were bloody.</span> <span id="s657">It was – was – was – was like hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: How does a 10 year old process something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Well, I was absolutely frightened.</span> <span id="s660">After this, every t-two – twice a day, all regular like clockwork, at 11 o’clock in the morning, the – the westerns allies came, and then nine o’clock at night the Russians came in bombing raids.</span> <span id="s661">And every time this happened, my mother had a huge pillow, which she put on my head.</span> <span id="s662">And to show you how traumatic it was, it took 30 years for me to be able to sleep without a pillow over my head.</span> <span id="s663">And – and it was – it was an absolute trauma.</span> <span id="s664">I mean, I – I – even today, if I hear some unexpected large noise, loud noise, I would jump.</span> <span id="s665">We did not know it at the time, that besides the air raid, we had an even deadlier situation developing in Budapest.</span> <span id="s666">What had happened is 3,000 gendarmes came out – came up to Budapest two days before, in process, or in – in the process of wanting us to be deported.</span> <span id="s667">In other words, by this – by the first of July, most of the Hungarian Jews from the countryside were deported.</span> <span id="s668">The only community alive was Budapest.</span> <span id="s669">My 150 relatives were largely dead by then.</span> <span id="s670">We did not know this, but what had happened is the extreme Nazis wanted to commit a coup, and get rid of Horthy.</span> <span id="s671">And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for deportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy.</span> <span id="s672">And there was only just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who were ready to follow orders.</span> <span id="s673">And one single army unit, a Panzer division was willing to come to Budapest to counteract this – not necessarily the deportation of the Jews, but the – the coup against the region.</span> <span id="s674">And by the second of July, they were around Budapest, taking up positions.</span> <span id="s675">By the seventh of July, they forced these gendarmes to leave.</span> <span id="s676">And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations would stop.</span> <span id="s677">And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we would be deported in probably a week, or two weeks.</span> <span id="s678">I mean, in six weeks, almost 500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the countryside.</span> <span id="s679">You can imagine that 160 to 180,000 Jews in – in Budapest, were concentrated, could be deported in a matter of days.</span> <span id="s680">But we were not.</span> <span id="s681">And that saved our lives.</span> <span id="s682">What happened after this was a – a little miracle.</span> <span id="s683">Eichmann left.</span> <span id="s684">He was frustrated by this inaction by the Hungarian government.</span> <span id="s685">And he also knew that things were not going well in the front.</span> <span id="s686">What we didn’t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, is that the Hungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and even with the Russians.</span> <span id="s687">And these negotiations, essentially, they wanted to manifest this – their good will.</span> <span id="s688">So the way they did it is they essentially replaced the government with a – a government of army officers, who were not as extreme.</span> <span id="s689">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you ever see Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: I did not personally see Eichmann, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Did you ever see Horthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I have seen Horthy, yes, when I was a kid, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What did he appear to you to be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, he was a handsome old man.</span> <span id="s696">He was – he was an [indecipherable] but he was a – a horseman, and he – he rode the white horse.</span> <span id="s697">And we had a national holiday on the 20th of August, which was a holiday for the first king of Hungary, Saint Steven.</span> <span id="s698">And what I remember about – maybe I was six or seven when my father took me to this day – the – the Saint Steven’s day on the 20th of August was a great holiday, because his right hand was, as a miracle, was preserved.</span> <span id="s699">Now, this man died a thousand years ago, and his right hand was the icon of Hungary, and they took this right hand and – and they took it all around the city, you know, there’s a whole procession.</span> <span id="s700">And Horthy used to ride the horse, also.</span> <span id="s701">And I remember this procession in the late 30s, when this had happened.</span> <span id="s702">And I saw him once after that.</span> <span id="s703">In 1938, if I remember, there was a huge, Catholic congress in Budapest, where the pope came, and – or at least the man who became pope later, Pius the 12th.</span> <span id="s704">And he spoke and Horthy was with him and I saw – I remember that I saw – this was a huge thing.</span> <span id="s705">He was not just a Catholic thing, he was everybody’s thing, and I saw Horthy that time again, the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Was he a hero to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: He was not a hero to me, but he was not a villain, either.</span> <span id="s708">We knew that he had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s709">We knew that his best poker partner was a Jewish industrialist my – by name of Goldberger(ph) and Weiss(ph).</span> <span id="s710">And his wife was connected to – there was a rumor that his wife had Jewish blood in her.</span> <span id="s711">And that – we knew that his older son, married to a – a countess who was very much pro-Jew.</span> <span id="s712">In fact, it turned out that – that she was working for the – the – the anti-Nazi resistance.</span> <span id="s713">And she’s still alive.</span> <span id="s714">She’s a very old lady now.</span> <span id="s715">And we knew that – that Horthy, if he was not pro-Jewish, he had friends, and he was not the worst.</span> <span id="s716">He was not a hero, but he – as I said, he was not a villain either.</span> <span id="s717">So going back to my story, we did not know, but we were saved.</span> <span id="s718">After Horthy changed the government, things started to be a little easier.</span> <span id="s719">Up until then, we only had like one or two hours where we could go out to the street.</span> <span id="s720">We were – we had a – given a couple of more hours of freedom, free time to go to the street, to shop, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: What did you do inside the apartment when you couldn’t go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Well, I was a lonely child, I – I didn’t have people to play with, so I played with my toys, and I was with the relatives.</span> <span id="s723">They played cards, and I sort of sat next to my mother, and they had a – a game which they played every – a day, which was a sort of a superstition.</span> <span id="s724">I – I don’t know if this game exists here, I guess it does.</span> <span id="s725">There is a [indecipherable] like a – a [indecipherable] with alphabets, with – with various ABC and so forth.</span> <span id="s726">And what they do is they put a – an upside-down – a turned water glass, and they put their hands on and then supposedly a ghost comes and then pushes the glass and then spells out things and tells you your answers, you know, and most of the questions were, are we going to have an air raid tonight, you know, and of course we didn’t need to know the answer, we knew that it was coming.</span> <span id="s727">But, you know, some people believed this, and we played that every day.</span> <span id="s728">That was a – a – a game we played.</span> <span id="s729">And we also, as I said, we played various – various games, word games, and I was sort of tolerated by the adults.</span> <span id="s730">And I was trying to be a fly on the wall most of the time, and didn’t do too much.</span> <span id="s731">Wasn’t very happy and wasn’t very active.</span> <span id="s732">I was reading a lot actually, I had a few books and I was reading.</span> <span id="s733">I – I was – my favorite author was Jules Verne, and since I was all [indecipherable] up, I was reading about “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” and Five Weeks in the A-Air – Air Balloon, and things like that.</span> <span id="s734">I – I was always interested in – in adventures, and it was certainly an ironic time to read about those adventures.</span> <span id="s735">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s736">And the summer went relatively fast, and – and it was lucky, because my father’s unit was brought back from the western parts of Hungary, where they built fortifications to Budapest.</span> <span id="s737">And my father was lucky because his commander was a decent man again.</span> <span id="s738">Turned out that his – the commander’s fiancée was Jewish, and she lived in our building.</span> <span id="s739">And the commander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of disappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning.</span> <span id="s740">This was strictly illegal.</span> <span id="s741">If a man was caught, he – under the circumstances, he would be subject to immediate execution.</span> <span id="s742">Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took this chance and came home late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him in.</span> <span id="s743">Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred pengős for this act, but nevertheless, he took a chance too.</span> <span id="s744">My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the morning.</span> <span id="s745">So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time.</span> <span id="s746">And again, the eternal optimist said well, it couldn’t last long.</span> <span id="s747">The Russians were already fighting.</span> <span id="s748">We knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and – and they know – we also knew that, you know, the war couldn’t last for more than a week or two.</span> <span id="s749">I mean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from Budapest at this point.</span> <span id="s750">So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and very important day.</span> <span id="s751">That was the day when Horthy declared that Hungary was becoming a neutral country, and that Hungary essentially threw in the towel.</span> <span id="s752">Well, I can tell you that it was unreal for us.</span> <span id="s753">We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went out, and we ra – ripped al – our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical.</span> <span id="s754">But the people around us were yelling down from their windows that we are just a little bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy.</span> <span id="s755">And they said, well, you dirty Jews, don’t think that you will survive.</span> <span id="s756">And indeed, they were more prophetic that we realized, because in a couple of hours, the – this – this coup was over.</span> <span id="s757">In fact, with German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s758">The ar – the Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s759">And we heard Mr. Vargo’s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his doors so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for Barakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to Budapest immediately to assume the – the – the command of the – the troops.</span> <span id="s760">And we heard by the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szálasi became the head of the state and a new government was sworn in.</span> <span id="s761">And this was the 15th.</span> <span id="s762">Ten days later, all the women between the ages of – Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40 were ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field.</span> <span id="s763">And this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old, and Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 – 10 – 10 and a half.</span> <span id="s764">And my mother was 43, so she was too old to go, but they did.</span> <span id="s765">And 10,000 young women went.</span> <span id="s766">The women who had children were excused, and Yoli(ph) left, but Elizabeth didn’t.</span> <span id="s767">She was too tired, she was just – she said, I – I – I just give up.</span> <span id="s768">And the – she was one of the ones who were deported.</span> <span id="s769">At that time they had no transportation except to walk.</span> <span id="s770">They had these death marches.</span> <span id="s771">And she made the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told us.</span> <span id="s772">She got to Ravensbrück, and she died a few days before liberation.</span> <span id="s773">She was 29.</span> <span id="s774">Her baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a wife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick.</span> <span id="s775">Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to the Ukraine in 1941.</span> <span id="s776">He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports person.</span> <span id="s777">And he walked the 800 miles.</span> <span id="s778">He just got back in March of 1944, just in time for the next round.</span> <span id="s779">And he was to be deported in September, but he didn’t wait for that, he took his rucksack, left it and went home, where his wife, in an efficiency apartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months.</span> <span id="s780">And she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived.</span> <span id="s781">My father came home in the beginning of November, with the news that he got the 24 hours furlough, and that he is going – he wa – if he is going back next mon – next day in the morning, he is to go to the railroad station, and he knows that he was going to be taken to Germany, and he was not about to go back.</span> <span id="s782">He had a friend, and they had a plan.</span> <span id="s783">The plan was that they were going to my grandfather’s abandoned building, which was in ruins, but the basement was in fairly good shape.</span> <span id="s784">And they knew the war was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just stick it out there.</span> <span id="s785">And my father left, and we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s786">This was the sixth of November.</span> <span id="s787">We didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s788">On the 22nd of November, a – an army man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don’t see an army soldier coming to a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s789">And he came in and he wanted to talk to my mother and he handed her a note.</span> <span id="s790">And the note said that – was a one sentence that said, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take you.</span> <span id="s791">Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn’t want to leave my grandmother and everybody.</span> <span id="s792">And – and – or the – the message was not to tell anybody anything.</span> <span id="s793">And so we went, but my mother didn’t take anything except me with her.</span> <span id="s794">And we went to this place, which was a factory building on the other side of town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called Chango(ph) Street.</span> <span id="s795">And it was a factory, a textile factory.</span> <span id="s796">And the soldier took us there and we met my father.</span> <span id="s797">It turned out that this factory was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of Jews, Jewish men, hidden.</span> <span id="s798">The outs – for the outside world this factory was a factory for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms.</span> <span id="s799">My father was quite mad at us when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately, and come the very same evening, come hell or high water.</span> <span id="s800">So my mother saw when – when – when she saw – when she saw that he was mad, we went home.</span> <span id="s801">We got back and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before curfew.</span> <span id="s802">And she threw in a couple of – she – the thing which she was most worried about were the family photos.</span> <span id="s803">And she threw in a f – the family photos in a small bag, which I still have.</span> <span id="s804">And she also put a little food in, and nothing else.</span> <span id="s805">While we were in the midst of this desperate packing, the house was raided by two teenage Nazis.</span> <span id="s806">And they came in, one must not been – I don’t think one was more than 13 and the other one maybe 16 - 17.</span> <span id="s807">They had submachine guns with them.</span> <span id="s808">And they went and they rampaged the whole place.</span> <span id="s809">They – they broke things, they stole things, they made a mess.</span> <span id="s810">They saw these little thing which my mother put together, this little bag, and threw it on the floor and stomped on it, and they terrorized everybody for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s811">And then they finally left.</span> <span id="s812">And this was after the curfew.</span> <span id="s813">So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out.</span> <span id="s814">Again, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went.</span> <span id="s815">And we got there – this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a short day, just like today.</span> <span id="s816">And by six o’clock or so, it was quite late la – quite dark.</span> <span id="s817">We got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got there, because we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s818">So he told us that he went to this rendezvous place with his friend, his name was Gargutzi(ph).</span> <span id="s819">And Gargutzi(ph) never showed up.</span> <span id="s820">He was caught in a raid, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s821">So my father was in a panic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian business associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s822">Well Gaykis(ph) told him that he would be happy to help.</span> <span id="s823">He gave him this address, it’s Changutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note.</span> <span id="s824">Told him to – not to talk to anybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army – factory.</span> <span id="s825">My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and – and the soldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he was let in, and the army commander went to see him.</span> <span id="s826">The army commander turned out to be a Jew who was a friend of my father’s, and who was playing this role.</span> <span id="s827">He was a spit and polished army – army commander uniform.</span> <span id="s828">And he told my father that 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there.</span> <span id="s829">They are all men, and he is welcome.</span> <span id="s830">And this was in the beginning of November.</span> <span id="s831">Toward the middle of November, the man who heard the news – they were much better informed, of course, than us, that things are happening throughout town, they knew about the deportation of the women.</span> <span id="s832">They started to bring their families in.</span> <span id="s833">So my father also took this – sent a soldier who was a deserter – a real, bona fide soldier, but a deserter, to the note – with the note to my mother, and that’s how we got there.</span> <span id="s834">Well, my mother didn’t bring anything and so my father’s overcoat served for the next three months as our blanket.</span> <span id="s835">We did not know what had happened, but this is what happened, the very next day: the Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took everybody from the building where we lived, to the brickyards.</span> <span id="s836">And at that point, Mr. Vargo(ph), who knew of a brother, my grandmothers had a – two sisters and a brother in Budapest.</span> <span id="s837">And a brother lived in a Swedish house, Swedish –</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Safe house.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: A safe house, correct, safe house, which was a – was saved by Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s840">And Mr. Vargo(ph) ran to this man, by the name of Beyla(ph) Kornhaus – Beyla Spitzer(ph), and tell him that – told him that his three sisters were in the brick factories.</span> <span id="s841">And Spitzer was able to get in touch with Wallenberg, who went and took the three ladies, and one lady’s daughter with her – with him, and took – took – took these four people to the safe house.</span> <span id="s842">The other ones were deported, and – by foot, and none of them came back.</span> <span id="s843">We would be among those who were deported, and who would have been, of course, the victims.</span> <span id="s844">This we found out later, after the war.</span> <span id="s845">In the place where we now were in the factory, we had about 120 - 130 people.</span> <span id="s846">They had a bunch of kids, young women and in a few days we found out that there was a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they were Jews.</span> <span id="s847">And they had a – a group of five or six people who went to the deportation trains and to the roads, to snatch some people back.</span> <span id="s848">They had papers, wi – which were forgeries, which said that such and such people would have to be brought back to headquarters because they wanted to interrogate them.</span> <span id="s849">And this way they brought in more than 50 people back from the road, who were already to certain death, mostly – mostly young women, and some young men, but mostly women.</span> <span id="s850">And so in the next week or so, the number of people went to about 170.</span> <span id="s851">We had about 22 kids, some of them were younger than I, and it was a – a great camaraderie.</span> <span id="s852">I mean, since – since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven’t been with kids.</span> <span id="s853">And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this – this factory had a bunch of machines, big textile machines and we were av – able to explore these, and a few of us were curious, particularly one fellow.</span> <span id="s854">His name was Foti(ph).</span> <span id="s855">Foti(ph) Yonchee(ph) and John Foti(ph).</span> <span id="s856">And he was my age, and he – we went on, and we played with these machines and it was just a lot of adventure.</span> <span id="s857">We also found that there was a garage, or sort of a shed, which had a – a lot of hay.</span> <span id="s858">And the hay was important because attached to the factory, there was a horse, and a – and a lorry.</span> <span id="s859">Horse and a lorry.</span> <span id="s860">And the hay was, of course, his food, horse’s food.</span> <span id="s861">But what we found out, which was very interesting and uk – unexpected is that one of the young men who was in this resistance told us that under the hay there was a car, a personnel motorcar, which they use to rescue people.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s864">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Okay, so what we found out is that under the hay was this car, and they gave us the permission to go into the car, and it was, of course, very exciting.</span> <span id="s866">This – this car was an early Škoda, model 1930s.</span> <span id="s867">And at that time, in order to start the car, you had a piece of – a steel rod you had to put in in the front and make it, you know, move it around.</span> <span id="s868">But these people told us, and I am sure this was a fib, that in fact – in fact that’s thing was not a part of the starter, but it was a machine gun built into the car, and that this would be used in case something happens here.</span> <span id="s869">And we believed that, it was a good – good fib, and it was certainly an interesting story.</span> <span id="s870">Unfortunately the reality was a little less interesting.</span> <span id="s871">What had happened is that on the second of December, we heard a – a very powerful knock on the door, and there were only f – a few seconds before we heard running steps.</span> <span id="s872">We – our – our rooms were on the second floor, second story of this place.</span> <span id="s873">It was really camouflaged as work rooms, but by the time we reached this number of people, there was not enough room to sleep on the floor, so they build these multiple – actually three story –</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Bunks, I guess you can call them.</span> <span id="s876">And they brought the hay from downstairs and we – we slept on the hay and we used the army uniforms, we had several hundred of those, as blankets and pillows, whatever.</span> <span id="s877">And we were in a middle bunk, and I remember the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Did you ba – did you stay with the children, or did you sleep with the children, or with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: No, I slept with my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s880">The families stayed together.</span> <span id="s881">Underneath there was another family with a little girl I remember, her name was Onchee(ph).</span> <span id="s882">She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she made her grandpa – Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push his buttons.</span> <span id="s883">And it was hilarious, I mean, it was really funny.</span> <span id="s884">Very close by, there was a young lady, young woman.</span> <span id="s885">Her name was Cotto(ph) Ferhier(ph).</span> <span id="s886">And she was a – she was married, she was 22 years old, and we got very good friends.</span> <span id="s887">She – she was patient enough with me and I talked to her about my stories I read and all these things, and I was 10 going on 30, and we really became very good friends and my mother and father didn’t mind that at all, because of course, they didn’t have to babysit me.</span> <span id="s888">And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another fellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph).</span> <span id="s889">And Bondi(ph) was one of the – the refugees there, the – the one who was able to escape from deportation.</span> <span id="s890">And Bondi(ph) one day, and this was the very end of November, I think the 30th, got very, very sick.</span> <span id="s891">And he got high fever and he was delirious.</span> <span id="s892">And the committee who ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s893">If they bring in somebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 – 69 people, and if they don’t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two.</span> <span id="s894">Well, they decided the next day, when Bondi’s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to bring somebody in.</span> <span id="s895">And – and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection.</span> <span id="s896">And in a day or so, he got better.</span> <span id="s897">The date is very important, this was the first of December.</span> <span id="s898">In the morning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to scramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and yelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to – to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi state police.</span> <span id="s899">This was the gest – the Hungarian Gestapo.</span> <span id="s900">And they sorted out the men to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought that this was the end.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, there was just no way.</span> <span id="s902">Within the few seconds of confusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building.</span> <span id="s903">It was like six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a – a – a glass door – glass enclosure.</span> <span id="s904">And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he got into the haystack.</span> <span id="s905">And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s906">But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be the end.</span> <span id="s907">But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the detectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the following startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection.</span> <span id="s908">And we just couldn’t figure out what happened.</span> <span id="s909">There was only one arrest which they made, and that was a na – a man by the name of Kormus(ph).</span> <span id="s910">Kormus(ph) was the – the leader of the group.</span> <span id="s911">Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer.</span> <span id="s912">I didn’t know much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what – who he was.</span> <span id="s913">They took him and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there, because there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding.</span> <span id="s914">So in other words, they bribed these detectives.</span> <span id="s915">And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but they left us behind.</span> <span id="s916">After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they – they tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the only one.</span> <span id="s917">In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran.</span> <span id="s918">They knew of three, our place, and another two.</span> <span id="s919">And what happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed.</span> <span id="s920">We thought that the doctor did – betrayed us, it was not the doctor.</span> <span id="s921">It was a man by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for months.</span> <span id="s922">And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn’t get enough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph).</span> <span id="s923">He knew of three places Kormus(ph) could have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of the fourth place.</span> <span id="s924">So when he – when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three of the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place.</span> <span id="s925">But the fourth place they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s926">The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with 350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there.</span> <span id="s927">But they, the slave laborers were armed, and they had a mission there.</span> <span id="s928">They were armed, and their mission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest.</span> <span id="s929">The paper said – they were all in army uniforms – their paper said that they would be the last one to stay, to blow up these utilities, the gas – gas company, the – the wa – the waterworks and so forth, and the electric company.</span> <span id="s930">That was the paper which said, but the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities.</span> <span id="s931">And every day they were trained like soldiers.</span> <span id="s932">Every night on the other hand, they we – they had a little factory underneath and they forged papers.</span> <span id="s933">And they worked with the Zionists and they worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head.</span> <span id="s934">So Kormus(ph) – they – they knew Kormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him.</span> <span id="s935">He did not speak, and because he didn’t show up for two days, they knew in the fourth place, that things were bad, so they left.</span> <span id="s936">They – they – they – they couldn’t accomplish their mission, but they were all safe, they were able to escape.</span> <span id="s937">And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to death, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape.</span> <span id="s938">He was very sick because of the fact that he – they tortured him, but he escaped.</span> <span id="s939">He was able to hide, and he survived the war.</span> <span id="s940">The other two places which were raided, were not as lucky as we were.</span> <span id="s941">They had not many rich people there and they were deported.</span> <span id="s942">One was deported on foot to – to Germany, and they all died.</span> <span id="s943">And the second part was taken to political headquarters, and they – they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was able to escape.</span> <span id="s944">The rest of them were shot into the Danube.</span> <span id="s945">So our group was essentially the – out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s946">After this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22 children were not safe, so they decided to take us from – ranging from age of six months to 11 years, I was among the oldest.</span> <span id="s947">And one lady who – who had the six months old son, I think, they took us to a – a Red Cross building which was in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s948">We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross building.</span> <span id="s949">And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there and we would be okay.</span> <span id="s950">That was the theory.</span> <span id="s951">The practice was that when we got there, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half a dozen adults.</span> <span id="s952">I didn’t like the place at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: When you said this was a – another protected building, protected by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: By the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross building, okay?</span> <span id="s955">They were the – they had about 30 buildings throughout town, which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like the Swedish buildings, this – but this was not within that enclosure, you know.</span> <span id="s956">There was a – what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the Swedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32 buildings.</span> <span id="s957">This was in a part of town, and they were all concentrated.</span> <span id="s958">That’s where my grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were.</span> <span id="s959">The Red Cross buildings were throughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected.</span> <span id="s960">Not very well, as you will hear in a minute.</span> <span id="s961">But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they were concentrating children there.</span> <span id="s962">Now, the idea was that there were adults who would supervise these children, they would bring hoo – food and everything.</span> <span id="s963">Well, the – that was the theory.</span> <span id="s964">The practice was that the building was almost empty.</span> <span id="s965">I was put in with a friend of mine, into a room where we had about 35 children of my age.</span> <span id="s966">No furniture, we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no food for the day.</span> <span id="s967">Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of mine from school there, who was there with his sister.</span> <span id="s968">I knew him, his name is Mike Vairmas(ph).</span> <span id="s969">He now lives here in this country.</span> <span id="s970">And he was telling me that he wa – he just came in a few days earlier and they are thinking about leaving the building, escaping, because they haven’t gotten any food there since they came.</span> <span id="s971">So, a young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying I was hungry and I was lonely for my mother.</span> <span id="s972">This young girl has a boyfre – had a boyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than happy to take me back.</span> <span id="s973">Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew that I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a – take me back to where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us.</span> <span id="s974">So John Foti(ph) and I decided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off.</span> <span id="s975">And the building was locked from the inside, so we couldn’t just walk out.</span> <span id="s976">And the next morning when the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to take us out so that we could buy some food.</span> <span id="s977">And as she took us out, we ran away from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Wasn’t that a very brave decision?</span> <span id="s979">You’re 11 years – 10 years old, to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: It was a brave decision, but it – we had no choice, because if we went back, the Nazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the other people were hiding.</span> <span id="s981">I didn’t want to take that chance.</span> <span id="s982">The chance was that they would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of course we didn’t wear our – our yellow star.</span> <span id="s983">That was the chance I had to take.</span> <span id="s984">It took us a couple of hours to – to get back.</span> <span id="s985">We were sort of ducking various little groups of Nazis who were patrolling the streets.</span> <span id="s986">We bought a newspaper, which we pretended to read.</span> <span id="s987">We took a number of streetcars to go, and we knew where – where the place was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there.</span> <span id="s988">My mother couldn’t believe that I did come back and we came back.</span> <span id="s989">We were the only two kids who – who did come back.</span> <span id="s990">After the war I found out that about three days later, the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube and they shot them.</span> <span id="s991">And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so earlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died.</span> <span id="s992">So here we were, this was, I think maybe the 10th of December.</span> <span id="s993">A few days after this, two policemen showed up in our building and told us that the detectives sent out – sent them to let us know that we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the area, and they are about to report this suspicious building and people.</span> <span id="s994">And that they da – they suggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s995">The ghetto in Budapest was established at the very end of November.</span> <span id="s996">And the people who were still in the – the yellow stone – yellow starred houses were taken to the – to the places.</span> <span id="s997">Now, many of the yellow starred houses were raided, and many of the people already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what – what was, there were – Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.</span> <span id="s998">And so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in Budapest into a small ghetto in the middle of town, which was the – used to be the Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s999">And then they would do something.</span> <span id="s1000">And so, on the 14th of December, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they would go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing else was said.</span> <span id="s1001">Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1002">The rest sort of evaporated along the way.</span> <span id="s1003">My father decided that we have nowhere to hide, so we went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1004">The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor section of town, the Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s1005">The center of it was a square, Klauzál square, and in that square, or one part of the square was a market.</span> <span id="s1006">They took us to the market, where the Nazis – a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us that, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they find anything, they’ll shoot us.</span> <span id="s1007">There was a dead body to sh – to prove the point.</span> <span id="s1008">And we didn’t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the – the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people.</span> <span id="s1009">Of the 63 of us who got there, we were separated into several groups.</span> <span id="s1010">The group which my father and I – my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people.</span> <span id="s1011">We were just taken to the other side of the square, is Klauzál square seven, a three story old building.</span> <span id="s1012">Turned out that this building housed a – the remnants of a old age home, old age Jewish home, brought in, and the first two stories – floors, were quite chock full of people, but the third story was empty.</span> <span id="s1013">So they gave us two rooms there, and it was dirty and no food.</span> <span id="s1014">And I remember that after – the day after we arrived, my father, who was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread, which must have been six months old.</span> <span id="s1015">And bugs were jumping all over the place out of it, but he said, that’s okay, because we’ll toast it and then we can eat it.</span> <span id="s1016">That’s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we ate a piece of it.</span> <span id="s1017">That was the food for that particular day.</span> <span id="s1018">People were not very choosy at that point.</span> <span id="s1019">My father also went around to see what – what was the situation in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1020">The ghetto was – th-the area originally was an area for about 12,000 people.</span> <span id="s1021">By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there, and at its peak they had 70,000 people.</span> <span id="s1022">So you can imagine that there were not – there was not much room around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Did you feel older than your age by that time, because of what you had been going through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Absolutely yeah.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn’t feel like a kid at all.</span> <span id="s1026">I mean, all these things age – age people pretty rapidly, and – and I remember that, you know, walking around with my mother on the – on the streets and seeing people in – in terrible physical and mental condition, and dirty and broken down, and it was – it was very depressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did you feel any responsibility for your mother or your father, or did you feel that they were still taking care of you?</span> <span id="s1028">Had the – was it still a parent-child relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: It was still a parent-child relationship, essentially, yes.</span> <span id="s1030">And my father was not a part of – you know, he was a take charge person, he was not a person who would – who would break down.</span> <span id="s1031">In – in fact, you know, he was my hero, because he was very brave man, as you will hear what happened there.</span> <span id="s1032">What he did is he looked around for possibilities, and one possibility was to join the ghetto police.</span> <span id="s1033">Now, the ghetto police in Budapest was a very different from the ghetto police in Warsaw or Lódz or any of these other places.</span> <span id="s1034">This is now the middle of December in 1944.</span> <span id="s1035">The Russians are completely surrounding this place.</span> <span id="s1036">The ghetto police’s mission is different.</span> <span id="s1037">The ghetto police’s mission, ridiculous as it may sound, was a defensive mission.</span> <span id="s1038">They’re supposed to persuade or – or – or fight off the Nazis coming into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1039">And the means for that was a nightstick and a – and a Swiss beret and a – a armband, a white armband which says ghetto police in three different languages; Hungarian, German and Russian [indecipherable] languages.</span> <span id="s1040">And he had an I.D. card saying he was ghetto police.</span> <span id="s1041">Well, one of his lucky strokes was that he found, in the basement of the building where we stayed, a hardhat.</span> <span id="s1042">These – you know, what – what the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Construction workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Construction workers wear.</span> <span id="s1045">Actually, the firefighters.</span> <span id="s1046">And he always wo-wore that.</span> <span id="s1047">That saved his life more than once.</span> <span id="s1048">And the reason why he want to – or wanted to join the ghetto police force was that the ghetto police had double rations, and he wanted to bring the ration home.</span> <span id="s1049">The policeman’s life were very difficult.</span> <span id="s1050">They were on patrol 12 - 14 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1051">And as I said, their mission was – their main mission was to try to fight off the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1052">Well, you don’t fight off people with machine guns when they come in, and of course, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1053">Many of them died because of that.</span> <span id="s1054">They tried to be polite to the Nazis, who simply let a – a slug of – a slug into them.</span> <span id="s1055">There – a few days after we moved in, at night, we heard this tremendous noise and a huge crash.</span> <span id="s1056">We found out that the shell, an artillery shell was shot into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1057">We don’t know who shot it, but it landed in the next room from where we were, and the people who were there, died.</span> <span id="s1058">And it was a wall away from where we were, where my father, mother and I were.</span> <span id="s1059">I got hysterical and I said, I’m not staying up here, and my mother and I and Cotto(ph), who was with us, the – the young lady who we met in Chango(ph), the three of us moved down to the basement.</span> <span id="s1060">The basement was very deep.</span> <span id="s1061">It used to be the shop of wood maker and it was covered with wood saw, and we just slept there.</span> <span id="s1062">They had a couple of workbenches there and I never moved out of that place after that happened.</span> <span id="s1063">I never needed to move out because in about two days, the – which was Christmas day, the siege of Budapest began, and everybody moved on.</span> <span id="s1064">The food supply was catastrophic.</span> <span id="s1065">We had people who were old – and I mean old – battle hardened Hungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnants of the people who were taken out in 1941.</span> <span id="s1066">About a half a dozen of them ended up in our building.</span> <span id="s1067">A number of them were very religious Jews, and they were Hassids and they were praying all day long.</span> <span id="s1068">A number of them were not too religious, but none of them were willing to risk their lives at that point to bring food.</span> <span id="s1069">There were food available about a block or a block and a half from where we lived, but somebody had to go there and get it.</span> <span id="s1070">My father always volunteered, but he was not enough just by himself, and a few people went and some got hurt.</span> <span id="s1071">And so our food supply, because of this, was very precarious.</span> <span id="s1072">People knew that the war couldn’t la – end up – I mean, how long could you live like this?</span> <span id="s1073">There was no water, there was no electricity, gas, nothing.</span> <span id="s1074">What we had was about 200 people in a small basement, which had no electricity, with a couple of slit windows eight feet high or nine feet high, and a couple of cans of floor wax.</span> <span id="s1075">I remember that I contributed one of my shoelaces as wicks and we put – put it in the can and that was the – the light which 200 people had.</span> <span id="s1076">My father – I haven’t s – you know, I – after the siege begun, my father was mostly out, he – he didn’t come home very often.</span> <span id="s1077">One time I remember when he came in, he came in only for – for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1078">He came in with the good news that he found his own parents in the ghetto, and his parents were in reasonably good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: What were the sanitary conditions like in the basement in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Well, the sanitary conditions were – were horrible.</span> <span id="s1081">What they had to do was to dig a – a latrine in the middle of the room.</span> <span id="s1082">And they had some old bed sheets, and they got a couple of pieces of wood and you know, you sort of leaned against it when you had to do your thing.</span> <span id="s1083">But the stench was unbearable.</span> <span id="s1084">And then, because we were very close together, people started to have lice, and because we were close proximity, everybody got it.</span> <span id="s1085">And the way we – we lived there, we – we raided the bil – the upper part of the building and got the – the doors out and put the doors down and the people essentially slept on the doors.</span> <span id="s1086">We still had my father’s overcoat, who would have really needed it in his forays in – outside, but he didn’t have it because we were using it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: How did you keep yourself clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: We didn’t, we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1089">There was some little water, but it was negligible, and most people just gave up on it.</span> <span id="s1090">And you know, for the last two weeks, two or three weeks, it was just nominal washing.</span> <span id="s1091">Some people tried to do it.</span> <span id="s1092">Interestingly enough, the – the more well educated were the ones who sort of gave up; the least well educated ones, who tried to keep their – their cleanliness.</span> <span id="s1093">And it was a – it was an interesting Darwinian selection.</span> <span id="s1094">One of the things which happened is that old people died.</span> <span id="s1095">They starved to death and we found them in the morning.</span> <span id="s1096">And in a lull of fighting, a few men volunteered to bring them out of the building, and threw them on a pile of dead bodies which were piling up in the middle of the square.</span> <span id="s1097">I went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Was it – was it easier for you by then to see dead bodies, since you had seen so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, it wasn’t easier.</span> <span id="s1100">I think it – it – it – it never was – was easier for me.</span> <span id="s1101">I – I knew that those people were alive a day before, and I knew them, I spoke to them, some of them.</span> <span id="s1102">I could never take this for granted.</span> <span id="s1103">And I remember once when I – when the lull in the fighting sort of persisted for an hour, I came out and I looked out and I saw this – this hill of bodies.</span> <span id="s1104">And I knew that if something will not happen very soon, we would all e-end up there.</span> <span id="s1105">I did not – did not think that any one of us would survive.</span> <span id="s1106">And then January came, and we were all lethargic, we were sort of sitting there, weak.</span> <span id="s1107">And tha – at that point there was very few who had any spark left.</span> <span id="s1108">And on the fourth of January, a group of about 30 or 35 young ladies, young women were brought in.</span> <span id="s1109">Turned out that they were from Wallenberg’s houses.</span> <span id="s1110">Wallenberg was very concerned that he could not really protect people any more at that point, and he decided that many of the people who were still alive there – his houses were raided by the Nazis – he decided –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: What di – what did you – what had you heard about Raoul Wallenberg previous to this date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1113">This was the first time that I heard of his name, from these people who came from his house.</span> <span id="s1114">I-I – most of the things which I knew about him, I learned after the World War.</span> <span id="s1115">I knew that Raoul Wallenberg was trying to save people, and it wasn’t just Wallenberg incidentally, but other people in organizations.</span> <span id="s1116">We knew about the Swedes, we knew about the Swiss.</span> <span id="s1117">We had, for example what they call schutz passes, safe passages.</span> <span id="s1118">The – they had forgeries by the hundreds of thousands.</span> <span id="s1119">Everybody had a couple of them in the pockets.</span> <span id="s1120">We didn’t know whether they were real or forged.</span> <span id="s1121">At that point, sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Did your family have any schutz passes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah, we had – we had schutz passes.</span> <span id="s1124">My mother had them, I had, my father had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: How – how did they get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: I – I guess at that point, they were given.</span> <span id="s1127">They were given away by Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1128">I sa – I’m sad to say that some of the – the Jews did not give them away for nothing, they – they made money on it.</span> <span id="s1129">We were – we didn’t have very much money, we never had Swedish passports, which was expensive.</span> <span id="s1130">So we had the Swiss, which was cheap, or nothing.</span> <span id="s1131">But it wasn’t – it really didn’t matter most of the time.</span> <span id="s1132">I mean, most of the Nazis really didn’t look at the paper, they – they threw away.</span> <span id="s1133">But sometimes you never knew whether it had or not.</span> <span id="s1134">So – for some people it had sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Did you ever have to show yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: We never had to show ours.</span> <span id="s1137">We had it in our pocket, but we never had to show ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Did your parents try to get into one of those safe houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No.</span> <span id="s1140">As I mentioned to you, our – our – our story was that my f – my mother and I stayed in the – in the re – in the yellow star house until we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1141">And the only people who went into the safe houses were my grandparents – my – my grandmother actually, and my grandmother’s sisters who, through the good offices of Raoul Wallenberg were able to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: I meant, did they try to get into any of the safe houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No, they did not, no.</span> <span id="s1144">Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1145">Remember, there was very little communication between people at this point, there were no telephones.</span> <span id="s1146">Each house, each yellow star house was sort of an island.</span> <span id="s1147">We did not know what happened to fair – friends, relatives, anybody.</span> <span id="s1148">And we did not know what was going on in the outside world.</span> <span id="s1149">So at this point, this was the first time we knew about, or I f-found out about safe houses.</span> <span id="s1150">I found out that these safe houses were no longer safe, and these people were brought in.</span> <span id="s1151">They were better fed than we were, but they were very frightened.</span> <span id="s1152">And we squeezed them in as everybody – at that point it was not that much of a squeeze because most of the older people died already.</span> <span id="s1153">So this was the case.</span> <span id="s1154">Tenth of January rolled around, and we were even weaker.</span> <span id="s1155">A young SS soldier came down.</span> <span id="s1156">He was surveying the building.</span> <span id="s1157">He told us that the whole ghetto is mined, that we will not survive, and just forget it.</span> <span id="s1158">They will not allow the Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s1159">The Russians were very close, but before the Russians would get there, they would blow them up – blow the ghetto up.</span> <span id="s1160">Turns out that – that the real plan was even more sinister.</span> <span id="s1161">I do not know whether the – this – this was really a fake story or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s1164">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: The – the real plan was more sinister than the one which the soldier disclosed to us, namely that they would blow up the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1166">The real plan was to massacre us on – for the 16th of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 SS, a couple of hundred Hungarian police.</span> <span id="s1167">The number of Hungarian Nazis would come in with submachine guns, and would line us up essentially, and – and mow us down.</span> <span id="s1168">It turned – turned out that fortunately, Wallenberg found out about it on the 15th, and he sent a message to the SS general.</span> <span id="s1169">His name was Schmidhuber, that if this happens, he would personally guarantee that Schmidhuber would be hung.</span> <span id="s1170">Apparently Schmidhuber was a middle-aged man and he was now concerned about his own welfare.</span> <span id="s1171">And he called – called this action off.</span> <span id="s1172">That obviously saved the people, my life, my father’s, mother’s, my relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1173">This was on the 15th - 16th.</span> <span id="s1174">There was one little girl in our building, her name was Alice.</span> <span id="s1175">She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid.</span> <span id="s1176">She was not very alive.</span> <span id="s1177">She had a mother, and a grandmother.</span> <span id="s1178">The mother was diabetic, and the grandmother was also.</span> <span id="s1179">And she came sometimes to play with me, but I didn’t like her that much.</span> <span id="s1180">This day, on the 17th, she came not just to my mother, but to everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who – who was in a diabetic shock.</span> <span id="s1181">We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a pound of sugar.</span> <span id="s1182">As I mentioned earlier, when we left our house, our home, the Jewish re – yellow star home to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with us.</span> <span id="s1183">This food was shepherded along since November, now it’s January.</span> <span id="s1184">The la – the – the – a month of food which is left in that little bag is fa – is a half a pound of sugar.</span> <span id="s1185">My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes would save my life if – if it all comes down to that.</span> <span id="s1186">So my mother refused to give Alice any food.</span> <span id="s1187">This was the 17th.</span> <span id="s1188">On the 18th of January in the morning – on the evening of the 17, my father came home and he decided to stay home.</span> <span id="s1189">On the 18th there was a strange quiet.</span> <span id="s1190">We didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1191">It wasn’t as quiet for – for weeks.</span> <span id="s1192">I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we didn’t know how much was left over of that city.</span> <span id="s1193">And all of a sudden it was – was strange.</span> <span id="s1194">So somebody climbed up to that slit window, about nine feet about the – the floor of the basement and saw some strange boots.</span> <span id="s1195">They were not Nazi boots, they were Russian boots, and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1196">There was no elation.</span> <span id="s1197">We vid – we really even didn’t say anything to each other.</span> <span id="s1198">It was fear that the Nazis would come back.</span> <span id="s1199">Was indecision what to do next.</span> <span id="s1200">The one thing we found out is that Alice’s mother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the next 47 years of her life.</span> <span id="s1201">Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her son, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn’t know, and her own son, and there was really no choice in the matter.</span> <span id="s1202">She felt still guilty til the day – day of her death.</span> <span id="s1203">I remember that some of the younger people evaporated first.</span> <span id="s1204">They didn’t ask, they didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1205">We didn’t know what happened to the people whom we knew.</span> <span id="s1206">My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it’s time for us to leave.</span> <span id="s1207">Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we had, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family’s pictures, they couldn’t carry.</span> <span id="s1208">I was the one who carried them, I was the – the strongest one.</span> <span id="s1209">My father, who was 43 years old, looked like 70.</span> <span id="s1210">And in his two or three weeks of patrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s1211">And then he – we started to walk out of the ghetto, that was not – not an easy walk.</span> <span id="s1212">There were very few walkways there, half of the buildings were on the street.</span> <span id="s1213">We heard the shrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads.</span> <span id="s1214">The artillery fire was going on, the – the siege of Budapest was still going on.</span> <span id="s1215">It took us three hours to get home, and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our home from which we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944.</span> <span id="s1216">We went back, it took us three hours, two and a half miles.</span> <span id="s1217">We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many dead horses, and one live Russian.</span> <span id="s1218">Which was almost ludicrous because this man was singing.</span> <span id="s1219">He was singing, he wa – must have been drunk, but he – he had a happy face, he was smiling and singing.</span> <span id="s1220">And we looked at him as if he were crazy, instead of the world.</span> <span id="s1221">Maybe he was the ones – the only sane people in that – person in that whole – whole mad, maddening scene.</span> <span id="s1222">And as we were walking, these shrapnels were hitting buildings, and whole walls came down, tumbling in front of us.</span> <span id="s1223">I mean, we were in mortal danger, we – we were crazy to walk there, but we did.</span> <span id="s1224">And we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1225">I mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it.</span> <span id="s1226">My father couldn’t lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1227">That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month.</span> <span id="s1228">It was – was a square loaf of bread, I remember.</span> <span id="s1229">And they just let us go.</span> <span id="s1230">And we stumbled home, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got there.</span> <span id="s1231">And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph).</span> <span id="s1232">Mr. Dudek(ph) was the man who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for years, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June, and which he gave back to us.</span> <span id="s1233">I remember the suitcase was a green suitcase, it was a canvas, but it was full of canned food.</span> <span id="s1234">He didn’t take any.</span> <span id="s1235">But the rest of the people who lived there were rather frightened.</span> <span id="s1236">They looked at us as if we were ghosts.</span> <span id="s1237">Not just because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious.</span> <span id="s1238">Here these Jews came back.</span> <span id="s1239">Now what will happen?</span> <span id="s1240">There were – we knew about those extreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was – who was boasting about his adventures with the Hassidic Jews whose – whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled with – with pork.</span> <span id="s1241">And some others, who were no less guilty.</span> <span id="s1242">They thought they will – that we were going to denounce them to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1243">We were too tired, too sick to – too nothing to – to do anything.</span> <span id="s1244">The miracle which happened to us was that a few hours later my – my maternal grandmother came home.</span> <span id="s1245">Turned out that she was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1246">And revenge was the furthest from our minds.</span> <span id="s1247">My grandmother was born in what is now Slovakia, so she spoke the language.</span> <span id="s1248">Russian troops came down, everybody was frightened of them.</span> <span id="s1249">We found out that they came a few days earlier, raped a few women.</span> <span id="s1250">But my grandmother spoke their language and they were very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1251">And I remember that Mr. Dudek(ph) made room for us, and on the evening of the 18th of January, we s – we went to sleep in another basement, in another part of town, and the siege of Budapest was still on.</span> <span id="s1252">In fact, it was still on for more than a month, because Buda was still defended by the Nazis for a month after Pest was liberated.</span> <span id="s1253">The life came back slowly.</span> <span id="s1254">The first thing we tried to do is to get some food somewhere.</span> <span id="s1255">My father found a rucksack somewhere and went out and scrounged for frozen potatoes, whatever.</span> <span id="s1256">We had this suitcase full of food, which helped a great deal for the next few weeks.</span> <span id="s1257">But of course it doesn’t – you know, I mean, we were – my father was like 90 pounds, my mother was like that too and my grandmother too, and so we really needed to eat something.</span> <span id="s1258">There was very little food.</span> <span id="s1259">There were no utilities.</span> <span id="s1260">Water came about because we were the fru – we had the ice, you know, in the – in the yard and we cut it up and boiled it – boiled it with water, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: What was your physical condition like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: My physical condition was the best of the three of us, cause if there was food, I ate it.</span> <span id="s1263">I was weak, but maybe not as weak as my mother and father.</span> <span id="s1264">And I probably bounced back in a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1265">We lived in the basement there, and we were trying to find some other arrangements.</span> <span id="s1266">As the end of February rolled around and Buda was liberated, people were free to move back up.</span> <span id="s1267">Our old apartment was occupied; they gave it to another family.</span> <span id="s1268">But the apartment next door, which was the apartment of the Surka’s(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and whose two daughters I used to play with, they went to the west, they left, and their apartment was empty.</span> <span id="s1269">So Mr. Dudek(ph), the super, suggested that we would go and occupy that place.</span> <span id="s1270">At that point it was like catcher’s catch can.</span> <span id="s1271">A number of apartments were also burned out by shells.</span> <span id="s1272">That particular apartment was in fairly good shape, so we went up and we occupied it.</span> <span id="s1273">Many months later, the Surkas came back.</span> <span id="s1274">There was a law by that time that if somebody occupied an apartment for more than a certain number of months, they were the owners of it.</span> <span id="s1275">So the Surkas(ph) couldn’t have a claim.</span> <span id="s1276">They were a sad lot when they came back and I felt very sorry.</span> <span id="s1277">The yo – the older daughter died.</span> <span id="s1278">They went to the west.</span> <span id="s1279">The father was a soldier, they got liberated and they came back, and then they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1280">I don’t know whether they left Hungary or not, but at that time – this was in May or June of 1945, and that was the last time I saw them.</span> <span id="s1281">Our next door neighbors who lived in number five, they stayed and – and most of the neighbors who – who – whom we knew before the war, stayed there.</span> <span id="s1282">There were some new neighbors, some people left, but all in all, we had about 20 apartments in this apartment house, about 15 of them were familiar faces.</span> <span id="s1283">So what happened next?</span> <span id="s1284">In March, the schools opened, and my mother and father and I decided that I’m going to go to the Jewish high school.</span> <span id="s1285">It opened in the – what used to be the rabbinic seminary, the old building which was in Aboni(ph) Street was not given back at that point.</span> <span id="s1286">And people somehow, and I don’t know how, they got the news that it – school’s garin – going to be open, life is going to start again.</span> <span id="s1287">In the beginning, in March, there were no streetcars, so it was like an hour and a half walk each way.</span> <span id="s1288">My mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Was the school in – in Pest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: In Pest.</span> <span id="s1291">In the middle of Pest.</span> <span id="s1292">We lived in Zugló, which is sort of outside.</span> <span id="s1293">Say was about a good three miles, three and a half miles from where the school was.</span> <span id="s1294">So every morning we got up fairly early, and my mother and I – my mother took my hand and we walked to the school.</span> <span id="s1295">And every – and then she waited for me in front, and then when it – school was ended, she took me back, we had the same walk.</span> <span id="s1296">And my mother became such a familiar face that the – the teachers all knew her and they invited her and then sort of she said – there were some mothers, not all of them were like that.</span> <span id="s1297">But some of the mothers whose sons were all – whose – this was a Jewish gymnasium for boys, boys’ gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1298">We had a girls’ gymnasium also, but this was the boys’ gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1299">And so we started out fairly large, we had about 72 students in my class, two [indecipherable] classes.</span> <span id="s1300">I was happy to see some friendly fa – and – faces from the elementary school.</span> <span id="s1301">But we found out, very sadly, that the – the orphans did not survive.</span> <span id="s1302">What happened to the orphans, one day they – they raided this orphanage and took out those orphans who were my classmates, 10 of them, with the teacher and took them to the Danube and they shot them.</span> <span id="s1303">So they didn’t – they didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1304">But many of our classmates who were in elementary school did, and – and we saw them – I saw them in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1305">It was very primitive in the beginning, we didn’t have anything, it was just an empty school building.</span> <span id="s1306">And the educ – and th – and many of the teachers didn’t come back from deportation, or from school yet.</span> <span id="s1307">They sort of trickled back throughout that – from March to June.</span> <span id="s1308">That was a very truncated year.</span> <span id="s1309">It was supposed to start, of course, in September of ’44, end in June of ’45.</span> <span id="s1310">Well, it never started, but it ended in June of ’45 anyway.</span> <span id="s1311">And by then, the streetcars started to run, and by then life started to trickle back.</span> <span id="s1312">We got a telegram in early June, I believe, from America, from the United States, from my uncle, the one who wanted to adopt me, telling us that they found us through the Red Cross somehow, and that they’ll happy that we are survive – that we survived, and th-that he and his wife had a son who was born in 1944, and they are fine and happy and we should write to them, and we did.</span> <span id="s1313">And we started corresponding and this – they sen – they said they would send us papers.</span> <span id="s1314">But my father decided against it.</span> <span id="s1315">He felt that Hungary is going to be a good country now.</span> <span id="s1316">And indeed, after the war there were some possibilities.</span> <span id="s1317">My father restarted his business.</span> <span id="s1318">It looked like there was going to be a democracy.</span> <span id="s1319">People were – were having some hope.</span> <span id="s1320">Many of the surviving Jews decided to join the communist party, my father and mother joined the social democrats.</span> <span id="s1321">And some of the people were out for revenge.</span> <span id="s1322">Many of them decided to join the political police and they were after the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1323">Kormus(ph), for example survived, became a head of a people’s court, and as such, his mission was to put away as many Nazis as possible.</span> <span id="s1324">And he accomplished it.</span> <span id="s1325">My father was not that kind, and my mother was neither, and we sort of tried to reconstruct whatever we could.</span> <span id="s1326">We looked around the neighborhood, we found that some of our furniture was not do – too far from where it originated from, and we got it back from the neighbors.</span> <span id="s1327">And we just tried to rebuild our lives, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: By that time, when you had gotten your strength back and had food and so forth and school had started, by then did you feel free, and feel liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: In a sense, yes.</span> <span id="s1330">I think it took me a long time to really feel liberated.</span> <span id="s1331">Probably 1946.</span> <span id="s1332">I remember 1945, and I remember the first of May of 1945, which was a huge demonstration by the social democrats and the communists.</span> <span id="s1333">And I remember the struggle, the political struggles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: You – you mean a May Day celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: May Day celebration and the political struggles for power.</span> <span id="s1336">I now also knew that most of the communist leaders who came back from Moscow were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1337">Rocco Shagerra(ph), Farkosh(ph).</span> <span id="s1338">And most of the Jews were not unsympathetic.</span> <span id="s1339">Some of them were.</span> <span id="s1340">Obviously the – the ones who were rich before, saw that the communists are not going to retain them as – as capitalists again.</span> <span id="s1341">But my family was never really rich.</span> <span id="s1342">My father was a – an engineer, he figured he would be able to do business, he would be able to find a job, and we were not very worried.</span> <span id="s1343">In fact, in 1945, Dudek(ph) – my father was able to reward Dudek(ph) and Dudek(ph) not only saved some of our food, but he also saved some of my father’s material, you know, ma – business, and so my father gave him half of it, and they started out a business, a little business right in the building.</span> <span id="s1344">Dudek(ph) was not a good businessman, so he – he didn’t do very well, but my father was, and – and he started to deal with the same people he dealt with du – before the war.</span> <span id="s1345">And it was a good time.</span> <span id="s1346">I mean, inflation was there for sure, but there were possibilities.</span> <span id="s1347">And these possibilities ended in 1947.</span> <span id="s1348">What were the possibilities?</span> <span id="s1349">Well, one was, you know, we were Jewish and the Joint from the United States had sent food and things, clothing.</span> <span id="s1350">I remember in 19 – I believe it was the summer of ’46, and I went to a camp which was run by the Joint and Zionists.</span> <span id="s1351">And I was not a Zionist myself.</span> <span id="s1352">We had a lot of Zionists in our – in our school, and many of the teachers were Zionists, and they had socialist Zionists, such as the Hashomer Hatzair, and then they had Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1353">And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some animosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who were of various persuasions.</span> <span id="s1354">I remember a particular teacher who didn’t like Orthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and – and things like that, and I could never understand it.</span> <span id="s1355">After ’44, how could a Jew hit another Jew because the Jew wears a hat?</span> <span id="s1356">And there were some very passionate discussions about, you know, Hashomer Hatzair and Irgun and all these others.</span> <span id="s1357">And Betar and – and whoever else.</span> <span id="s1358">And some people who were orphans – many of my students – fellow students were orphans, moved into these Zionist camps, these little – they had houses.</span> <span id="s1359">And they lived like – like – they were told that they were like adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, they were adults, they could do anything they wanted to.</span> <span id="s1360">And I was fortunate enough to have my parents, and in a sense I was a little bit jealous that they could do anything and I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1361">I was still a son, and I was still a child.</span> <span id="s1362">And despite ’44, you know, I – in a sense I reverted back to childhood.</span> <span id="s1363">I couldn’t accompli – completely in a hundred percent, but – but largely, and I was expected to.</span> <span id="s1364">And I was expected to forget about all those things.</span> <span id="s1365">And it been – and it had been bothering me for a long time, you know, what do you remember, how could you remember, you were too young.</span> <span id="s1366">And the authenticity of these remembrances were always questioned, not by me, but by others.</span> <span id="s1367">But life went on and we were told, you know, that we shouldn’t dwell on the Holocaust, we shouldn’t dwell on this.</span> <span id="s1368">We shouldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: When you say we were told, you mean your parents told you that, or other people told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: My parents told me, but mostly other people, and the – and th – and the newspapers, and the – an-and the school, you know, now you have to learn, now you are back to school.</span> <span id="s1371">Now you worry about your homework, now you worry about your exams.</span> <span id="s1372">Now you do things.</span> <span id="s1373">You know, we joined first the Boy Scouts, and then when the Boy Scouts were disbanded, the Young Pioneers.</span> <span id="s1374">And there was always something to do.</span> <span id="s1375">There was some excitement too, I mean, how did we – how did we build – rebuild our lives?</span> <span id="s1376">What do we – what did we do?</span> <span id="s1377">How did we do it?</span> <span id="s1378">And as I mentioned, I was taken to one of these camps, Zionist camps, I was – we had four languages in the same time, and I was never a good linguistic expert.</span> <span id="s1379">We had Hebrew, Latin, English, and for a while German, but then that was dropped.</span> <span id="s1380">But three languages were more than enough for me, and I was not very good in either of those.</span> <span id="s1381">And the only way I could not flunk Hebrew is that the – I promised my Hebrew teacher that I was going to go to a Zionist camp.</span> <span id="s1382">And they took me and I was unhappy and I s – I escaped.</span> <span id="s1383">I escaped after about a week.</span> <span id="s1384">Went home, my father was very upset with me.</span> <span id="s1385">He felt that I was just a coward, that I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1386">I disagreed with him.</span> <span id="s1387">But these things were not for me, I was – I was too much of a mother’s boy still, and I was still with my mother.</span> <span id="s1388">I was only 12 years old, I mean, it’s not that I was – and this camp was not exactly what you would call a camp here, it was hard.</span> <span id="s1389">And we didn’t get that much food, and the food was mostly split pea soup, which reminded me of the ghetto, which was the only food there.</span> <span id="s1390">But I had friends, and I started to – to form relationships.</span> <span id="s1391">But I didn’t have too many friends of my own age.</span> <span id="s1392">The building we le – lived in had a – a number of young girls who were older than I was.</span> <span id="s1393">I was always attracted to young girls, and I was – these young girls were 16 - 17 - 18.</span> <span id="s1394">And I was more mature than my age and I started to have – sort of strike up conversations with them.</span> <span id="s1395">And I thought that I was enough of an intellectual challenge to – to talk to, to be talked to.</span> <span id="s1396">And our next door neighbor was a – her name was Miriam.</span> <span id="s1397">She was not Jewish, she was 16 and she was telling me about the facts of life, and there was another girl downstairs who was – she was – her – her name was Maurika(ph) and she was 18 and she was a very studious girl and we had nice, interesting conversation about – conversations about literature and art and music and things like that.</span> <span id="s1398">Of course, they all had their boyfriends, but I sort of fancied myself as being somehow a surroga – surrogate boyfriend and – and was there.</span> <span id="s1399">And so my – my – my life, my social life sort of started to evolve among these people, my neighbors.</span> <span id="s1400">And many of my friends, too.</span> <span id="s1401">And then I got involved in the Young Pioneers, and some other various organizations.</span> <span id="s1402">There was one organization, Young Workers.</span> <span id="s1403">They were usually three, four years older than I was, and they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1404">And once I got into a – a real fight with them, and they told me that I was just a dirty little Jew, and they chased me out and chased me to – through the streets.</span> <span id="s1405">And I – sort of it occurred to me that, my God, you know, these people are the same.</span> <span id="s1406">They are not – they are not different any more.</span> <span id="s1407">They are just the same.</span> <span id="s1408">They are still calling me dirty Jew two years after the war, and they are still chasing me down the street.</span> <span id="s1409">And then I had some doubts whether it was a good idea to stay in – in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1410">But these doubts were not, at this point were not very bad and very pronounced.</span> <span id="s1411">This was 1947.</span> <span id="s1412">We had a – an election and the communists came in distant fourth.</span> <span id="s1413">We still had a democratic government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: I had a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1416">My Bar Mitzvah was an interesting one.</span> <span id="s1417">It – in Budapest there were two orphanages, a girl orphanage and a boy orphanage.</span> <span id="s1418">The girl or-orphanage was very close to where we lived, so – and they had, of course, a shul.</span> <span id="s1419">And Rabbi Schwartz was the rabbi there, and he instructed me.</span> <span id="s1420">In 1947, I had the Bar Mitzvah there.</span> <span id="s1421">And my mother decided that I would have a Bar Mitzvah lunch, and well, what can you do with a lu – for a lunch, you know?</span> <span id="s1422">I invited the following people; there were a couple of communist kids in school, they were about three years older than I was, but they were friends.</span> <span id="s1423">And there was a fellow who was a friend of mine who was sort of a literary guy.</span> <span id="s1424">And then a few friends, contemporaries.</span> <span id="s1425">And I borrowed two girls from the orphanage, they came also.</span> <span id="s1426">And we had a very nice lunch, and the adults were in the other room.</span> <span id="s1427">That was my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1428">And I remember, I got a book, which I still have.</span> <span id="s1429">It’s in Hungarian, of course.</span> <span id="s1430">It’s about Jewish Middle Ages.</span> <span id="s1431">It’s about Spain, the Spanish Jewish Middle Ages.</span> <span id="s1432">And it was by Roth, Sir ce – Sir Cecile Roth, famous historian.</span> <span id="s1433">I didn’t read the book, it was way above my head at that time, but for some reason or another, I – I got it – my mother got it out of Hungary, and I found it many years later and I read it with much interest, and I still have it.</span> <span id="s1434">My Bar Mitzvah present.</span> <span id="s1435">And then a stupid thing happened.</span> <span id="s1436">A friend of mine was tackling me in school, right after my Bar Mitzvah and pushing me back and my shin broke.</span> <span id="s1437">And so, I missed about two weeks or three weeks of class.</span> <span id="s1438">I was in a cast for six weeks.</span> <span id="s1439">And after the cast my father and mother decided that I should go to a camp, a real camp.</span> <span id="s1440">And they send me to this camp, which was run by Jews.</span> <span id="s1441">Was run by a Olympic – Jewish Olympic wrestling champion by the name of Karpathi(ph), and it was called a Karpathi(ph) camp, it was a sports camp.</span> <span id="s1442">And most of the kids were Jewish and I had a great time there.</span> <span id="s1443">And it was three weeks.</span> <span id="s1444">I didn’t escape there – from there.</span> <span id="s1445">I learned how to bike again, because for some reason I forgot, and how to swim and how to do all those things; how to dance.</span> <span id="s1446">There was a girl there who was 18 years old and who was really the owner.</span> <span id="s1447">Karpathi(ph) was sort of the manager.</span> <span id="s1448">Kerienyi(ph), who was another wrestler, was the owner.</span> <span id="s1449">And Judith was her – his daughter, and she was up there, sort of helping out with the kids.</span> <span id="s1450">And I got very, very friendly with her, and we talked, and she was engaged to another wrestler, to be married.</span> <span id="s1451">And she figures in my later life, that’s why I’m telling you this.</span> <span id="s1452">Anyway, Judith and I became friends and even after the camp I saw her many times and then we lost in touch maybe a half a year or so later.</span> <span id="s1453">Five years passed by, and I met her again.</span> <span id="s1454">And I’m going to cut this story, because there will be some significance at that point.</span> <span id="s1455">But now we are still in 1947 – 1947 and 1948.</span> <span id="s1456">I had a happy education, particularly in one particular subject, which was history.</span> <span id="s1457">My homeroom teacher and my history teacher was one and the same, he was a young ma-man named Paul Poch(ph).</span> <span id="s1458">He turned out to be one of the great historians of Hungary, and he was very young man and he – one of his claim to fame was that he was also the director of the statistical survey run by the Joint, of the [indecipherable] remnants.</span> <span id="s1459">And you find a copy of the book in our library.</span> <span id="s1460">What they did is 400 people, in 1945, in August of ’45, went through every building of Budapest and found the [indecipherable] remnants of – of Jews in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1461">Found 68,000 of them.</span> <span id="s1462">There were – there were probably more, but many of them did not want to be registered.</span> <span id="s1463">My family and I were – my family’s name and my name were – are in the book.</span> <span id="s1464">Poch(ph) was the one who did it.</span> <span id="s1465">Besides that, he was a brilliant teacher and he was my homeroom teacher for four years, and I wanted to be a historian.</span> <span id="s1466">Poch(ph) left the school because he became a professor, a full professor at age 28 in the University of Budapest in the – the economic university of Budapest.</span> <span id="s1467">A few years later he became the – the dean, and a few years after that he became director.</span> <span id="s1468">Then he became a absolute world class historian.</span> <span id="s1469">The one thing which he did however, is that he completely changed his point of view, he became a Marxist economic historian.</span> <span id="s1470">And he wa – he became one of their authority.</span> <span id="s1471">And – but he was a humane person, and one of the interesting part was that one of the classes he taught in the Jewish high school, who graduated in 1948 - ’49, of that class, three men went to his – his faculty.</span> <span id="s1472">They became very famous historians.</span> <span id="s1473">One of them became the president of the Academy of Sciences, his name is Ivan Berendt.</span> <span id="s1474">He came to this country, he’s now a professor of history in UCLA, and Poch(ph) helped him and helped others.</span> <span id="s1475">Helped one man by the name of Rankey(ph), who became a – a – an authority on Hungarian Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s1478">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: I was saying that Rankey(ph) was not a communist.</span> <span id="s1480">He was – he became a Holocaust expert, historian.</span> <span id="s1481">And because of that his – his career during the communist ye-years was really jeopardized.</span> <span id="s1482">Poch(ph) helped him a great deal, and he helped others.</span> <span id="s1483">So although Poch became a communist, he was still a – a great human being and helped a great deal of – great many men and people in their – in their career.</span> <span id="s1484">So I must say that I am personally very thankful to him and grateful, because for one, he taught me the love of history, which is – which I wanted to become my – my profession.</span> <span id="s1485">Thankfully which did not become my profession, but a lifetime hobby.</span> <span id="s1486">1948, Poch(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the school.</span> <span id="s1487">Passover, Pesach, nine four – 1948.</span> <span id="s1488">We say goodbye to many of our friends who went to a camp, Zionist camp.</span> <span id="s1489">After Pesach, our s – our class of 38 became class of 13.</span> <span id="s1490">The rest of the people left.</span> <span id="s1491">We found that they went through the Bricha lea(ph) to Israel.</span> <span id="s1492">Many of them are still there.</span> <span id="s1493">And we stayed – I wasn’t a Zionist – with this small, shrinking class.</span> <span id="s1494">They combined the other class with us, which also shrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a class of roughly 30, a combined class of 30.</span> <span id="s1495">We had other teachers.</span> <span id="s1496">Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers stayed.</span> <span id="s1497">I became very interested in acting.</span> <span id="s1498">We had a little acting group in our school.</span> <span id="s1499">I became interested.</span> <span id="s1500">We had put on full three act plays.</span> <span id="s1501">My father became interested in this school.</span> <span id="s1502">He wanted to help the school.</span> <span id="s1503">He found out that the school, of course, lost most of its labs, and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a – a way to ask famous performers to come to the school for nothing, and have fundraisings.</span> <span id="s1504">And he became involved in many of these kinds of fundraisings.</span> <span id="s1505">And you would not believe the most famous singers came to sing; Jews and non-Jews alike, and they are always sold out performances, and my father was really a great enterprise [indecipherable] and – and got enough money to rebuild the physics and biological libr – labs.</span> <span id="s1506">And in 1950 or ’51, they dedicated a greenhouse on the top of the building which my father raised money for.</span> <span id="s1507">And so my father became the president, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved with the – on a student level.</span> <span id="s1508">And it was from ’48 to ’50 - ’52.</span> <span id="s1509">They were – despite of the fact that – that there were – th-there were terrors, and – and – and worsening political situation and crisis, there was an island there.</span> <span id="s1510">The school became a – a separate island, where we had a dicono – dichotomy where we shared both what we needed to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the great communist camp, and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this phraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the Voice of America saying, you know?</span> <span id="s1511">So it was a really funny, ironic situation.</span> <span id="s1512">The same people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of America.</span> <span id="s1513">And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist phraseology, which they didn’t believe in, who were Hebrew teachers before he beca – they became Marxist, quote unquote, teachers, who were teaching Yiddish instead of Russian, which they ended up teaching for a while, you know?</span> <span id="s1514">These teachers knew that this is a big joke, that nobody believes in this, but we pretended that something had to be done, and – and we did.</span> <span id="s1515">Except for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Di-Did the tightening of the government, or what you had to do, did that bring back any memories of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Well, it certainly did.</span> <span id="s1518">Of course, the – the tightening of the government, and the – the loss of rights brought back a lot of memories.</span> <span id="s1519">And people who were deported during the Holocaust, were deported again.</span> <span id="s1520">This time not because they were Jewish, but because they were capitalists, and capitalists couldn’t live in Budapest, so they took the – took away their – their homes and they deported them to the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Did that make you more nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: It absolutely did, but there was no choice in the matter now, of course, that the Iron Curtain was shut.</span> <span id="s1523">In 1948, after the Bricha, and very shortly thereafter when the communists took power, things were over.</span> <span id="s1524">And by then, of course, those of us who recognized too late, and too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we were there.</span> <span id="s1525">So what could you do, you know?</span> <span id="s1526">Well, what you could do was what we did, which is to go along outwardly, and go to the May celebrations and the November celebrations, and at the same time talk about BBC and Radio Free Europe and trying to keep each other in – in a Jewish era.</span> <span id="s1527">We were – we were still studying – not legally at this point – Jewish things, Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Did you feel more Jewish now than you had many years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1530">In the next – in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium meant that we were not studying, we were – we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1531">So we did.</span> <span id="s1532">That wasn’t a pleasant thing for me, I was never a synagogue goer.</span> <span id="s1533">But it made me want to know more Jewish history.</span> <span id="s1534">It made me much more of a conscious Jew.</span> <span id="s1535">And after the communist takeover, the synagogue was closed, we couldn’t – the – the – the synagogue of the – the gymnasium was closed, it was no longer there.</span> <span id="s1536">So – but – but we still had some spark, and – and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are Jewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me.</span> <span id="s1537">And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the school.</span> <span id="s1538">We knew that there were a few people who – who we could not, including teachers.</span> <span id="s1539">And this came to a head in 1950.</span> <span id="s1540">In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school, demanding of the government of nationalizing our school.</span> <span id="s1541">And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers.</span> <span id="s1542">And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te – a teacher-student-parent conference.</span> <span id="s1543">And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that – the principal of what was going on.</span> <span id="s1544">And this – all hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s1545">And I was there and I remember.</span> <span id="s1546">There was a parent of a classmate of mine whose – who told the students and the teacher, who did not want to identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are traitors.</span> <span id="s1547">And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1548">And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next school year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was – who – whom we found out was a – was a defector.</span> <span id="s1549">And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students.</span> <span id="s1550">But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed.</span> <span id="s1551">Our class of 30 became a class of 13.</span> <span id="s1552">This was our sixth grade, it was junior high school.</span> <span id="s1553">And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less.</span> <span id="s1554">We couldn’t talk about Jewish history.</span> <span id="s1555">We couldn’t talk about Jewish things.</span> <span id="s1556">But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph).</span> <span id="s1557">And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example.</span> <span id="s1558">An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a hole in the head.</span> <span id="s1559">I mean, he was always a – a lesson ahead of us, but that was it.</span> <span id="s1560">And – and we took this as a joke, inside.</span> <span id="s1561">But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going to come to an end.</span> <span id="s1562">And then what?</span> <span id="s1563">And that end came in 1952, when I graduated.</span> <span id="s1564">Now one of the motivations of the – all of my classmates who left, was that nobody’s going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1565">That was the motivation why they left.</span> <span id="s1566">It turned out very ironically, that out of the two – four – 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were accepted.</span> <span id="s1567">Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom.</span> <span id="s1568">Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise.</span> <span id="s1569">The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn’t even want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1570">I was accepted.</span> <span id="s1571">And here came the big shock.</span> <span id="s1572">The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university, Budapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200.</span> <span id="s1573">And we had this huge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women.</span> <span id="s1574">And I found myself in – very much in a minority.</span> <span id="s1575">This was the year where it made a difference who’s – who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications.</span> <span id="s1576">If your parents were businessmen, you wat – you were rejected.</span> <span id="s1577">My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a – what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure.</span> <span id="s1578">My father wasn’t a businessman by then, he worked for another company.</span> <span id="s1579">And so in – I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me.</span> <span id="s1580">The chemistry worked there.</span> <span id="s1581">Very quickly we found from each other – o-of each other, who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1582">Of the f – of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage.</span> <span id="s1583">And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn’t know from Adam.</span> <span id="s1584">We found us, each other and we drifted toward each other.</span> <span id="s1585">The way the school were – was divided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering – this was only mechanical engineering.</span> <span id="s1586">We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding, whatever else.</span> <span id="s1587">And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy – naval architecture, we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not.</span> <span id="s1588">And we were sort of drifting in and out.</span> <span id="s1589">I was – I was never really very friendly with these people because their culture, their – their interests were very different from me.</span> <span id="s1590">I felt sorry for them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with the material.</span> <span id="s1591">They didn’t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff.</span> <span id="s1592">I have to step back now because there is a – an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally.</span> <span id="s1593">And that – what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1594">This was right before graduation in February of 1952.</span> <span id="s1595">Fell in love with a young girl who didn’t understand my – my feelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated.</span> <span id="s1596">And I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick.</span> <span id="s1597">They thought I had mononucleosis and other diseases and I was in the hospital for a month.</span> <span id="s1598">And this was in February - March of ’52, just before graduation.</span> <span id="s1599">And my wa – mother and father were worried that I was going to se – lose that year.</span> <span id="s1600">But my colleagues were very nice and they brought me up to date very f – very fast.</span> <span id="s1601">Then April roll – rolled along, and walking on the street, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar.</span> <span id="s1602">Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a camp.</span> <span id="s1603">Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from college.</span> <span id="s1604">She became a singer, she never married.</span> <span id="s1605">Didn’t marry the – broke off with the fiancé, and she was single.</span> <span id="s1606">I was 18, she was 22 - 23.</span> <span id="s1607">And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before.</span> <span id="s1608">It became a very hot romance, not to my mother’s liking and my father’s liking, who felt that I should really learn and study.</span> <span id="s1609">The way it went in our school system is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam.</span> <span id="s1610">And it was almost like a PhD thing.</span> <span id="s1611">And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral.</span> <span id="s1612">And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions.</span> <span id="s1613">We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers.</span> <span id="s1614">Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can’t learn eight years of answers in two months.</span> <span id="s1615">You really had to learn some other things.</span> <span id="s1616">But at that point, you know, the – the summer was full blown and – and I was too interested in – in – in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study.</span> <span id="s1617">But I studied a little.</span> <span id="s1618">And – and it was just the hottest romance we had.</span> <span id="s1619">It was sort of crazy.</span> <span id="s1620">The – her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we took advantage of it.</span> <span id="s1621">And it was my real – first real romance.</span> <span id="s1622">I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1623">This was really a woman.</span> <span id="s1624">I didn’t know what – and she didn’t know how to handle it either.</span> <span id="s1625">Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18.</span> <span id="s1626">If I didn’t know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she – she should have known better.</span> <span id="s1627">Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn’t see eye to eye through this.</span> <span id="s1628">I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation.</span> <span id="s1629">My fa – my mother told me the same.</span> <span id="s1630">My father said absolutely not, I am – you are a minor.</span> <span id="s1631">In – in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I’m not giving your permission and that’s that.</span> <span id="s1632">Make the long story short, we didn’t marry and she had an abortion.</span> <span id="s1633">And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact.</span> <span id="s1634">And saying that, you know, she understands the – the pain and the sorrow.</span> <span id="s1635">But she has to understand that I am too young and I am just starting my – my schooling, and she should have known better.</span> <span id="s1636">And that romance stayed with me for a long time.</span> <span id="s1637">That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1638">It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children.</span> <span id="s1639">Nothing bad happened to her.</span> <span id="s1640">But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1641">And I went on to school, and I had this – and I had another girlfriend about a year later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was.</span> <span id="s1642">And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to ’56.</span> <span id="s1643">I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name.</span> <span id="s1644">And we had a tempestuous relationship.</span> <span id="s1645">But there was a – there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of – small circle of friends.</span> <span id="s1646">We still kept going to – to – to operas.</span> <span id="s1647">We went to theater.</span> <span id="s1648">We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they – they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide.</span> <span id="s1649">But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a – in a great degree.</span> <span id="s1650">Between 1952 and ’56, times were hard, and I was working very hard in – in school, trying to earn my college tuition, which I did.</span> <span id="s1651">We were not rich, and I really needed to work.</span> <span id="s1652">In the summertime, I did.</span> <span id="s1653">I went to – this was not my choice, I had to do work once – one month every summer, work – we got paid – in industry.</span> <span id="s1654">And one month every summer, we had to go to the – to the army.</span> <span id="s1655">And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s1656">Both – I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s1657">And that in is – in itself a story of itself, but I’m not going to go in there.</span> <span id="s1658">Fifty-six came around.</span> <span id="s1659">The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck.</span> <span id="s1660">My father all of a sudden got sick and died.</span> <span id="s1661">He got celebra – cerebral hemorrhage.</span> <span id="s1662">He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him.</span> <span id="s1663">This was at the end of March, right during my period of exams, final exams.</span> <span id="s1664">And I was very scared, and I didn’t know how to handle it.</span> <span id="s1665">I was 22.</span> <span id="s1666">I had a ver – a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud – he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a – an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought.</span> <span id="s1667">He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well.</span> <span id="s1668">He was a very, very close friend.</span> <span id="s1669">He sort of said look, I think you should pull together.</span> <span id="s1670">You should have a better – a bigger family.</span> <span id="s1671">You should really be not one – I mean you – my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died.</span> <span id="s1672">In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father.</span> <span id="s1673">And I drifted – the only person I had close was my mother.</span> <span id="s1674">I had a couple of cousins I wasn’t that friendly with.</span> <span id="s1675">My maternal grandmother died.</span> <span id="s1676">My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1677">I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them.</span> <span id="s1678">So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to.</span> <span id="s1679">And I was scared, so Erica’s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica.</span> <span id="s1680">And – and essentially I felt that maybe this is the time when – when I should have my own, and then I engaged – I became engaged to her.</span> <span id="s1681">And we had an engagement in August.</span> <span id="s1682">And we were planning to get married after I graduated from school, which was at the fall of 1956.</span> <span id="s1683">It was going to be in October of ’56.</span> <span id="s1684">And in fact, in October of ’56 – I just completed my last exam on the 22nd of October.</span> <span id="s1685">The 23rd of October became a notable day, but for me the 22nd was the – the real clincher.</span> <span id="s1686">There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o’clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an independent state and should declare neutrally – neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out.</span> <span id="s1687">And we agreed that on the 23rd in the morning, we would all come back to the university and we would have a – a demonstration.</span> <span id="s1688">Came October 23rd, I went to the university, we waited until late afternoon, we finally got permission for the demonstration.</span> <span id="s1689">I was there in Parliament Square, and then I went home and then the shooting war started.</span> <span id="s1690">I went back to the university about a week later, and I participated in some of the – the skirmishes which had happened there.</span> <span id="s1691">November second, the Russian tanks rumbled through our neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Wh-When you say you participated, what did that mean, in the skirmishes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Meaning I was shooting guns at whoever was shooting guns at us.</span> <span id="s1694">This was a shoot –</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: And you – you – you – you were shooting guns after seeing – being much younger in a war where you saw other people being shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Remember, this is a revolution against the Russians now.</span> <span id="s1697">I am now with the good guys.</span> <span id="s1698">I am – I am fighting for Hungarian independence.</span> <span id="s1699">I am just a graduate of a university.</span> <span id="s1700">I feel that maybe we have a chance, although some people think it’s ridiculous, and I find out a few days later that it is ridiculous, the world is not going to help us.</span> <span id="s1701">Second of November came.</span> <span id="s1702">The Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1703">I felt that it was futile, and at that point I wanted to stay alive, I d – I didn’t go out to shoot any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Ho – and seeing the Russians coming in in their tanks, did that trigger any memories for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: It did, it certainly did, th-the memory of that March Sunday, when the Germans – German tanks came in the very same route, toward the – the center of the city, and that – that memory also triggered that, you know, what is happening here is – is history repeating itself, or not.</span> <span id="s1706">But there was not very much time for thinking here, because there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a – a real fighting.</span> <span id="s1707">I mean, at that point we went – everybody from the building where we lived when down to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and ’45.</span> <span id="s1708">It was artillery duels.</span> <span id="s1709">And by November, by the 20th of November, the inside of the downtown was completely demolished again.</span> <span id="s1710">I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just like it did in 1945.</span> <span id="s1711">Twenty-second of November – oh, during this period of time, we are listening to radio free Europe and a voice of America.</span> <span id="s1712">And I was particularly appalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a bunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives, saying that they are already in Austria and they don’t know whether they are going to Australia or Canada yet.</span> <span id="s1713">And I’m sitting as – like a rat in a basement in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1714">And I, just to mys – I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes can I make?</span> <span id="s1715">I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes.</span> <span id="s1716">I’m not going to make the same.</span> <span id="s1717">So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fiancée and a friend, that in the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and then we’ll see what happens.</span> <span id="s1718">And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s1719">Said goodbye to my mother.</span> <span id="s1720">The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next morning we met at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1721">We had a vague plan, which is to go to a border town and then feel our way around.</span> <span id="s1722">We never got there.</span> <span id="s1723">After the – the – this is chaos now, there is no central government.</span> <span id="s1724">The Russians are occupying part of the country, not all of it.</span> <span id="s1725">There is still fighting going on in the countryside.</span> <span id="s1726">Railroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent.</span> <span id="s1727">People are doing their thing.</span> <span id="s1728">Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the country.</span> <span id="s1729">The train was completely packed, maybe a thousand people.</span> <span id="s1730">And shortly after we started, we found out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western border and get out.</span> <span id="s1731">We were told that it’s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed the maps away.</span> <span id="s1732">I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few other things.</span> <span id="s1733">Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who to bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1734">We had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: What’s it like to make decisions yourself?</span> <span id="s1736">Previously, in the war, it was your parents who made the decisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Well, it – I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions which saved my life, and I am not going to stay around.</span> <span id="s1738">I knew that some people knew that I was participating in the fighting.</span> <span id="s1739">I knew that the Russians are not going to be very merciful for those who were participating.</span> <span id="s1740">I could end up in jail, or worse.</span> <span id="s1741">So I didn’t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1742">I – I thought this was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me.</span> <span id="s1743">I had completed my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would – would pay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was.</span> <span id="s1744">To make the long story short, the train never reached the town where we went to.</span> <span id="s1745">It stopped in a smaller town, some 20 – 25 miles from the border.</span> <span id="s1746">We slept there, and the very next morning went to the station, we got into a cattle train.</span> <span id="s1747">The cattle train stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the border.</span> <span id="s1748">And I didn’t like the situation very much, because in the border there was some fighting at night.</span> <span id="s1749">So I told my fiancée and our – our friend to – we are moving back.</span> <span id="s1750">We moved back to a small village.</span> <span id="s1751">I met a – we met a fellow who told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way.</span> <span id="s1752">And we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to come out.</span> <span id="s1753">The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that between those two haystacks, if we stay between them it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1754">That haystack – beyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists, but in-between is okay.</span> <span id="s1755">And that’s what we did, we went in between.</span> <span id="s1756">The only problem was that right before no man’s land, there was a quarter of a mile of completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Do you think your experience during the war helped you get through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1759">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1760">At that point I was only thinking about the now and the then.</span> <span id="s1761">Th-The moment.</span> <span id="s1762">We knew that we had to go – go through.</span> <span id="s1763">We knew that we also had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the watchtowers.</span> <span id="s1764">We also knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed a few months before, and we have no other barrier.</span> <span id="s1765">And this was the chance.</span> <span id="s1766">And I think there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate too much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed.</span> <span id="s1767">So what I just did, I started to curse in Hungarian, started to yank my fiancée as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s1768">We ran though this part, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it il – seemed like an hour.</span> <span id="s1769">And then we were there, we were – we were in no-man’s land, we saw the Austrian flags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the Austrian border patrol intercepted us.</span> <span id="s1770">We didn’t speak the language, but they didn’t want.</span> <span id="s1771">Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little town, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up there, but I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1772">So my – my luck was still – still with me.</span> <span id="s1773">And then the very next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city.</span> <span id="s1774">They took us to Linz.</span> <span id="s1775">It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler’s hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate.</span> <span id="s1776">It was Wiesenthal – I don’t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal, who was in charge of that operation.</span> <span id="s1777">We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there.</span> <span id="s1778">The non-Hungarian – Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were there for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1779">Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room.</span> <span id="s1780">There came recruiters from Canada and from the United States.</span> <span id="s1781">When they found out that I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come.</span> <span id="s1782">When they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all.</span> <span id="s1783">And three weeks later, on the 19th of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark, and we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: How did you feel putting your foot down on American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Well, it was unreal.</span> <span id="s1786">We had a 30 hour flight.</span> <span id="s1787">We stopped in Reykjavik – in Reykjavik, Iceland, we were in Scotland, we were in Labrador.</span> <span id="s1788">Not the jet planes, th-they – they had no jet planes in ’56.</span> <span id="s1789">It was a – it was an exhaustive – exhausting trip because the night before we started, we already were going – we originally were going from Linz to Salzburg, and in Salzburg we didn’t have a place, so they sent us back to Linz, and from Linz to Muenchen(ph).</span> <span id="s1790">And so we were on a bus for 14 or 15 hours before we had the 30 hour flight.</span> <span id="s1791">So I was sort of in no-man’s land.</span> <span id="s1792">There was one thing which happened a day before we left, which was very important.</span> <span id="s1793">We visited Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1794">This was an inoculation against Europe and against any kind of – of – of wanting to go back to the old – to the old – to the old country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s1797">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Prior to leaving Austria, my mother and I were in almost daily telephone contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Le – you were talking about maut – going to Mauthausen though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1801">The day before we left for the United States, we decided my – my fiancée and my friend and I decided to inoculate ourselves against any kind of homesickness, so visited mau – we visited Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1802">Mauthausen is in a fantastic place, it’s on the top of a hill.</span> <span id="s1803">Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors.</span> <span id="s1804">In ’56, Mauthausen was very different, I am sure, than what it is now.</span> <span id="s1805">It was much closer to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had – what must have been.</span> <span id="s1806">And – and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and which we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and who – some of whom came back from Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1807">I have a number of uncles who were in Mauthausen and who came back.</span> <span id="s1808">And so I could now put together the – the name and the place, and it certainly cured me for – for many, many years, for 38 years from – from any kind of homesickness.</span> <span id="s1809">And then the next morning, as I mentioned, we were bound to go to – to Salzburg and then back and forth until we got to the plane.</span> <span id="s1810">Prior to leaving, finding ou – we only found out that we were coming to the United States about a week before we left.</span> <span id="s1811">We did not know precisely what was going to happen, how long things would take.</span> <span id="s1812">And shortly after we left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fiancée’s parents were in daily telephone contact.</span> <span id="s1813">The original plan was that her – her parents and my mother would essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there.</span> <span id="s1814">The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to – to Budapest and he on – he also told them that they could come with him and he would help them.</span> <span id="s1815">But they didn’t want to take the chance.</span> <span id="s1816">It started to be fairly late in December.</span> <span id="s1817">My mother and a cousin of mine went down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border.</span> <span id="s1818">They tried it there, they couldn’t do it, they were turned back.</span> <span id="s1819">And I told my mother not to go anywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country legally.</span> <span id="s1820">I didn’t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1821">So, late at night on the 19th of December we touched down.</span> <span id="s1822">On the 20th, I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don’t need those Jews.</span> <span id="s1823">You come with me, I live in New Jersey, and I’ll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1824">I told him that, that’s nice, but I came with my fiancée and I’m not going to let her just drift away.</span> <span id="s1825">He reluctantly took her also with him, and us.</span> <span id="s1826">We went to this New Jersey place, it’s Wharton, New Jersey, it’s a small town, small Hungarian town, sort of.</span> <span id="s1827">Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis.</span> <span id="s1828">Now my uncle is a fisi – was a physician.</span> <span id="s1829">I didn’t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret.</span> <span id="s1830">This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me.</span> <span id="s1831">Until I left Hungary, I went to say Kaddish for my father every day.</span> <span id="s1832">When I came to this country, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1833">There was no Jewish synagogue in Wharton.</span> <span id="s1834">My uncle arranged for me to have a job, mean – two – two weeks after I came, as well as my fiancée.</span> <span id="s1835">She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job.</span> <span id="s1836">I got a general helper’s job in a small factory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have.</span> <span id="s1837">What – and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things is that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fiancée and I had decided to go to the next town, which had a little, small synagogue.</span> <span id="s1838">And we – to say Kaddish.</span> <span id="s1839">So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle’s whom we – knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1840">And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fiancée in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1841">You know, ho – what – what’s going on?</span> <span id="s1842">Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that – why didn’t I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him.</span> <span id="s1843">So it was a big fallout.</span> <span id="s1844">I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address.</span> <span id="s1845">And it – the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e – much glee I am sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me.</span> <span id="s1846">And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will – and I am just a terrible person.</span> <span id="s1847">My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me.</span> <span id="s1848">Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at Temple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was – ’57 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left.</span> <span id="s1849">My fiancée stayed there.</span> <span id="s1850">I went to vi – to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year.</span> <span id="s1851">My fiancée and I sort of broke up at this point.</span> <span id="s1852">She moved to New York, and later on she got married.</span> <span id="s1853">My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother left Budapest in August of 1957, with a visa to Israel.</span> <span id="s1854">She never went to Israel, she stayed in Italy.</span> <span id="s1855">My uncle, who was her brother, helped him – her a bit, however, in reality what he did is he told me that I have to help my mother.</span> <span id="s1856">And I sent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to my mother.</span> <span id="s1857">After Temple, I got a job as an engi – junior engineer at Westinghouse, and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at Drexel and I started to study engineering.</span> <span id="s1858">And I did that until March of ’58, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be coming in the next six months.</span> <span id="s1859">And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she’s here.</span> <span id="s1860">So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school.</span> <span id="s1861">I went to New York.</span> <span id="s1862">I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it – my friend’s help, I got a job.</span> <span id="s1863">And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington.</span> <span id="s1864">This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph).</span> <span id="s1865">Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil – she liked me.</span> <span id="s1866">And she called Cardinal O’Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this refugee boy, and that she would like to help him.</span> <span id="s1867">And I got a interview, and I got a job as an instructor there.</span> <span id="s1868">I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for seven years.</span> <span id="s1869">I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi – ending up as an as-assistant professor and receiving my Master’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1962.</span> <span id="s1870">In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer.</span> <span id="s1871">That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later.</span> <span id="s1872">Two months after I came to Washington in ’58, my mother arrived here.</span> <span id="s1873">And I live with my mother from ’58 until ’64.</span> <span id="s1874">And I worked in the university and my mother – most of the time my mother didn’t work, essentially.</span> <span id="s1875">She found a little job to get a social security, finally.</span> <span id="s1876">And the university was – the university experience was – was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it – it’s a small school.</span> <span id="s1877">At that time Catholic University was a rather backwards school in terms of theology.</span> <span id="s1878">They still didn’t step out to the 15th century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn’t tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that’s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left.</span> <span id="s1879">Well, actually, divorce wasn’t as bad as my remarriage in 1964.</span> <span id="s1880">I met another Jewish girl here, and we married.</span> <span id="s1881">And that – after that, things became very intolerable.</span> <span id="s1882">By then I only worked part-time at school.</span> <span id="s1883">I got a job in a research inst – a research in – firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1884">One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, is I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since ’56, and the first time I really had a chance to travel.</span> <span id="s1885">And it was a fabulous two months of – of – of not just vacationing, but – but discovering western Europe.</span> <span id="s1886">It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship, which was called the USS France.</span> <span id="s1887">On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph).</span> <span id="s1888">She became my wife a year later.</span> <span id="s1889">We didn’t know that we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together.</span> <span id="s1890">We met in a – in a Jewish get together, about a half a year later.</span> <span id="s1891">In 1966, I went to join the – work for the navy.</span> <span id="s1892">At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis.</span> <span id="s1893">And the university had no laboratory which was really capable of doing anything.</span> <span id="s1894">So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did.</span> <span id="s1895">I worked there 11 years.</span> <span id="s1896">I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis.</span> <span id="s1897">I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn’t – I was in – in school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it.</span> <span id="s1898">And I really didn’t think that I needed it.</span> <span id="s1899">So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I – the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1900">It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research.</span> <span id="s1901">I wrote more than 50 papers.</span> <span id="s1902">I was involved in the professional development there.</span> <span id="s1903">And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did.</span> <span id="s1904">I moved from 19 – from Maryland where I lived, to Virginia.</span> <span id="s1905">Unfortunately, my family life did not turn out as well as my career.</span> <span id="s1906">After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent got divorced.</span> <span id="s1907">Reason why we did – and this was a – again a fairly long story, is I had a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children.</span> <span id="s1908">We went through three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her biological clock was running and that the only way that she could have a child is if she will marry somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Did you not want children because what of – you went through when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Precisely.</span> <span id="s1911">I didn’t think that I would be a very competent father after which I went through, and the father which I – whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and in another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just like him and I would be incompetent and I didn’t want anybody to have that kind of a life.</span> <span id="s1912">I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn’t sure that – if it was the final decision, but it was.</span> <span id="s1913">Then we divorced in ’73 - ’74.</span> <span id="s1914">And it was during our separation when I went to Israel the first time.</span> <span id="s1915">It was a fantastic experience in 1970.</span> <span id="s1916">It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I felt home.</span> <span id="s1917">And I didn’t feel home in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a real close kinship.</span> <span id="s1918">I had many friends there, and – and the land was just indescribable.</span> <span id="s1919">I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that.</span> <span id="s1920">I traveled a great deal, I was single for 20 years.</span> <span id="s1921">I traveled every year abroad, from the Far East to the Middle East to Europe many times.</span> <span id="s1922">My career went fine.</span> <span id="s1923">I worked for the navy two more jobs.</span> <span id="s1924">From 1977 to ’88, I worked for a high energy laser project, where I became a project manager, and it was a very exciting, new edge, high – high tech e – envelope program, edge of the envelope program.</span> <span id="s1925">And the next one is – ha-happened from 1988 to 1994, where I worked for a multi-national project office, which was the NATO [indecipherable] office, where I very – where I jokingly said I wanted this job because I – al-always in my job I was the only one with an accent, and this – in this office, I would be in the majority, having 13 different nations, and people from 13 different nations work there, although I was the only Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1926">And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project, developing a – a vertical missile.</span> <span id="s1927">And I was very instrumental in that.</span> <span id="s1928">After the project was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a little bleak, and the technical challenges – whereas the money sort of went away.</span> <span id="s1929">And at the end of 1994, I decided to – to retire.</span> <span id="s1930">There were two things which happened in the early 90s.</span> <span id="s1931">One is that my mother got sick at age 89.</span> <span id="s1932">We lived apart, but very close for 20 years.</span> <span id="s1933">Now, we moved back together, she moved back.</span> <span id="s1934">She was an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months.</span> <span id="s1935">And the last 18 months of her life perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness.</span> <span id="s1936">She felt that we were again together.</span> <span id="s1937">In her 90th birthday she beca – she got the heart failure.</span> <span id="s1938">They pulled her out for some reason, she lived six more weeks.</span> <span id="s1939">And then in May of 1991, she died of heart failure, her fourth.</span> <span id="s1940">In 1990, after some unsuccessful relationships, some long term, some short term, I met a woman who was as far away from my culture as anybody could be.</span> <span id="s1941">She wa – she’s Mexican, her name is Letitia.</span> <span id="s1942">And what I found out, actually it was in 1991, and I found out that when my mother got sick, that my American girlfriend didn’t stick out with me, but this woman, whom I met only two or three weeks earlier, did.</span> <span id="s1943">And she stuck with me for a year and a half almost, with – under these conditions and – and I found not only a kinship, but also love.</span> <span id="s1944">We got married in 1992, and we are still married.</span> <span id="s1945">She works in the Mexican embassy and we are pretty happy now.</span> <span id="s1946">So I think that’s the end of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Well, there are just a few more things I want to ask you now about working at the museum as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1948">What was your first encounter with the museum before you went to work there?</span> <span id="s1949">How did you learn about the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: I learned about the museum probably 10 years before it was built, through some solicitations and through friends whose – who provided some funds to the museum.</span> <span id="s1951">I did not know very much about the museum until I saw an ad, I think in the “Washington Jewish Week,” where the museum advertised for volunteers.</span> <span id="s1952">This was in 1992.</span> <span id="s1953">And I went to the L Street, where the museum headquarters were at the time, and I didn’t know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could help in the library, could do some translations from Hungarian to English.</span> <span id="s1954">And I got – I – I worked a little bit with – with a car – with Sheri(ph) Shebo(ph) – you know – I don’t know if you know Sheri(ph).</span> <span id="s1955">She – I think she still works up in the library.</span> <span id="s1956">And I worked there for a couple of months until the first course started for the volunteers for the visitors’ services.</span> <span id="s1957">And I was in – in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Why – why did you start working for the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: I felt that the museum fulfills a mission for me.</span> <span id="s1960">I am a survivor and I had a responsibility and a mission until I can, and I’m capable of, to associate myself with projects which have something to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1961">My awareness started before the museum, in the mid – mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which they spoke again about.</span> <span id="s1962">As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in this country, for many years.</span> <span id="s1963">Although I read a n – a number of books, it’s astonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986.</span> <span id="s1964">There were a few books only, and not very much of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1965">I think where I became more aware is the gathering.</span> <span id="s1966">I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that – that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor did not hit me at that point.</span> <span id="s1967">It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read about child survivor groups.</span> <span id="s1968">And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in Washington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became very active.</span> <span id="s1969">We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the museum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group.</span> <span id="s1970">I started to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups.</span> <span id="s1971">And by 1992 - 1993, I was a – a full-fledged volunteer who is – was more than eager to do something, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1972">I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant and that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a – was the vehicle for that.</span> <span id="s1973">And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working there.</span> <span id="s1974">The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I – I completed the learning center specialist course, and I finished another cor – specialized course for – for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still can do, and do occasionally.</span> <span id="s1975">And then I got associated with the speakers’ bureau in 1980 – in 1995.</span> <span id="s1976">And in ’95 - ’96, I – I spoke to a number of outside groups: among them Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and churches.</span> <span id="s1977">And I feel that – that that aspect of – of my work, in conjunction with the museum is very appropriate for me as a – as a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Are the talks that you give to these groups different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Some of them are different.</span> <span id="s1980">Most of them center about my own story, you know, survi – as a survivor.</span> <span id="s1981">But I have spoken to high schools, such as the Lee High School in Silver Spring about other things, such as the relevance of – of the Holocaust in today’s world.</span> <span id="s1982">It’s a – it’s amazing how many people think that the Holocaust is really not relevant, and how I feel that that’s wrong, and that there is tremendous relevance even today and will for the future.</span> <span id="s1983">In a sense, I am very desperate to – to – to preserve the memory, which whatever means that takes.</span> <span id="s1984">I wrote up my story, which was published, incidentally, in 1993 also, as a – as a collection of stories with 11 other Hungarians and – and it’s published in a book.</span> <span id="s1985">And I – I am writing now a – a lo – long – longer autobiography which will be probably a full-length book.</span> <span id="s1986">Not just my Holocaust, but my post-Holocaust experience in life in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: How has working at the museum affected your life?</span> <span id="s1988">Has it affected your memories of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: It certainly has.</span> <span id="s1990">It induced me to – to learn a lot more.</span> <span id="s1991">I thought I knew the Holocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 15 years of reading, but I found out that I needed to learn a great deal too.</span> <span id="s1992">And in the last five years, oh, I read maybe a couple of hundred books on the Holocaust and I took a number of courses, mostly in the museum.</span> <span id="s1993">There are tremendous courses in the museum, for learning center specialists and research department.</span> <span id="s1994">I try to go to every course and every lecture and every one or two day cour – one or two day –</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Seminars, conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: – sem-seminars, wherever it’s offered, then wherever I have time.</span> <span id="s1997">I – I went maybe 50 of them already.</span> <span id="s1998">So I am – I’m really immersed, and it made me very conscious about a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1999">A lot of things which a lot of people just sort of don’t care about or – or feel that it’s not – not relevant any more, and I think it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Why do you think it’s relevant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Why is it relevant?</span> <span id="s2002">I think that it’s relevant because people are – most people in this country and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what happens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as they were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message is still fresh.</span> <span id="s2003">You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is the only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Do you think, as a staff member at the museum, you bring special insights because you are a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: I do believe that that’s the case.</span> <span id="s2006">I believe that every time that I say to a group who comes, and whose – and I give group – little – little group orientations when I say that my name is George Pick and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody looks at me.</span> <span id="s2007">And it – it – I think a survivor is a – is the only direct link people have to the Holocaust, and I believe that that is a unique thing I bring to the museum, and all the survivors who are there, bring to the museum.</span> <span id="s2008">And I think the museum should take maximum advantage of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: With your survivor friends, have you ever tried to encourage them to volunteer at the museum, and if so what – what did they respond to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yes, I do, I – the – I have two sets of survivor friends.</span> <span id="s2011">The – some of them are older than I am.</span> <span id="s2012">The ones who are Hungarian, and who are in their 70s, and some of who gave considerable amount of money to – to the museum.</span> <span id="s2013">Who can afford to, but they do.</span> <span id="s2014">And who are – some who are not as wealthy, myself included, who would give our time.</span> <span id="s2015">I know that a number of us are volunteering in the museum who are Hungarians and who are survivors.</span> <span id="s2016">Same thing from the survivor – child survivor group.</span> <span id="s2017">And I am –</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: So the – so the response to – when you ask people to volunteer has been good?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Not as good as I would like it.</span> <span id="s2020">I would like to have more of them volunteer and more of them go out, but each year I can – I can persuade a few more people to – to get involved.</span> <span id="s2021">And as – that’s always pleasing to me, and I’m always gratified if that happens – if – when that happens.</span> <span id="s2022">And I’m trying to keep people’s minds out – interestingly enough, few – few of my friends who really suffered a great deal through the camps, are not willing to speak out and not willing to face, maybe never will face the horrors they – they had gone through.</span> <span id="s2023">And – and I sympathize and I understand that.</span> <span id="s2024">But I encourage everybody else, who are capable of talking, to – to talk to the museum, talk to the foundation, the Shoah Foundation, and give testimony.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers at the museum, who are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: We have a very close-knit relationship.</span> <span id="s2027">We know, of course who the survivors are, and we speak perhaps more among ourselves.</span> <span id="s2028">We have now a group who meet about twice a – about once every two months.</span> <span id="s2029">We have now the – the director of survivor affairs, and Martin Goldman, who is encouraging us to interact with him and with each other.</span> <span id="s2030">We are very concerned about the museum and we are concerned about the direction the museum takes.</span> <span id="s2031">We want to make sure that the – the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the Holocaust are not going to fall by the wayside.</span> <span id="s2032">We understand it’s a – it’s a government institution, but we still believe that the main event of the Holocaust was still the – the Holocaust against the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2033">And we emphasize that among ourselves, and among the – the visitors.</span> <span id="s2034">We do not think this is in contradiction with any kind of museum policy, should not be, and must not be.</span> <span id="s2035">And so we are – we feel that we want to preserve the museum’s main mission, which is to explain the Holocaust and show what – what had happened during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Do the – you think the emphasis is becoming less Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Well, I think we have now, this year particularly, succeeded in steering the – the museum back a little bit.</span> <span id="s2040">I was unhappy about the – the Nazi Olympics.</span> <span id="s2041">I think it was – it make – it first of all, cost a lot of money and a lot of resources, and I don’t think it has a direct relationship to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2042">I mean, it was a – an event, a Nazi event, but there were many, many, many other events, which had direct relations.</span> <span id="s2043">I am very happy now that the Kovno ghetto exhibit will come.</span> <span id="s2044">I was happy with the Fry exhibit.</span> <span id="s2045">But the – but I thought that going – going with that Nazi exhibit – Nazi Olympic exhibit was essentially going away from that.</span> <span id="s2046">I was also unhappy for the same reason of that little exhibit we had, which was the faces of Bosnia, or whatever they called.</span> <span id="s2047">Which I sympathize again, I felt that it was a terrible genocide, and you know, I sympathize with all this, but again, that served to – to steer away the muse – from the museum’s main mission.</span> <span id="s2048">And I don’t think we can afford that, we have too many other – too – too many things which is not in the main exhibit, which should be said in the various other exhibits.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Well, such as – what, for example was the – you know, the Jews, as victims are shown pretty well in the main exhibit.</span> <span id="s2051">But what about the Jews as contributors of European culture and science?</span> <span id="s2052">We were not victims before Hitler came; we were great contributors.</span> <span id="s2053">There is – I think the museum has that part – the museum’s mission is very integrated with that, to show that – that our contribution, our 1,000 year old contribution to European culture and civilization and technology is more than just six million deaths.</span> <span id="s2054">And I think the museum should have an exhibit for that – pretty soon, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s2055">That’s one idea, and I had about 20 or 30 other ideas which I wrote up as a – in a memo to the management, and which I submitted to the ma – high management in January of this year.</span> <span id="s2056">I really believe that they are looking at some of it, and some of these ideas are already bearing some fruition.</span> <span id="s2057">But I think they have a long way to go, and many years to do it.</span> <span id="s2058">And I think that – that – that management should not forget these aspects of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick.</span> <span id="s2061">This is tape number four, side B. Describe your impressions of the museum’s non-survivors volunteer and staff, both Jewish and non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: My impression of the non-survivor volunteers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: And staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: And staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Those who are Jewish, and non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Okay, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s2067">I think that it is not a coincidence that in the volunteer corps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors.</span> <span id="s2068">I feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the museum whether Jewish or non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s2069">But there is, I think, a reason why Jews feel more of a mission there than a non-mission.</span> <span id="s2070">And I feel the same thing about the staff.</span> <span id="s2071">I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many others, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, is leaving the museum, and many of them already have left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Well, that’s a good question, I don’t – I don’t know what the answer is, but I have a feeling that the answer is very complex.</span> <span id="s2074">One aspect of that answer is that the museum, in some respects become a bureau – bi – be – is becoming a bureaucracy, just like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative.</span> <span id="s2075">And there are some – there were some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and who were frustrated and who find – found a dead end situation there, and left.</span> <span id="s2076">They were not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized with, and who would have loved to stay in a museum if they have seen for themselves some – some way up and some way to develop.</span> <span id="s2077">But some senior man – senior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation enhanced the reputation of the museum, such as the research center.</span> <span id="s2078">I was very sorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving.</span> <span id="s2079">I was very sorry to see when Sylvia Milton left.</span> <span id="s2080">And my fear is that, with these kind of people leaving the museum, the research institute is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable scientists, such as Browning and others.</span> <span id="s2081">It is not just a matter of money, I think it’s a matter of reputation, and I think the – the institute started out as a world class – world class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today, and I think it should.</span> <span id="s2082">And if it doesn’t now, it should certainly strive to do it again.</span> <span id="s2083">That is an awful lot that institution needs to do, and had the potential to doing it.</span> <span id="s2084">I think the museum management should definitely strive to – to nurture that institution, and my impression is that it is not doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: What would you like to see them do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: What I like to see them do is to first of all encourage and hire world class historians to work there.</span> <span id="s2087">As I said, some of them already left, and I’m not positive that too many of them wants – wants to work there under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s2088">I think some enticement, grants, sut – etcetera, probably will bring some of them back.</span> <span id="s2089">But I think that there is a – a limitation there.</span> <span id="s2090">There are other institutions who are competing for these same people, and I think if – if the research institute is not going to compete successfully in the next few years, they may lose that kind of brainpower, and I think that would be a great loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: You had mentioned that you had many other ideas for other exhibits.</span> <span id="s2092">Can you just name a few?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: Yes, well I – I believe that some of the exhibits, some of various ghetto exhibits – I think Kovno is – is a good – good – I’m sure it will be a good exhibit, but there are other ghettos and life in – in ghettos which were very different from Kovno and which is portrayed in the main exhibits, which should be shown.</span> <span id="s2094">For example, in – in west Europe, the ghettos were very different.</span> <span id="s2095">I think that there should be exhibits about the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but because the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it – in my estimation it’s underrepresented in the – in the main exhibit, anyway.</span> <span id="s2096">So it should – it should find someplace else.</span> <span id="s2097">The French Jews same thing, and – and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are also underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary space.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Are there any powerful experiences, or memorable experiences you’ve had while you’ve been working at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2100">These memorable experiences had been very asso – very much associated with teachers training there.</span> <span id="s2101">I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak to them, in a Belfer conference.</span> <span id="s2102">I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave, who recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers’ education.</span> <span id="s2103">After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse – to – must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a – the education department recognized the contribution with the educ – which the survivors could make to education.</span> <span id="s2104">But I had some memorable instances this year, when I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting around and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and wanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them.</span> <span id="s2105">And one – and telling me – and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but other years, is that their me – most meaningful experience was to meet survivors.</span> <span id="s2106">That many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to person touch was – was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit to their students.</span> <span id="s2107">And I really believe that.</span> <span id="s2108">That was certainly most memorable for me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Are there any particular parts of the museum with which you identify with?</span> <span id="s2110">Anything special there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Of course, I – I under – I identify with everything.</span> <span id="s2112">It would be saying, you know, if you have many children, who do you love more?</span> <span id="s2113">But despite of that, there are certain things obviously, which – which were closer – or which are closer to me than other pieces are.</span> <span id="s2114">For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s2115">Obviously, the man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate family’s life, makes a difference to me.</span> <span id="s2116">But – but everything is meaningful.</span> <span id="s2117">And of course th-the-the large pictures which – which show the Hungarian Jews on the ramp of Auschwitz in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered faces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old.</span> <span id="s2118">I have a picture of it, and I provided that to the museum to show that this was a uniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore.</span> <span id="s2119">And so I am always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of them.</span> <span id="s2120">They of course, not survived and I did.</span> <span id="s2121">And that is a very emotional thing, but for me – and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and – and go through that – that exhibit so many times, isn’t that stressful?</span> <span id="s2122">The answer is, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2123">It’s a gut-wrenching experience, and I – I feel that I owe that to – to the dead, and I owe that to myself and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate, of what it was, not just to look from the outside in, but what it was to be in, in hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Be-Because of the very difficult experiences you had during the war, was there ever a time when you resisted remembering what you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: I – I do not remember consciously resisting.</span> <span id="s2126">After the war, particularly after the communists took over in Hungary, this was a taboo subject.</span> <span id="s2127">We did not focus at this, we had day – daily problems and concerns.</span> <span id="s2128">The memory, as fresh as it is 53 years later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its vividity, its – its vividness, its – its – its relevance.</span> <span id="s2129">And it stayed there.</span> <span id="s2130">I mean, it obviously this kind of things don’t go away forever, but I never resisted it consciously, I si – I simply just went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2131">I – I did – and I – I must say also that my life is not defined by the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2132">Maybe in the later, last few years it’s focusing – the Holocaust is more of a focus.</span> <span id="s2133">But as you heard it from my post-Holocaust experiences and my – my professional life, I was not – the fofo – the Holocaust did not deter me in what I was doing.</span> <span id="s2134">I was among the probably few who ended up not in a helping profession.</span> <span id="s2135">You would be a-amazed how many of the survivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha – how many ended up in becoming a – more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers.</span> <span id="s2136">But I was among the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and profession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I am very much like – I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2137">I still do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only.</span> <span id="s2138">But I f – want to use my survivor status to speak, and my – my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Do you think you’d be a different person today if you hadn't gone through the wartime experience that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: I am sure I would be.</span> <span id="s2141">I think the wartime experiences has – had taught me a great deal.</span> <span id="s2142">Many things which I probably wouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s2143">Persistence.</span> <span id="s2144">Not be cowed by – by intimidations.</span> <span id="s2145">Sometimes recognize when a crucial decision have to be made, and I learned that heroes are not born, but made.</span> <span id="s2146">Not un – I’m not com – saying that I’m a hero, but at least I have seen heroes who became heroes, who were plain folk, and – and I brushed with death very many times.</span> <span id="s2147">So many times that sometimes I worry that I run out of luck eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Do you feel Hungarian or American or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: I have to tell you the – I have to tell you a little story about this.</span> <span id="s2150">You know Einstein was asked the same question.</span> <span id="s2151">The – does he feel American, German or Jewish, and he says – do you know what his answer was?</span> <span id="s2152">His answer was, well, as long as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I’m German, the Americans will say I – I am American, and of course the Jews will say I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s2153">But if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I’m German and the Germans will say I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s2154">So the same way with me, it’s – I feel that the components are there.</span> <span id="s2155">I am a part – I have 22 years of me with Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2156">I have 40 years of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they somehow counteract and interact.</span> <span id="s2157">I – I think it is – is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component.</span> <span id="s2158">I – I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music.</span> <span id="s2159">I love American literature, but I love a lot of – lot of other things.</span> <span id="s2160">And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish.</span> <span id="s2161">But I lo – but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither.</span> <span id="s2162">For example, I – I love photography, which is neither Jewish – although there were many Jewish photographers.</span> <span id="s2163">Neither Jewish nor Hungarian were – there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers.</span> <span id="s2164">Nor American, where again, same – same thing happens.</span> <span id="s2165">My interest and philosophy of life, I hope transcends somehow, this compartmentalization.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Is there anything you’d like to add that you haven’t said, before we finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yeah, I l – I like to go back to the museum, and I like to go back to a – a concern I – I had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers’ education.</span> <span id="s2168">I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian.</span> <span id="s2169">I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s2170">And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was – where I am – was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central – centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2171">And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea.</span> <span id="s2172">And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa – one of the – one of the teachers said well, what happens if e – we teach it different?</span> <span id="s2173">And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way.</span> <span id="s2174">Well, that’s nice.</span> <span id="s2175">I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec – spe-specific and fairly practical objections.</span> <span id="s2176">For example one black teacher got up – very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt.</span> <span id="s2177">I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt – their – their New Testament is wrong.</span> <span id="s2178">I can’t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong.</span> <span id="s2179">How do I do this?</span> <span id="s2180">And I was really concerned and I am – I think that this is a great central concern and should be of the education department to – to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a – of – of the anti-Semitism in such a way that the teachers can accept it.</span> <span id="s2181">I’m not talking sugarcoating.</span> <span id="s2182">I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it.</span> <span id="s2183">If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won’t be taught.</span> <span id="s2184">And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost.</span> <span id="s2185">It’s not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened.</span> <span id="s2186">And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art – of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s2187">But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves?</span> <span id="s2188">I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling.</span> <span id="s2189">I mean, they – they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don’t know how to resolve it.</span> <span id="s2190">I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that’s not a small amount of work either.</span> <span id="s2191">That’s my parting shot for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Thank you for – for letting me do it.</span> <span id="s2194">I-I really hope that I have pointed out some – some thoughts here.</span></p> <p><span
