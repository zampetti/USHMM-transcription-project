2000</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Good morning Professor Mommsen.</span> <span id="s12">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Nice to see you here in Washington.</span> <span id="s14">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Tell me when you were born, and what your name was at birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Well, I was -- I was born on the fifth of November, 1930, and certainly I had the same name as I have, Hans Mommsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Same name.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me something about your -- your family, your mother and your father, and your -- you have a twin brother, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: S -- I had the twin brother, and my father was historian at Marburg, and -- because many people ask that, Theodor Mommsen is the great-grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s21">And he won a -- a Nobel Prize, didn’t he -- A: Yes, he did, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: -- in 1903.</span> <span id="s23">So, at what age did you start being very conscious of this very prominent background in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Quite late, you know.</span> <span id="s25">There was no -- there was no -- no tendency to miternigize Theodor Mommsen at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: You know, that was not necessary.</span> <span id="s28">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We rather were timid to -- to talk about Theodor, and especially not to use that relation, if one had contact to the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And was your mother a professional as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, my mother is a -- just a housewife, she is from Prame and -- and she comes from a bank-banking fam-family, and they broke down in the hyper-inflation in 1923, and thus in a way, had a negative impact on the relation between my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, it -- there was no money left.</span> <span id="s34">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: And my mother, you know, she was used to have s -- plenty of money all the time, and now -- and suddenly there was none, because the salary of a German [indecipherable] professor was not too high, if he now had four kids, and that was our case.</span> <span id="s36">And certainly he l -- lost many of his income after the Nazis took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: So that meant that your par -- th -- your relationship between your parents was not -- A: Right, it could have been a bit better.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: -- was not so easy -- better.</span> <span id="s39">Did that affect you?</span> <span id="s40">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s41">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s43">You said four kids?</span> <span id="s44">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So, twin brother, older brother, and?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Had two older brothers, we were four brothers, yes.</span> <span id="s47">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s48">And what’s the difference in age between --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, the oldest one is born in 1923, next in ’27, and we are 1930.</span> <span id="s50">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s51">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: And the oldest are [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s53">They had a lot of war experience in the second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: When do you first become conscious of the -- the Nazis, what -- I mean, what kind of a dec -- do you remember as a kid seeing things in the streets?</span> <span id="s55">Hearing things on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, it -- Well, it’s difficult to say, you know, because to recognize the Nazis as something which is really distinct from the general conditions, you wouldn’t, I think, be aware.</span> <span id="s57">Before the war -- although, you know, my first interesting, and -- experience in the contemporary history, was arige Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s58">And it was a quite strange story, because my father wanted to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s59">The synagogue which was burning, was directly besides of the lecture building of the university, and my father was teaching at the university, and by that he had a pretext to go there.</span> <span id="s60">Because it was not accessible for the public, it was only SA men who were there.</span> <span id="s61">In order to get into that, and oh -- he took the twins, and by that, it looked that way, he [indecipherable] but we all the time, asked him, “Father, why doesn’t the firefighters come?”</span> <span id="s62">And he said, “Psst, psst, psst.”</span> <span id="s63">And I remember the scenery, and certainly the thing which is interesting then, for the historian, is that there was no public people, there was only the SA.</span> <span id="s64">It was certainly not as Goebbels had tried to let it appear, as a riot of the German people, it was just only the -- the Nazi activists, and the others didn’t have any access to the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And how did you -- And how did -- Do you ha-have any idea how your dad got access, or were you far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No, we go -- we went to the -- the adjacent building, we knew that way well, you know -- Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Because he got exception.</span> <span id="s68">No, that was nearby, nearb -- Q: Were you scared by this?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Not -- Not random, oh, I don’t know, maybe.</span> <span id="s70">You know, but I remember it only -- recollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: When you went back home, I mean when he -- when you asked him there, you know, why isn’t there a fire truck stopping this, and he tells you to be quiet, was there any talk when you went back home?</span> <span id="s74">None?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, wouldn’t talk about that.</span> <span id="s76">Q: No, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s78">We got the feeling that he didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s79">He wouldn’t talk about any politics at home.</span> <span id="s80">Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance movement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit him regularly.</span> <span id="s81">And we got aware only of the fact that he left the house, he didn’t receive th -- him in the house, and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the kids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his conduct.</span> <span id="s82">And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in German, that ronteheron in Berlin with an auchnie pas etou and so on.</span> <span id="s83">That means the people in the ministry down there wouldn’t do either, you know.</span> <span id="s84">And certainly that reflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn’t, in a way, use the governmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or the administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a bypass, or surpass them.</span> <span id="s85">That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable] and a potential.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">One is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was known for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s89">But he visited us in the summer of 1941.</span> <span id="s90">Then the German troops had conquered the Aprole, that was highest mountain in the Carpathors.</span> <span id="s91">And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, “Ee, Meineker’s proud of that.”</span> <span id="s92">We couldn’t get to that, you know.</span> <span id="s93">But cernly all the money was owned in some respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he was proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One officer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union, because he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Your dad was not a member of the party?</span> <span id="s95">A: He was a member of the party, he was -- Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end the party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he came very late to the party.</span> <span id="s97">But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn’t much meaning about what the people really thought of.</span> <span id="s98">And we have a lot of nominal members in that time.</span> <span id="s99">He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he was a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to leave that university and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow people in the education ministry in Berlin, who helped him, by that he could preserve his chair.</span> <span id="s100">But he lost the periodical he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way politically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and by that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s101">Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really conservative.</span> <span id="s102">And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the restoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system.</span> <span id="s103">There was some disorientation.</span> <span id="s104">Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing tendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for the importance of the Bismark in tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the great German tendencies.</span> <span id="s105">And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not really a member of the opposition.</span> <span id="s106">He was in the midst between the camps, I think.</span> <span id="s107">And in a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in 1944, I’ll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants who were in the Third Reich, came from Strassburg.</span> <span id="s108">Strassburg had been lost, and now we were sitting at Marburg.</span> <span id="s109">So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my father’s and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was way, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his chair.</span> <span id="s110">It looked like they had, you know.</span> <span id="s111">And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the regime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know there you see the change.</span> <span id="s112">I never forgot that, you know.</span> <span id="s113">And so far, I think the position of my father’s was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And your -- your two older brothers, were they brought into the army in ’39, or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he served all the time, first in -- in the eastern front, and then in Africa, but he -- fortunately he didn’t get to northern Africa because there end of the main -- because then -- there was everything finished.</span> <span id="s116">And then he went back to the Soviet Union, and he survived in a way because he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- Oude river in order to get into the hands of the Americans.</span> <span id="s117">That was that story.</span> <span id="s118">So the -- he had the pressure o -- you know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two times wounded, and so on.</span> <span id="s119">That way, typical war -- war age cahount.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that means he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also got soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn’t get to the Soviet Union, but to France.</span> <span id="s122">And you know, that’s a really strange story, because when he went back to Schlevig Kolchda, that’s in the north of Germany, that was a region where still the great Admiral Doernitz had his .</span> <span id="s123">And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved as independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one calls in German, Ate tu exetsianser.</span> <span id="s124">Exercise the great thing, Heil Doenitz.</span> <span id="s125">You know that Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a Heil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable.</span> <span id="s126">And then he came home with everything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff.</span> <span id="s127">And [indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in American -- ga -- custody.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s129">Tell me about school during this period, when you started going to school.</span> <span id="s130">I know you have no comparison, because you go to school, and it’s in -- within the context of the National Socialism, but what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: But it’s strange, you know, the school was called Adolf Hitler school.</span> <span id="s132">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Got the name after 1933.</span> <span id="s134">About the time I take -- round that gymnasium -- in Germany we’d say gymnasium, that was the second day of school, you know.</span> <span id="s135">It was one of the -- not of the old k -- gymnasium, which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons, but they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the German secondary school.</span> <span id="s136">And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was definitely non -- a non-Nazi, that’s quite clear.</span> <span id="s137">And he tried to avoid too much in indoctrination in that time.</span> <span id="s138">And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to overestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period.</span> <span id="s139">You know, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German, Nationalists certainly, it was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic.</span> <span id="s140">But I can’t remember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that would play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific Nazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start, you know.</span> <span id="s141">It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944.</span> <span id="s142">It’s because they had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you can -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really different from the other professors, you know?</span> <span id="s143">And it -- so far, I can’t remember that there was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the school.</span> <span id="s144">Certainly some, you know, and well, you would have the -- the typical school pil -- festivals or something, but I can’t remember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe that happened, but it was not very significant, I think.</span> <span id="s146">And as a historian, I add on the commentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one hand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some deportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not -- and -- and so far, I think the school was not too much Nazified.</span> <span id="s147">And there was not too much change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little bit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every f -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every Sunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth organization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s148">I th -- I think, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it’s not so much.</span> <span id="s149">At least I didn’t understand anything about the Jewish question before the war was over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naïve in that way, you know.</span> <span id="s150">So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn’t talk about politics at all, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: And that’s what I have to say to the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: You know, in the -- in the museum we have, on the fourth floor, this thing about the school, and we show something about “The Poisonous Mushroom.”</span> <span id="s154">Do you ever remember reading that book, or books like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: No.</span> <span id="s157">So this was not so typical.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Se-Serious school teachers wouldn’t use that.</span> <span id="s159">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: But that’s a problem you know where i-it’s a -- now, and there’s a lot of tendency in the research to start it at -- but when should we weigh causes, you know.</span> <span id="s161">These things were very tedious.</span> <span id="s162">I can only tell my experience with it --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: -- with the Deutsch yungfolk, you know, so the -- Q: Yes, please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: We had to go into the Deutsch yungfolk when we were 10, and I was in the Deutsch yungfolk from the age of 10 to the age of 14.</span> <span id="s166">And so that we were living in specifics quarter at Marburg, and there was something like the academic elite there, but that our -- our [indecipherable] some unit of the yungfolk, you know, had a lot of intellectuals, and you know, it’s quite good.</span> <span id="s167">We had a library and I wa -- the -- Wolfgang, my twin brother and I, had to run the library, the fanela library, and had a lot of books, but you know, what did it guys lend out.</span> <span id="s168">So they lend out calimai, and technical literature.</span> <span id="s169">There’s no universum literature dealing with a technical future, and something like that.</span> <span id="s170">They wouldn’t read anything which is related to Nazi ideology, that was quite symptomatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">And you know, if you have to run a -- a youth group, you know, and you have to take one evening in the week, you know, which should -- what the Germans call that heimarm, that means, I have some program, you know.</span> <span id="s172">The pr -- The Nazi ideology is very poor, and after awhile it’s very difficult to do something, and by that, you know, it was a little bit, you know, they had very different topics, but in Farenow, the specific ideological issues were not debated very much.</span> <span id="s173">So the e -- went -- there was criticism against it, but it wasn’t -- it -- it was not so much in the minds, I think, of the people as -- from the -- from hindsight, one per -- would believe, if he looks at the specific literature.</span> <span id="s174">And I want to add one experience that then, in 1944, late in 1944, we were assembled and to be taken over to the Hitler youth, that is the organization of the 14 to 18 old boys, and they had to swear the oath on Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s175">It -- The whole thing happened within the inner circle of the marble castle.</span> <span id="s176">And there were about 1200 boys, and we’re way much packed.</span> <span id="s177">But the whole thing was a little bits disturbed, because there were two lightnings, and there was - - we -- we -- we would have preferred to go, you know, in it so far.</span> <span id="s178">In 1944 there was no much chance to indoctrinate people any longer.</span> <span id="s179">And -- But that’s on -- all of my experience I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: And in your sense, at least in the world in which you traveled, was that while people were not necessarily going to resist the Nazis, and the regime.</span> <span id="s181">They were not necessarily believing.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, that’s ish -- they were -- just to -- in the middle of that, you know.</span> <span id="s183">And do you know what was the problem with only if you wanted to -- to decide for assistance and -- there was some identity between the nation and the personality of Hitler, it was quite difficult for -- for I think ordinary people, you know, where you can say -- members of the elite, that’s different, or Conservatives, or even Communists, that’s different.</span> <span id="s184">But the ordinary people, what should they do, just you know, the -- the -- the -- the gentleman, tentative was, they criticize all the time the regime, and Goebbels and Himmler, and everybody, but would exempt Hitler from that.</span> <span id="s185">So they had a split consciousness, and you have that famous sentence, “Ven dusta fuhrer wusta,” “If Hitler would know that, then it wouldn’t happen,” you know.</span> <span id="s186">And certainly that was a psychological mechanism, because you can’t easily revolt against your own nation.</span> <span id="s187">And so far, Hitler was taken from out of that criticism, while certainly all the soldiers would say, after the war, then we will change the regime.</span> <span id="s188">And that was the other side of the other interrogations of German prisoners of war by the Americans.</span> <span id="s189">You know, we have a lot of material for that.</span> <span id="s190">You see, I am not a very good eye witness, you know.</span> <span id="s191">A historian usually --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Is not, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: -- reflects his own experience too much.</span> <span id="s194">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Yeah, was it hard during the war?</span> <span id="s196">Did you ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, we had a good life because we are living a little town at Marburg.</span> <span id="s198">There was some air attacks, but not many.</span> <span id="s199">I never forget that I also was caring, and to help people, and if somebody wouldn’t have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back, then I would have not survived, and so on.</span> <span id="s200">And -- But in general, I think the conditions at Marburg were not too -- too bad, while certainly in the big cities, where you have the wide air raids, it must have been very problematic, you know.</span> <span id="s201">And especially in the last ter -- months of the war.</span> <span id="s202">I never forget when the Americans attacked the city of Giessen, that’s just 30 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s203">That was in the night at three.</span> <span id="s204">And we were -- had a house with a good looking -- you could looks out a little bit on the -- on the hill.</span> <span id="s205">We could read on the balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Then Giessen was burning, we could read on the balcony, 30 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s208">Q: Oh [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well, that was the last face of the al-allied bombing of encef.</span> <span id="s210">That certainly was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">And it depended certainly also where the political pressure is concerned, how -- how -- how the local functionaries would behave, surely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: -- wouldn’t talk about these things.</span> <span id="s213">Would your mother talk about these things with you?</span> <span id="s214">A: No, she was apolitical, no, she would not.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: She was apolitical.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I know there was, I think some agreement not to talk about anything.</span> <span id="s217">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: So, the only thing I remember, that sometimes I didn’t understand, my father ordered to us, please don’t be too kind, or don’t make friendship with the sons of Professor Funshdeal.</span> <span id="s219">30 years later I learn that a Professor Funshdeal, who was a colleague in the medical faculty, was a -- participating in the concentration camp -- how is that called?</span> <span id="s220">Medical experiments.</span> <span id="s221">He must have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So your father would hint slightly at things?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes, you know, in this situation, if you have something like an political double life, then you probably wa -- should -- should -- wouldn’t ta -- to tell anything to the kids, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Another question certainly was that he would tell so many nice stories, that he would listen, and evening be recie.</span> <span id="s227">And you know there was his -- his working room, and that would -- had to be dark, and nobody was allowed to go there.</span> <span id="s228">This was clear that something was happening.</span> <span id="s229">But he did not know that my older brother, before he came to the -- to the entire air troop, together with his friend, had a telephone connection to that radio, and were sitting in a neighboring house, and listening to the BBC too, you know, which, as you can imagine, was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s230">But th-there was some feeling that there was something, and you’d been -- better wouldn’t talk about it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: And may -- you know, but certainly that depends on my recollection, you know, no promise.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Right, I know the promise.</span> <span id="s234">Why do you think historians make very bad witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Historians make bad witness because they put everything only the -- in history in perspective, and what you need is -- and what a historian needs if he is working with historical witnesses, that they just recollect immediately, which I hadn -- you have to get them bef -- and we have the re -- in the situation, to ask them the first time.</span> <span id="s236">And I am -- so a little bit ca -- or we could -- you can say afterwards, you have to shoot them, because it’s quite clear that they would change an opinion, and have a -- you know, th -- that experience with the expiration of a ristock fire, where all the witnesses would change their opinion if they were in favor of a Communist, or of a National Socialist background, doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s237">The witness who told in 1933 that and that, they would tell them the opposite in -- after 1945, and the -- the other way around.</span> <span id="s238">It’s very interesting, and I -- I had a way -- it was we -- when I had to study on the Volkswagen company in the Third Reich, and I had a good contact to the former -- former man of the management, who was responsible for the accunt -- commercial ex -- aspects.</span> <span id="s239">And I asked him, why are they put in Jewesses in the work to do to -- could use some pasokas because that was certainly not very important, and especially -- certainly they -- it was now pr-profiteering motivation [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s240">First he immediately sa -- spontaneously answered, “Because we had to fill the capacity.”</span> <span id="s241">A week later, or two, he called me and said he wanted talk about me, and now he added [indecipherable] of second day liberations, why that was there, but he never had reflected that the most interesting thing is when the -- th -- over 50 years, never had reflected that the occupied Jewish concentration camp inmates in the c-company.</span> <span id="s242">You know that, I think, was the most interesting.</span> <span id="s243">And then he got the original motive, that he didn’t think that it just put in whom they got, in order to fill the capacity, not to lose anything of the capacity for -- well, possibly a later peace production.</span> <span id="s244">It was so primitive, that was it.</span> <span id="s245">This is one of the cases where I got him at a situation where he didn’t reflect it, and then he told the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: And otherwise, they don’t tell -- Q: The truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: -- things that they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What was it like soon after the war?</span> <span id="s250">Your brothers come back.</span> <span id="s251">Is there --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Well, you know, it’s quite interesting that when all is cu -- he talks about he -- the hour zero, you know, and that was a tobide whether it’s a liberation, or whether it is a defeat.</span> <span id="s253">But what is, I think forgotten, is that there was a constellation which lasted several months, with a total disorientation, because it didn’t know whether there would be a German state again, or something, or what would be a political structure, there was -- there was no future.</span> <span id="s254">And also, what my personal situation was concerned, I didn’t know whether the -- whether we would continue the secondary school, then I didn’t know whether there would be a chance to go to the university.</span> <span id="s255">There was, in a way, everything broke down, and I think that left an imprint on that generation, and those -- are those age cohorts, who -- who went through that situation of this extreme disorientation I think they are different from the next ones, who haven’t, I don’t think, gone through that.</span> <span id="s256">I never forget one situation, and I think, which has a -- being very, very important for my personal development.</span> <span id="s257">But those -- April 27th, 1945, in the early morning, the Germans -- the German troops left the city in disarray, you know, it was ger -- my father went to them, and said throw the rifles into the garden, ya -- bi -- please put it down the street and so on, and I went into the garden wa -- and so on, then they fled, and at last, the general who was there, there was some -- some -- had division staff there, and he hosed, then fled t -- by foot, you know, that was the end of the -- of the borf wars.</span> <span id="s258">And then there was something, Germans had left, and Americans would come, but nobody would know when.</span> <span id="s259">And then my notables, and my peers were all plundering.</span> <span id="s260">They were some deport of the German army, and they’re plundering, you know, and I, for my first and last time, learned what is it, if there is never law and order, and no authority.</span> <span id="s261">And s -- you know, I didn’t have much respect when I went to school, noby -- here’s all these people, you know, I’m very nervous, don’t you notice.</span> <span id="s262">It was just nothing, well, they could rape there, but they did what they could do, and -- and even the -- the directors of the schools, and the professors, and everybody belonging to the elite, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: You know?</span> <span id="s265">And this has -- had, I think, left an imprint on me, and cer-certainly may be somewhat responsible for my lack of accepting authority, and being very nervous if I got the authority [indecipherable] conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And wha-what do you think made those people do that, the plundering, at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, you know, besides all -- as you know, far more important than any Nazi indoctrination was the terrible loss of -- of moral radius, something like a -- a -- people got accustomed to moral indifference.</span> <span id="s268">And all these radius were gone undone, there were no longer norms, and by that, you have then this certain de-decay of a civilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Certainly if you look at the Jewish question, you have that very clear, you know, it’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s270">And there is also, I think the [indecipherable] not only anti-Semitic indoctrination, but it’s, you know, a mentality where people just do what is in their -- their primary interest, and where we have something like an amoral vitality.</span> <span id="s271">And I always grow the -- the famous atrons of -- of Hannibal James Homerker, the leader of the German resistance group, the so-called crisis [indecipherable] who said the foremost talk of the resistance is to restore to picture of man in the hearts of our fellow citizens, in order just to -- to come back to something like a civilized society, so the -- the extreme decay of all radius, of all habits, and so on, and -- we-well we had something like more anarchy.</span> <span id="s272">This is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did that affect you?</span> <span id="s274">A: Yes, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So that you felt this lack in yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes, I -- if you have it, if you are a young guy, and you don’t have any -- any morals, any persons you can adore, or to follow their ideas, you know the oldest -- the old Nazis were gone, and the other ones, who were -- who was left?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: We were in that -- in that respect, I think psychologically alone.</span> <span id="s279">Q: Psychologically?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Psychologically alone.</span> <span id="s281">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Without -- Without guidance.</span> <span id="s283">Who could at -- help us?</span> <span id="s284">Also, we had to li -- also, when we learned what was happening, we had some distance to the -- to the parents, too, you know.</span> <span id="s285">The whole peer generation was just without any -- we didn’t have any respect towards the peer generation.</span> <span id="s286">And that’s the way it differ -- ca -- education ca -- has a -- has a certain [indecipherable] you know, it’s way difficult.</span> <span id="s287">And to get there somebody orientation, and that made for that -- made a -- a youth career very difficult.</span> <span id="s288">Next -- The next generation certainly didn’t have these problems any longer, because they looked, and they had economic progress, and some put -- a positive [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s289">But in that situation of the ultimate decay of all moral radius, and also of national radius, and up, the Germans of that time, certainly was completely a national, and without any engagement, and a famous mentality as -- that’s like signified by the word onimish.</span> <span id="s290">That means, without my participation, and no, they wouldn’t engage themselves.</span> <span id="s291">They were totally isolated people.</span> <span id="s292">And this situation, I think, is what youngsters, I think, are quite -- quite exceptional, and quite important.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I think it had a negative impact, insofar as I -- I was -- it was difficult to adapt me to conditions, which I -- already existed, and made me in a way -- in a way a critic -- a -- a critic of traditionalism, yes, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Was it equally difficult for your -- for your twin brother?</span> <span id="s296">There he was -- A: Oh certainly, that’s the same experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Yeah, the same.</span> <span id="s298">Do you have a recollection when you and your brother, and your other brothers knew about the genocide, and about the killing of groups, o-other than Jews?</span> <span id="s299">I mean, that there was this mass death?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well, that became immediately known a -- Q: After?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: -- b-by the American re-orientation, and re-education, immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s302">Then it bees -- became quite clear, you know?</span> <span id="s303">Before that, they didn’t really know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: So you must have been in -- in enormous shock from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, you know, that was -- there was a lot of shocks all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s306">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: It -- It has to be put into the context of -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: -- the loss of the total political ori-orientation.</span> <span id="s309">And as historian, I was -- I add, you know, that at the time of the Nuremberg trials, the Holocaust in it’s reality, wasn’t really in the minds, you know.</span> <span id="s310">Even Americans didn’t realize that this was the biggest crime by the regime, and still people like Odeelok Lobochnick could be witnesses at a -- at a trial, instead of being persecuted by themselves.</span> <span id="s311">You know, it’s very symptomatic.</span> <span id="s312">But you know, step by step, that became quite clear, and certainly the -- but the -- the American films on the concentration camps, Bergen-Belsen and so on, were more known than the Holocaust, because the Holocaust was far away, you know, and the myth I think persevered, that -- that this was nothing that the German people was related to, and it took us, as historians many, many -- and you as many years to get that into the [indecipherable] where the Holocaust was not, if I went -- done by -- performed by Himmler and his chieftain.</span> <span id="s313">It was also a lot of people involved.</span> <span id="s314">But I don’t know, maybe the -- you’re a bit more, but I re-recollect, you know, that -- you know there -- these typical anti-sem -- anti-Semitic songs sung in the -- in the -- in the Hitler youth, I think we didn’t realize what we were singing.</span> <span id="s315">And sometimes it was corrected , then there is one of the essentials today belongs as Germany, and -- and -- and tomorrow the whole world, you know, it was corrected, and it will say that it’s only today will be -- will be heard by Germany, and tomorrow by the whole world, you know.</span> <span id="s316">Some of these guys in my hired entourage, they thought that this couldn’t be -- couldn’t be really real, and by that they changed that you know, that’s certainly exceptional.</span> <span id="s317">But that also shows -- show now, as a historian, I’ve learned that, you know, people do not reflect too much the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s318">If they would, you know, the main problem of the Third Reich is that the Third Reich was successful in preventing the people to have any time and leisure, in order to reflect.</span> <span id="s319">If they would have had the possibility, then I think that -- I think the whole thing would be proten down.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s321">You think that was on purpose, the way in which the --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, it was not so much on purpose, but it was a -- was a mentality of the party.</span> <span id="s323">You know, if you have such an organization which relies on continuous dynamics, you know, and they have a feeling, if there is no longer any dynamic, then there’s nothing left, you know.</span> <span id="s324">And I run all this theory that there is a -- a connection between the Munich agreement, which meant that Hitler couldn’t have his little war against Besarakia, and the party we have forgotten, stood on alert all the time, well -- because they just thought they would have a per -- a permanent role in the war later on, that it was dropped anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">And the Reich’s Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s326">Because, exactly at a moment then, the German people believe now we c -- got a bit more quiet situation, and the peace is -- is rescued and so on.</span> <span id="s327">Then it’s like a logical reaction of the party, was to push the Jewish question ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: There’s a psychologic connection bet -- between both events.</span> <span id="s330">You have a radical assession especially in situations in which otherwise, that would happen -- who would come into being a stable, political situation.</span> <span id="s331">And then -- then they -- you know, their unrest, their inability to -- to wait, or something like that, could use a certainly dynamics, and the steady mobilization, and it -- so far, I think it wasn’t a -- a deliberate policy, but it was a specific political style they had only learned in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s332">That would be my theory.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: At the end of the war, does your father have to go through de-Nazification, because he was a member of the party?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes, he -- he -- he had some -- Q: And what did --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: -- problems because -- well, that is a very difficult story.</span> <span id="s336">First of all, he had -- he had some problem because he had American students, and one of them was a man who was in the headquarters of Eisenhower, and he got the unfortunate -- unfortunate idea to ask him whether he should take the position of Minister of cultures in -- in the -- the land of Hessia, because it was a reformer of the university system in the 20’s and the [indecipherable], all the colleagues did everything to get him out of that, but that also put so much [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s337">Then there was an American CID officer, he is still existing, he is politic -- political scientist in California.</span> <span id="s338">He ist -- came from Vienna, and you won’t believe it, he wanted to press my father to support ESED.</span> <span id="s339">He was a leftist.</span> <span id="s340">And after my father declined, then he wrote a terrible expertise on him, and that dis-destroyed his career.</span> <span id="s341">He was losing his office, he had problems with the de-Nazification o -- although at the end he -- he was acquitted, but it took him like a couple of years, and so that -- that affected the kids, because all of the years he didn’t have any income.</span> <span id="s342">So now you take a family from a upper, bourgeois class, with that background, and suddenly there is no money at all.</span> <span id="s343">It was very difficult for them.</span> <span id="s344">It was difficult for us, too.</span> <span id="s345">Later on, it -- that wasn’t so -- so important.</span> <span id="s346">But if that -- if Major Dorn wouldn’t have that wonderful idea, you know, it would have been better for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So how did you survive?</span> <span id="s348">Did you lose your house, or were you able to ge --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No, we didn’t lose our house, but well, it was -- it was very, very difficult, and certainly we -- we sold everything what we could, and so on, and Fritz, that was the older brother, he was able to -- to use a black market, and so on, and somehow that worked, but only somehow, it was very hard time.</span> <span id="s350">And I think it wasn’t just -- it was really bad.</span> <span id="s351">And now with that becomes a little bit known, because people are doing some research on the Marburg University, it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s352">Well, it’s interesting sa -- that case, you know, because most all these people, all these professors, [indecipherable] officers, only very, very few were thrown out, but in this case, it was very bitter.</span> <span id="s353">But that was -- well, for me it was very interesting then, and Major Dorn came and then what’s her name, other man who runs for many years, he asked me [indecipherable] Berlin.</span> <span id="s354">Had a moment, forget a name, also.</span> <span id="s355">You know, I never forget a -- suddenly there comes in an American officer, first time I see an American officer in uniform in so on, it was very impressive.</span> <span id="s356">I was 14, and then they -- when came, you know, before the war ended, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Because the war ended in [indecipherable] with big slayeron you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s359">It’s a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s360">And they had started with my father, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: It was -- so Mr. Sweezy [indecipherable] who then was in Prame, and wa -- was the only one who accepted the antifar committees, and so on, which existed in Germany by that time.</span> <span id="s363">Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: How long was it before you were able to go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well, I think we could continue in school.</span> <span id="s366">That was interrupted anyhow, half a year, because the Americans got that crazy idea, just to have a collective taking into custody of all people who had a title rat.</span> <span id="s367">The German word is rat, and means counselor, th -- you know, that’s in the German civil service, and there was a position, but then suddenly all the teachers sat in the internment camps, and the [indecipherable] was -- was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Whether we were Nazis or not, you know, that was a really crazy idea, and it took time, then to -- to put the school system into function again, and so on.</span> <span id="s369">By that, I lost a year in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: But then the -- we stayed in the school, and later on there was some improvement.</span> <span id="s372">I don’t know why that was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Let me ask you again, maybe I missed it.</span> <span id="s374">Did your father ever get back to teaching, or was his career --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, he wud -- there was a compromise, and he gots a -- got an emeritus on that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes, that was it.</span> <span id="s378">But he was giving lectures all the time as emeritus.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s380">And does that mean he was also getting a salary as an emeritus?</span> <span id="s381">A: Yes, he got some pensions, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Some pensions.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: -- but the problem was that -- that in the meantime the very nice colleagues had to put somebody on his chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: And after the teenis vacation trial was finished, he -- the chair was -- was not available, and that was it, you know.</span> <span id="s386">And I had to study with that man, I didn’t like that man much, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s387">Now it turns out that he had way close relations with the SS apparatus, that man, the Fritz Wagner, you know, who ended that chair.</span> <span id="s388">But he was uni -- unisancta of the Catholic organization, and that had a much influence at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: D-Do you recall, if you can be a witness to this, that this experience of your father was very depressing for him.</span> <span id="s390">Did he change because of this, or did -- was this just --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, he tried to write books, but in a way it was reda -- really depressing for him</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s393">I would imagine.</span> <span id="s394">Did you know for, I don’t know, a long time, that you wanted to go into history, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: W-We certainly didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s396">We tried to avoid it, because of the family, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">And Wolfgang, he started physics, and -- but he was still interested in philosophy and the -- and philosophy of history, and suddenly he was a historian.</span> <span id="s398">And I started German language, and everything, but suddenly I was a historian.</span> <span id="s399">Maybe we had a -- in the years when the father was with our business, we also, all the time, helped him to write many books, and so on.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t know, but anyhow, we both wer -- became historians, although we don’t wanted to become it.</span> <span id="s401">Well that -- that happens, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: So you’re a reluctant historian.</span> <span id="s403">A: I had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Had been a reluctant historian.</span> <span id="s405">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And your two older brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes, the oldest one, he was archivist, but he had a -- certainly some trouble to gain a position, because it was -- he had to study, then later on, you know, he was already rather old, and what he -- when -- he lived on his whistle, I guess.</span> <span id="s408">The next one got a Protestant priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s410">So, once you started in your reluctant career, what did you start studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Whe -- How -- How did you move into history?</span> <span id="s412">What was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well, we -- we would study many -- in two fields, or two and a half fields in Germany, and did Communistic, and as a second field, history, and at first I was at Marburg, and the only field in history which was interesting, was Medieval history, and certainly modern history was also there.</span> <span id="s414">The Fritz Wagner, whom I didn’t like very much, as you can imagine -- although I had examinations with him, I’ll never forget it, because he was really fearful, you know.</span> <span id="s415">In a way he didn’t -- he didn’t want to make blunders in the examination.</span> <span id="s416">Now -- And by that I -- I got a Medievalist, and then I made my exam there.</span> <span id="s417">I wrote a examination paper, which I deft -- I think quite interesting besides, on the development of the region in the west of the Rhine, which is to ca -- today called the naicowanda.</span> <span id="s418">But that didn’t fit into the theories of my professor, and he gave me only a B minus.</span> <span id="s419">And I decided then I’ll leave that, and go to teebing, to Hans Rodefass, about that I went back to contemporary history, and certainly to the Tside cacheefta essensasencherm.</span> <span id="s420">That means the history of National Socialism, although I did my dissertation work on the nationality problem in the Hapsburg monarchy, and the period between 18 -- 1867 and 1907, which was quite interesting, and certainly had a lot to do with the German Czech relations at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I’m going to stop the tape now, so they can change tapes.</span> <span id="s422">A: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: And we’ll take a slight break.</span> <span id="s424">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Mr. Mommsen, during the break you started talking more about your own naïveté.</span> <span id="s427">So before we go back to your career, talk -- talk a little bit about what that reflection feels like, that you were so -- you say about yourself that you were so naïve about what was going on.</span> <span id="s428">You didn’t notice.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Well, as a youngster, you wouldn’t notice so much, and we were not polit -- very political.</span> <span id="s430">And if you are living in a situation where -- no-nobody would talk about that, then certainly some naïveté is arising.</span> <span id="s431">I told that I d-didn’t know what Jews are, what Jewish life is, that in the post-war years there, it took me awhile to realize not only that there was the Holocaust, and the Jewish persecution, that was easy, but -- but that Jews were interesting individuals, you know, because you have to -- we’re living in a German little town, Jews would d-disappear from the city, you wouldn’t know who they -- where they -- wh-where are Jews, and even those Jews who lived there we-were not discernible, and were the -- they would cut all communications to the so-called Aryan population.</span> <span id="s432">By that, if you grow up as a kid, Jews didn't have any arriello -- idea of what that -- that was, you know.</span> <span id="s433">And certainly I was told that we were su-surviving as a -- as a -- babies, because of a Jewish professor, who was a junior colleggest -- trolegest, and knew what to do with early birds, and so on, and we knew that there was a lot of Jewish colleagues, and the father told us about that, but you know, that was no all reality of the Jews -- y-you didn’t know much about that.</span> <span id="s434">I think that was very symptomatic for my age cohorder, yeah.</span> <span id="s435">And that they certainly were told in the Hitler youth, there was a Jewish question something, in Moscow, or somewhere, but they never realized that it’s our Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Certainly those people who were with the olderunder -- really understood what was going on inorise Crystal Night, and so on.</span> <span id="s437">They must have realized that, you know.</span> <span id="s438">That -- But that is also part of what I -- I mentioned earlier, of that incremental depolitization.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: You mention in the break that you had gone into a kosher restaurant, you didn’t even realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: In Genna yes, that was in the 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Wha-What -- What significance -- Did you eat there?</span> <span id="s442">Or did you sw -- A: I think so, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s444">And it had no -- you didn’t -- this was not a different -- this was just a -- A: I didn’t know much about Jewish life, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: You know, nobody had told me about that.</span> <span id="s447">I didn’t -- I didn’t realize that --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: -- bef -- before I was there, you know.</span> <span id="s450">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s451">So it’s hard to --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I didn’t have any pressure to this, not at all, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s454">But it’s hard to know what’s missing when it’s missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: A chit -- you know, the whole -- the whole time, mention of Jewish life had disappeared in our minds, and now that was no longer existing.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s457">So, when did you come to decide that you would study the period of National Socialism?</span> <span id="s458">How did it happen that you decided that?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was running the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went into the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary history, in Munich.</span> <span id="s460">And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business.</span> <span id="s461">But think that’s not all, but it’s very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they just we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of Adolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my fellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand the seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime, after 1934, and studied that.</span> <span id="s462">That is, I think a typical process.</span> <span id="s463">And the following generation then, would look into 19th century.</span> <span id="s464">What are the basic reasons for the German way -- for the deformation of German politics.</span> <span id="s465">That was when, signified by the so-called Beedafeld school.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: And how do you understand the -- th-the -- if -- if you could summarize the sort of historiography of what’s going on in Germany, and how historians are trying to understand the Nazi era.</span> <span id="s467">Are there very clear demarcations as you see them, in how people are studying this, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, the deka -- a lot of demarcation lines.</span> <span id="s469">In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the early post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or i-in history, certainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary history, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know.</span> <span id="s470">And then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the suppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance, which we call the other Germany, and in the midst were also some people, but you know, this tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one.</span> <span id="s471">And that was mixed then with the fear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and the predominant role of Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s472">That was the old position, which I think was prevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60’s.</span> <span id="s473">Now there happened one change that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967.</span> <span id="s474">And our generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the files, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg trials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses.</span> <span id="s475">We looked into the files, and we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the contradiction within a system, and that’s why the -- but then developed it -- a quite different understanding of how the regime functioned then.</span> <span id="s476">For instance, Hans Roadface or Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation.</span> <span id="s477">And they also -- the so-called Functionalist school emerged.</span> <span id="s478">I belonged to the Functionalist school.</span> <span id="s479">I would certainly point it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to -- to say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything happened like that, it’s nonsense.</span> <span id="s480">And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler in the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the responsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that was, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and the perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put Jews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or the -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect to the Jewish persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Let me ask -- L-Let’s go talk a little bit about -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: -- the Functionalist - Intentionalist -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: -- debate.</span> <span id="s484">On the one had, the Intentionalist can often be considered to be Apologists, but there are many Jews, there are many victims who are very sympathetic with that view.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Well, I know that, you know -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that [indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been developed by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas.</span> <span id="s487">That has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">And certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of ideas, you know.</span> <span id="s489">But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social history.</span> <span id="s490">But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas.</span> <span id="s491">Therefore, they have one bias in that direction.</span> <span id="s492">Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of the creation of the state of Israel, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">And so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept what already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that policy.</span> <span id="s494">It’s very, very comprehensible that they don’t want to have these very trivial elements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a difficult time if they talk to those people.</span> <span id="s495">Although we say one can’t explain everything where the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that element of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole -- whole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you know.</span> <span id="s496">Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a Structuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he suddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn’t work with the Intentionalist explanation, which he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate with them, you know.</span> <span id="s497">At that time, he was in another camp.</span> <span id="s498">But today, most of the researchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of explanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had that [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are even more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the process, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a moral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know.</span> <span id="s499">And my generation, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of Himmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term.</span> <span id="s500">For fear they seduced the German nation, you know.</span> <span id="s501">That was your -- the main argument.</span> <span id="s502">And we started to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I certainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen?</span> <span id="s503">And certainly I would argue then -- your argument -- I can’t go to the next generation and say there was some stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that’s why they killed five million Jews.</span> <span id="s504">I don’t think that this is sufficient.</span> <span id="s505">It seems to be real plausible, but then it’s not plausible by -- because why could one man do that?</span> <span id="s506">And so on, we’re -- in a way we have to describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function.</span> <span id="s507">And so far, I think in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both fronts, I think have overcome.</span> <span id="s508">There’s just the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to some ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some experience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he originally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea that it’s not so important.</span> <span id="s509">Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question, but that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion of a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Is -- Is the functional -- Was the functional -- I don’t know, my study of history would s - - would suggest to me that this is a very odd dichotomy.</span> <span id="s511">I don’t know of any other event where all of this -- where you have this -- is it a kind of fake dichotomy?</span> <span id="s512">How do you not talk about ideas, and how do you not talk about the structure in terms of which these ideas function?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: That’s okay, but you know, there is some difference.</span> <span id="s514">You know, the terms have been coined by Jim Mason at a conference near Lornan many years ago, when there was -- was a clear cut, I think, distinction of the -- of the explanation between something like a history of ideas, and something like social history, that’s different, you know?</span> <span id="s515">And so far, that was also related to the explanation of the field, and certainly the whole metalogical difference wouldn’t play such a big role if they wa-wouldn’t have been loden with some role -- with some moral legacies, you know.</span> <span id="s516">Because the Germans need a strong Hitler, because if Hitler would be weak, they can’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s517">I never forgot that famous Louden conference, where there was a discussion where Hitler could preserve his rule for so long, it was very long, in a way, while he was -- I coined that formula, in some respects, a weak dictator.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And certainly I wasn’t tact all the time, because u -- I always thought I would defend Hitler, I didn’t want to -- want to, but turn out that with the -- that the emotional element, that was very symptomatic, and then I said, really, look, if you have a dictatorship, then it’s really likely that perseveres.</span> <span id="s520">Take Idi Amin.</span> <span id="s521">Oh, I was already wint by that, because that violated the chair of national pride.</span> <span id="s522">We want to have a strong Hitler, not Idi Amin, now that -- that shouldn’t be done, you know.</span> <span id="s523">That’s a basic background, all that, and to understand that, one has to come back to what we talked about, where the Germans would take the personality of Hitler out of the responsibility of the crimes and decay, because they preverse them -- pre-preserve them something like icon for their national identity.</span> <span id="s524">Now, in 1945, they certainly got aware that this was wrong.</span> <span id="s525">And not -- now the emotion turned against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: And if then somebody like Hans Mommsen [indecipherable] the other week in Germany, Hitler was not only the subject, but also the object of politics.</span> <span id="s528">You get immediately a very angry criticisms, even by -- by very good historians.</span> <span id="s529">Karl Dietrich baha -- he immediately wrote and said, “How can you say that Hitler’s objects are [indecipherable]”.</span> <span id="s530">Well, why not, you know.</span> <span id="s531">If you talk that -- If you talk about that in England or America, it’s not so difficult, be -- but there is a -- apologetic element, the emotional elements, which I think are guided the debate, and also the research.</span> <span id="s532">And that’s why we have that -- that’s not only a metalogic distinction, or dim -- different starting point, but they had then this controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists.</span> <span id="s533">That is certainly gone with the next generation, which doesn’t have that necessity to defend in a way, indirectly, the Germans [indecipherable] pointing out the manipulative character of Nazi dictatorship and all that.</span> <span id="s534">But they needed, in order to believe that they had been seduced.</span> <span id="s535">Certainly the opposite was true, they made Hitler, they in turn wanted to use him certainly then Hitler used them, you know, but that still proves with which certainly they -- nobody would reject them outright, but th-they are not very convenient.</span> <span id="s536">And then so far, I think I am still not too old fashioned [indecipherable] an old historian, you know.</span> <span id="s537">The next generation certainly doesn’t have that problem.</span> <span id="s538">They don’t see also this specific constellation under which we developing contemporary history.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Let me ask you about a quote from your piece, and from Vimar, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s540">You say that the Nazi system of rule completely lacked internal coherence.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Can you explain that for our --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Well, you know, there was a Sherman Oaks, one of the leading English experts in the field, and he talked about the re-organization of the party in 1932, in December 1932, immediately before the seizure of power, and he then said that from then on, they had 37 different territories, with a rather independent Gauleiter, and so far, as they can do what they want.</span> <span id="s544">And you know, the problem is -- is not coordination within the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Everybody can act, everybody can make initiatives and so on, as far as that stays, as they accept the authority, or the prestige abi -- Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s546">And the thing we have to do with the specific style of Nazi politics -- it’s very difficult, especially for a European say, Americans are better, to understand this regime, which doesn’t have any institutionalized governmental board, or some representation.</span> <span id="s547">But after 1937, we don’t have a cabinet, there is no political discourse between the different ministries.</span> <span id="s548">We don’t have that on the party side either.</span> <span id="s549">There is nothing which would integrate diverging political interests, in sa -- in the -- the very diverging politic interests are then -- are brought to conflict or not, is by personal feuds.</span> <span id="s550">That’s the reason why everybody among the Nazi regime hates the others.</span> <span id="s551">And some of the later Gauleiter would say if Hitler -- Himmler comes into my territory, my gow, I will imprison him, you know.</span> <span id="s552">They hated -- They hated each other, you know.</span> <span id="s553">And the whole system is built on that -- watha -- non-structure.</span> <span id="s554">At the same time, you have a system of non-communication.</span> <span id="s555">If you were in the high position of that regime, let’s say you are the secretary of state in your [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s556">You know something, but you don’t know everything.</span> <span id="s557">The case of Mr. Kritchinger, who was a -- a member of the confessor -- confessing church, but he -- he was present at the Wannsee conference.</span> <span id="s558">Was really took -- Because he didn’t get a clear cut picture of the Holocaust before, I think the middle of 1942.</span> <span id="s559">And then he wanted to get dismissed, and the lama said, “No, no, stay.</span> <span id="s560">It would be better if you stay here,” you know.</span> <span id="s561">And there was a systematic non-communication.</span> <span id="s562">In the newspaper, you wouldn’t get the necessary information of what was really going on, and then there was the so-called shtimmelsburchter report of the securities service, made by -- these so -- should in a way replace them -- lack of information for the leading functionaries within this history -- s -- within the system.</span> <span id="s563">But after they became inconvenient, because of too many inconvenient trusay they also were no longer permitted.</span> <span id="s564">Where did you get information from?</span> <span id="s565">It’s very easy to read today the d-diary of Goebbels, and you see that even Goebbels, who is at a [indecipherable] sometimes at a [indecipherable] the system, because they’re changed all the time, he isn’t very well informed about important ada -- aspects of politics.</span> <span id="s566">And that is a -- cer -- specific nature of that regime.</span> <span id="s567">And we have th -- we have also a travelma, to prove who was then really responsible for the onicol, because that happened, and there was no precise mechanism.</span> <span id="s568">And you know, I point that out, no-not only -- not to say that people were not responsible for what they were doing, you know, but to explain why there was no opposition, you know.</span> <span id="s569">And it -- In the question of the Holocaust, there could have been opposition on the side of the army, or other groups, not because they were not anti-Jewish, I wouldn’t say that, but because of th -- the ta -- c-competing interests, because Jews the -- a certain amount of -- of manpower and resources in order to do the -- the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s570">Cosponick has shown that in 1943, they had 300 men just to liquidate Jews in the east -- and the whole army at that time has only 1,000,800.</span> <span id="s571">You know?</span> <span id="s572">But under those specific ambivalent condition, where you didn’t have any institutional set of politics, then something like Holocaust could occur.</span> <span id="s573">That’s a tatrol out of the analysis, and I’ve had this also a conclusion which may have -- be some importance for future events, because genocidal acts usually would come into being, if there is no clear cut command structure, not the other way around.</span> <span id="s574">If we look at Vietnam, we know that we will -- certainly that could be it -- not -- no comparable level, but you know, certainly, if we look at the Holocaust, we also look helpul existence are like, which would then be a -- able to be per-perverted in that direction, that there is no protest against the destruction of all the foundations of law, and destruction of all the radius, which is certainly accompanying the implementation of the Holocaust, according to my conviction.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: But that is somewhat counter to what one might think, right?</span> <span id="s576">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: That there -- Is there no notion that this is what somebody wants to be done, even if there’s no clear cut order?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: There is certainly -- well, that’s -- the long run, they got accustomed to get rid of the Jews, and suddenly they learned, under the conditions of the occupied Soviet territory, where the recent study said a -- under certain conditions, then certainly then, see that it’s possible, that it’s the easiest thing just to kill those people.</span> <span id="s579">First, before that, they want to have some reservations, solutions, that turn out to be impossible, and so on, and at the end it was for them, the easy d -- way, to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s580">And after they had started with that, then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business, and then they had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could find in Ukraine, or elsewhere.</span> <span id="s581">You know, that is really in -- that is -- well, impresses me a lot, and well there you have then the marriage between Nazi fanatism, and Prussian state tradition, and this terrible affect -- affectivity of the Germans.</span> <span id="s582">Other nations would have just said, well that in -- why -- we -- we -- th-that -- that’s not interesting for us.</span> <span id="s583">But the Germans, and the way they are on a problem, then they do that up to the way and -- and they hold icemen so he shows that that is still -- that business of killing the Hungarian Jews, after he had a counter order, obviously a counter order by Himmler, you know, that’s very symptomatic for that process.</span> <span id="s584">And it -- so far, we have not only to do with anti-Semitic moderation, but also with attitudes which are things stemming from the Prussian state tradition, in a way.</span> <span id="s585">-- murdered Fromme, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: And do you really think there’s something very special about the German state, and the -- and Prussian history, given all the help that Germany got doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, I wouldn’t overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly there is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the authoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill the expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can see that with their example, the Reich’s Crystal Night, and all the -- the German population protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of November already, and the eighth, and so on.</span> <span id="s588">But then the Gestapo gave the explicit order that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s589">That was a state measure, they accepted that, you know?</span> <span id="s590">This is a strange element.</span> <span id="s591">Law and order can work under certain conditions.</span> <span id="s592">That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can support Nazi policy.</span> <span id="s593">And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded in getting these European Jewry from the last isle in Greece, or elsewhere.</span> <span id="s594">You know, it’s really nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world.</span> <span id="s595">In that respect I think it’s uniquely German.</span> <span id="s596">Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some heritage from Germany to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- to a -- I think complete, and that’s, I think one specific element.</span> <span id="s597">But, on the other hand, we’re starting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing results [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Do you think that people -- that historians now are more accepting of your view of -- of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Well, I think it’s gone -- it’s -- everybody is of that opinion, because w -- you know, we know more documents.</span> <span id="s600">We know that Hitler didn’t -- didn’t -- he was a ideological motor all the time, especially in the Jewish question.</span> <span id="s601">But, on the other hand, he didn’t always push things ahead, and now it turns out that also the Wannsee conference has to be interpreted in a somewhat different context.</span> <span id="s602">The main problem of Heydrich, besides of getting, or increasing his competence for the so-called Jewish question, was that he didn’t want to proceed with the Nuremberg laws, and hi -- difference between Jews and half Jews, and Jews living in mixed marriages, you know, that very complicated system, to distinguish between a more assimilated, and a less assimilating [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Because, certainly on the one hand, a party from the star wanted to include everybody who was of Jewish descent, up to the quarter Jew, and to the -- all the first -- the [indecipherable] exclusion from Germany, and later on the liquidation.</span> <span id="s604">And the problem arose that Hitler didn’t want to change the Nuremberg laws, and he was not following the suggestions of Heydrich, and Himmler, and the so-called mishling question, the -- the k -- the question of -- how do you say that in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews.</span> <span id="s607">And Heydrich invited the ministers to the Wannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries, and the Reich chancellor, which were involved.</span> <span id="s608">In order then to press on Hitler, to get the approval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s609">And Hitler at that point was a -- was something like a brake.</span> <span id="s610">Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he didn’t change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp -- unpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s611">And he was less strict in that issue than Heydrich, and Himmler and others.</span> <span id="s612">That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite a new meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the question of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role.</span> <span id="s613">And by that, he over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by Heydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what was going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big street between Lublin and -- and Kraków.</span> <span id="s614">And from there he had a -- Jewish labor camps, and where he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned in this speech by Heydrich.</span> <span id="s615">Because 20 days later he would, in Prague, still talk about all the deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the Icemeer region, where the Gestapo wanted to have a -- it’s own territory, and a continuing the archy period in the gulag.</span> <span id="s616">You know, that was really simple.</span> <span id="s617">But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly everything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic liquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference.</span> <span id="s618">And you know, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations by now, but certainly that doesn’t change anything in the very terrible development, and the criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible.</span> <span id="s619">And certainly the problem still is that -- that it’s not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly he’s supporting that all the time.</span> <span id="s620">The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Certainly I -- I wouldn’t say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn’t want to know too much.</span> <span id="s622">And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings and him, Hitler, as everybody assumed.</span> <span id="s623">But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the case.</span> <span id="s624">Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a flight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">That was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history.</span> <span id="s626">Well, is that some sufficient explanation of your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yes, you did.</span> <span id="s628">Let me ask you about your involvement with studying Hannah Arant, because you seem much more sympathetic than many historians.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s630">Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Which --</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Well, at that time, this was very difficult to get anybody who was ready to talk about Hannah Arant in Israel, and -- forget it.</span> <span id="s633">And also Hans Wartfels, he was a clear cut opponent of Hannah Arant.</span> <span id="s634">Why’d I think Hannah Arant had some good points?</span> <span id="s635">We know today that this was not very reliable, that he used the book of Raoul Hillberg to a good part, and that he -- that she, you know, all the time tends to -- to overshoot the mark, you know, and so on, but in general I think she was right with the main thesis [indecipherable] available.</span> <span id="s636">And all that certainly was a problem that is so difficult to understand for the survivor side.</span> <span id="s637">I do understand that very well, while that issue on the -- Raoul -- of the Jewish council, I think have been otherwise too [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s638">But the main problem certainly is that, in fact, Iseman was very active, but he was on the other hand not a man who [indecipherable] and new research has found out that Iseman comes into that business first because of the resettlement of the ethnic Germans in 1939, because of the German-Soviet agreement.</span> <span id="s639">And he is responsible for the interpretation of the pillars, and the Jews, and other groups from Vladica, in order to resettle the Germans there.</span> <span id="s640">And there they make their first experiences, and by that they are working for the establishment of the greater German Reich, and that’s not only that negative element, and later on you know everything in that [indecipherable] resettlement in [indecipherable] affairs, and it didn’t work, but then something like an overcompensation down there, work very hard and honor -- at least -- at least, to implement the Holocaust, they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">You know, I think that’s a psychological mechanism, it’s very important to give an interpretation of the group of the -- of the local and regional perpetrators.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: How do you understand -- I have seen, over the years, not a lessening of anger at her -- at Hannah Arant, but in some sense an enlargement of the anger.</span> <span id="s643">When the book came out about her relationship with Heideger, it gave people even more reason to --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, but change, the -- the other year, I have been in Jerusalem, they had on a scolley conference on Hannah Arant, and they took over the admiration of Hannah Arant, which is I think symptomatic for the United States, we would be more critical in Germany.</span> <span id="s645">And her problem certainly is that both sides don’t understand that Hannah Arant is basically influenced by the [indecipherable] your Conservative -- tism.</span> <span id="s646">Which is different from bigots.</span> <span id="s647">One has to know that in order to understand Hannah Arant.</span> <span id="s648">In all her theories, you know, of the philasinhite, of the loneliness of man, and then there comes back the -- a model -- that the Jews are the model for the world population.</span> <span id="s649">Well, and if you look in a German idea, there’s philosophy of the 19th century of Fishter, and all these people, you suddenly get it, that’s her.</span> <span id="s650">But she t -- I think masschoserv has to be a pragmatic philosopher, she is not.</span> <span id="s651">Therefore --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s653">No, she’s an idealist -</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: She is -- Well, about an -- with that crazy mixture, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: And a -- a -- th-- the easer -- it is -- don’t understand that either, I think we -- I -- according to my opinion.</span> <span id="s657">I am not a specialist for Hannah Arant, but I met her.</span> <span id="s658">I never forget when I met her, because I was invited by American history department of the Columbia University.</span> <span id="s659">When was that?</span> <span id="s660">In 70 -- in ’78, I think or ’74.</span> <span id="s661">And my wife was there, and that was in affecta club of the Columbia University.</span> <span id="s662">And they had very bad organizer, sadly it turned out that also Henry Freidlander was invited to deliver-liver a lecture, and then they decided that we had each a half an hour rather than hour lectures.</span> <span id="s663">[indecipherable] care.</span> <span id="s664">And there were about 200 people there, once was very lively, and then suddenly somebody entered the room, that was Hannah Arant.</span> <span id="s665">I saw they knew her from the television, that was very clear.</span> <span id="s666">The whole atmosphere changed immediately, the -- the talk silenced down.</span> <span id="s667">She was there, you know, that was -- she had a radiation, no problem, no.</span> <span id="s668">Then we had to give our papers, then she said, “Well, both papers are very bad.”</span> <span id="s669">This is wrong, that is wrong, she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s670">But anyhow -- And after that -- that was finished, the debate, I went with Wilfreda to her, and said hello, and she invited us immediately to go to her flat that was in Riverside Drive.</span> <span id="s671">And I forgot that she took a cab for that 300 meters or something, but that was the time there that was still very dangerous, you know.</span> <span id="s672">And then we were sitting there until two in the night, and that was -- that didn’t change much, there were all the papers of her husband still there, the name of the husband at the entrance to the flat, and we had a very, very interesting talk.</span> <span id="s673">And she was really good, I never forgot it.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about what you talked about, and what it was like?</span> <span id="s675">A: Not a problem, it’s difficult to say what we talk.</span> <span id="s676">Certainly we reported a lot about Germany, German history and so on, and possibly she was a receiver more than -- I have to talk with my wife, she is better in recollecting these things, I don’t know, but I only recollect that th -- the -- the graduation of her personality, and on the other hand, you know, she had learned in Germany that openness of the American academics, you know?</span> <span id="s677">Immediately you talk about what you’re doing, what you want to do, and so on.</span> <span id="s678">She was really good, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So you were impressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: I was very much impressed, and also from the surrounding, these many books and papers, who knows, was a lit -- anything but orderly, and I think she didn’t change too much since her husband died, and well -- and so far, I was very much impressed by her.</span> <span id="s681">That didn’t much influence what -- what my -- because I -- I wrote about the Eichmann trial bukfa earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Th-That was far before she -- I met her then, and I was not influenced personally, but I think that she had some good points at -- at that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Had she read what you had written?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: She must have known -- at least she knew who I was, you know.</span> <span id="s686">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s688">I don’t remember that, you know.</span> <span id="s689">But I never got, you know, the openness and she was really ready to -- to talk with us, in spite of the criticism of that paper, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Tell me how you -- We all -- I don’t know what I want to say, suffered through the Goldhagen controversy.</span> <span id="s691">Is there -- Was there something about that book that both took on the Intentionalists, and the Functionalists together, trying to come up with the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Well, it was quite good, because you know, there was a [indecipherable] written by -- what is this Stuttgart destroy, and again, and a mountain -- and he -- bec -- and he criticized then, or could ha -- was criticized to be a hyper-Intentionalist.</span> <span id="s693">And that was quite true.</span> <span id="s694">And -- But that all my enemies, you know, say -- opponents, they would then argue with Functionalist arguments against Goldhagen.</span> <span id="s695">And that was in a way, the end of the Intentionalist school.</span> <span id="s696">Even if you take what the -- what the -- what Chris Browning said there, you know what, all the Functionalists are the ones against Goldhagen, and Goldhagen in a way, you know, by -- by expanding the Intentionalist position to the utmost, you know, it des -- he destroyed it, you know.</span> <span id="s697">And so far, it was in the -- it was quite interesting.</span> <span id="s698">I know him very well, I met him first in ’85, in a conference which was run in Berkeley by Gary Feldman, and there he delivered a paper on the [indecipherable] republic, and he was very, very critical about [indecipherable] republican said there was still extreme anti-Semitism, which he would deny today, and he had, for instance, this strange conclusion that in the Secret Service, there are more party members than have been in the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s699">You know, so I mean, that may be true, and so far, as nobody could enter the Secret Service in the Third Reich, there was no member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s700">But you know, he really thought that the [indecipherable] republic was completely Nazi party, and anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s701">And then later on, you -- now, his publisher told him not to tell that, and Jerry Feldman -- Gary Feldman should publish that conference, I ne -- I met him in Oxford, and said, “What’s with the conference?”</span> <span id="s702">“Yes,” he said, “I don’t have yet the paper of -- of Daniel Goldhagen.”</span> <span id="s703">I say, “You will never get it,” you know, he would -- he’s [indecipherable] himself, he’s doing that.</span> <span id="s704">And I never forgot I said to him, “Well, Daniel, if you go to my class and [indecipherable] on the other hand that we are sympathetic to you, they wouldn’t accept that, you would have hard time.”</span> <span id="s705">And that impressed him a little.</span> <span id="s706">And then I met him at a conference in -- on Hannah Arant, and others -- other things in -- in Harvard.</span> <span id="s707">And we are sitting on a panel and he attacked me sharply and [indecipherable] republic, I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s708">On the same line, you know, that anti-Semitism is still there, and there -- course, when I was answering, I said to the -- to the [indecipherable] also, you got it from the audience, anti-Semitism is still hanging, you know, it was really -- it was a really not a very friendly climate.</span> <span id="s709">Then I said to the audience, well people, you must know the German Jew, the younger generation is doing anything to study the Holocaust, and to go to Israel, and to improve the German Jewish relations, it’s not fair if you say that.</span> <span id="s710">And I never forget that someday you tha -- that mud change, you know, that was clear, that this was no longer the topic, German anti- Semitism.</span> <span id="s711">And then he told them -- I invited him for dinner, and he told me what he wanted to do in Germany, the whole [indecipherable] things, so and so on.</span> <span id="s712">I know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Know?</span> <span id="s714">Well, in a way, I glad that he got a prisoner of his own thesis, and of the whole affair, because I don’t see that he has an academic future by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Because, as y -- he -- I know, the father very well, ri -- when I was in Harvard, I met the father several times.</span> <span id="s717">That was in ’72, and I also met that -- the very young Daniel, you know.</span> <span id="s718">It’s -- It’s -- In a way it’s a pity, and the book is so terribly bad, from the -- from the scholarly viewpoint.</span> <span id="s719">It’s not a -- so much a problem with the position, but he doesn’t know anything about folkish anti-Semitism, and you know, it’s quite interesting, where did he got his idea of the -- how is that anti-Semitism called, e-el --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Eliminationists.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Eliminatri -- Eliminatri, or Eliminationists anti-Semitist.</span> <span id="s722">That’s Julius Langbean.</span> <span id="s723">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: But he never read la -- Julius Langbean, the [indecipherable] that very impressive and -- and very popular anti-Semitic book of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s725">He never read it.</span> <span id="s726">He got it by Georgie Massey.</span> <span id="s727">There he got some information of Langbean that was also a bit one- sided, but well Georgie was a wonderful man, anyhow, and then he took that up without really knowing what he took up, you know.</span> <span id="s728">Because he never understood the context of the early -- that means the li -- 19th century Wagnerian anti-Semitism, which was strongly connected with the idea that the Jews are, in -- was -- some respects, a model nation for the German one, and then they got the idea that the German nation can’t be built, except of the elimination of the Jews from the German nation, so that -- that was not meant in the sense of killing.</span> <span id="s729">Now see, all this assumes [indecipherable] he’s as bad that he -- he c -- he -- he doesn’t -- he isn’t able to read German text correctly, you know.</span> <span id="s730">His interpretation of one quotation of pishta Israel is really terrible.</span> <span id="s731">He wants them to -- to say that there already was a idea of a systematic killing of choice.</span> <span id="s732">But, on the other side, where you have that, in the fergush movement, he doesn’t mention it e-either, you know?</span> <span id="s733">But you know, that’s a story for -- o-of itself, and the reason was that he discovered a bit late that Chris Browning had already written the book he wanted to write.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So he had to write something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: And by that, he added that part on the 19th century, and added that part on the labor camps, and the Death Marches.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: What do you think of George Massey’s work as a sort of culturalist orien?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, George Massey, I knew him very well, we were together at Jerusalem, and he was a man one can’t but adore, you know.</span> <span id="s738">But his book has some weaknesses.</span> <span id="s739">He is -- He is a historian of th -- of ideas, you know, and he also, I think, over exenderency anti-Semitic issues, or -- in a way he is a forerunner of Daniel Goldhagen, in a way, you know.</span> <span id="s740">And he has a lot of material that’s very important.</span> <span id="s741">I wouldn’t accept his a little bit monocausal interpretation.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: And certainly he is also one of those people who -- who if they have anti-Semitism, then they think they have to explain the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s744">That’s not my opinion.</span> <span id="s745">But it’s indispensable, it’s very good at that time, but he published that, that was pioneering, and far better than everything which existed on the history of the German anti-Semitism it’s quite clear.</span> <span id="s746">He put that in a broader politic context, you know, I can’t have a lot of positive arguments, but in the principle -- principle, mathological point, I would say present research is -- is, I think, has developed farther, and couldn’t -- would avoid to have this harda monocausal, and mainly I -- illogical interpretation, and but -- but I recommend to read these books, anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: D-Do you -- Cause I didn’t speak with him about this.</span> <span id="s748">When Daniel Goldhagen’s book came out, was George sympathetic to the book, or not?</span> <span id="s749">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s751">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s752">Q: You don’t know?</span> <span id="s753">I doubt it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I don’t think so, because he must have seen the weaknesses, because George knows the material very well, you know, and what he’s writing about in 19th century, you know.</span> <span id="s755">No, Geor-George must have wudwich senicher undehenderben kauf to sunwichlong, can you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: D’you know, you -- I said, if you are upset, then you -- then you’ll say that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">He can’t accept that -- can’t have accepted that, I think, because of the weakness of scholener research, you know.</span> <span id="s759">He was a really good scholar.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s761">And how are you -- h-how do you view Raoul Hillberg’s work?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Well, that was a pioneering study, pioneering study.</span> <span id="s763">Unfortunately, it hasn’t been translated to the German pur before 1982, and you know the reasons.</span> <span id="s764">It’s not only the German disinterest, and it is today indispensable, you know, as a first book.</span> <span id="s765">But, on the other hand, the recent research, you know, did a lot more.</span> <span id="s766">Awhile ago, in 1932, I invited him to deliver a lecture in -- in my university at Buckholm, telling him, if you could enter -- reclude the resettlement policy of Heinrich Himmler, in 1939 - 1940, you know?</span> <span id="s767">And he answered he couldn’t do that, then he would deliver what he usually delivers, you know, his very competent survey on how the implementation of the Holocaust occurred step by step.</span> <span id="s768">And then -- I met him in 1933, we -- at a museum, at that conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: You mean ’92, we’re talking about ’92.</span> <span id="s770">You said ’32.</span> <span id="s771">A: ’93.</span> <span id="s772">N -- I know, ’93, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: ’93, right, the conference, yes.</span> <span id="s774">A: Another famous conference.</span> <span id="s775">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Where it was a main issue, what is the future of Holocaust research?</span> <span id="s777">Then he said the future of the Holocaust research lies in the context.</span> <span id="s778">Where was it?</span> <span id="s779">Because today we see that we have to connect that with the other polit -- policy fields, especially the terminization and resettlement policy of Himmler, in order to understand why that could be performed without any significant opposition.</span> <span id="s780">And that makes it then also better comprehensible for next generations, who have difficulties to study only the little bit isolated Jewish field.</span> <span id="s781">Those are my position -- my field here, I thought I should be the generalist a little bit, in the midst of all these special -- specialists, and experts on certain fields of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s782">They are far better than I am, but to know my role should be also in the lexus to give a little bit more the general context, because in the next generations will be ready only to see this aspect, and I think -- well that’s -- I continue the idea by Mr. Raoul Hillberg, you know, I adore him, he’s a really good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Okay, we’ll stop tape number two, and change the tape.</span> <span id="s784">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Tell me about the emergence of the Klemperer diaries in Germany, y -- in your lecture to the Leo Beck Institute, you said that it was actually a bigger best seller than the Goldhagen book.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: How do you account for that?</span> <span id="s789">I mean, what do you think about these diaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, the diaries are very impressive, especially for those youngsters, and for those students who want to realize how the living condition of Jews in Germany, and posey with other parts of Europe at that time, really were.</span> <span id="s791">Certainly he is living in a mixed marriage, that’s -- a mixed po -- the -- Polish marriage.</span> <span id="s792">By that, he even certainly has better conditions than the average Jews, that’s quite clear.</span> <span id="s793">But anyhow, what gets -- what gets a vivid, I think, picture of how -- what the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany was.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">And that’s helps for the youngsters, I think, to understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s795">S -- You know, for the first time, they get an interpretation of Jews, and Jewish life, and how they had, or tried to survive, and so on.</span> <span id="s796">And because it’s translated by a man who belongs to the m -- basically to the German culture, and so on, it’s obviously easier to understand that, anyhow, that belongs to that new wave of sensitivity towards the Jewish question, which also was to be seen in the “Schindler’s List” film.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: When -- When you read the diaries, and you think back upon your saying about yourself that you were naïve.</span> <span id="s798">Now, I understand you were a child, and he was an adult person, so I’m not trying to compare your naïveté, and his la -- so-called lack of it, but it was fascinating to me how much he figured out.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Even given where he was.</span> <span id="s801">It seems really extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well, that’s right, yes, but I must atsee as a child I didn’t -- I didn’t hear that at the -- and -- and -- and I think in my hometown, that didn’t -- that didn’t occur too much.</span> <span id="s803">At least I don’t know, you know, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: -- and, d’you know, when I was growing up, in order to see something, you know, the Jews had disappeared to the big cities, there was nothing left, and by that, I’m a bad witness in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: But it is interesting to see those diaries, because it’s clear that if you were adult person, and you would take the information that was coming in if you thought about it, which is what you said before, if you actually thought about it, you -- you’d know.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: That’s right, or at least know what the general direction was like.</span> <span id="s808">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: That’s right, that’s no question.</span> <span id="s810">Q: So it’s quite a --</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: And then so far, it’s a -- it’s an explanation, you know, also.</span> <span id="s812">And certainly -- Q: An explanation of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: An explana -- no, it’s -- it’s not an explanation of the attitudes of the population, you’re right, but it’s an explanation of how the isolation came into being, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: I think that they don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: There’s often, when people talk about the Holocaust, nor -- regular people, including some historians, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: They talk about this as a unique event.</span> <span id="s819">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: And from what I read about your work, that would be hard-hardly a word that you would use, because you want to talk about the Holocaust in context.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yes, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: So, can you tell me what you think is so problematic about this use of the word, uniqueness, and what it -- what it destroys.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: I wouldn’t say it’s problematic, but you know, if I study historical events, I don’t study them for their u-uniqueness, but in order to learn from that, to have a better understanding of comparable, or prospeels, or opposite situations.</span> <span id="s824">And by that, that category of uniqueness is not very variable, I think.</span> <span id="s825">And, well certainly there is an u -- u-uniqueness insofar as this systematic liquidation of millions of people in the 20th century.</span> <span id="s826">It’s incomparable to other developments.</span> <span id="s827">But I’m -- I’m always a bit cautious for what -- what uniqueness can mean, you know -- you know.</span> <span id="s828">Or, the other day I have been in Yucatan.</span> <span id="s829">What [indecipherable] with those populations.</span> <span id="s830">Well, it took them a century or two, the Germans did that within two years.</span> <span id="s831">That is maybe the uniqueness, that means our century.</span> <span id="s832">But the size of killing whole people, they maybe not so ni -- u-unique if you take in comparison to size of populations today, and in earlier periods.</span> <span id="s833">And so far, I would also have a principle objection to use the term unique, because in a way, we don’t much about what is really unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: We don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: We don’t know much about, compare -- well, history is a very broad business, I think.</span> <span id="s836">Q: Is a very?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: A very broad --</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Broad business.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: -- experience, you know.</span> <span id="s840">Well, you know, would have been in ancient societies, and so far, but that’s not a very important point.</span> <span id="s841">For me, it’s not a principle question, whether the -- the pate or the uniqueness.</span> <span id="s842">But certainly, it’s only from a German viewpoint, the average German viewpoint’s only -- it’s necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war, or the murder of Slav people, and Gypsies, and others.</span> <span id="s843">You know, that’s quite clear ba -- th -- by that, it gets more comprehensible.</span> <span id="s844">And -- And if you look at that in order to show the pre-conditions for any pre-ju-jub -- any genocidal policy, you know, then it shouldn’t isolate that, and so far, the term uniqueness is not very helpful, but I wouldn’t re -- wouldn’t reject the -- that on the other hand, this is a unique event, which isn’t comparable directly with the [indecipherable] gulag under Stalinism, and so on, although it l -- it lies on the same level.</span> <span id="s845">They are -- We will discuss, I think, in future years a little bit, to what extent the -- the German perpetrators learned from -- from the local anti-Semitic populations in the east, and the Russians in the way.</span> <span id="s846">You know, the death marches are an invention by a Soviet -- by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s847">They did that with their own people.</span> <span id="s848">And then the German suddenly came to the idea to do it also, first with prisoners of wars, and at -- at the end, with concentration camp inmates.</span> <span id="s849">That’s Soviet, the idea of that in -- can -- let -- march people about, hundreds and kilometers, was very familiar in a -- start in this period.</span> <span id="s850">And so far, sometimes there are comparabilities which are -- shouldn’t be precluded by accepting the unique character of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Let -- Let me push this uniqueness just a little bit, be-because I -- there are certainly debates about -- and you take it on, though not in these terms.</span> <span id="s852">The Holocaust is about the Jews, the Jewish experience is unique.</span> <span id="s853">And then there’s a -- a view that there’s a universal way to look at the Holocaust, that there are many victims during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s854">The Jews may have been the major, or the primary ones.</span> <span id="s855">How -- How do you think it’s best to actually look at this event?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Well, I would say -- would take up the argument that i -- on account of a -- a -- quite a lot of reasons.</span> <span id="s857">Some is certainly the traditional occ-Occidental anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s858">The Jews were killed, and the others not, just because the Nazis didn’t have enough time to kill the others.</span> <span id="s859">And my friend Kurt Salley, he would talk about the top of the iceman to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Where’s the iceberg, or where -- Q: Iceberg, yes, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Iceberg, you know.</span> <span id="s862">And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the resettlement policy, you know, it’s quite the -- after -- there was some compensation mechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews.</span> <span id="s863">And suddenly they are the -- the prejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was responsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors.</span> <span id="s864">But that - in -- in the long run, that wouldn’t have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed other groups, also.</span> <span id="s865">So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill the Jews, because they didn’t get opposition from their local populations, and you know, and you know, and you know.</span> <span id="s866">But the tendency to kill other groups as well, is unmistakably t-there.</span> <span id="s867">And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on their -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe kind of ca -- try to put that in that way.</span> <span id="s868">And there is something which certainly explains that the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although killing processes were underway all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: There is --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Is that a sufficient answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s872">There is a way in which -- when I read your stuff, and I think about reading other people’s material, that one gets the feeling that Nazism is either self-mutilating or suicidal, that in the end it would eat itself up with death.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That’s my thesis, yes.</span> <span id="s874">So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they suddenly said, we don’t need only racial homogeneity, we need only political homogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either, you know.</span> <span id="s875">And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that style of politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: You know?</span> <span id="s878">If you -- If you have politics which are unable to have something like a lasting compromise, and then you have only destruction as the alternative, you know, that’s really --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Tell me what you think about the emergence of movies like “Schindler’s List”, and television films and this sort of spate of popularization of the Holocaust, after years of a lot of people not thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Well, usually historians are very critical, I’m not.</span> <span id="s881">I think “Schindler’s List” is quite a good film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable.</span> <span id="s882">One can talk about some interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the minds of many youngsters in Germany.</span> <span id="s883">And well, it doesn’t replace the historical work, which is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was more helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50’s and 60’s, which didn’t left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Including Landsman’s “Shoah”?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Landsman’s “Shoah” is different, but you know, Landsman’s “Shoah” has something for a few intellectuals who will sit there for 24 hours, I don’t know how long that is, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Nine hours, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Nine hours, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s888">Q: But still --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: You know, that’s not symptomatic for a -- for the public.</span> <span id="s890">It’s very impressive, you know, and [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: A-As an historian, is it an odd phenomenon that the farther one seems to get from this event, the more interest there seems to be, or is there deep -- how -- do you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s892">I mean, they -- there may --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I don’t understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly we have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way.</span> <span id="s894">We did, as historians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don’t know -- want to know that.</span> <span id="s895">And it’s so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second World War, and the Jewish issue, and so on.</span> <span id="s896">Among the younger students today, and that’s quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel change.</span> <span id="s897">Do you know, after those generations have left office, or the positions who was -- who were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to provide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: So, is that connected with what you said in your Leo Beck lecture?</span> <span id="s899">Implicitly and explicitly, the legacy of Auschwitz forms the historical framework for the process of acquiring a new national self-concept?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Well, not necessarily, but that’s certainly connected to that, that we have that phenomenon in Germany, which I think it’s really remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: So tell me what this means.</span> <span id="s902">Why is this so necessary for it -- for a new self national -- a n-national self-confidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: You know we had a national indifference in Germany at the time, and the nation stayed traditional 19th century, almost disappeared.</span> <span id="s904">If you talk to the kids today about Bismarck, they don’t know who he is, you know, and if you talk about students in the war area, about the French scoo occupations, and they ask whether that’s in the 17th century, or in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s905">That’s got national history in a traditional sense, in Germany has, in a way, faded out among the next generations.</span> <span id="s906">And there is, I think, growing a new national identity, which looks more at the chain of events, starting in the Third Reich, leading to the second World War, and the Holocaust, and certainly then, being in the background for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic.</span> <span id="s907">That’s rit -- quite a different side of historical basic facts, which have -- they have in mind, and to which I think the experience of Auschwitz belongs, in a way, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s909">You’ve -- Was this the first time -- I know it’s not the first time you’ve been in Washington, but the first time you saw the museum this year?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: No, you saw -- seen it bef -- you s-saw the [indecipherable] A: I’ve seen it -- yes, I have been in it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: So, how do you evaluate, as you walk through the permanent exhibition, it’s portrayal of this history?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d’you ever read them?</span> <span id="s914">You know, and I found it very interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the miterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want to put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in comparison to what is going on in wa -- Yad Vashem, you know.</span> <span id="s915">Well, from a German viewpoint, that is -- that’s not very convincing.</span> <span id="s916">And I -- I always told that story that a Germans wanted to have a room for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is too anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very symptomatic.</span> <span id="s917">But we don’t have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with some sort of suppositive national tradition, you know.</span> <span id="s918">That’s it’s -- has to do with what I told you about, the emergence of a new consciousness.</span> <span id="s919">We just can’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s920">At least the other Germany resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that’s not enough, you know.</span> <span id="s921">It’s not representative.</span> <span id="s922">And then so far, sh -- from a German viewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson went on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you say, you know.</span> <span id="s923">We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that experience.</span> <span id="s924">But anyhow, it’s a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good and interesting material, in many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a most impressive place is where you have the pictures of that little town, what’s the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Rushishaka</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: You know, that is -- Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: But that would be also the reaction of the -- of the German yosterday, you know.</span> <span id="s928">Because that’s like “Schindler’s List”, or that’s the Klemperer diary.</span> <span id="s929">It shows the people again, you know.</span> <span id="s930">And what is our task as historians, is to -- not to -- well, the people should stay alive in the whole description of the process, that’s difficult.</span> <span id="s931">And that is done, in a way, by the exhibition.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: So then you must appreciate what Saul Freidlander is trying to do in his --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Well I -- He is a good friend of mine, I like him.</span> <span id="s934">The book is wonderful in respect -- with respect to the style and the language and the -- I think the breadth of the material he uses.</span> <span id="s935">I differ in one respect, that I think that he doesn’t show the political process leading to the events, you know.</span> <span id="s936">That -- I want to write now a small history of the Holocaust, and I am not so bright as my friend Saul [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s937">Wh-What I want to show is how -- why the Nuremberg laws were in 1935, and not in 1943, or so on.</span> <span id="s938">And how did the rise kastern, cris - Crystal night occur in Sep-September 19 -- no, in November 1938, and -- d’you know, that he doesn’t show, you know.</span> <span id="s939">What are the -- the political mechanisms which were involved, and that is a little bit what I think I can contribute to the business of all these experts who -- that’s very impressive, but we have to -- to -- also to explain why that came into being, you know, and that’s -- that’s difficult and -- and so far, it’s wonderful, but -- but it’s written from hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: But one should try -- Q: To understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: -- to write in the way that you still, as a reader, are not aware what is going on.</span> <span id="s943">Later on ows, that’s still open -- open -- open -- open.</span> <span id="s944">And suddenly then, it will change.</span> <span id="s945">That’s what I want to do.</span> <span id="s946">Whether I’ll be able is another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Have you started it?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Oh I don -- no, no, not yet.</span> <span id="s949">Q: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I -- In a way, I started with tha -- doing these nextashear, put a lot of work into them.</span> <span id="s951">I learned something.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: So, when at these conferences, people say where is the direction of the study of the Holocaust, what do you say?</span> <span id="s953">Or what should be the direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yes, first of all, to interpret the Holocaust as political process, and to put it in the context.</span> <span id="s955">Q: Simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: That simple, clear, and difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s958">Well, is there anything that I missed, that I should ask you, or that you wanted to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: No, you were very good, no.</span> <span id="s960">Thank you.</span> <span id="s961">Q: Well, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Thank you for the study of my -- my text.</span> <span id="s963">Q: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I think we have a lot of i -- of ideas in the talk.</span> <span id="s965">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: I thank you very much for your time, okay.</span> <span id="s968">A: Was very good.</span> <span id="s969">Yes, I -- End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
