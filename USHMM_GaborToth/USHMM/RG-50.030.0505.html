place and date of birth, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I am Irena Veisaite.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in Kaunas a long time ago, in 1928, on the ninth of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: So, when the war began, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Can you please tell me something about this 13 years old girl before the war, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Well, I was very lucky to be born in a wonderful family, in a wealthy family.</span> <span id="s23">I had really a wonderful childhood, except maybe that my parents get divorced in ’38, which was, of course, a very big shock to me.</span> <span id="s24">My father left Lithuania, remarried later on, and I stayed with my mother in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s25">I -- I was probably a quite good pupil.</span> <span id="s26">My father sent me to a Yiddish school Shalom Aleichem gymnasium, which was famous.</span> <span id="s27">They had very good teachers, and it was a left wing school, I would say, which was shaped by Yiddishes -- by the Yiddishists and not by sci -- Zionists.</span> <span id="s28">And the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Mis -- yeah, but my -- my parents were already out of the shtetl, they were European educated people.</span> <span id="s33">My mother finished [indecipherable] schule in Berlin.</span> <span id="s34">My father got his education in Hamburg, and th -- and so they were not religious, but were very tolerant.</span> <span id="s35">My grandparents -- I had -- had only my grandparent -- parents from my mother’s side, so they were quite m -- they came out of Bapte my father was a milkman, like Tevya from Shalom Aleichem.</span> <span id="s36">Was really a wonderful, wonderful man.</span> <span id="s37">I think he influenced the whole family a lot, with his very open-minded and -- views and with his goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Excuse me, I must ask you for --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Can you take off this -- because it makes sounds on the tape will you, and -- thank you.</span> <span id="s41">Sorry for interrupting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s43">And -- and I was educated respecting them very much and very much respecting their belief, and I would go every Friday for kiddush, to -- to meet Saturday and I was attending there all day, of course holidays and Rosh Hashanah and -- and especially Easter, where I played a big role under the table, looking for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: You say their holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Not -- not holidays, but how is it in English, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s46">It is like -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: But you say their.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I was with my par -- when I -- with my grandparents always there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Their holidays, their --</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Their Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Their Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s54">Back then you felt it’s theirs and not yours?</span> <span id="s55">A: Because in our house we didn’t celebrate it, we especially.</span> <span id="s56">So I felt it more tha -- as the -- a-as the tradition of my grandparents, which was very nice and respected.</span> <span id="s57">But I had also in my childhood a Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Because ma -- not because it was for relig -- religious purposes, that my parents was -- were saying that you can take from other people the best they have, and they wouldn’t like me to be envious of other children who have this tree and get their different presents.</span> <span id="s60">So I had also a Christmas tree and our home was very international.</span> <span id="s61">We had very many guests, Lithuanians and Russians and -- from all over the world, friends who would come and visit us.</span> <span id="s62">So my parents spoke already -- except English probably, all European languages, French, German, Polish, Russian.</span> <span id="s63">So -- no, my -- my parents told me that you have always to speak the language that everybody understands, if you can.</span> <span id="s64">So I was multilingual from childhood.</span> <span id="s65">I was speaking from my -- my native languages were two, Lithuanian, and Russian, I spoke from childhood.</span> <span id="s66">And then when I was five years old I had something with my lungs and I was sent to S-Switzerland, to Arosa in a sanitorium, where I stayed for almost a year, and then I forgot all languages.</span> <span id="s67">I came back not speaking Lithuanian and not speaking Russian, but speaking only German.</span> <span id="s68">And I remember that I went with my parents to Moscow, my father had his family there and m-my uncle made me a present, such a sewing machine, a children’s sewing machine.</span> <span id="s69">And it is in Russian shvaina mashina.</span> <span id="s70">So I was told that -- that -- then the joke was that I answered the [speaks Russian here], I don’t want a big mach-machine, yeah.</span> <span id="s71">So this only proves that I really didn’t speak any more Russian, but of course the languages came back very fast.</span> <span id="s72">And when I was sent to the Shalom Aleichem gymnasium, to the yeshida school, I didn’t speak Yiddish, but I learned it quite fast.</span> <span id="s73">And I -- but the -- the beginning was not so good because I didn’t speak so well Yiddish, so my classmates would call me the intelligentka.</span> <span id="s74">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: This is also a question I wanted to ask you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: On one hand you described a very cosmopolitan house.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And on the other hand you are sent to a Yiddish --</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: -- school.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Didn’t you feel any contradiction?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, I didn't feel because I mentioned already that it was a left wing school, really a very good school.</span> <span id="s85">I remember my -- my -- my teachers, most of the teachers with great respect.</span> <span id="s86">And my -- I must say that, for instance, my Lithuanian, I am really literate in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s87">I write in Lithuanian well, and I learned -- I spoke from childhood, but I learned really the language and the writing in this Jewish school.</span> <span id="s88">Bu -- and my -- my teacher was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s89">She perished in the Holocaust, and she came from a Lithuanian province and she was -- she finished the university, Lithuanian language and literature, and she was really a wonderful teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: So this -- a-and they saved my life also, you know, beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You will tell about this later, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: -- you said -- you use an expression that I would like --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: -- if you allow me, to check with you.</span> <span id="s97">You said about your teacher that she perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s98">You -- you mean she was murdered in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Murdered, yeah, murdered.</span> <span id="s100">Sorry, my English is maybe not so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: No, no, no, because -- because -- it’s not your English, because many people don’t use the term murder, and they, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, she was killed.</span> <span id="s103">She was killed in the Holocaust, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: She was wo -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: And but she was -- in the school she was an exception, because she was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s106">But because she was a very good teacher, she was kept in the school.</span> <span id="s107">And my father had also illusions, left winged illusions.</span> <span id="s108">He was a rich man in Kaunas and he had his own house, he has his own business.</span> <span id="s109">But he was -- he was dreaming about social justice, and as you know, in the 30’s, many European, not only Lithuanian intellectuals, had this illusion that the Soviet Union is maybe the solution.</span> <span id="s110">And maybe they are giving equal rights to everybody.</span> <span id="s111">So he insisted that a -- I go to this school.</span> <span id="s112">All my cousins went to Lithuanian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So your father was a leftist bourgeois?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: He was a salon communist, I would say.</span> <span id="s115">Not a communist, but a left wing salon.</span> <span id="s116">He was helping people who were in trouble.</span> <span id="s117">He was paying, I think, money for Mopar -- for the -- this was an organization who has collected money for the political prisoners in -- in those times.</span> <span id="s118">And in the main time he was -- he was quite a rich man, and he never came to the -- to live in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s119">So -- and th --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What -- what -- what were he doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: -- and his -- his -- his family -- you know, my father was sent to be educated in Hamburg, because my grandfather, who was a merchant of the second gildia -- I know that’s a quite high level, he was quite [indecipherable] man.</span> <span id="s122">He was -- he had his business in Garganas, it’s was -- it’s not far, now it’s Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s123">And all his chil -- sons became revolutionaries, so he got sick of it, fed up with it and he decided, the youngest son, to send to -- to study in Germany, that he shouldn’t become a revolutionary.</span> <span id="s124">But my -- they were really -- you -- you should very much distinguish the revolutionaries of those times with the Stalin times, because they were -- they really thought it was an utopias, you know, and an utopia, that’s socialism, and communism will bring social justice, equality and so on.</span> <span id="s125">And it ended that one brother of my father was arrested in ’37 and killed by Stalin.</span> <span id="s126">A-And -- because he was a too honest man, he was a quite known person.</span> <span id="s127">He was the director of [speaks Lithuanian here] this is fiction literature, it’s a big, big publishing house.</span> <span id="s128">And he was also then later on the director of the medicine -- is that me-medical publishing house.</span> <span id="s129">Well, he was accused so, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s130">He was arrested in ’37.</span> <span id="s131">And my other uncle who was a professor, he never joined the party again after the Bolsheviks came to power because he saw what happened in the Crimea.</span> <span id="s132">He spend the time of the civil war in Crimea and he saw what the -- really the Bolsheviks are like, and he never joined the party.</span> <span id="s133">He had his own story, which I don’t know if we have time to tell you now, but very interesting, that he never told me, really, the truth he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: About the Bolsheviks?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: When I came -- yeah, when I came, because everybody was afraid then.</span> <span id="s136">And only when he was already quite -- qui -- after -- after Khrushchev’s letter, this -- in -- on the -- in ’56, when Stalin was really -- it was opened up what he did, he told me that he knew it all, because he also knew -- he was a friend of Krupska, Lenin’s wife, who was also persecuted by Stalin and the whole -- all -- all -- this whole regime on -- and the -- the -- what -- what happened in ’37, he had no illusions.</span> <span id="s137">But of course he -- but then he told me really true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: After.</span> <span id="s139">Many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: So your father was sent to Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: -- to study, and he came back to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: And then th-the -- the first World War started, because he was born in 1900.</span> <span id="s145">So when the first World War started, and you know that Lithuania was under the Tsarist regime, so he was a rush -- a r -- a citizen of Russia.</span> <span id="s146">So he went back with lot -- with lot of adventures, and he was even arrested by the Bolsheviks as a German spy.</span> <span id="s147">And just by miracle he -- his life was saved and he came back to Kaunas and his father was already in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s148">He was the owner of [speaks Lithuanian here], it was a lottery.</span> <span id="s149">And because he was the only one not in Russian, not in the Soviet Union, so he inherited his business, and it was the stu -- h-he was the owner of [speaks Lithuanian here].</span> <span id="s150">This is the -- the main agency of the government lottery.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Would you like to make a break and to have some water for your throat?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Maybe it would b-be good because I -- my --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s154">Let’s stop for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: [indecipherable] can you please bring a glass of water?</span> <span id="s157">[interruption] Thank you.</span> <span id="s158">Okay, so your father came back to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: At the age of?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Then he was 20 something, or maybe a little bit less, I can’t tell you exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: When di --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: -- but he is born in 1900.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And when did he start his business?</span> <span id="s165">He became a wealthy man l-later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: In ’26, I think, my grandfather -- my grandfather was wealthy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s168">Ou-out of --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: -- and he -- an-and my father inherited his business, the lottery business.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: The lottery business.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: And th-then he never [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay, so you were studying in a Yiddish school --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: -- with leftist tendency --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: -- in a cosmopolitan family.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: You didn’t f -- did you feel a Jew, or did you feel a citizen of the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, I felt that I am -- I am a Lithuanian Jew.</span> <span id="s182">This I felt, of course.</span> <span id="s183">I -- this -- I was -- I was, you know, educated in our school, very patriotic, because we were studying history.</span> <span id="s184">I don’t know if you heard, there was such a -- a textbook shap -written by a Lithuanian historian, Shapulka, who really mythologized the Lithuanian history.</span> <span id="s185">And his book had the -- probably the task to unite a nation, because I don’t know if you know Lithuanian history, but Lithuania was -- the history is quite painful, because you know that the Polish influence, the Russian influence, and -- and the Lithuanian speaker were mainly peasants.</span> <span id="s186">So it was very important to unite a nation and to give them a mythology that -- to be proud.</span> <span id="s187">And then it came to idealize the past, our -- our great --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You identified with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah, I identified with that --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: You did, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: -- I was singing [indecipherable] Vilnius [indecipherable] was very anti-Polish.</span> <span id="s192">In -- in -- in -- not against the individual, but that Vilnius was occupied and we were very strong, yeah.</span> <span id="s193">And you know, I remember even such a joke, which shows you also where we had a -- it was obligatory to have a exa-examination religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: And a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: A religion in the Yiddish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: In -- in the Yiddish school, Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: And I had also to -- to pass this exam.</span> <span id="s200">And I was really always the first pupil, which is not very good for developing a good character, but it happened that I was.</span> <span id="s201">So -- and you know, and the -- th -- the person, the teacher who was asking questions was a Lithuanian inspector.</span> <span id="s202">And he asked me --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: A Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Wha -- no, not a Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So how --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: -- a Lithuanian inspector.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: -- how could he --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: He came to -- to find out what is -- how -- how religion is teaching in our school -- is -- is taught in our school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: I -- he did make the examination, but only checked --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No -- yeah, he came -- additional questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: So he asked me -- I think so, maybe you know, you can sometimes remember, but I remember that this Lithuanian inspector asked me, what is Yom Kippur?</span> <span id="s213">So I said, Yom Kippur is a very famous artist.</span> <span id="s214">It was -- y-you probably know Jan Kiepura.</span> <span id="s215">He was a -- playing -- he was of Polish, I think, origin and he was playing, if I am not mistaken, with Martha Eggerth, and -- and she was also very famous actress, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So how did he react in respect to --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: He -- I -- everybody was laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: He was laughing as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And he was laughing as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">So an --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, and I -- I still -- I very much liked all the, you know, all the -- the -- Easter especially, and I was always asking the que -- the -- the kashas [speaks foreign language here] and -- and so on, so I -- I didn’t reject it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: -- no way.</span> <span id="s225">And we were very much, you know, indoctrinated against the Sinai schools, the Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s226">So, in -- in the end, in the Soviet times the Hebrew schools were closed, and some of the -- of the pupils from the Hebrew schools came to our school, but -- was united, the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: And oh we had quite big fights with the Zionists there, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And you a-as a 13 or 12 years old girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- you had your opinions.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I had my opinion, yeah.</span> <span id="s233">I had my opinion and -- and I had a very big conflict with a -- with a boy who was the best pupil, the first pupil in his school, in the Hebrew school, Schwabe.</span> <span id="s234">And I was the first in AMI school.</span> <span id="s235">And when we came together in the first trem -- seme -- semester finished, so he -- I was the first and he was the second.</span> <span id="s236">So he started the fight against me.</span> <span id="s237">So it was a whole story, but it -- it’s fine [indecipherable] Bloomberg, a very nice boy.</span> <span id="s238">He survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And sometime in the period before the war started, during your youth in Kaunas, do you feel any antisi -- anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s240">Did you omit and phenomena of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: To be honest, I didn’t feel, no.</span> <span id="s242">I didn’t feel.</span> <span id="s243">I-I had -- my school friends were Jewish, but I had also -- we had a lot around.</span> <span id="s244">I hadn’t -- I -- probably I didn't have very close friends of my age of Lithuanian ethnic origin.</span> <span id="s245">But I really didn’t -- didn’t feel -- but what I really felt is a terrible fear because of war, because the adults were speaking all the time about war, about Hitler, about what is happening.</span> <span id="s246">And I had even such a terrible dream, you know, I don’t remember so many dreams, but this is one of the dreams I remember very well.</span> <span id="s247">I was a little girl and somehow I found myself in a camp where Hitler was.</span> <span id="s248">And I was taken to his -- to his tent and he was ca -- somehow very kind, he -- he told me that I should sit on his knees and say him Poppy.</span> <span id="s249">This is father.</span> <span id="s250">And I couldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s251">And this was terrible for me and then I woke up.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: But I was terribly, terribly -- this was really the -- the nightmare.</span> <span id="s254">And then of course I remember how the -- the German -- the Nazis took over Klaipėda [indecipherable] and how our friends came from there, and what they told m -- and the very close friends, families from Klaipėda, they had to escape.</span> <span id="s255">Then I remember very well, when the war with Poland started, how Polish refugees came to Vilnius -- to Kaunas and I know that my parents helped them.</span> <span id="s256">My father wasn’t there any more, but my mother helped them and t-tried to support them.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: The people who came from Klaipėda, what did they tell about the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Th-They -- they thank God, left before it was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: So they didn’t tell anything specially about their own experience, but they told about Kristallnacht, about you know, things which are happening in Germany, and about the whole ideology of Hitler.</span> <span id="s261">And this -- really, this is the nightmare of my childhood, Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: This dream, you -- you said that you dreamt that you were in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: The [indecipherable] camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: The -- the -- the camp is that it was a place where many tents were staying.</span> <span id="s266">And it was not in a house, but in a tent.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Anybody was talking about camps in this period before the war?</span> <span id="s268">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: A camp maybe like a camp, or scouts, or I don’t know, something.</span> <span id="s271">No, no, it was a tent in a -- in a wood, in a forest, and tents were staying and in one tent, in -- the central tent was Hitler’s and I was taken to him and what I remember I -- I already told you, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: -- he told me to sit on his knees and to say him very nicely, Poppy.</span> <span id="s274">And I couldn't pronounce it.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And this was more or less in the period that people f -- refugees started coming to Kaunas?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: This I can’t tell you exactly, but it was somewhere in ’38 - ’39.</span> <span id="s277">And then, you see, when my parents divorced --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: In 30 --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: In ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: -- eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: In the beginning of ’38, the agreement was that I will spend my summer with my father --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Where --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: -- and I will live with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Where did your father went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: My father went to -- to west Europe.</span> <span id="s286">His second wife was of German origin, and he lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s287">He survived the war -- war in Belgium.</span> <span id="s288">But in ’38 he took me, and I spent two months with him and we were in Switzerland, in Belgium, in France and in Berlin.</span> <span id="s289">Mm -- and I got my wonderful bicycle, which was very famous in -- in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s290">Probably one of the first bicycles with gears, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: ’38 in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: ’38 I was in Berlin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: How was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: This is what I wanted to tell you, that it was wonderful because I -- we were Lithuanian citizens and we were not -- we w -- were not under the Hitler’s law, and we got even -- but my father told me when we -- we lived on kuf -- Kurfürstendamm and we got for breakfast, for instance, a -- a little britchen, a -- a -- no, a piece of white bread with butter, with -- or margarine and marmalade and my father told me that the Germans don’t receive it, and the Jews definitely not, because it is very hard now and they are preparing a war.</span> <span id="s297">And then my pa -- father took me to the street Unter den Linden which was the main street on the Brandenburger Tor, and -- and th-there were -- there were normal benches.</span> <span id="s298">I think they were white, but I don’t remember, but I remember the yellow benches.</span> <span id="s299">And my father told me that you are not obliged to sit on the yellow bench because you are not a German citizen.</span> <span id="s300">But you are Jewish and this is benches where Jews are sitting.</span> <span id="s301">They are excluded, they are discriminated, and I want you to get the feeling how it is like to sit on such a bench.</span> <span id="s302">So we were sitting, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s303">And can you imagine that in 2004, when we joined European Union, I was speaking at the Brandenburger Tor, to the crowds because when the enlargement of the European Union happened, I was speaking in the name of representing my country, Lithuania, and -- and I -- I -- I finished my speech with a personal remark, that you see how time changed?</span> <span id="s304">I’m speaking from the place, behind is the Reichstag, where I was doomed to die, to be killed, and now I am representing and talking to you, representing the country.</span> <span id="s305">It also proves -- it’s a si -- symbolic, for me very important proofs how times have changed.</span> <span id="s306">It was a -- a -- I must say it was a big moment in my life, it was successful, my speech, so I was very happy.</span> <span id="s307">But, of course you feel -- the first time when I was in Berlin after the war I feel very stel -- felt very strange, staying at the Reichstag.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So you wa -- went for two months vacation to Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- to western Europe with your father and you came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: To Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: -- to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah, Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And -- and ni -- in ’39, Jewish refugees from Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: They’re coming, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: -- start to come to Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Start to come, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: How did you meet with them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: They came to our house, to my mother’s house.</span> <span id="s320">I know even -- I can even show you now, I have a little silver such plate which my mother bought from -- from a refugee, to help them also.</span> <span id="s321">And I know that my mother -- my mother was involved in -- in helping them.</span> <span id="s322">But I don’t know details, but I know that they were around.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And did you hear what they were telling?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yes, yes of course.</span> <span id="s325">I was very curious.</span> <span id="s326">I was called in the family alticope, and -- and th-the -- it means that I am a old cop -- a old head, because I was always interested and I was such like responsible person.</span> <span id="s327">And so I was interested and I heard it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And what do you remember ma -- made impression on you of what they were telling?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: It made a terrible impression.</span> <span id="s330">It -- it raised my fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: What were they telling?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: The people had to leave their homes, everything and -- and just became refugees and got stuck.</span> <span id="s333">And I didn’t know, but later on I learned that they -- many -- very many of them got stuck in Lithuania and of course they were killed made -- mainly.</span> <span id="s334">And -- in the Holocaust, but some of them were saved by Sugihara, and the hol -- the Dutch also, cons -- council -- c-con -- consul.</span> <span id="s335">Ambassador.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So, at the certain moment you feel that -- y-you are afraid be -- the adults are talking about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s338">I was very afraid.</span> <span id="s339">It was really a nightmare, this -- it was like, you know, like hanging over -- over the heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: You were talking with this -- ab-about it with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What did she say about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, she’s -- she tried to -- to comfort me, but I don’t remember exactly, you know.</span> <span id="s344">I remember many conversations with my mother, but I don’t remember exactly what we were speaking.</span> <span id="s345">But I know the only one thing, that my mother wanted to leave Kaunas.</span> <span id="s346">And she asked my father to pay her the alimentay -- I don’t know, the money he has to pay her after the divorce, in currency that she could leave the country.</span> <span id="s347">But it was maybe not only of -- out of fear, but also those times very few people were divorced.</span> <span id="s348">And my mother was a quite -- my father was q -- my family was a quite known family.</span> <span id="s349">So I think she didn’t feel very well, in this little town, you know, where everybody was talking about the divorce and -- and she was somehow -- maybe she felt humiliated.</span> <span id="s350">And she was in Sweden and a German refugee who got a affidavit to go to America wanted to marry my mother and take her -- take her out.</span> <span id="s351">And because it was already very tense, I can imagine what the adults were -- were already talking about this -- those times, my mother decided that she is not coming back, but I should go to Stockholm.</span> <span id="s352">And a ticket, air ticket was bought, and we had a very good friend, Monsieur Dumaniel who was a -- a -- mm -- a cons -- con -- consul -- a ambassador of France and Lithuania and then he was transferred to Helsinki, but he stayed friends with my mother.</span> <span id="s353">My mother was beloved by everybody, really.</span> <span id="s354">She had lots -- many, many friends, was -- and I sh -- I had to go to Helsinki and then he would take me to Stockholm and then we would go to America.</span> <span id="s355">And I was -- that was the first of September, and my uncle brought me to the -- to the airport [indecipherable] in Kaunas and I was waiting for the airplane to came.</span> <span id="s356">And I went through customs.</span> <span id="s357">I remember like today I had talc powder, how the customer took a knife and -- and cut this little box to see if I have in gold there or something else.</span> <span id="s358">And -- and I was waiting, but the airplane never came, because it’s the first day of war, and the airplane was supposed to come from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s359">So -- so I got back and when -- and then my mother came also back.</span> <span id="s360">And this was fatal.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And then the war started in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No, the war -- the -- the -- yeah, it was the first of September ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: So, my mother wanted to leave, and probably she had also reason to leave because we all felt that we are trapped.</span> <span id="s365">We -- my mother didn’t -- my mother was much less left winged than my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: But -- but -- but didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And you stayed in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: I stayed in Kaunas and my mother came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And then the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Then the Russians came.</span> <span id="s372">The Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: You know, I don’t -- I try not to use the word Germans or Russians.</span> <span id="s375">I think that any nation is a nation [indecipherable] to be respected, but I say Nazis and Soviets, because not all the Russians were Soviets and not all the Germans were Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So the Soviets came?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah, the Soviets came.</span> <span id="s378">The Soviet Russians came.</span> <span id="s379">I know it is [indecipherable] -- it is stupid because nobody is following me, but -- but still I feel better when I do [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Personally I agree with you about the Soviets --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Mm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: -- not about the Germans, but this is another --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I agree with Germans.</span> <span id="s384">I have seen wonderful Germans, and if we have time, I can tell you as -- wonderful stories about wonderful Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Yes, th-the problem is that when you say Nazis, you detach it from the origin, and th-this is the problem, were they -- they were from Indonesia, the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, they’re German Nazis, you can say German Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: -- if you -- if you want to be very precise, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Okay, yes.</span> <span id="s390">So, how did life change when the Soviets came?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Oh, life changed a lot.</span> <span id="s392">First of all we were thrown out from our flat, and we had to share a flat with another family.</span> <span id="s393">We had two rooms and the other family had one room.</span> <span id="s394">And we had to share the kitchen, which was very unusual for us, of course.</span> <span id="s395">My mother didn’t work and this was good, maybe.</span> <span id="s396">She went to work.</span> <span id="s397">She was educated, she -- she was quite capable woman and she worked in the narcomat of trade.</span> <span id="s398">So she started to work.</span> <span id="s399">And -- and immediately rumors went on, and th-th-this person is arrested, th-that person is arrested.</span> <span id="s400">Life changed.</span> <span id="s401">But still I was at school.</span> <span id="s402">I believe that maybe this is for justice.</span> <span id="s403">That -- that still maybe I’d -- I was not so m-mature in my political views as I-I was later, but -- but still I m -- I was not -- I personally -- it affected very much the life of the adults, but not so much maybe my own life, because I went to school, I fought with the Zionists there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s404">And so, it [indecipherable] stupid, but it was.</span> <span id="s405">I was never religious so I never experienced luck of -- of the possibility to -- to practice religion.</span> <span id="s406">I also -- can you imagine that about the religious schools, the famous Lithuania, I got to know only probably in the -- after our independence, when I was sent -- I wa -- I got a fellowship in Oxford, and I was in [indecipherable] and I learned really what Lithuania means for Jewish culture and religious culture and so on.</span> <span id="s407">Because we were very far aw-away from this yeshiva -- yeshi botnikas and the [indecipherable] and all that.</span> <span id="s408">And the school was also not closed to religion.</span> <span id="s409">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: During the Soviet time, did you have any contacts with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: [indecipherable] And still there was the fear of the war, or the war was already here?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, I can’t say that it -- the war was already here.</span> <span id="s414">The war started on the 22nd of June, ’41.</span> <span id="s415">But there was already a lot of things happening.</span> <span id="s416">Don’t forget that in those times parents were even afraid to talk to children openly, because the children could say something at school and then you will be arrested.</span> <span id="s417">So there was no such open communication with the parents on all topics.</span> <span id="s418">And I wouldn’t say that I heard a lot, but I know for instance, when deportations started, my mother was very, very upset and she -- she was -- she was helping people, her -- Lithuanian people who were also Jewish people, but also Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s419">She worked with, and -- as much as she could -- as she knew.</span> <span id="s420">And she was very, very, very unhappy about what happened.</span> <span id="s421">And I remember also my mother, on the 15th of June ’40, when the tanks came in.</span> <span id="s422">And this -- I remember my mother sitting so, at the table.</span> <span id="s423">And she was very upset that some Jewish people went out in the streets to greet the Soviet army, the Soviet tanks.</span> <span id="s424">And i-it was even, I must say for -- for historical truth, that my mother called them interveldnikas, who went out in the street, because it was not loyal, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Interveld is a si --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No, they’re -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: -- low.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s429">The -- the people who are the lowest.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Low grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Yes, okay.</span> <span id="s433">Did you see them?</span> <span id="s434">Those Jews who went out and th -- you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: -- you didn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, I didn’t go there, no.</span> <span id="s438">But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and Lithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between two super powers.</span> <span id="s439">And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn’t be different, that for Lithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians still, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better.</span> <span id="s440">And I learned now recently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people were deported, and how many people came back from Siberia.</span> <span id="s441">So I was told that in ’41, the last information is 17,000.</span> <span id="s442">After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000.</span> <span id="s443">So -- including the Jews, who were also deported.</span> <span id="s444">So, as a whole, about 150,000.</span> <span id="s445">Now, from the people who were deported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not very precise figures.</span> <span id="s446">And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until ’51 or ’50 -- I don’t know how long, think un-until ’51, or maybe ’53, I don’t remember now exactly, the deportation -- 70 percent came back.</span> <span id="s447">From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it was still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it’s a paradox, but in some way they were saved.</span> <span id="s448">And for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and he could -- he suffered his whole life.</span> <span id="s449">Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his whole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation.</span> <span id="s450">They got killed in -- in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s451">So it is -- yeah.</span> <span id="s452">But, also among the Lithuanian, I would say, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volkspartei, the -- no, they were not socialists, but close to socialists.</span> <span id="s453">So they were thinking, what’s better, the Germans or the Soviets?</span> <span id="s454">And they decided better the Soviets.</span> <span id="s455">Why?</span> <span id="s456">Because under Germany, under the German governance, for instance, Prussia disappeared.</span> <span id="s457">No -- no -- no traces of Prussia any more.</span> <span id="s458">And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn’t disappear, but we developed our, in Lithuania, the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s459">The -- the -- re-revival of the nation.</span> <span id="s460">So, that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans.</span> <span id="s461">Then also, some people, they’re fascinated, like for instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they were fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet Union, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights.</span> <span id="s462">So it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers.</span> <span id="s463">So -- but that’s also understandable, because it was like saving from the deportation to Siberia.</span> <span id="s464">Was a very complicated situation, and is very interesting that in Poland -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not -- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed.</span> <span id="s465">So it is also in the region where the Soviets were before, where the deportations took place, and so on, you see?</span> <span id="s466">Then there is also another such moment, which can’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s467">Of course in -- in -- in Lithuania, the Jews had cultural autonomy and -- autonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody.</span> <span id="s468">Jews couldn’t take government positions, high up positions in the army.</span> <span id="s469">They served in the army, but not on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on.</span> <span id="s470">And they didn’t feel like equal citizens of Lithuania, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that’s a very short time.</span> <span id="s471">And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody’s equal, and quite a few Jews got into the administration, got into, you know, official positions.</span> <span id="s472">I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it was like an illusion that now we are equal.</span> <span id="s473">But this was absolutely illusion.</span> <span id="s474">And i -- and I must say ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother, Jorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in France and he came back and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of course, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s475">So, you see, he was still a -- a very much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on.</span> <span id="s476">But -- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very complicated.</span> <span id="s477">I don’t know if I expressed myself clearly now.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s481">Certainly you did.</span> <span id="s482">So, did you feel that the war is almost s-starting at a certa -- certain point?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: The -- th-the danger, the feeling of danger was present all the time, and of course everybody was shocked with the Soviet German pact, with the Nazi pa -- you know -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Ribbentrop-Molotov --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: -- oh, Ribbentrop-Molotov pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And in -- in the Soviet Union people who would say something against Hitler were arrested, you know.</span> <span id="s488">So it was a quite -- quite confusing situation.</span> <span id="s489">But of course, you know, people are optimistic and -- and still the war came unexpected, the bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: It came unexpected for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: F-For me, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: For you of -- how did it start?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: I was at home.</span> <span id="s494">My mother was operated in -- in the hospital Raudonas Kryžius, the Red Cross, by Professor Kanauka.</span> <span id="s495">She had the very, very serious operation which -- which ended very well, and she will be okay, but -- on the 16th of June.</span> <span id="s496">So she was in hospital and I was at home.</span> <span id="s497">It was not very far, we lived not very far away from the hospital.</span> <span id="s498">And suddenly I woke up and I hear some, you know, like thunder.</span> <span id="s499">I didn't understand what’s happening.</span> <span id="s500">And then I don’t remember who told me that it’s the -- the war.</span> <span id="s501">I was -- I -- I don’t remember who told me, but I know that quite a long time we didn’t -- no, hours, it’s not days, but hours, and then I think Molotov made the speech that the war is started.</span> <span id="s502">And then I was -- I was go -- going to my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You had the radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Sorry?</span> <span id="s505">Q: You had radio at home?</span> <span id="s506">You had a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yes, yes, we had the radio.</span> <span id="s508">And I -- I went to my mother and I stayed in the hospital, because I was afraid to be alone.</span> <span id="s509">And I tried to make myself useful and to help, because there were immediately wounded injured people coming in.</span> <span id="s510">And -- and I stayed with my mother there, I helped a little bit the nurses there, too.</span> <span id="s511">And then on Monday it was already clear that -- that the Soviets are withdrawing, are leaving.</span> <span id="s512">And on Tuesday the bicyclists -- no, the mo-motociklistai, how you say it, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Yes, motorcycles.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Mo -- yeah, moto -- came the -- the -- the Wehrmacht, they ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Ge-German Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yeah, yeah, they came already in, they were already in.</span> <span id="s517">And my mother was immediately transferred to a different room.</span> <span id="s518">A much worse room than she had.</span> <span id="s519">And there were such -- on Monday, a young Lithuanian boy opposite the hospital was raising the Lithuanian flag, and the tanks were still going out at this next --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: The Soviet?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: The Soviet tanks.</span> <span id="s522">And when they saw that he’s raising the flag, they wanted -- they shot at him, but he was not killed, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s523">And then he was taking in as a hero into the hospital and everybody was taking care of him.</span> <span id="s524">And -- and then the -- the Soviet tanks wanted to shot into this hospital.</span> <span id="s525">This is -- you know, this is [speaks foreign language here] what -- what -- where -- where it is -- and -- and m -- and they -- they turned, they -- the tank turned the --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: The gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: -- the gun against the windows, and I remember how the -- the Russian -- the Soviet soldiers, they ra -- they [indecipherable] to hand up and they were crying brazi, brazi [indecipherable] brothers, brother, don’t shoot here, we -- we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: The wounded soldier --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: The wound -- th-the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: -- Soviet soldiers in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s532">And then they -- they left, they didn’t shot, so we stayed alive.</span> <span id="s533">But on Thursday, my mother was arrested.</span> <span id="s534">A Baltaraištininkas, a partisan, so called -- we called them Baltaraištininkai came to arrest my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: From the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: From the hospital.</span> <span id="s537">But Professor Kanauka was so n-nice and he said that now she is a patient, so she belongs to me and you can’t take her, because she can’t even walk.</span> <span id="s538">But -- and she was kept in the hospital until Sunday.</span> <span id="s539">But, under the supervision of a Baltaraištininkas.</span> <span id="s540">And of course I had to leave.</span> <span id="s541">And he told me only that I should bring clothes for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Who told you, the partisan?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: This -- the Baltaraištininkas, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: There was a partisan who was left in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yeah, with a gun.</span> <span id="s546">Yeah, was left at the hospital to watch my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: To watch your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s549">And then m -- I left, and I -- on Friday I came back and I brought her clothes and she was already sitting at the window, and the Baltaraištininkas was probably flirting with the nurses, I don’t know, maybe, but he wasn’t there, so I could get in.</span> <span id="s550">And this was my last time I saw my mother, and she was 35 years old.</span> <span id="s551">And we had the last talk, and I remember that my mother gave me some, like, three commandments.</span> <span id="s552">And I can -- until now I can’t believe what kind of personality she was that she could speak about such things in such circumstances.</span> <span id="s553">Of course, she had the hope that it is a mistake and --- and that everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s554">But she told me that -- try always to live according to your possibilities.</span> <span id="s555">Don’t ask for more.</span> <span id="s556">Be s -- be independent and self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s557">And she also meant that if I need now money I can sell something of her jewelry or something of our belongings that I shouldn’t go and ask grandparents, or aunts or uncles or somebody else for help.</span> <span id="s558">Then the second commandment was I should always live with truth, because a lie doesn’t help.</span> <span id="s559">And the third, which is maybe the dearest to me and probably saved me in some way, I should never take revenge.</span> <span id="s560">So -- and she of course told me where to go and maybe to look for help, that she should be released.</span> <span id="s561">So I left her, and of course I started to -- to try to -- to liberate her.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Ho-How did you interpret the situation that your mother is giving you this kind of advice, these commands, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I am until now interpreting it.</span> <span id="s564">I think she was just a wonderful person and she believed in some very important common values she wanted me to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: But at this moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: At this moment why she -- because this was very important for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: But for you, you weren't surprised that suddenly she is giving you --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No, I was not surprised, I was -- I had -- I was surprised later on, and then I was just listening and remembering, and I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s569">It was such a situation, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s570">I was -- I was not reflecting then, I was only thinking what to do, how to save my mother.</span> <span id="s571">So -- and -- and I went to -- to such a person, Skuropskas is his name, he was working, he was a tow toninkas, he belonged to the national party and my mother helped him to escape the -- to save him from deportation, because in some way she -- she told him that he’s in danger.</span> <span id="s572">And -- and when I came, he was already the -- the minister and the -- he was sitting in the -- ond -- in the place where the [indecipherable] was sitting.</span> <span id="s573">And -- and he told me -- I s -- told him that my mother is arrested, could he help?</span> <span id="s574">He knows her, he knows that she was not NKVD and she was nothing.</span> <span id="s575">She was even not a party member, nothing.</span> <span id="s576">So he said there were hidden and there were open communists and NKVDist.</span> <span id="s577">So he didn’t help at all.</span> <span id="s578">He had already high position, but it didn’t last for long.</span> <span id="s579">And then I went to Pulkininkas Bobelis who was a neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s580">We lived together before we -- we -- m-my father built his own house of Laisves Aleja, at the beginning of Laisves Aleja.</span> <span id="s581">It was I think first, or number one, and -- house, and the house is still there.</span> <span id="s582">And he was a very, very polite and very charming Colonel Bobelis, and he came to s -- play cards with my mother and I was friendly with his daughter Laimuta, who was my age.</span> <span id="s583">The -- she had two brothers, Kazys Bobelis and they are -- ah, no, sh-she had two brothers, Jurgis [indecipherable] is why, the sons of Bobelis.</span> <span id="s584">But they were older and they were already very active in this movement of liberation, and Bobelis became the commandant of Kaunas.</span> <span id="s585">And I must say I had a very bad experience with him.</span> <span id="s586">I went to his house and he promised to help and asked me that -- he said -- told me that I have to bribe -- he has to bribe people so I should bring some -- some -- some --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: [indecipherable] End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Okay, so you were running --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: I was running away and of course my grandparents didn’t allowed me any more to go to him.</span> <span id="s591">But I must also say that I learned from Sara Ganita that he helped her family, Bobelis, and I also -- he released my aunt, the wife of stro -- o-of Jorge Stromas, who got arrested.</span> <span id="s592">And when he got to know that she is there, he told to let her out.</span> <span id="s593">So -- but my experience with him was really not very good.</span> <span id="s594">And -- and it’s painful for me, of course.</span> <span id="s595">So I couldn’t help my mother, and I was -- she was taken on Sunday to the pri -- to prison on Mizkavajoes, to the main prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: How -- when did you know this?</span> <span id="s597">When did you learn about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I can’t tell you exactly when I learned it.</span> <span id="s599">I was looking for her, but I got to know that she is there and that she is there with -- sitting with such communist -- Lithuanian communist Bud-Budinskinada, I think her -- her name was.</span> <span id="s600">And -- and I gave her -- I brought her something to eat and I got her signature.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How did you bring her --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: And -- I was queuing in line, in -- and they were taking packages for -- for prisoners, so I -- I once brought, and the second time when they came, it was I think, middle of July, I was told -- or maybe even earlier, it was told -- I was told that she is not any more there.</span> <span id="s603">And then I couldn’t find her anywhere, and I think she was killed at the seventh [indecipherable] I think, or on the fourth -- I think on the seventh, but I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s604">I can’t go there even, this is too hard for me.</span> <span id="s605">But this I can’t take, be -- my mother is -- she was such a -- a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s606">But you see, she -- she was already divorced and the narcom -- the minister were -- were called -- he was called narcom in -- in the Soviet times, Gregorouskas Marionas, he fall in love with here and probably therefore she was -- she was somehow suspicious, or they wanted -- I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s607">I think this -- this Skuropskas denounced her, so I think.</span> <span id="s608">Because not everybody was arrested.</span> <span id="s609">People -- they would take women from the street and man especially -- not so many women, more man.</span> <span id="s610">But -- but she ca -- she was arrested and I am absolutely sure that it was denounced.</span> <span id="s611">And I -- and she was, after such a hard operation and I was told by women prisoners who came out, and I met them in the ghetto, that my mother was very proud, and she would -- she was singing.</span> <span id="s612">Sometimes they thought that maybe she lost her mind, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s613">But in the -- she was interrogated by the Gestapo or by the Lithuanian police, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s614">I think by Gestapo.</span> <span id="s615">And she spoke, of course, German very well.</span> <span id="s616">And th-they -- they told her that, oh we can’t believe you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s617">She -- but she answered that she is Jewish, and she was not asking, she was proud and full of dignity, so that’s -- that’s all I know about my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And you heard it from other prisoners, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yeah, from women prisoners, that she was very nice and behaved very proudly and -- and very -- and full of -- with dignity.</span> <span id="s620">She didn’t ask for mercy, or she was not, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: But this you learned later, in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: This point --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: She just disappeared, and my uncle, her brother, Jorge Stromas was also arrested on Monday evening.</span> <span id="s625">He -- just because he was too honest.</span> <span id="s626">He didn’t leave -- he didn’t escape.</span> <span id="s627">My mother couldn’t escape because she was ill, and my uncle couldn’t escape because his son, Alexander Stromas was in Palanga.</span> <span id="s628">And my mother was in hospital.</span> <span id="s629">We were a very close family, old grandparents, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s630">So he stayed here.</span> <span id="s631">But he understood that -- he was the director of Parama.</span> <span id="s632">This is a bakery of bread.</span> <span id="s633">And he went on Monday evening to -- because the factory has to work, to give the keys away, because he understood that he will not any more be the director, so -- and then they arrested him, and I saw him working in -- in the Russian embassy.</span> <span id="s634">This was in the beginning of Laisves Aleja, guarded by a Baltaraištininkas with some other people.</span> <span id="s635">I -- I was very -- I was very energetic.</span> <span id="s636">My father, I must say, somehow prepared me for such a life because he educated me and -- to be very independent.</span> <span id="s637">So I went immediately to my aunt, his wife, and my cousin Margaret, and I brought her down to -- to -- to this place, and I was trying to convince my uncle to leave.</span> <span id="s638">It was on -- on Wednesday, to -- to escape, because the Baltaraištininkas was -- it was they were not so hardly guarded, yeah.</span> <span id="s639">The har -- it was -- he could escape.</span> <span id="s640">And I told him come, you -- you should escape.</span> <span id="s641">And my uncles said no, I can’t do it, because these Baltaraištininkas, we were all count and if he comes back without one person, he will be punished.</span> <span id="s642">And I don’t believe that something will happen, you know.</span> <span id="s643">Everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s644">And he didn’t go, because -- because he didn’t want, you know, to put in a bad position this Baltaraištininkas.</span> <span id="s645">And then he was killed in Lietukis in the garage.</span> <span id="s646">But this I got to know only after the war.</span> <span id="s647">After -- after -- after the war was finished, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: The Lietukis garage happened on the second day of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No, it was on the 27th, on Friday.</span> <span id="s650">You know, there are now controversies, who can now remember exactly, but in my opinion, I saw him definitely on Wednesday, and I didn’t see the Lietukis massacre, but as I learned from -- from literature and so on and from memories, it was on the 27th, on Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And Wednesday was the 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So, you lost your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yeah, I lost my uncle --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: You didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: -- and I lost my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: -- you didn’t know how, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: -- he disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: They -- they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: They disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: We -- I -- I -- we were all waiting a long time for them to come back, but never happened.</span> <span id="s663">Couldn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Then you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Was also a person -- you know, they were extremely -- my -- I wouldn’t say that about my father, he was a -- such a strong person, but my mother and her brother were extremely soft, liberal, good hearted people who wouldn’t really -- they -- it is so -- it is terrible.</span> <span id="s666">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: And a-a-a -- you’re left on your own, or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, I was then staying with my aunt, my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s669">The only who -- from the whole family who survived, and my grandparents lost all their children except this aunt, and with my grandparents, I went with them to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: But before you went to the ghetto there were still --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I was alone, I was in my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: -- two -- two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, there were not, there was more than two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: More than two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s676">The war started on the 22nd, the order to go to the ghetto was on the 15th of July, and the ghetto was closed on the 15th of August.</span> <span id="s677">And I had another aunt of a uncle of my mother’s brother who perished before, well died before.</span> <span id="s678">Died.</span> <span id="s679">No, died from operation.</span> <span id="s680">And I was -- you know, I was by myself 13 years old, but she had a little son, Lavinka, my -- my cousin, and I took care of them, you know.</span> <span id="s681">I was -- I was -- I was going to -- to -- to get some food, because the -- in the Jewish shops you couldn’t buy anything, so I would take off my -- my star, yellow star and I would try to go in this Lithuanian shops to buy something.</span> <span id="s682">So mostly I succeeded, but twice I was thrown out from the -- and [indecipherable] you -- why are you staying here?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: They knew you, or the --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: But I -- I looked like a Jewish girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: You looked Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s689">But what saved me sometimes is my language, because it was ma -- be-because it was, you know, like a stereotype that the Jews don’t speak Lithuanian well.</span> <span id="s690">They can’t speak Lithuanian well, they have an accent, they are, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s691">I had no accent at all.</span> <span id="s692">So, they couldn’t believe I could sometimes you know, like it -- it -- it made people doubtful.</span> <span id="s693">Maybe I am not Jewish because I speak so well Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And was it dangerous for you to walk in the streets in this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh yes, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s696">Very dangerous.</span> <span id="s697">And it was maybe you know, the -- the most humiliating thing because -- I don’t remember now exactly which day it was, but we were not allowed to go on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s698">So we had to walk like animals on -- on the -- on the street, not on the pavement.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: So -- and you couldn’t go two together, you have to go one by one.</span> <span id="s701">So this was really -- it was so humiliating, it was so -- and terrible.</span> <span id="s702">And then you meet people you knew -- you knew them, yeah?</span> <span id="s703">And when they see you, they turn away their eyes from you.</span> <span id="s704">And I was -- it was -- it -- it was so shocked, I couldn’t understand what happened.</span> <span id="s705">And -- and only later already, much later, I understood that they were turning away their eyes and heads because they couldn’t help, and maybe they were very confused, I am -- I am -- I understand that --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: And ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: -- there was no -- I -- I tried to understand this, but this was very painful.</span> <span id="s708">And I remember how a partisan, a -- a Baltaraištininkas on Laisves Aleja, I went there, I was with my star and he took my hand and -- and said, do you know -- don’t you know that the Jews have no rights to wear watches?</span> <span id="s709">And I had a Paul Bourret, which my father bought me in Switzerland when we were in ’38, it was a very dear present to me.</span> <span id="s710">And he took it off.</span> <span id="s711">And good he didn't beat me up or didn’t kill me, or -- but it was also very humiliating.</span> <span id="s712">I was very sensitive to such things.</span> <span id="s713">I couldn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: You knew him?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s716">But it was such -- you know, the atmosphere was really somehow terrible.</span> <span id="s717">My cousin Margaret, my -- the -- the daughter of Jorge Stromas, of my uncle, she later got to know that her classmates were -- were discussing -- they knew that she has a radio, and then the radio was not so -- so, they were discussing maybe let us go and take away from her the radio.</span> <span id="s718">And then they still decided no, it wouldn’t be nice, so they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s719">But once one of the group stopped them.</span> <span id="s720">So, you see, it was -- i-it was a atmosphere of you had no rights at all.</span> <span id="s721">You were nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s722">Everybody was an enemy.</span> <span id="s723">And when our former -- former servant, she was a cook in our house, she brought me something to eat -- so she was hiding, nobody should know, nobody should see it, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s724">And so it was -- it was really -- it was a -- there were some people who tried to help, too, but really very few, and everybody was very afraid to help Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: You understand such a phenomena suddenly -- not talking about the partisans and about the German Nazis, but the Lithuanian friends of --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Can you -- did you live some -- sometimes -- did you have the experience of living in totalitarian society?</span> <span id="s727">Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: So -- so, when you are living in a totalitarian society, you are afraid of your shadow.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: No, I’m not talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: This is what -- how they -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: No, no, this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: -- keep, and they know that for instance, Lithuanians who tried to help Jews were killed, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: This was not my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: I’m asking you about another thing, about those Lithuanians who suddenly found out that it’s okay to loot, it’s permitted, and then they can do it, to take the radio, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No, not everybody did it, you know, I would say the whole atmosphere was bad, but not everybody did it, no.</span> <span id="s738">Many people were ashamed to do it, it -- it is like, you know, when you say that the Jews were meeting with joi -- the Red army.</span> <span id="s739">So, there were some Jews who did it, some were terrified.</span> <span id="s740">But -- so the same is to say that Lithuanians, some yes, but not all.</span> <span id="s741">And then you see the propaganda, the -- the Nazi propaganda, which was taken also over by the LAF-ists, the Lithuanian LAF-ist Skirpa, who had a good intention to -- to have again an independent Lithuania, he thought that maybe Hitler will give him back the independence, but it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s742">It was a big disappointment, of course.</span> <span id="s743">But I know that you can’t use any -- you have, you know, this M-Machiavelli, that i-if you have a task you can pay any price, this is not valuable in life, it is terrible.</span> <span id="s744">So -- and it was, the propaganda was, you see, you are of -- all Jews are communists.</span> <span id="s745">It stays very deep in your -- in your con -- in the Lithuanian conscience that -- that they sold you to the Soviet Union, they are your real enemies and therefore you have to kill them like parasites.</span> <span id="s746">So you -- and I am absolutely sure that many Lithuanians really took revenge for their deported -- and it could happen that for instance, when their family or somebody was deported, some -- some of the people who came to deport was -- could be also a Jew.</span> <span id="s747">There were not many of them, but still, it could happen.</span> <span id="s748">This is why th -- you should never generalize.</span> <span id="s749">So it was like absolute belief that the Jews are your enemies, that the Jews are communists, the Jews sold your cu -- sold your country and there were maybe people who believed that they are killing the enemies.</span> <span id="s750">And only later it came -- of course there were people among the killers who wanted to become richer, who wanted the -- there were different people.</span> <span id="s751">It’s complicated, but i-in the beginning it was really that.</span> <span id="s752">And it’s very interesting, one lawyer from Solvakia, he told me how, after the beginning of the war, the Jews, I think it was in Vilkaviškis, they were collected and brought into the kazaram, you know, where the -- the -- the -- the soldiers live.</span> <span id="s753">And everybody was asked who he is and -- and they wanted to get from them, I don’t know, the men -- men, maybe men.</span> <span id="s754">And then one Jew was somehow -- wasn’t obedient, and they shot him.</span> <span id="s755">And they were so afraid that they did it.</span> <span id="s756">And they have hidden him in -- in somewhere, buried him in a secret place, because they were afraid that tomorrow will come a [indecipherable] and will accuse them that they killed a person.</span> <span id="s757">But nothing happened, nobody came.</span> <span id="s758">So it was absolute free.</span> <span id="s759">You could kill a Jew, you could kill him like a fly.</span> <span id="s760">Nothing would happen to you.</span> <span id="s761">So -- and then it is e -- it -- it -- it -- it comes like a -- I don’t know, it was a terrible atmosphere of hatred.</span> <span id="s762">You can’t -- it’s described in literature, it is -- it doesn’t last for very long, but it is there and they have to pay a very high price for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And then there was the decree about moving to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s765">We had to exchange flats to find a place.</span> <span id="s766">The Lithuanians who lived in Vilijampolė became our flats and we went there.</span> <span id="s767">Of course we all were very squeezed in, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Was it -- was it a relief to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: To go to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: -- to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: In some way, yes.</span> <span id="s772">Because -- because we felt really very unsecure and unprotected in the town.</span> <span id="s773">But this was also, as you understand, it was a -- not a secure place.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: And what did you take with you to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s775">What could you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I remember that we got a -- a coach with a horse and I put some clothes in, and food, mainly.</span> <span id="s777">And some -- what you had what could be maybe sold later on, or something, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: You were together with your aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: No, I live -- I lived separately, but -- but we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s780">I went with the aunt, first of all, of my -- of my -- of my -- that uncle, past -- Tanta Ada with Lavinka.</span> <span id="s781">And I stayed with them, because they were very helpless and I was already stronger.</span> <span id="s782">And then they were taken to the ninth fort on the aktion --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: -- big aktion on the 28th of October ’41.</span> <span id="s785">But already before I went already to live with my grandparents and with my Aunt Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yeah, because it was a more secure family who had some men, and Auntie Ada, he was a lonely woman with a child, so she wasn’t very secure.</span> <span id="s788">Nobody was secure, but still.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Now, can you describe the first weeks in the ghetto before the big aktion?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: The aktion started very soon, very fast.</span> <span id="s791">There were --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: But see, there were a few weeks there.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Y-Y-Yeah.</span> <span id="s794">No, you see, we were somehow trying to cope with new situation.</span> <span id="s795">It was immediately a question of food, because there were -- the Germans came, the -- the Nazis came too, and took away our, you know, food we had.</span> <span id="s796">Also, it was an order to give away everything gold, silver and so on.</span> <span id="s797">So th -- I remember how the Germans were even searching, you know, gynecologically, the -- the Nazis who came to the -- to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s798">And they took away -- I had such a bracelet here, was also a very pre -- a very dear present from my father, this chains, for lu7ck.</span> <span id="s799">Took it away also.</span> <span id="s800">Everything.</span> <span id="s801">Very brutally.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: This was the Germans, or the ger --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Nazis, yeah, those were the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Not the Lithuanian, the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No, the partisans were maybe also, but this were the Germans.</span> <span id="s808">They took away.</span> <span id="s809">And the lithu -- the Lithuanian partisans were looking after the ghetto, they were guarding the ghetto, and they were really -- during the aktions they would take the people, they would guard the people who were selected by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s810">And at the big aktion, I was staying with my grandfather and my grandmother on the 28th of October, and with the -- and th-there was al-also the whole family was standing, and my aunt with her son and her husband and his brother, and they went already through, and I was behind them with two old people.</span> <span id="s811">I remember I was dressed in my mother’s suits and I put here to make a bigger breast, I put some socks into the bra.</span> <span id="s812">And also I -- I took some shoes on higher heels to look a little bit more a -- as an adult.</span> <span id="s813">And then -- and my -- my aunt and my cousin went through bet -- but the parents and a sister of my aunt’s husband, they were taken to the bad side, and the-they were killed at the ni -- in the ninth fort.</span> <span id="s814">And I was, of course, it was already -- we were staying the whole day on [indecipherable] in Vilijampolė, we were already of course, tired and -- and I know that about four o’clock, it was already a little bit getting dark, it was -- and not dark, but that was not the nicest day there was, it was not so nice.</span> <span id="s815">And when I was staying, I can feel now like I was holding my parents behind -- my grandparents behind me and I was looking him in the eyes.</span> <span id="s816">And Rowka, who was making the selection, said [speaks foreign language] this girl has nice eyes, and -- beautiful eyes and told me to go to the right side, to the bad --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Together --</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- to the good side.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Together with your --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: To-Together.</span> <span id="s821">He didn’t see them maybe, because I think I hypnotized him.</span> <span id="s822">And then I was taking away my grandparents.</span> <span id="s823">I don’t know where I had so much, you know, I was so strong.</span> <span id="s824">And m -- I remember my grandmother saying [speaks foreign language], where are you carrying me?</span> <span id="s825">I can’t -- I can’t run, and my grandfather was also not so fit.</span> <span id="s826">And -- and I -- I told her, Bobinka, laif.</span> <span id="s827">I was shle -- I was carrying them until we got to the -- to the right side, so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: From what you describe, I learn -- I understand that already then you knew what was the good side and what was the bad side.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s830">We knew because we saw that on the one side are the elderly people, the ill people, the children, the weak people.</span> <span id="s831">And here are the -- the -- we didn't know, but we guessed.</span> <span id="s832">And then sometimes policemen would come and take out somebody, you know, and send to the other side, so we guessed that sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Policemen?</span> <span id="s834">You mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: -- Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: At that time the -- the Jewish police in the ghetto already had a stand, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s840">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: What did you think about them at that time?</span> <span id="s842">About the Jewish police?</span> <span id="s843">A: I thought of them -- I -- I knew personally Kopelman, who was the head of the police, and he was a very decent person.</span> <span id="s844">Not very strong, but very decent.</span> <span id="s845">And many policemens were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s846">And some of them were like -- like animals.</span> <span id="s847">So Armstam was terrible, you know, and everybody hated him.</span> <span id="s848">But there were -- this was onl -- th-those were only individuals.</span> <span id="s849">But as -- the police as a whole were somehow respected, in my view.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: You know, w-w-we -- you -- you thou -- you were talking about the big aktion, but before the big sh -- aktion, there was the a-aktion of the intelligentsia.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: And did you see though, can you tell about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes, I can tell.</span> <span id="s854">Everybody wanted to go, because they thought that there will be a better solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: What -- what was the announcement?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: The -- the announcement was that -- that he will work in archives, he will -- we need intellectual people, and we are asking for 500 men.</span> <span id="s857">So, of course I would now be suspicious why they are asking only for men, but -- but th-then -- and they went and my cousin, who was then -- how old was he, he was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s858">So he wanted also to go, but they had already 500, he was too late.</span> <span id="s859">So it was a -- it was very tragic, because really very good people went.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: And they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: They disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Di-Did you hear any rumors about what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Mm, you see, it is a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s864">You hear rumors and you’d want -- don’t want to believe in it.</span> <span id="s865">You know, and you don’t know.</span> <span id="s866">So when people say, how could they go to be killed like -- like sheeps, so I would like to see how others would -- would behave in such position.</span> <span id="s867">First of all you don’t know that they are taking you, they say you -- they’re taking for work.</span> <span id="s868">And then you know that if you protest at this very moment, they will kill you immediately.</span> <span id="s869">And there you have still some hope that maybe, maybe you will be taken for work.</span> <span id="s870">And -- and then, you know, you -- you probably know, I learned it also, for any moment you need a leader.</span> <span id="s871">You can’t expect that the crowd will do spontaneously something, you know.</span> <span id="s872">So -- it can spontaneously, but it’s [indecipherable] and people were afraid.</span> <span id="s873">My aunt, for instance, she had a hiding place, the widow of my uncle, Jorge Stromas.</span> <span id="s874">And she was afraid to step out from the -- from the cot -- from the group of people who was taking out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: At what point did she had the hi-hiding place?</span> <span id="s876">You mean Malina later?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: No, no, my -- my -- everybody understood that there is no future in the ghetto and that they are going to kill us all.</span> <span id="s878">And my aunt did everything and she pushed out her son, Alexander Stromas, and he was taken by a Lithuanian family and was -- lived with them unt-until their liberation, wonderful people, absolutely, Metsunaviches family.</span> <span id="s879">And my -- his sister Margaret, she got married.</span> <span id="s880">And her husband was a very active and very energetic man, and he organized a place, a hiding place in a factory, and a Lithuanian friend, a worker of this factory [indecipherable], he brought them there, under an attic.</span> <span id="s881">And even the German leader of the factory knew that they are there, but di-di-di -- didn’t denounce them.</span> <span id="s882">And he -- nine months he was feeding them, and risking his life and the life of his family, but they were saved.</span> <span id="s883">And M-Margaret’s mother, Auntie Jaina had also to come to this place.</span> <span id="s884">She knew, but she hadn’t the courage to step out, and I know what it is.</span> <span id="s885">I stepped out, so I know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: So this is later.</span> <span id="s887">We’re talking about later --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: This is already in ‘43, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s890">We are now at the end of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: And we -- you described the selection at the big aktion in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yeah, that was terrible.</span> <span id="s894">You can’t imagine how it was.</span> <span id="s895">It was the -- the -- the day after the selection when everybody came home, was such a crying, such a -- such a -- a f -- a terrible -- everybody lost somebody.</span> <span id="s896">It was really terrible, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And did you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Did you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: We didn’t know anything, but for instance, the next day and the day after, we heard shootings.</span> <span id="s901">So, I told you we believed and we didn’t believe, but we know -- never saw them back.</span> <span id="s902">We saw them from -- they were taken on the 28th to the little ghetto, and then the next day they were taken to the Ninth Fort from the little ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: And you saw them walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yeah, we s -- we saw them going, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And then you heard shots?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: For how long these shots were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s909">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s910">It went on probably for some time, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Did you hear anything about people who were taken to the Ninth Fort and managed to survive there and come back to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yeah, this was Judel Baylis.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: You know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yeah, I know him.</span> <span id="s915">I helped to publish his book.</span> <span id="s916">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: But -- but then, I -- if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Ah, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Then.</span> <span id="s920">Not later.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No, I -- then I really didn’t know, no.</span> <span id="s922">No.</span> <span id="s923">I he-heard only rumors --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: -- about somebody coming back, telling terrible stories, and some people thought they are mad, you know.</span> <span id="s926">But I was still a young child and then I -- I went to -- to -- to -- I worked, because I need to have some food, so I went to the aerodrome, to the -- to work.</span> <span id="s927">It was very hard work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: You -- when you say you went there, could you initiate this --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: No, no, I just joined the -- the brigada of the ar -- aerodromestikas.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yes, but how did you join them?</span> <span id="s931">You came in the morning and said, I’m coming with you to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No, no, I registered probably, in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s933">I don’t remember now exactly how I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: But I went there and then I could expect a little bit bigger piece of bread, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: That was given by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: It was given by -- by the -- we had some stores in the -- in the ghetto, so we would get there some bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you got some coupons to --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: I -- I don’t remember we had coupons or not coupons, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: But I know that my aunt, a cousin of my mother worked in such a shop and she couldn’t give me more, but still she tried.</span> <span id="s942">You know, the burt -- bread was cut so give me a little bit bigger piece of bread.</span> <span id="s943">And then she worked in the -- in the kitchen of the werkstatten, where I worked later on, so she gave me a little bit thicker soup, you know.</span> <span id="s944">But however, I went to -- with the aerodromestikas, and this was the hardest brigade.</span> <span id="s945">We had to work nightshifts there.</span> <span id="s946">And it finished with that I collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: What were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: We were -- no -- pits --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Digging pits?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Digging pits, yeah.</span> <span id="s951">Digging pits and with a kierka, with such a --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: For what?</span> <span id="s953">Pits for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah, I don’t know how to call it in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: But for -- what was the purpose of these pits?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Like trenches to make, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: For soldiers --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I think it was -- it is -- it had no purpose at all.</span> <span id="s959">It was just to sc -- to ca -- to -- to torture us.</span> <span id="s960">I don’t know if that’s some -- but opposite were -- also, this was terrible.</span> <span id="s961">We were already better off than the -- than the Soviet prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s962">They were so hungry.</span> <span id="s963">Was terrible.</span> <span id="s964">So we would share with them, but if somebody sees it, ger -- a Nazi guard, that you throw some piece of bread or a cigarette, they would kill you immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Did you see people being shot for throwing a piece of bread or a cigarette?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: I don’t remember seeing it, but I know that it -- it would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: You knew that it was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yeah, yeah, it was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: But you didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: No, but I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: How did you communicate with the Soviet prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: No, I didn’t communicate, but some people, they were -- we were -- they were a little bit far behind the fence, so we couldn’t direct communicate with them, but somehow people managed.</span> <span id="s973">And of course we tried not to work too hard, but the guards would come and beat us up, and I got also on my back some hits.</span> <span id="s974">But then it finished that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Who were the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: The guards were -- as far as I remember these were -- were soldiers, is -- German soldiers, mainly.</span> <span id="s977">I don’t remember it being Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s978">Maybe the Lithuanians were taking us to the airport there, but really, you see, the memory is not so -- is not so clear, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Well, this -- maybe it will help you to try and remember in what language they were talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I think in German, but because I understood German --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: You</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: So if I wouldn’t understand German, then I would maybe remember better.</span> <span id="s983">But because I -- Lithuanian and German I understood equally, so I maybe don’t remember.</span> <span id="s984">I only remember how a woman was picking up a piece of cigarette which this guard was throwing out -- throwing away, and she got terribly beaten up for that.</span> <span id="s985">This I saw.</span> <span id="s986">And some people managed even to leave the brigade, to get out to some Lithuanian houses and to bring some food, in exchange of some things, but it was also, of course, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s987">So then I’d -- I’d worked there at li -- I think about six weeks and then I collapsed, I was dystrophia, you know, I couldn’t move any more, I was absolutely -- and I got ill and I was lying in bed for six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: You -- you collapsed during work?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: No, no, at home --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: At home.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: -- I couldn’t any more go, I was absolutely dystrophia.</span> <span id="s992">I was still 13 years old, so I needed some food.</span> <span id="s993">I know how much teenagers are eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: So you stayed at home for a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: For six weeks I was -- I was ill and --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Anybody took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah, my -- of course, my family and then doctors would come.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Your family is whom you gra --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: My aunt and my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1000">And my grandparents would -- I would find under my pillow a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1001">So my grandmother or grandfather would take their portion and give it secretly to me, because the husband of my aunt was very -- he wa -- he wanted everybody to have equally and so -- but they -- they gave me some bit more, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1002">And he would cut everything in equal pieces.</span> <span id="s1003">So it was -- and then I -- then I recovered, bit by bit and then I got another job.</span> <span id="s1004">I -- the werkstatten were organized, and I was working there in the [indecipherable] this is [indecipherable] this is fo -- where we made toys.</span> <span id="s1005">And then already we saw -- we made out toys from -- from different, you know, m -- no -- no -- for instance, suitcases, clothes which were -- that was taken away from the killed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And you recognized this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yeah, we could ice -- I remember some inscriptions.</span> <span id="s1008">And of course I couldn’t recognize the -- the -- the clothes, but it is clear that the clothes was not very good clothes, the good clothes was probably taken by other people.</span> <span id="s1009">And then we made -- I made dolls.</span> <span id="s1010">We made dolls out of that.</span> <span id="s1011">We were cutting from the suitcases such round things to put like joints that we can move their hands, and -- and from the material we would -- we would sew clothes, nice for these dolls.</span> <span id="s1012">And the dolls were sent as presents to the families of the German soldiers, to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: How did you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: I -- we are told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: You were told so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: How many people was -- were working together with you in this werkstatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: [indecipherable] in the werkstatten were a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: In this -- in this werkstatten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: In the -- in the [indecipherable] alone, there may be 15 - 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Which was a small one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Small, small, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And how did you learn to manufacture this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Ah, you learn everything immediately.</span> <span id="s1025">Somebody knows better, and -- we had -- we had, you know, I don’t know how it is in -- in Russia, when you cut wood, then you have like -- like flour, how it’s called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: I n -- I know what you mean, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: You know what I -- so we would put it inside these legs and -- and bodies so it -- it should have a shape, and then we would put the clothes on, and make --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And you got this from another werkstatt, this flour?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah, from another werkstatt, because there was another werkstatt who made something out of -- of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1032">So they had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: And this period, working in this werkstatt was a relief for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: In some way, yes.</span> <span id="s1035">There were no reliefs in the ghetto, but still there were some -- the for -- the year ’42 was a little bit better than ’41, and there were not so many aktions, not so great aktions, and we managed even to organize an orchestra, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: What do you mean we managed?</span> <span id="s1037">You took part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Well, th-the -- the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And you took -- you took part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: That [indecipherable] me, no, but I identify myself with the ghetto</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Yeah, I-I see.</span> <span id="s1042">And you went to listen to this orchestra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yeah, yeah, these were moments of relief.</span> <span id="s1044">We were singing, people were performing and -- and then -- and this was really -- and I had a friend, Bobby Rosenberg -- brum who was playing piano and on [indecipherable] there were -- this was this concert hall, the piano was there and we went sometimes and listened -- were listening how he plays.</span> <span id="s1045">And he had also a hidden patophone and concerts.</span> <span id="s1046">Huberman was playing Tchaikovsky’s concert and Mendelssohn’s they had, so we were -- we went sometimes to listen to it.</span> <span id="s1047">This was just, you know, really moments of relief.</span> <span id="s1048">And then I went to school also there.</span> <span id="s1049">It was a illegal school, and -- because we were not allowed to have schools, but still, it was organized and I went there and I learned there, for instance, Schiller’s Ballade, which also, I must say, gave me a lot of moral strength, because as you know, Schiller in his Ballades is giving examples of people’s high morality of -- of -- of behavior in very critical circumstances, according to their principles, to their understanding of honor and so on and -- like the [speaks foreign language here] and so on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And this was for you something to identify with at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1052">With -- I always identified with -- I wanted to be like -- you can’t always be, but I wanted really, it gave me some.</span> <span id="s1053">It was also in -- coinciding with what I learned from home, from my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: May I ask you, you are, at this time a gi -- a girl of 14, and this is the time that girls start to think about romantic [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah, I had a romance in the ghetto as well.</span> <span id="s1056">And we are still friends until now.</span> <span id="s1057">It’s Dr. Jack Browns.</span> <span id="s1058">Now he is Dr. Jack Browns, then he was Yasha.</span> <span id="s1059">And when we were meeting each other and we were very happy to share many things, and I remember how after the Estonian aktion, when people were taken to Estonia and I was in the werkstatten and he worked also in the [indecipherable] but in -- in the biz -- he worked with -- with wood.</span> <span id="s1060">He told me that I shouldn’t go alone home, that he is going to see if his parents are there.</span> <span id="s1061">We went together and then he will see me off.</span> <span id="s1062">And I remember that we went together, it was a very good feeling and his parents were at home, thank God, and then I was living in the other part of the ghetto and we had to pass the Krikschu kaichu Street where the ghetto was very narrow and that was a little bit dangerous to walk there, so his parents were absolutely terrified that he is going to see me off, but still he did it, and -- and I came back and I also found my family, but many people disappeared and after the Estonian aktion, I left the ghetto pretty soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Why was it dangerous to go in this narrow part of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Because there were the guards, and the guards can shoot you any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Were they shooting from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: They -- oh, it can -- yeah, for instance, there was a very tragic story in the ghetto, which happened to a half Jew, Argie Saviskas.</span> <span id="s1067">He was a very beautiful man.</span> <span id="s1068">He is a son of a very famous Lithuanian writer and diplomat who happened to marry a Jewish woman, and he has two sons.</span> <span id="s1069">One of her sons is still alive -- of their sons is still alive, Augustinas Saviskas, he is a very famous painter.</span> <span id="s1070">And his brother Argie Saviskas fall in love with a Jewish woman, terribly ugly woman.</span> <span id="s1071">She didn't look li -- she had the child, but he fall in love with her and he joined her in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1072">And he was guarding the gardens in the ghetto, where we were growing some potatoes or something like that.</span> <span id="s1073">And once he started to talk to a Lithuanian guard who was walking around, and they got in some controversy.</span> <span id="s1074">And when this guard learned that he is Lithuanian -- because he probably accused them that he is a guard or something, he shot him, this Argie Saviskas, he just shot him.</span> <span id="s1075">So it’s a very tragic story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So it was frightening to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yeah, it was frightening, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: -- get closer to the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yeah, and after an aktion, you know, you are so frightened, you don’t know where the danger comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: You said that 1942 was a bit better than 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: This was a little bit more stable, less aktions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: But still, do you remember any aktions in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: There were different events.</span> <span id="s1084">People were punished for smuggling in food, and people -- I -- I can’t tell you now this, I should check really the dates, I don’t remember exactly when it was, but there were -- for instance there was a Jewish fa -- a -- a Jewish man who had a Christian wife, she was Belgian.</span> <span id="s1085">And they wanted to -- they -- they applied to go to the -- to Belgium, because she was Christian, and -- and they were not allowed and finally they were told that okay, and they were taken out from the ghetto and they were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Did you see them taken out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No, I didn’t see, but I know -- I knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: You knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I knew them personally, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1091">And how did you know they were shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Because they never came back and then -- then it was the rumors were spreading around, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: And have you seen any people who were punished for smuggling food?</span> <span id="s1094">Any cases of punishments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: You see -- that I saw th -- for instance how they go through the -- the -- through the fence, below the fence.</span> <span id="s1096">I knew -- I knew even the places where they went, but -- and they were bribing the guards often, but I didn’t see it by myself, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: You only heard about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yeah, yeah, but -- you know, I was not running around in the evening or at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: So I -- I’m trying to understand how it is to be a 14 years old girl in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1100">You have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: You have a love affair?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1104">No, a love affair, you know, it was all very platonic and very innocent.</span> <span id="s1105">It was -- it was another time, so it was not like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: In the sense that he gave you some strength, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yeah, we had very nice feelings, but we had no -- no sexual relations or something.</span> <span id="s1108">This was not the case in those times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And what did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: What I eat -- I ate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: I ate the piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: That you were -- that was distributed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1115">I got the soup in the werkstatten for instance, which was very thin, but still my aunt was giving me sometimes a little bit more so I -- I could find there some lentils or a little piece of -- of horsemeat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: How did you know it was horsemeat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Because my -- I know what was cooked, my -- my aunt told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: She told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1120">And I know already the -- the -- the taste of it.</span> <span id="s1121">And it is very good to get a -- a piece of horse -- horsemeat, not so bad.</span> <span id="s1122">Yeah, so this was the main food, and yeah, we made sometimes for -- when we had kipsventai -- what is Easter?</span> <span id="s1123">Easter is -- what is it?</span> <span id="s1124">It’s not a holiday, but what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: It’s a -- festive.</span> <span id="s1126">No, I don’t know what it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: It’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1128">I don’t know how it’s in English now, I -- I -- it -- it is out of my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: I can tell you in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1130">It’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: In Hebrew it doesn’t help me.</span> <span id="s1132">Unfortunately [indecipherable] I’m very upset that I don’t know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1133">The -- so in ’42 we were -- we -- for -- for some celebrations, okay, we made for ma -- for instance, out of cabbage, we made gehakt herring, this is you know, such he-herring like -- like when -- chopped herring.</span> <span id="s1134">Or out of potatoes, even sometimes we ate the -- the skin of the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1135">Not always potatoes, so we made out of the skin -- we -- we l-let it through a machine mixing -- mixer, and then we made -- we made kikolach, such -- such -- such --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: -- th -- like -- and then it -- it was li --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Cakes.</span> <span id="s1139">Some cakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Yeah, like [indecipherable] cake, yeah.</span> <span id="s1141">And then we made in -- out of -- we had rye flour.</span> <span id="s1142">This was already -- we brought sometimes in from the city.</span> <span id="s1143">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: What do you mean, we brought from the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No, when we -- for instance, my cousin went to work, so he was smuggling in, he was changing it for some -- he was br-bringing out some clothes or something and then getting for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Buying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Yeah, buying.</span> <span id="s1148">So then we made such a porridge out of this -- with this rye flour and if we had some spirgai, some -- some -- you know, pork fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Which was -- was -- was made, you know, with -- because we had not any more guze or -- or chicken fat, this was absolutely -- so -- and if you put a little bit in, so this was already a wonderful -- won-wonderful dish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Usually, were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, this was one of the main feelings in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1153">This is fear, hunger.</span> <span id="s1154">All the time hunger, you can’t imagine, it’s a terrible feeling, hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s1155">And -- and then also I was personally -- I really was suffering that I couldn’t learn.</span> <span id="s1156">I wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s1157">So this was also that time is passing.</span> <span id="s1158">But fear and -- and hunger was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: You didn’t feel any more so humiliated because you were among the same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Everybody was hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Y-Yeah, but everybody -- no, there were people who were not so hungry.</span> <span id="s1163">It was a difference in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1164">We were calling them the yallis, you know, the -- the -- the people who were in the altestenrat, the police.</span> <span id="s1165">There were people who worked in the Gestapo brigada.</span> <span id="s1166">So they were better off than we because they could smuggle in more, or -- or they had the better place to make exchange, or speculators who would smuggle in food.</span> <span id="s1167">They were all so much better off than we.</span> <span id="s1168">We were a very ordinary family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: What was the Gestapo brigade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Gestapo brigada was a -- the brigade which worked in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1171">Liptzer was a Gestapo, a Jewish Gestapo man who was working for the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Y-You mean working in the ghetto for the Gestapo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: -- collaborating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yeah, he was collaborating and he was also, I think, the head of the brigade, of the Gestapo brigade, if I am not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: What were -- was their task?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: I don’t know what they were building there, or they were -- they were doing some work there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, in the -- inside Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: In the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: And of course the -- the Ge-Gestapo was always interested if there was -- it shouldn’t be resistance in the ghetto, it -- the partisans guns shouldn’t be smuggled in and so on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: So they were using these people who were working at the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, Liptzer was not.</span> <span id="s1186">Not all ga -- people who worked in the Gestapo were collaborating with the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: But some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: No, no, but Liptzer was a yalla, you know, he was rich, and he -- he was working for -- he was a Jew who worked for the Gestapo, yeah.</span> <span id="s1189">And then there was another one Serabrovich who even lived in town.</span> <span id="s1190">He was a Jew, and he was also killed, and Liptzer, everybody was killed, but the -- he also worked for -- somehow for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1191">But you know, I was still a 14 years old, 15 years old girl, 13 years old girl.</span> <span id="s1192">So I saw it all, but not so -- maybe not -- I remember more talking then.</span> <span id="s1193">But I have seen a lot, I remember this terrible case when -- when the -- when the hospital in the little ghetto was burned down with people who were alive, with doctors, with nurses, with the patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: What do you mean remember?</span> <span id="s1195">Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, I didn’t see, I was in the big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Yes, so what -- End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: So -- but my friend Jack Browns -- my boyfriend, so-called, so he -- his father and he went to work, because they worked in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1200">And this day they were a little bit late, and the little ghetto was closed and they were -- didn’t -- they were -- they were not let in there, so they saved their life, otherwise they were -- would be burned there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: So you heard about this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yeah, I heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: -- you heard about.</span> <span id="s1204">Do you remember any case of executing someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: I know that there was execution, but my aunt didn’t let me go to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Okay, so we have change another tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1210">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: So you have an emotional memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah, my -- my -- this is -- I don’t know if this is important to say now, but that I don’t remember the faces of people who were [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1214">Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: I wondered, you asked me what were the dominant feeling.</span> <span id="s1216">So one I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s1217">Never, never -- I wanted so much to live as I -- as -- and to survive as it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1218">The -- the -- the -- the desire to survive was very, very strong.</span> <span id="s1219">And maybe the purpose for that, rationally, was to tell the world what happened to us, because it was absolutely unimaginable.</span> <span id="s1220">Out of my childhood, my peaceful childhood, with belief and enlightenment in goodness and humanity, and suddenly I see all those terrible, violent, absolutely rational hatred and so on, and I thought that we have to witness it to tell the world about that, that it should never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: You thought about this in this wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1225">Very much.</span> <span id="s1226">Very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: That it should never happen again, in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1229">I -- I thought that we have to witness it.</span> <span id="s1230">We have to witness it, to tell the world what happened to us, because it should never happen again, to anybody.</span> <span id="s1231">And I somehow believed, after the -- after the end that it will c -- everything will come up and it will really -- we will learn something, but now I have no illusions any more.</span> <span id="s1232">I know that if not Jews, somebody else.</span> <span id="s1233">Yugoslavia killed me.</span> <span id="s1234">Killed all my hopes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1235">And also I -- of course, the Soviets --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And Cambodia, Rwanda --</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Cambodia, Rwanda, yeah, but this was already later, after Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1238">But I must say that it is terrible that -- it is human nature, and you can’t change it, and -- and you will never change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Let’s go back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: -- the optimistic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: -- period th-that you still thought it could be changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1247">So, what would be your question now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: At the certain point you started thinking about getting out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I really didn’t think so much by myself about that, but very close friends of my parent’s, the Strimychie family, Bogdonavichai Strimychie, they came to Kaunas in ’42, because he was in Belgium, he was a -- studying there engineering.</span> <span id="s1250">He was [indecipherable] with his wife Onutay.</span> <span id="s1251">And -- and th-they knew that I am in the ghetto in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1252">They were looking for me, and they found out that I am there.</span> <span id="s1253">And then they have sent me a little note that there is no future for me in the ghetto and I should sing that -- to get out, and that they will arrange documents for me, and then we will -- I will -- I will -- I should escape the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1254">I even didn’t want to do it, I don’t -- didn’t want to leave my family and my friends and th -- I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s1255">But still, it was clear that everybody can’t be saved, and we have to try to save ourselves one by one.</span> <span id="s1256">And my boyfriend talked me in that I have to go, and -- and my family.</span> <span id="s1257">And so I got documents that I -- I became the daughter of -- I got the documents of the daughter of the director of the Marijampole gymnasia, Tregeis -- I was Tregita Irena Felisksor, the same name, his daughter had the same name -- name as my name, I was Irena, given -- the name was given by my parents to me.</span> <span id="s1258">And -- and h-he just gave this documents of his daughter to me, and it was such a green page of paper with -- with -- they forged in there a -- a photography picture.</span> <span id="s1259">And we decided that I, after the Estonian aktion, that I will leave the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: The Estonian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: The Estonian aktion was, I think the third or fourth of November ’43.</span> <span id="s1262">But I have to check [indecipherable] at the date if -- if -- to be very precise.</span> <span id="s1263">Or it was maybe on the seventh, I don’t remember, but in the beginning of November.</span> <span id="s1264">And then I had to leave the ghetto in the evening at six o’clock with the brigade, which went to town to work.</span> <span id="s1265">I should not put my -- not sew my sign, but put it just as a little needle so that I can easily take it off, and Onuta will wait for me on the bridge, which uni -- connects Kaunas with Vilijampolė.</span> <span id="s1266">But I couldn’t leave at six o’clock, it was something.</span> <span id="s1267">And of course the policeman there, they knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Did you -- did you say goodbye to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yes, of course, everybody was sitting with me at the gate.</span> <span id="s1270">Yasha, my friend was sitting with me, and my aunt was sitting with me, and -- and everybody, of course was very nervous.</span> <span id="s1271">And then, finally I was told that I should join the brigade and the policeman, who was counting the people, didn’t count me.</span> <span id="s1272">A Jewish policeman who was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: He knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yeah, yeah, he knew.</span> <span id="s1275">And then we went -- this is -- here is the gate, yeah, and here is Krikščiukaičio Street, and here is Jurbarko gatvė and here is the bridge, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: And here is already Kaunas.</span> <span id="s1278">So -- so I went out with the brigade.</span> <span id="s1279">Then I know definitely that Lithuanians was guarding us.</span> <span id="s1280">And s -- a friend -- somebody took off my sign from my back, I took off it from here and then I had to step from the group of people in the colon -- colonna, to the pavement, yeah, they were walk -- walking pavement, because we were walking on the street, the -- the whole brigade.</span> <span id="s1281">And this step, to do this was the most terrible thing, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s1282">I can understand how hard it is, because they can shot -- shot -- shot you.</span> <span id="s1283">But it was already -- I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1284">And the main I had only one idea in my head, not to run.</span> <span id="s1285">To go very slowly, not to show that I am nervous, and so I went out, I get -- got a -- gained the feeling that somebody is -- will shoot my back immediately.</span> <span id="s1286">But still I managed to go slowly, then I turned.</span> <span id="s1287">And I don’t remember the brigade was walking faster or slower, probably slower.</span> <span id="s1288">And then, on the bridge, nobody was meeting me, because it was already two hours later than it was expected.</span> <span id="s1289">And then I went to their house, I knew the address, but not so very precisely.</span> <span id="s1290">So I didn’t know the flats, so I rang the bell, and it was the bell of the house caretaker, yeah, you call it.</span> <span id="s1291">And they were the most dangerous people because they were really all serving in the ge -- not all, but many of them in -- for Gestapo, and they would denounce.</span> <span id="s1292">And I asked where are the Strimychie?</span> <span id="s1293">He told me and I went in, but I told them that -- that I was asking the -- this man.</span> <span id="s1294">So they were absolutely terrified.</span> <span id="s1295">They had two children, little.</span> <span id="s1296">But in the morning they had already prepared a ticket.</span> <span id="s1297">They took me immediately to Vilnius, where -- which is a more multicultural city and nobody knew here my parents or me.</span> <span id="s1298">And then started my life in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1299">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Where in Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: The -- th-the first place [indecipherable] took me was his sister’s, she was a dentist and she lived in Shwerinas on Mitskabajo Street.</span> <span id="s1302">She was a wonderful woman, but she was so afraid when I came, for three days she couldn’t eat, she couldn’t sleep, she was so afraid.</span> <span id="s1303">So I can’t kill -- can’t kill a person, so I had -- they took care [indecipherable] took care all the time what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1304">So I went to live in the house of her brother, Onuta’s brother, on the [speaks Lithuanian here].</span> <span id="s1305">It was a house which belonged then to the university before and I lived in his flat with him like -- like a relative from -- from the -- from the countryside.</span> <span id="s1306">And he was very kind, very good, but he was actually a little bit Bohemian, he was a surgeon and all the elite, artistic elite came, so I learned there Schema and Kuchinskas and Vukoshas and Yukonaviches, all the famous Lithuanian artists and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s1307">And well, there was a girl from -- from the -- from the countryside.</span> <span id="s1308">But Pranas, he was very goodhearted and he thought I must look like everybody.</span> <span id="s1309">So he gave me money and t-told me to curl my hair, you know, permanent [indecipherable] permanent, this is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1310">And I went, and then I became much more like a Jew, looking, because -- so it was not a very good idea, but nothing thing to do.</span> <span id="s1311">And once it happened, I lived there for more than two months and once I -- yeah, and I was a -- a friend, also very famous Lithuanian woman, Marcella Kubilutai.</span> <span id="s1312">She arranged for me a working place in the orphan home on Subacho 16, it was then.</span> <span id="s1313">And she told the director of this place that I am a half Jew, it should be a little bit easier for him, and -- and that I -- and he gave me work, I was working like a -- like -- no, like a sanitarka, you know, I -- w-washing and -- and feeding the children and so on.</span> <span id="s1314">And -- and once -- I will tell you later on about this orphan home, but Pranas, there came his friends one evening and brought a book, Van Gogh reproductions.</span> <span id="s1315">And I was -- I liked very much Van Gogh, and my mother liked very much Van Gogh, I knew him.</span> <span id="s1316">And when I saw this book, I forgot who I am, and I said oh, this is Van Gogh, so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1317">And then they all looked what kind of girl from the countryside is it who knows who is Van Gogh, because then you haven’t had so many, you know, books of reproductions as we have now.</span> <span id="s1318">So -- and it became a little bit dangerous to stay there because they were all very good people, but you know, sometimes when they got drunk, they got -- they were talking too much.</span> <span id="s1319">And also, he was engaged to a woman from Siauliai, Janni, who of course didn’t know that I lived there, and some rumors came that a young girl lives with him, so she got a little bit like jealous and wanted to find out who is this girl, so I had to disappear from this house.</span> <span id="s1320">And then I got to -- to a family of a Lithuanian Colonel Meskauskas, who was arrested by the Soviets already, in ’41, to his widow and daughter, who lived on Gedimino Street.</span> <span id="s1321">And Marcella Kubilutai also in this house, which arranged my -- me to work there.</span> <span id="s1322">But registered I was, in Pranas’s house.</span> <span id="s1323">So once, it was maybe a week or two after I started to work there, the gabrininia, the nurse, the -- the main nurse, she came, asked me, who are you, where are you from, who are your parents?</span> <span id="s1324">She asked -- she started so very suspicious to interrogate me.</span> <span id="s1325">And I answered all the questions as needed, and -- but I -- when I came home, I was very nervous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You -- you had the -- you had a cover story prepared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: No, I didn't tell her the truth.</span> <span id="s1328">I said all the time from Marijampole, that I am the daughter of the director of the school</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: This cover story --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yeah, no, not the truth, of course not.</span> <span id="s1331">And -- but when I came home I told Marcella immediately that -- that -- that I was asked by this nurse, and probably somebody denounced, or has some suspicion.</span> <span id="s1332">And she of ca -- course started to find out.</span> <span id="s1333">And then it really was that some of the -- my colleagues there was su -- was suspicious that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1334">I was still with my curled hair.</span> <span id="s1335">And -- and she went to director to ask who I am.</span> <span id="s1336">And the director told her that everth -- everything is okay, everything is alright.</span> <span id="s1337">And so it calmed down, the whole story.</span> <span id="s1338">And after a week of this event, suddenly some of my -- the sinit -- the nurses came in, saying that Gestapo surrounded the -- the -- the orphan hou -- o -- home.</span> <span id="s1339">And I wa-was absolutely sure that it’s -- they come to take me.</span> <span id="s1340">No -- a-and I really didn’t know what to do, so I wa -- worked -- there were two rooms, like that, and here in the middle was a little corridor, and here a toilet.</span> <span id="s1341">So I went in the toilet, into the toilet.</span> <span id="s1342">I put -- pulled down the water, and I was thinking what to do.</span> <span id="s1343">To run away, it is little hope to escape.</span> <span id="s1344">To -- to -- th -- and then I will -- if I escape, I prove that I am Jewish, that I have to be afraid of something.</span> <span id="s1345">And if I stay, maybe I will at least be able to defend Pranas, because I was registered in his house that -- that -- and say that he didn’t know who I am really.</span> <span id="s1346">So, because it was terrible for me to think that somebody will, because of me, you know, be punished, or suffer.</span> <span id="s1347">So I decided not to run away.</span> <span id="s1348">And I went out from the toilet, I was calm and I f -- was feeding the children.</span> <span id="s1349">And I hear already like, you know, the -- the shoes, the boots coming in and the director, dor -- Dr. [indecipherable] with the -- with, I think, three Gestapo people are coming in.</span> <span id="s1350">And I saw only their boots, black, shining boots.</span> <span id="s1351">And the -- but I thought that Dr. Rudokas is a little bit, you know, like making me a little -- like with his eye, such.</span> <span id="s1352">So they were looking around the children, they were -- it was a denunciation that rudo -- that Ruditis, Dr. Ruditis is hiding Jewish children, and this was true, actually.</span> <span id="s1353">But he proved them that they are Karaims, the -- the Karaims are also circumsi-sized and he didn’t give the children away.</span> <span id="s1354">They wanted to take the children for blood for the soldiers, so I was told.</span> <span id="s1355">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Who told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Dr. Ruditis.</span> <span id="s1358">And -- but he didn’t give it -- later on he told me.</span> <span id="s1359">And -- and then they left.</span> <span id="s1360">I stayed.</span> <span id="s1361">And this saved me, because it was proved that nobody came to take me, that I didn’t run away, I am here.</span> <span id="s1362">But I can tell you, it was quite an experience to -- to this day I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1363">So I worked there to the very end of the Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s1364">Then I lived in this house of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Before -- before we finish the Nazi occupation, I would like to ask you one more question about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeah, but I didn’t finish you my story in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: You know, fo -- and then don’t forget --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: -- to ask me about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1373">This is, you know, and then I was staying in this house of this Meskauskanya colon -- wer -- the -- the widow of the Colonel Meskauskas, Maria Meskauskanya.</span> <span id="s1374">I wouldn’t say that it was the best time I had, but okay.</span> <span id="s1375">And one day Gestapo came in and was searching the flat.</span> <span id="s1376">And I was -- my bed was in a sandylukas, how -- in a storage room, and was behind different stuff, was a bed.</span> <span id="s1377">But when you open the door you can’t see, you see only different stuff.</span> <span id="s1378">And the Gestapo came in and they opened the door, but they didn't go farther, they saw it’s a storage place and they didn’t find me.</span> <span id="s1379">But the very moment they get -- got out, I had to get out from the other -- from the other door.</span> <span id="s1380">So -- and I couldn’t come back because it was really very threatening.</span> <span id="s1381">Somebody probably already denounced or something like that.</span> <span id="s1382">So I went again to the sister of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1383">And then in a day, or maybe even faster, they found for me a place, and so I got to the family of my second mother, really.</span> <span id="s1384">This is Stephania Ledugania, you can see her beautiful face.</span> <span id="s1385">He is a book we were pub -- we published recently about her.</span> <span id="s1386">She was absolutely outstanding personality, she had six children and -- and she took me as the seventh.</span> <span id="s1387">And she was, I can’t tell you what kind of person she was.</span> <span id="s1388">And we became with her friends from the first day, and I would like to remember several little things.</span> <span id="s1389">When I came in there, I was brought in by [indecipherable] Strimitis, she introduced me as a an orphan and now I will be the sister of her children.</span> <span id="s1390">And she invited me for a evening meal.</span> <span id="s1391">And of course she had also very little to eat, but a little bit more than in the ghetto, of course.</span> <span id="s1392">And her husband was a Lithuanian general, he was already arrested and killed by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1393">She didn't know that, but she learned later, but he was arrested immediately, in ’41, when -- in ’40, when the Soviets came.</span> <span id="s1394">And -- and when she -- and she had such a -- agi-aginyeta.</span> <span id="s1395">She was a housewife who was cooking, and we had for this evening meal screelai.</span> <span id="s1396">This is made out such things of -- of flour with a little bit fat on it.</span> <span id="s1397">And what I noticed that she has put in my -- into my plate a little bit more than she has given to her own children.</span> <span id="s1398">So I was almost crying.</span> <span id="s1399">I was really very hungry.</span> <span id="s1400">I-In this orphan home -- I’m sorry that I’m a little bit jumping, but I am proud of it, I was feeding the -- the -- the children who were also more than one years old, and they would go -- get every day such a little plate with manakasha, how is it -- I d -- I don’t remember how it’s in English.</span> <span id="s1401">It is such a wheat -- I forgot how it’s in English, b-but a-a-a porridge out of little wheat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Kasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Kasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Kasha, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: It’s also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Porridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: -- porridge, kasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yeah, it’s kasha, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: I -- okay, so it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Manakasha.</span> <span id="s1412">And -- cooked with milk.</span> <span id="s1413">And this manakasha, oh, I -- I can’t tell you how hungry wasn’t I -- I wanted the manakasha to put in my mouth.</span> <span id="s1414">And every spoon was a fight with myself.</span> <span id="s1415">I wanted to put it the mouth, but I had to put it in the mouth of the child.</span> <span id="s1416">And the children, like devils were also very hungry.</span> <span id="s1417">They wanted to eat, they never left a spoon for me to eat.</span> <span id="s1418">Sometimes soup was some leftovers, but the manakasha, never.</span> <span id="s1419">And so I thought after the war I will eat only manakasha with milk.</span> <span id="s1420">It was my dream.</span> <span id="s1421">But okay, I was very hungry, so you can imagine what it meant to me that she has put a little bit more, and nobody -- nobody -- nobody noticed, but I noticed.</span> <span id="s1422">And then at 10 o’clock in the evening, ev -- everybody went to bed, and she had this habit, she was going to -- to every child.</span> <span id="s1423">We were -- three of her children were -- three were out of the -- living in different places, they were already more adults, and three were with -- with -- so we were four.</span> <span id="s1424">And she went to everybody to give a kiss, and then she came to me.</span> <span id="s1425">I was in the bed, sleeping in a bed in a dark room without windows, where her son, who was taken to Germany for work was sleeping before.</span> <span id="s1426">And she came and she kissed me and told me goodnight.</span> <span id="s1427">And then I try -- then it really -- I broke out with such a almost hysterical cry.</span> <span id="s1428">And this is what I wanted to tell you, how you can be indoctrinated by atmosphere of hatred.</span> <span id="s1429">She was shocked, why?</span> <span id="s1430">She came to kiss me, why am I so crying terribly?</span> <span id="s1431">And you know, nobody kissed me already, for such a long time.</span> <span id="s1432">I was all the time in fear.</span> <span id="s1433">Pranas was very good to me, but he didn’t kiss me, you know, or -- or -- and this -- Maria Meskauskas [indecipherable] was not such a very soft woman.</span> <span id="s1434">And -- and suddenly she comes like a mother and kisses me.</span> <span id="s1435">So -- and I -- I thought already that -- that -- I thought, how can you kiss a Jewish girl?</span> <span id="s1436">A Jewish human being?</span> <span id="s1437">It mu -- I thought that something has to be ugly in me.</span> <span id="s1438">Something what puts off people because everybody’s hunting me, is hunting every Jew.</span> <span id="s1439">So why?</span> <span id="s1440">What is the matter?</span> <span id="s1441">Something must be wrong with us.</span> <span id="s1442">So when I told her that, she also started to cry, and -- and we were speaking until four o’clock in the morning, and so -- so this night I really became her daughter, and she my second mother.</span> <span id="s1443">And we stayed so to th -- she died on my hands with -- with the whole -- whole st -- she has a whole story to tell.</span> <span id="s1444">But even after the liberation, I stayed in her family because I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1445">And then she was arrested and taken to Siberia, of course, was already then, but then she still came back and we were always very close.</span> <span id="s1446">And I think she loved me as well.</span> <span id="s1447">She was a wonderful, wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1448">She was a very religious Catholic, but never fanatic.</span> <span id="s1449">She was a very artistic nature.</span> <span id="s1450">She loved poetry.</span> <span id="s1451">She brought me, in those times, for instance, rouge, you know, like blu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Color.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: -- color, because I was very pale.</span> <span id="s1454">So -- so that I should a little bit have some color.</span> <span id="s1455">So, you know, in those times it was absolutely immoral to -- to -- to do such a thing, in the psychology of those times.</span> <span id="s1456">You have to be very modest, and -- and very, innoc -- but she did it, and I remember this little red box, I had it for a long time.</span> <span id="s1457">And we were very close, really.</span> <span id="s1458">Very close.</span> <span id="s1459">And she played a big role in my life.</span> <span id="s1460">She was never fanatic, she was never -- she was taking in everybody.</span> <span id="s1461">And she was very demanding only maybe -- she was more demanding from her children than -- you know, such discipline then, but she was very demanding of -- to herself, but to other people she was much more -- much softer.</span> <span id="s1462">Yeah, you wanted to ask me about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: About the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: But just to finish this, and you stayed there until -- until --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Until she was arrested and even three months more.</span> <span id="s1467">A-A-And she -- so it was a -- a whole story when Vilnius was liberated already, they -- they -- it started to -- not liberated, but the new occupation, but still, I must say for me it was also liberation, because I was not any more afraid for my life.</span> <span id="s1468">And it was the liberation from Nazis, but we suffered quite -- and I myself suffered quite a lot from the Soviets as well.</span> <span id="s1469">But -- but still the feeling was that now I can go out, I can -- can go to school and so on.</span> <span id="s1470">So, when the bombing started it was dangerous because we lived in the center, Trakų -- on Trakų Street.</span> <span id="s1471">So she went out to the outskirts of Vilnius, to a friend, Ponas Stabinis, and they wer -- he had a cellar and they would sit there in the cellar, the -- and I wa -- went with them.</span> <span id="s1472">But then I decided that I have to save -- I -- to do -- have to do something for her.</span> <span id="s1473">I loved her like I can’t tell you how.</span> <span id="s1474">And so -- and we lived in -- in th -- in this big, big house and courtyard, we were probably the only Lithuanians there.</span> <span id="s1475">So -- and all the Poles were around.</span> <span id="s1476">And the Poles didn’t like too much Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1477">And I knew very well that if we will leave at night during the bombing, the flat alone, it will be -- they will take everything away from there.</span> <span id="s1478">They will break in and loot the -- the -- the flat.</span> <span id="s1479">So I wanted to -- to -- to save it.</span> <span id="s1480">Crazy idea, but I wanted.</span> <span id="s1481">So I went back for the night to Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1482">I was -- I went to the cellar when it -- when the bombs -- there was also a cellar.</span> <span id="s1483">And I really saved everything.</span> <span id="s1484">But it -- but one day, I think it was Sunday, the fight started in the street.</span> <span id="s1485">So I couldn’t get any more daytime to them.</span> <span id="s1486">So I got stuck there for a whole week.</span> <span id="s1487">And the m -- the har -- the street was three times, going from hands to hand, from germ -- from the German Wehrmacht to the Soviet army and -- and back.</span> <span id="s1488">And there were many events there, which I have seen in the killings of -- of -- of 16 years old soldiers, who just without anything came down the street from Pilimond, were killed by a -- by a German tank.</span> <span id="s1489">Altogether 13 pen -- people, but one we -- we managed to save from there.</span> <span id="s1490">But however, it was terrible, and I heard the Poles talking, who is this la -- is she lithua -- is she Lithuanian, or is he Jewish -- is she Jewish?</span> <span id="s1491">And they were not -- and so I thought they want to give me away to the Germans, or what.</span> <span id="s1492">A-As a Lithuanian they don’t like me either.</span> <span id="s1493">They wanted to get the key from the flat, I didn’t give it to them.</span> <span id="s1494">But it was already too hard for me and on Thursday I felt that I can’t take it any more and I packed two suitcases and wanted to go on the other side of Neris, into -- in the outskirt of Vilnius where the family was.</span> <span id="s1495">But when I had already my -- my suitcases ready, the -- the fight started again, I couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s1496">And only on Sunday, when already the Soviet army liberated, then I -- I -- I -- I could get out and a quite famous friend of [indecipherable], Conrad Eskadatskas, he was a -- a -- a com-composer and a -- a conductor and a -- a quite famous musician Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1497">He came also to see if somebody’s alive and then we went with him to the outskirts of Vilnius to see if they are alive.</span> <span id="s1498">So this was a terrible walk through a city full of -- full of fire, full of dust, full of dead people.</span> <span id="s1499">Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s1500">But it was still already a little boat which took us from one side of the Neris to the other.</span> <span id="s1501">And then we got to meet each other and -- and this was also a moment which I will never forget because she couldn’t forgive her how she -- how she didn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s1502">It was -- it got quite hard to stop me.</span> <span id="s1503">I was stubborn, so -- so that she was happy that we are alive and everybody in the family remembers this moment, she was happy that I came back.</span> <span id="s1504">And then I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s1505">I went to school immediately and -- and then she was arrested in March ’46, on the 14th of March.</span> <span id="s1506">And I stayed still to the end of the year that the children should finish school.</span> <span id="s1507">And then we were already spread to different homes, and -- but I was going to all the prisons and -- and bringing her food and taking care, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: She was imprisoned here, in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yeah, the Soviet times.</span> <span id="s1510">The Soviet prisons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: And was she released?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No, no, she was -- she was convict -- she was -- she got a sentence co -- a co -- you know, they were called three people who -- who decide, the -- the Troika this was called, w-would decide they -- their fate and their punishment.</span> <span id="s1513">And so I got to know somehow that this trial will be on [indecipherable] and when she was brought in I -- I was there with my two sisters from -- from her family.</span> <span id="s1514">And we got from her a little note and I got a present from her.</span> <span id="s1515">She cut off her -- the end of her braid, yeah -- braid, yeah?</span> <span id="s1516">It’s long hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Hair, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Br-Br-Braid --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: -- how is it called, braid, o-or -- cassa.</span> <span id="s1521">I have it, it’s my [indecipherable] I have it until now and then she was -- a handmade serviette and a little note and -- and then the -- the -- the Russian soldier who was looking after, he was quite kind, he was giving her my note and -- and giving back her present to me so we could communicate a little bit.</span> <span id="s1522">And then after the sentence was already announced, she was taken with [indecipherable], this is such a black car, which would take the arrested people.</span> <span id="s1523">And she was -- we saw how she was taken from the -- how she went from the building to the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: -- what was the sentence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: The -- eight years at prison and then had no rights for five years to come back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1528">So -- no, sorry, she got 10 years.</span> <span id="s1529">My friend Tadas got eight years.</span> <span id="s1530">And -- and then, it was also a terrible moment, you know, when she was closed into this c-car, int -- into this black car, and -- and you saw her, and she is stopped -- you are stopped to -- to communicate with her.</span> <span id="s1531">And you feel absolutely helpless.</span> <span id="s1532">You see -- this brutal power you feel, you know, which is just violating you.</span> <span id="s1533">And I remember this was also a moment when I lost control and I was running behind this car on the street just screaming, and -- but of course the car was faster than me, and couldn’t do anything about that, but it was also a -- a moment when you felt the Soviet power, cruelty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: And -- and what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: She was in prison.</span> <span id="s1536">She was deported to -- to the sibe -- Siberia and she was there and she was released in -- in -- in fi -- I think after Stalin’s death.</span> <span id="s1537">She could join, but she cou -- was not allowed to come back.</span> <span id="s1538">She joined there her two sons, who were also deported to Siberia, not in concentration camps, but to work there.</span> <span id="s1539">They were deported.</span> <span id="s1540">And then in ’56 she came back to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: And you met her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1543">And she lived for 10 years and then she passed away.</span> <span id="s1544">But she was very -- she was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1545">She helped so many she -- people, she saved so many young girls, she never complained.</span> <span id="s1546">She never told about her suffering, she told only about how many wonderful people she met there, because the elite was in the concentration camps, in the gulag.</span> <span id="s1547">So she would maybe not have a chance to meet such wonderful people in ordinary life, so -- she was -- she was very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Can you say her name once again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Stephania ela -- Pellulitai Ledugania.</span> <span id="s1550">She comes also from a wonderful family, her grandfather was a caretaker of books.</span> <span id="s1551">He was kig nashise.</span> <span id="s1552">This was a -- he was bringing, you know, education to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1553">Then the Tsar prohibited the Lithuanian alphabet and -- when it was not allowed to read Lithuanian books.</span> <span id="s1554">And her father als -- also participate.</span> <span id="s1555">They were a very, very nice family from -- from Rabalninkai, from the north of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1556">And her husband, the general, he could also run away, together with our government in ’40, but he said that he will stay with his soldiers.</span> <span id="s1557">And of course he was immediately arrested and he was shot it seems, in ’41 or ’42.</span> <span id="s1558">And he was very, also, full of dignity, he never gave in.</span> <span id="s1559">He got seven shots in his head.</span> <span id="s1560">And she got to know it much later, already wi -- being in Siberia, people still live with the slight hope to -- to be -- to -- that their beloved are maybe still alive, you know.</span> <span id="s1561">And yes, she told me also that she took me because she didn’t know my parents, she didn’t know anybody, I was just a Jewish girl, and she said that the Jewish population suffered so much here in Lithuania, and some Lithuanians were not so kind.</span> <span id="s1562">So I, as a Lithuanian want to do my best.</span> <span id="s1563">This was what she said to me as well.</span> <span id="s1564">And she before -- I learned later on that she would try to help Jews with food in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1565">But when I came to Vilnius the ghetto was already liquidated.</span> <span id="s1566">No sign any more of the ghetto, only ruins.</span> <span id="s1567">You wanted to ask me something about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: During the period that you have been in the ghetto, was there any occasion that you had to hide?</span> <span id="s1569">To hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: To hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I don’t know, because how could you hide?</span> <span id="s1573">It was very -- no, I wa-was never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: There were malinas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: No, no, I was not connected with any malinas and we were a very such -- I was in a family where nobody would be able to build a malina or something.</span> <span id="s1576">And we did not belong to the establishment of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1577">Not to [indecipherable] at all.</span> <span id="s1578">And for instance, my cousin who -- Walter Mark Ginsberg, who survived in Dachau and he wrote a very nice book, “And Kaunas Wept,” which is published by Bet Shalom in England.</span> <span id="s1579">He’s -- he lived in England after the war.</span> <span id="s1580">So he -- he -- th -- th -- we were -- he even has no big sympathy today, iyalas, he’s in some way accusing, he doesn’t trust the -- some people of the altestenrat and so on.</span> <span id="s1581">Like for instance, you know, this famous book which written by Gollup, but now he is not Gollup --</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Torey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Torey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yeah, Torey.</span> <span id="s1586">So he was also iyala.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1589">So my -- my -- my cousin is quite critical.</span> <span id="s1590">I am a little bit more tolerant.</span> <span id="s1591">I -- I think there were -- Elkas was a very honest person and we had not the worst altestenrat.</span> <span id="s1592">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Did you have anything to do with the altestenrat [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: I personal ha -- didn’t have -- I was a child still, you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: -- and -- but -- but still, I for instance -- people who knew my parents and my mother and knew that I am a -- a -- a orphan, they -- I -- I got a Jordanschein, which was a paper which like, gives you security that you work and -- and you -- you get -- you like, have some security, but it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s1597">And m -- I got this place to work in the werkstatten after I collapsed at the airport, you know.</span> <span id="s1598">So this was done by -- by people from -- still from the altestenrat.</span> <span id="s1599">People who knew my parents.</span> <span id="s1600">I somehow remember more good things than bad things, you know?</span> <span id="s1601">This is in my nature, probably.</span> <span id="s1602">Or it helps to survive, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1603">I remember how my girlfriend and I, we decided that we have to -- to celebrate the new year, ’42.</span> <span id="s1604">And I remember how one Jewish guy gave us -- he knew that we -- we want to do it, we had nothing, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1605">So he gave us a little bagel, but very thin, wi-with a big hole.</span> <span id="s1606">And we -- when it was 12 o’clock, we were sitting and we were dreaming about post-war and so on.</span> <span id="s1607">And we were talking -- her mother was also arrested and didn’t come back, never came back.</span> <span id="s1608">And we shared this little bagel.</span> <span id="s1609">So this man I remember, who gave us the bagel.</span> <span id="s1610">This was a big thing, to give a bagel.</span> <span id="s1611">It was like now giving you, I don’t know, thousand dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Can we talk for awhile about Lithuania after the -- after the -- no, not after the war, but after independence, how it is coping or not coping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Oh, this is about 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Nine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: When we -- now, the last 14 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Please, I can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: How Lithuania cope or does not cope with the part of Lithuania in -- in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: You see, it is a very hard issue, and very unpleasant issue, and you have here to differentiate many things.</span> <span id="s1622">First of all you should know that in the Soviet times, nothing was really mentioned, and the Holocaust, if it was mentioned, was used mainly only for anti-Fascist propaganda.</span> <span id="s1623">And you couldn’t even use the word Jew, it was only Soviet citizens and so on.</span> <span id="s1624">You know that the Soviets destroyed finally the big synagogue in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1625">They destroyed the famous cemetery.</span> <span id="s1626">I don’t know if you have seen the -- the last pictures of that, it is really an -- and -- and they build houses and -- and ste -- and -- and steps and so on out of this -- of these stones.</span> <span id="s1627">So there was nothing, really, and th-the Jewish life didn’t exist as such, almost.</span> <span id="s1628">Only maybe for some propaganda.</span> <span id="s1629">And -- and when we became independent and even before the independence, when the Lithuanian revival started, cultural revival and -- and the -- and so on, then also started the Jewish revival and my colleague, Professor Kudaba, here is his picture.</span> <span id="s1630">An absolute outstanding person.</span> <span id="s1631">He was the organizer of the Lithuanian Cultural Society, and then, thanks to him all the minorities also organized their cultural societies and the Jewish Cultural Society was organized.</span> <span id="s1632">And for the first time all the questions came up about the past and -- and about the future.</span> <span id="s1633">So -- so m -- th-th-this -- th-the situation was really m -- very complicated, complex, and you can understand that a nation who is, after being suppressed and occupied for so many years is regaining its independence and want to establish itself in the normal democratic world, it’s not very pleasant to talk about participation in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1634">Also, I must say that it was not very -- it was still, I must say the -- the stereotypes of the -- of the 40’s and 50’s were still alive.</span> <span id="s1635">That the Jews are traitors, that Jews were communists and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1636">So I must say that anti-Semitism and the readiness to face the Holocaust was not a -- a simple question.</span> <span id="s1637">But I must say that on the official level, our government, and especially I would say Vytautas Landsbergis took all the really decent steps.</span> <span id="s1638">First of all, the genocide was condemned.</span> <span id="s1639">The -- one of the first -- it was -- and it has no -- it -- the people who took part in -- in this genocide can’t be -- can’t be [speaks Lithuanian here] I don’t know how to say.</span> <span id="s1640">They -- they have ever to be, always to be condemned, it doesn’t depend how much time passed away past then.</span> <span id="s1641">The -- one of the first things the government did was to replace the stones in the -- on the steps of tower of Kaunas, to take all these cemetery stones, gravestones away and put the o -- the other ones, not to go on those [indecipherable] th-the 23rd of September, which was the day of the liquidation of the Vilnius ghetto was announced as the day of genocide, and it was an order to -- to put out all the flags, Lithuanian national flags with -- with a black --</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: [indecipherable] ribbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: -- ribbon, yeah.</span> <span id="s1644">The Jewish cultur -- the Jewish community was recreated and -- and supported.</span> <span id="s1645">They cemeteries were looked after and m -- I am very proud that my former student, Vito Tostalakis was the first.</span> <span id="s1646">He was a teacher then, he took his -- his pupils and they went to clean up a cemetery not far away from Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1647">And killing places were also, bit by bit, together with the Jewish community, they were cleaned and looked after.</span> <span id="s1648">And of course, Jews got all the rights ar -- citizens and Lithuanians have absolutely equal rights.</span> <span id="s1649">That --that’s absolutely a matter of fact that I would say that maybe a little bit weaker was the question of conde -- of the trials, you know, this Lileikis and so on, but I must still say that on the official level, everything was -- was quite okay.</span> <span id="s1650">And m -- on the academic level, the breakthrough started pro-probably from ’95, something, ’96.</span> <span id="s1651">And I look -- came up and there were, especially our young historians, of middle age historians were ready to face the truth and -- and more and more information came up about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1652">So I th -- and now we have really already a changed situation on the level of the [indecipherable] intellectuals and with -- and not only a civil society is now really a lot participating already in -- in facing this question.</span> <span id="s1653">You know that Lithuanian in-intelligentsia created the house of memory, which is working in this direction and -- and they -- they announced already four times a competition, who were the Jewish neighbors -- for schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Who were the Jewish neighbors of my grand and grand-grand parents.</span> <span id="s1656">So the children are coming out through all Lithuania, to the little cities and finding out who lived here.</span> <span id="s1657">And so they go back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history.</span> <span id="s1658">And I must say that we made now about 700 schools -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust topics.</span> <span id="s1659">Holocaust is told in the military s -- academy, and in military schools and the military academy.</span> <span id="s1660">A lot i -- we have a lot of educational centers who are dealing with that -- with that issue.</span> <span id="s1661">And really hundred, hundred of schools and pupils.</span> <span id="s1662">We have now, you know, that Adamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and the gulag.</span> <span id="s1663">And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot.</span> <span id="s1664">I must say that our genocide center, which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement is now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation.</span> <span id="s1665">So I would say that on the academic level it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog.</span> <span id="s1666">A lot is really done.</span> <span id="s1667">I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief editor of the newspaper, a terrible article, “Who rules the world?”</span> <span id="s1668">And the answer was the Jews and the gays.</span> <span id="s1669">You heard, probably, about this article.</span> <span id="s1670">So what -- not everybody remembers, but you should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian organizations and Lithuanian individuals.</span> <span id="s1671">And during two days, this protest against Tomkus’s writing was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and much more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn’t, they didn’t even allowed me to sign because I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1672">Only Lithuanians signed it, really.</span> <span id="s1673">So that on -- organizations, not only individual peoples.</span> <span id="s1674">So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you should not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it -- you can’t say that it’s all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: In all this positive picture that you just portrayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: It’s so positive that it may seem a bit unbalanced.</span> <span id="s1678">The educational activity, the academic activity.</span> <span id="s1679">Is it -- is it put in focus, th-the -- the fact that those who murdered the Jews in Lithuania mer -- were mainly Lithuanians, or just the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: You see, it -- no, no, no, they -- everybody -- it is hard to recognize, it’s not so easy, but -- but people more and more recognize that some Lithuanians really, they were the executors.</span> <span id="s1681">Ma -- not always, but mainly.</span> <span id="s1682">But the initiators of that still were the Germans, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1683">And this is also clear.</span> <span id="s1684">You -- this is also a mistake when you put everything only on the shoulders of the -- of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1685">The -- the worst thing is that Lithuanian independence was declared.</span> <span id="s1686">It lasted only for six weeks, and the administration of -- of -- which had never real power, is temporary government, didn’t really know to do a lot about saving Jews.</span> <span id="s1687">Let us put it openly.</span> <span id="s1688">So this is really when you can ta -- maybe speak about some responsibility.</span> <span id="s1689">But otherwise they were auxiliaries.</span> <span id="s1690">They helped.</span> <span id="s1691">Lithuanians helped but I wouldn’t say that -- that it was done without, absolutely without Nazi encouraging.</span> <span id="s1692">And as you know, in Yager’s -- in Yager’s report, it is said that the -- the Nazis could never succeed so well if they couldn’t find so helpful Lithuanian auxiliaries, yeah.</span> <span id="s1693">The partisans who helped them.</span> <span id="s1694">But -- but still they don’t deny that they were -- and they had the full control -- this is what Yager says, from the second of July, they had full control of all the executions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: So they -- they -- it was -- you know, here I -- I must say that I know that I -- I don’t -- I -- I don’t justify killings and so on, but I think that Jews are sometimes too much inclined to blame only Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1699">Because they saw like Lithuanians blamed Jews that they made the deportation.</span> <span id="s1700">It’s just a mytho -- mythology.</span> <span id="s1701">Jews had no power to make it.</span> <span id="s1702">This was done by Moscow, by the K -- by the NKVD, by the -- by -- by very few Jews and even there were some that were mainly -- mainly executors.</span> <span id="s1703">But if a Lithuanian saw a Jew coming, so okay, the Jew is deported then, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: But it’s not by the same token because the Lithuanian did have guns and we know that about 15,000 Lithuanians took part personally in killing and shooting the Jews.</span> <span id="s1705">This we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: But they were organized.</span> <span id="s1707">No, not 15,000, it’s less now.</span> <span id="s1708">Vu -- vu-vu -- but I don’t want to argue about figures, but I want to say that Lithuanians -- Lithuanians were in a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1709">In a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1710">Here deported, it was a shock to the whole nation.</span> <span id="s1711">Influenced by a terrible Nazi propaganda, which was also taken as a tool by Luff and by some Lithuanian officials, yeah.</span> <span id="s1712">Then, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and Jews also had some role to play.</span> <span id="s1713">So I -- but -- but the nation was really in a shocking -- in a terrible -- in a terrible state at this very moment.</span> <span id="s1714">And it was really, in some way in the beginning [indecipherable] and then it came, of course it’s dirty business.</span> <span id="s1715">But -- but I can’t -- I can’t blame -- I will never blame a nation because I know that people were absolutely shocked by what happened [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: But I’m not talking about the nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: I’m talking about few thousand of killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Many of them are still alive now in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: No, no, not many.</span> <span id="s1722">Not many.</span> <span id="s1723">How can you say many?</span> <span id="s1724">There are not many alive, and -- and maybe -- of course they were -- they’re somewhere hidden.</span> <span id="s1725">I wouldn’t say that our procurator or our court is very much interesting to persecute them.</span> <span id="s1726">But -- and this is maybe the weakest point, but not only we have problems with our -- with our court and with our procurators, not only in the Jewish commission, in others as well.</span> <span id="s1727">So, I think, you know, really that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: How much we have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: He says that it’s finished.</span> <span id="s1731">I would like to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1732">Sorry the -- always we have more to say and l-less time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yeah, but we stopped at a very -- a very -- a very important point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: So I -- we should put another tape.</span> <span id="s1735">[tape break] So we were talking about the question of how Lithuania is coping with it --its past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1737">I don’t know how I succeeded, but I tried to explain you the -- how complicated the situation was.</span> <span id="s1738">And you see, being Jewish, and here is really -- this is very important, that -- and I suffered myself, and Jewish people suffered so much from generalization, from accusing.</span> <span id="s1739">If one Jew is bad, all the Jews are so, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1740">So I can’t do it to anybody, you see.</span> <span id="s1741">And I think that we have to understand, of course in a different degree, but Lithuanians and the Jews are victims of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact.</span> <span id="s1742">Lithuanians are also victims, because their deportation to Siberia, the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War, when Lithuania was still fighting for its independence, and of course it is a very controversial moment.</span> <span id="s1743">But -- but we have to take it also in account.</span> <span id="s1744">You -- you can’t see only your own suffering, you see?</span> <span id="s1745">And therefore, I am very happy I did not -- I didn't want to make you a -- a picture that now in Lithuania everything is solved.</span> <span id="s1746">But a German historian, Joachim Tauber, a very good friend of mine, he told me that in Germany it took 30 years from discussions on the academic level to the conscious of the people to recognize what happened.</span> <span id="s1747">So, it is also -- we have to be a little bit patient.</span> <span id="s1748">We can’t -- we can’t, you know, impose this terrible thing, I think it was the biggest tragedy in Lithuanian history, the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1749">And I think that for me the Germans, th-the Nazis are even worse enemies than the Soviets, why?</span> <span id="s1750">Because the -- the Soviets, we were still -- Lithuania could -- could resist the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1751">And -- and -- and they didn’t take away the honor of the nation.</span> <span id="s1752">And the Nazis in this -- in those times, they made out of some Lithuanian, killers.</span> <span id="s1753">So you lose your -- it’s hard for me, it is very sensitive, everything, so in -- in English it’s very -- quite hard for me to explain it.</span> <span id="s1754">But you understand, maybe, what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: I understand what you mean and it’s very difficult for me to hear such a sentence, the Nazis made out of some Lithuanians killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yeah, they made the situation which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Really, the kil -- th-the killers who were Lithuanians joined the Nazis, the German Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: -- and took the opportunity to murder Jews and to loot their property.</span> <span id="s1760">Why didn’t they -- weren’t they brought to justice?</span> <span id="s1761">Really, if Lithuania is so positive --</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: No, no, many people were brought to justice.</span> <span id="s1763">First of all, there were Soviet trials --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: The Soviet trials --</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Yeah, there were Soviet trials, which you can’t trust hundred percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: But -- but I was asking only after the independence, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: I told you that i -- during the independence it is not -- it is the weakest point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: It’s the weakest point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: It’s the weakest point, yeah.</span> <span id="s1770">It is the weakest point.</span> <span id="s1771">That’s I must -- I -- I must -- I -- I have to admit.</span> <span id="s1772">But according to the law they have to be sentenced.</span> <span id="s1773">And you know how it is very strange, but sometimes it’s probably now you can’t prove there are not enough businesses, I don’t know what, but of course I would -- I would -- as a Lithuanian I would take the trial those people and I would recognize -- I think that you -- only when you recognize the whole truth, then you are liberated, see?</span> <span id="s1774">But -- but you can’t also impose all the time, on -- on another nation what -- this is a -- a thing which has to grow out of the nation itself, not imposed by anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: If at -- if at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: If at all.</span> <span id="s1778">If the nation is capable of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: I think that every nation, and we have already enough people who are capable and are taking -- Brazauskas even went to Israel and apologized, and he was attacked here for that.</span> <span id="s1780">But now more and more people understand that maybe he was right.</span> <span id="s1781">You see, it takes time, it -- I see, in the 14 years already, a big breakthrough.</span> <span id="s1782">I see also the positive things.</span> <span id="s1783">And I think that if you want to achieve something, you have to think in positive terms.</span> <span id="s1784">You can’t accuse all the time people who have already nothing to do with that, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: And I [indecipherable] for instance, I will -- for me, Holocaust will always be a thing which I will never forget, and I think as a Jewish person I will memorize it.</span> <span id="s1787">But I don’t want to impose on others to memorize it.</span> <span id="s1788">That has to be -- in Israel is had to be memorized forever, but here it can -- it is already a question of -- of the people -- of the local people.</span> <span id="s1789">And I will tell you, recently I was invited to Siauliai for a talk about tolerance.</span> <span id="s1790">And I had a big audience, over a hundred people, different people, and you know that Siauliai is a city where Murza is located, he is the new Lithuanian neo-Nazi, Lithuanian fascist.</span> <span id="s1791">And I got a question, I don’t know if you heard about that, that -- that m -- during Christmas, next to the Christmas tree was standing a menorah because last year Hanukah and Christmas was almost the same time.</span> <span id="s1792">And Murza with his guys came and sir -- oversi -- and -- and crashed this menorah, he was destroying it.</span> <span id="s1793">So they asked me what I think about that.</span> <span id="s1794">So I answered them like that.</span> <span id="s1795">You see -- you understand that I have two identities.</span> <span id="s1796">I am Jewish and I am Lithuanian citizen.</span> <span id="s1797">And as a Jew, I wouldn’t even put on the main square, the menorah.</span> <span id="s1798">I would put the menorah in a place which was maybe a Jewish place or a synagogue, and I would remember and -- and -- th-the day somehow very -- very modest.</span> <span id="s1799">But as a Lithuanian I would be very happy that the menorah stays next to the tree, because there are no any more Jews here.</span> <span id="s1800">There are no any more people can light the candle.</span> <span id="s1801">There are no people who can be memorized by somebody because there are no Jews any more.</span> <span id="s1802">So as a Lithuanian, I would like to memorize -- I would happy to ca -- to light the candle for the -- my killed compatriots.</span> <span id="s1803">So you -- can you imagine the -- the reaction was I got applause.</span> <span id="s1804">And people came then and said that -- thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: You know, this is a very nice thing to say, what you just described.</span> <span id="s1806">I wonder if you could have said such a thing as a Lithuanian, unless you were also a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: I am.</span> <span id="s1808">I am double.</span> <span id="s1809">I am double.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Because -- no, I am talking about what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: No, there are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: -- you have chosen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: -- oh yes, I can give you names of Lithuanians who would say the same, and even more than I said, because I am still careful, and they would not be careful, they would be much more critical about Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1814">I can name such people like Iapramus Markos, Iacunis Markos, Avido Tostalaikias, Iakeenos Verjunas.</span> <span id="s1815">Like Ludas Troska, like Guidos Alexandravichas.</span> <span id="s1816">I can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Of course, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: -- give you a lot of names of Lithuanian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: I’m sure, I’m sure about this, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1821">Vytautas Landsbergis told it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: I’m sure about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: He said Vytaus Landsbergis [indecipherable] many years ago that the -- the Holocaust is not any more a Jewish problem, it’s a Lithuanian problem.</span> <span id="s1824">None of -- there are a lot, but not everybody wants to hear it.</span> <span id="s1825">I will give you another example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Wh-What do you mean not everybody wants to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: -- you mean everybody out of Lithuania [indecipherable] people on the inside Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Inside Lithuania and -- doesn’t want to hear it, and -- and I must say that the Jewish approach is sometimes also a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Anti-Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Non -- non -- no -- non -- anti-Lithuanian and non-sensitive.</span> <span id="s1832">And I really don’t agree with that.</span> <span id="s1833">I will give you another example.</span> <span id="s1834">Yo -- yud -- yudka -- Judel Bayli -- Baylis who was already twice going through all Lithuanian scho -- many Lithuanian schools to talk about his story, and meet with children.</span> <span id="s1835">And he was always nicely very met, because he is really -- he’s an -- he is a goodhearted person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: He’s a charming person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Charming person, yeah.</span> <span id="s1838">And once after his talk, a Lithuanian boy came and he said -- he asked him -- he was almost in tears, he said, Ponas Baylisi -- Mr. Baylis, my grandfather was sh -- was a Jew killer, what should I do?</span> <span id="s1839">What should I do?</span> <span id="s1840">Because he was shocked by all that, what he said.</span> <span id="s1841">So he embraced him, he kissed him and he told him, you have already done.</span> <span id="s1842">You un -- realize it, you understand it.</span> <span id="s1843">You are not guilty, you can’t be guilty.</span> <span id="s1844">And the -- and they separated as friends, you see?</span> <span id="s1845">He didn’t -- or I can give you another example of my experience.</span> <span id="s1846">I took in a Lithuanian girl to live, just -- she li -- she lived [indecipherable] I was asked by my friends to take her in.</span> <span id="s1847">And in Lithuania really aba -- almost everybody was told that the Jews are using blood for matzos.</span> <span id="s1848">And she lived with me and after half a year she told me that she was told she shouldn’t go to live with a Jewish woman, because she always will have some blood on her body, Christian blood.</span> <span id="s1849">And -- and th -- sh -- now I must admit, she said, that I was watching you all the time.</span> <span id="s1850">I was watching through the keyhole when you were in the bathroom if you had blood or not.</span> <span id="s1851">And now I know that you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s1852">So I also embraced her.</span> <span id="s1853">I told her, my dear friend, I’m happy that you realize now that there are a lot of mythology.</span> <span id="s1854">I don’t accuse you because if it was told -- y-you were told by your grandmother or by your mother, or by your aunt about that, why shouldn’t you believe them?</span> <span id="s1855">Why should you believe me?</span> <span id="s1856">But now I am very happy that -- so you -- you -- you didn’t commit a crime.</span> <span id="s1857">But now you know, and you can say to the others that this is not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: So to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: You see, so we had no -- I was not hating her that she is -- she has a s -- prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: So we -- we have two stories of happy end to this interview.</span> <span id="s1861">Judel Baylis’ story --</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: -- and your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: So you lost -- you lost --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: I lost my whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: No, no, no, you lost the -- the live and the good nature of humankind, you still think in a positive way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: There is no other way.</span> <span id="s1869">You know, Sisyphus, he was pushing the stone up the hill, always knowing that the stone will fall down.</span> <span id="s1870">But still he did it because he had no other way to live.</span> <span id="s1871">So I have also no other way to live.</span> <span id="s1872">And if I can help one soul, one person to get rid of hatred and to get rid of suspicion and -- and understand another -- we -- we speak always all -- we have to understand the other, that we shouldn’t be always treated as the other, but we ourselves are treating very often the others as the others.</span> <span id="s1873">I can tell you another story of a family, I can even mention the name, it’s William Good, who was jumping out of the Paneru -- Paneru pit, he was shot, but he was alive and he escaped and then he survived, also helped by Christian people, but in the woods.</span> <span id="s1874">And -- and his wife is also a Polish wil -- a -- a Jew from Vilna, a Polish orient -- more oriented than Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1875">And he was also from Vilna and they had a lot of prejudice against Lithuanians because for them -- I understand it also, because after the war I was even asked by people, how can you live in a -- in a country which is soaked with blood, with Jewish blood?</span> <span id="s1876">So -- and they were so full of -- of -- of I don’t know, fi -- some feelings, anti-Lithuanian feelings.</span> <span id="s1877">And then I told them that you can’t generalize it.</span> <span id="s1878">There are such wonderful Lithuanian people.</span> <span id="s1879">Such wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1880">And I brought them into a family of wonderful Lithuanian people and they came and they talked and they shared and they were, you know, even crying together.</span> <span id="s1881">And when we went out, Parella, the wife of William Good told me, Irena, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1882">You take from us away the burden of hatred.</span> <span id="s1883">I think hatred is the most terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: I see no better point in ending this conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: It’s a wonderful ending.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: -- yeah, thanks, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1891">We could have gone on and on and on [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Yeah, this can be forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: But thanks a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Conclusion of
