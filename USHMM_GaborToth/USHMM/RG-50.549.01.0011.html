voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s5">My name is Bella Tovey, and I live in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s6">And what else do you want to know right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: I'm going to slate this tape by saying my name is Nina Ellis, and I'm interviewing Bella Tovey.</span> <span id="s8">Today is Monday, June 10th, 1996.</span> <span id="s9">and we are at her home in Silver Spring -- Silver Spring, right, Maryland.</span> <span id="s10">I saw your video interview, and you talked a little bit about your memories of your liberation.</span> <span id="s11">And you were quite ill at that time, so a lot of it, I guess, is hard to remember.</span> <span id="s12">But could you maybe start there with some of the events around that time that are most outstanding to you?</span> <span id="s13">And how you remember that general period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well, I remember -- okay, that's okay.</span> <span id="s15">I remember being liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s16">That is, I don't remember it, but I was told later that I was liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s17">Q: What do you remember?</span> <span id="s18">Do you know where you were that day and what your condition was?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, I was in Bergen-Belsen in a barrack in a -- I was one of the lucky ones at that point, because I had a -- I wouldn't call it a bed.</span> <span id="s20">Stop it for a second.</span> <span id="s21">I can't think of the name -- I had a bunk which I shared with another girl because what happened to me in Bergen-Belsen, and I already -- I did say that, but maybe it need clarifying.</span> <span id="s22">That about a month before liberation, I was lucky enough to have been taken out of the barrack, of the death barrack that they called, where I was on the floor with many other women.</span> <span id="s23">And I was taken out of the barrack, thanks to my girlfriend, Frieda, about whom I also talked a lot.</span> <span id="s24">Who managed to get me out of that barrack into a working barrack, and it was there that I shared a bunk with another girl.</span> <span id="s25">And it was from that barrack that I went to work, but for a very short time.</span> <span id="s26">Actually, I had had -- by that time, I had had typhus, and when I came to this second barrack where I was supposed to go to work, I came down with typhoid.</span> <span id="s27">So that I basically worked for a very short time.</span> <span id="s28">And then no sooner did I get of this typhoid, I came down with what they called paratyphoid.</span> <span id="s29">It must have been a repetition of that high fever.</span> <span id="s30">And it was then that I -- as I was still sick with typhoid, I had fever and I don't remember much happening to me, that I was liberated.</span> <span id="s31">I do remember that my girlfriend, Frieda, came.</span> <span id="s32">She was very concerned about me.</span> <span id="s33">Things were obviously going on in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s34">The British must have been very close.</span> <span id="s35">Some of the SS men were trying to escape.</span> <span id="s36">Things were unsettled in the camp.</span> <span id="s37">I don't know it, but I remember being told.</span> <span id="s38">But my girlfriend, Frieda, who was in a different part of Bergen-Belsen because she worked as a runner for a hospital, worried about me.</span> <span id="s39">She knew something was wrong.</span> <span id="s40">She told me later she sensed that something was really wrong.</span> <span id="s41">So she came to see me, and I was on the bunk.</span> <span id="s42">I was feverish, I had not eaten, and I think I said that for certain more than a week.</span> <span id="s43">And I don't think I had anything to drink for days on end.</span> <span id="s44">When people tell you that you can't live without food and drink, well, I managed.</span> <span id="s45">And I wasn't the only one in camp.</span> <span id="s46">But anyway, she did come, I think she brought me some water.</span> <span id="s47">I think she managed to bring me -- she says she brought me some aspirin.</span> <span id="s48">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s49">And she sat with me through the night, and, in fact, I do remember something else.</span> <span id="s50">As she came to my part of the camp, I think they were trying to stop her.</span> <span id="s51">Because somebody did -- she was shot, somebody hurt her.</span> <span id="s52">And I remember that the only thing I remember is seeing Frieda and seeing blood.</span> <span id="s53">I saw a lot of blood.</span> <span id="s54">She told me later that it wasn't that she was bleeding so profusely, she was hurt in her arm.</span> <span id="s55">It was a very -- what is it?</span> <span id="s56">It was not a very severe wound.</span> <span id="s57">I think the bullet must have just scraped her skin or something.</span> <span id="s58">And she had enough presence she just, you know, put something around her arm, but it must have been red.</span> <span id="s59">I saw her bleeding, and this I remember.</span> <span id="s60">I also remember people shouting that we are liberated.</span> <span id="s61">I also remember that somebody tried to give me something to eat, and I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s62">And I know now, I knew later, too, that I was very lucky that I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s63">Because what happened is that British soldiers felt so sorry for the inmates that they gave them their rations, and most of the inmates in Bergen-Belsen were not able to handle that kind of food.</span> <span id="s64">And -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Let me ask you to go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s66">Do you remember very much about that working barracks before you got sick?</span> <span id="s67">Can you tell me something about who was in there, what it looked like, what your average day was like right before you got sick?</span> <span id="s68">Because it was about a month that you were in there altogether, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s70">I remember the barrack.</span> <span id="s71">The barrack was a long barrack.</span> <span id="s72">There were bunks on both sides.</span> <span id="s73">If you ever saw any of the pictures, it was the normal kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s74">You walked in and the bunks were on both sides, and it was like a throughway.</span> <span id="s75">Like a corridor in the middle.</span> <span id="s76">The bunks were double.</span> <span id="s77">You know, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s78">Very small, crowded.</span> <span id="s79">Two women, two of us sharing a bunk.</span> <span id="s80">We didn't have too much room.</span> <span id="s81">If I had to turn around, my partner had to turn around.</span> <span id="s82">You know, we had to be always aligned.</span> <span id="s83">So it was -- but it was heaven in comparison to the barrack from which I came where we were on the floor and just some straw.</span> <span id="s84">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s85">Of course, the barrack was also infested with lice, even the one I was in.</span> <span id="s86">Because . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you have any bedclothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: We had a -- oh, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s89">We had a straw mattress, and we had -- everybody had like a blanket.</span> <span id="s90">I remember we had a blanket.</span> <span id="s91">I remember it was dark gray.</span> <span id="s92">I don't remember exactly -- certainly no pillows, no sheets.</span> <span id="s93">But, as I said, this was heaven.</span> <span id="s94">Now, I went -- most of the people who were in this barrack went to work.</span> <span id="s95">And the work that I was taken to or was sent to was to sort clothing in a warehouse.</span> <span id="s96">And, of course, the clothing was the clothing that they had managed to bring from the other camps.</span> <span id="s97">From Auschwitz mostly, because a lot of inmates in Bergen-Belsen had come from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s98">And this was mostly clothing that belonged to Jewish people or other people that were taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s99">And we had to sort things, socks and stockings and underwear.</span> <span id="s100">All of it, by the time we got it, I think it was already washed.</span> <span id="s101">And there was an SS man in charge.</span> <span id="s102">Every morning we had to get up, I do remember we had to get at about 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s103">Appell was at 5:30.</span> <span id="s104">I was given -- when I came to this barrack, I was given a uniform, a famous gray and blue striped.</span> <span id="s105">Basically, what women were given.</span> <span id="s106">It's like a dress, not a jacket.</span> <span id="s107">Men wore pants -- slacks and jackets, and we wore like long dress.</span> <span id="s108">And underneath, since I was working in the warehouse, I was permitted the first day when I came, because I probably had rags by the time I got to this camp.</span> <span id="s109">But I was permitted to take from the warehouse a pair panties, I suppose maybe some stockings, maybe slacks.</span> <span id="s110">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s111">And it was winter.</span> <span id="s112">A blouse and a sweater.</span> <span id="s113">I didn't have a bra, I didn't any bra.</span> <span id="s114">I was just as flat as anything.</span> <span id="s115">I was very skinny already.</span> <span id="s116">The way one could survive in Bergen-Belsen when one worked, and that's why the death rate on this working camps was a little lower, was that you could steal something and exchange it.</span> <span id="s117">So when I finally got to this working place where that first day that I got my clothing, when I came home -- home meaning to the barrack -- I would, say, take off my sweater.</span> <span id="s118">And the next day, I would just put on my blouse and that uniform, and that sweater stayed on my bunk, let's say.</span> <span id="s119">Or I sold it that evening for a couple pieces of bread maybe or a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s120">Then the next day, I would go to work, and when I was working, there was always a chance you could sneak in somewhere and get a pair of -- get another sweater and put it on and then I had something.</span> <span id="s121">Unfortunately, we had a kapo.</span> <span id="s122">A kapo is a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s123">Actually, she was probably just a couple of years older than I.</span> <span id="s124">She was very pretty.</span> <span id="s125">She was not a ______ like I was.</span> <span id="s126">I was very skinny, I looked like -- I was already at that point a walking skeleton, and I think she disliked me.</span> <span id="s127">She disliked all of us who looked so terribly bad, and I thought one day of trying to read.</span> <span id="s128">I'm sure something was written about Jewish women -- of course, she was a bitch.</span> <span id="s129">But why she was so particularly mean to me and those of us who looked so bad would probably make a good case study for a psychologist.</span> <span id="s130">Was it that she saw in me what could happen to her?</span> <span id="s131">Probably.</span> <span id="s132">There was another reason why she disliked me, and that was my own fault.</span> <span id="s133">The SS man who was in charge of our group sent her to get some books from a little -- there was a little office where he had some books.</span> <span id="s134">He needed something.</span> <span id="s135">Well, she was I think illiterate, or if she was not illiterate -- maybe she was not illiterate.</span> <span id="s136">But she certainly did not read and write German.</span> <span id="s137">I don't know how good her Polish was.</span> <span id="s138">I didn't speak to her much.</span> <span id="s139">She was born in Poland, she came from a little town.</span> <span id="s140">She was very pretty.</span> <span id="s141">So he sent her to get the book, and she brought the wrong book because she didn't know how to read.</span> <span id="s142">But she didn't have the courage to tell him, "I don't read German."</span> <span id="s143">So he turned around and looked at me, and he said, "This little one looks smart.</span> <span id="s144">Why don't you go and get me the book?"</span> <span id="s145">And I made a horrible mistake, and brought him the right book.</span> <span id="s146">And she never forgave me for that, so as a result, what she did is the following day when we came on appell, she made me lift up my uniform to check what I missing.</span> <span id="s147">And when she saw that I didn't have a blouse on, that I only had the sweater which is what maybe I was hoping to steal so I could have a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s148">Right away, whatever I sold and whatever I got for it I shared with my girlfriend, Frieda, always.</span> <span id="s149">So she said -- she started beating on me, of course, and she said, "You're not going to take anything back with you."</span> <span id="s150">Even though this was a kind of a gentleman's agreement, everybody did it.</span> <span id="s151">She did it, too.</span> <span id="s152">And so my career in that sense ended.</span> <span id="s153">I had an interesting thing that happened because of it.</span> <span id="s154">I'm taking you to a different part.</span> <span id="s155">The girl with whom I shared that bunk was a cousin of Frieda's friend in the hospital.</span> <span id="s156">When Frieda was taken out from that barrack, from that death barrack, very -- originally, if you heard my story, you know that someone whose life was saved my Frieda's sister took her out of that place.</span> <span id="s157">And she first didn't want to go, but she went because, of course -- that same, her name was Salka Longett (ph), the same woman who took Frieda out of the death barrack took out another girl by the name of -- her name was Ruth, and I don't remember her other name now.</span> <span id="s158">And Ruth was her girlfriend, so she also saved Ruth.</span> <span id="s159">I mean -- I don't mean save, but took her out that horrible barrack where the death rate was the highest.</span> <span id="s160">So when Frieda was able to get me to this working barrack, that friend of hers, Ruth, with whom she became friendly now because they were working together in that hospital, managed to get her cousin.</span> <span id="s161">And that cousin's name was -- I don't remember anymore, Franka (ph), Francis.</span> <span id="s162">She was a very placid, not very bright girl, and I think she was just not a very nice person.</span> <span id="s163">But maybe, maybe just not to me, I don't know.</span> <span id="s164">She fared much better with the kapo.</span> <span id="s165">First of all, she was not that skinny.</span> <span id="s166">As I said, I think she was not that bright.</span> <span id="s167">And she was managing to -- and she didn't get sick as I did shortly after that.</span> <span id="s168">But whatever it was, but she knew that all of us were bringing things.</span> <span id="s169">She didn't know that I was being picked on by the kapo, or she didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s170">What she did do is that after the war, after I was already out of the hospital and now I'm going ahead of it.</span> <span id="s171">I didn't see my friend, Frieda.</span> <span id="s172">I fully expected her to come and see me, and she didn't.</span> <span id="s173">She came to the hospital once, maybe.</span> <span id="s174">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s175">But just the relationship was not what it was, and so I went -- when I was already better, I went to see my girlfriend, Frieda.</span> <span id="s176">And she was cold to me, she wasn't very pleasant.</span> <span id="s177">I don't know that I ever told anybody that, but I just remembered.</span> <span id="s178">So I said, "Frieda" -- we went out for a walk.</span> <span id="s179">It was already in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s180">And I said to her, "Frieda, what's going on?</span> <span id="s181">Why are you so uncaring?</span> <span id="s182">Is something wrong?"</span> <span id="s183">And she got very angry.</span> <span id="s184">She got very upset, and she said that Francis, the other girl, told her that I did not share with her everything that I was able to get -- you know, that I was getting, bringing some stuff and I was probably selling it and getting maybe some bread.</span> <span id="s185">And I want you to know that Frieda was not living in heaven there.</span> <span id="s186">I mean she was working in that hospital, but she was hungry from -- I mean there was just no question that Bergen-Belsen was a horrible place, even if you work.</span> <span id="s187">And she said that she was very hurt when she heard Francis tell her that I did not share, because this was -- you know, we were like sisters.</span> <span id="s188">This was an agreement that -- we didn't write anything to each other, but this was a given.</span> <span id="s189">And she said to me that that's what Francis told her, that I did not -- that I basically cheated on Frieda.</span> <span id="s190">And I got terribly upset, I remember I cried.</span> <span id="s191">We had a long talk, and we made up.</span> <span id="s192">She believed me.</span> <span id="s193">I'm grateful to this day we are still friends.</span> <span id="s194">In fact, I just saw her in Israel again.</span> <span id="s195">But so I had this terrible experience, but it was this Francis with whom I shared, that bum.</span> <span id="s196">And it was this Francis who I remember, because she did not get sick as I did, when I was so sick toward the end of my stay in Bergen-Belsen that she just was just a very uncaring person, at least as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s197">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: The close relationship that you had with Frieda was clearly very important to you.</span> <span id="s199">Was that -- did other women have close relationships like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: That was very important to many of us.</span> <span id="s201">Very often a relationship such as this was was there between, let's say, two sisters.</span> <span id="s202">If some of them were lucky and they had a mother and daughter, but usually two sisters, two cousins.</span> <span id="s203">Interestingly enough, not always did the two sisters get along.</span> <span id="s204">It was not always, but many of us did form these kind of relationships, and it was extremely important for all kinds of reasons.</span> <span id="s205">I mean not just -- first of all, it was important to survival.</span> <span id="s206">When we were on the death march, when Frieda couldn't walk, I dragged her.</span> <span id="s207">And when she didn't want to get up, I pushed her.</span> <span id="s208">Or I couldn't -- and in Bergen-Belsen, if it wouldn't be for Frieda, I probably wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you.</span> <span id="s209">There's no question that she saved my life, and I don't think this was true just for me.</span> <span id="s210">We had a lot of us formed these kind of relationships.</span> <span id="s211">I know that Henry, my husband, had a kind of -- actually, he was with a group, but he had one friend who I didn't even know about, because Henry doesn't talk much.</span> <span id="s212">But we were in Sweden a couple of years ago, and we were staying with one of his friends with whom he was in Auschwitz and in the camps.</span> <span id="s213">And his name is Jacob, and they were awfully nice to us.</span> <span id="s214">We had a tour, but then we stayed a couple of days with them.</span> <span id="s215">And Jacob told me for the first time, I didn't know, that he's alive because of Henry.</span> <span id="s216">That Henry literally carried him during the death march.</span> <span id="s217">Henry never told me that, but these things were happening to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s218">This was very important to have somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Once the British came and you started to get your health back, you stayed there because it became a DP camp; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: How did -- what was your life like there, let's just say, for like the first three months or so of that summer of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I'm trying to remember.</span> <span id="s223">I probably came out of the hospital -- I was liberated on April 15th.</span> <span id="s224">I have no dates to give you, I don't remember when I was -- they probably took me out of the hospital as soon as I was not contagious.</span> <span id="s225">Because when I was taken to the hospital, I had paratyphus, but I was already lucid.</span> <span id="s226">I, for instance, remember being taken out, not fully, but I remember that they put us on a truck or something, since the sick people went first.</span> <span id="s227">But I do remember being sprayed with DDT, I always talk about it; it's such a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s228">And I remember that the air, when we're driven out of Bergen-Belsen, the air smelled so sweet once we left.</span> <span id="s229">But I don't remember how long I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s230">It was not probably a very long time because I think that it was already in May I was already in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s231">In the DP camp, actually, you probably know about it, was formed in a place called Bergen, not Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s232">Bergen had -- these were army, this was an army camp.</span> <span id="s233">And what the British did, is that they took over the German Army camp, and they turned it into a DP camp.</span> <span id="s234">The Jews were not the only inmates there.</span> <span id="s235">They had Russians -- I don't think there were too many Poles there, meaning non-Jewish Polish people.</span> <span id="s236">There was Polish, but no Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">They had men and women, but they kept the barracks separately.</span> <span id="s238">So I was put in, I remember I was in Block -- if I'm not mistaken -- Block Number 73, which was one of the blocks where the women were put.</span> <span id="s239">And what they would do, we were given a room, the blocks was a two-story house.</span> <span id="s240">I don't remember how many rooms were on each floor, but I do remember that we had a bathroom and showers on one floor and then one -- so I have no idea how many.</span> <span id="s241">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s242">I do know that I was given a room on the second story, second floor with this Francis.</span> <span id="s243">Probably because I came out with her, and I very quickly moved out.</span> <span id="s244">I didn't want to share with her.</span> <span id="s245">There may have been somebody else in that room.</span> <span id="s246">And I met a very nice girl who was from Lódz, was in Bergen-Belsen, who was about five years older than I. And I actually came to borrow a frying pan from her, I wanted to do something.</span> <span id="s247">And we became very friendly, and she took me into the room where she shared with three other women.</span> <span id="s248">And so we were five of us in one room, and we also had bunks, but these bunks were now private.</span> <span id="s249">I had my own bunk, and there was one above me and there were five or six bunks.</span> <span id="s250">Because I think eventually, we took in another girl, and the room had -- so we had bunks.</span> <span id="s251">It was a good-sized room, and there was a table in the middle.</span> <span id="s252">And then there was a closet, I suppose, for clothing.</span> <span id="s253">People had clothing.</span> <span id="s254">And then, of course, if we wanted to wash and shower or use the bathroom, there was one big communal.</span> <span id="s255">I suppose this was the way soldiers lived in these barracks, so that's -- it was summer.</span> <span id="s256">We were coming out from a bad situation, we had food.</span> <span id="s257">It was not wonderful food, but we were -- I'm trying to remember.</span> <span id="s258">We probably were given all the bread we -- we had enough.</span> <span id="s259">I remember for the first time not being hungry, which means that we were given soups.</span> <span id="s260">I think ONR moved in rather quickly and provided, they had big kitchens.</span> <span id="s261">We had to go to the kitchens to pick up our -- I think, midday soup meal.</span> <span id="s262">In other words, we were given soup and probably bread.</span> <span id="s263">I don't remember anything more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: What did you do during the first few weeks?</span> <span id="s265">What did you do?</span> <span id="s266">Were you strong enough to go out?</span> <span id="s267">Could you leave the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I don't remember leaving the camp.</span> <span id="s269">I think what we did in the beginning, we were trying to -- I have all kinds of memories.</span> <span id="s270">Well, the first thing that we tried to do is to find out who was alive.</span> <span id="s271">I remember going to the -- there was already probably something, a community center formed.</span> <span id="s272">In fact, there was one.</span> <span id="s273">In fact, if you ever heard about Hadassah, Gross Rosen, her husband, she by that time was not married to him.</span> <span id="s274">She comes from my city.</span> <span id="s275">Her name was Hadassah Binka (ph), I think it was.</span> <span id="s276">She was a dentist.</span> <span id="s277">She survived, she was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s278">I think her husband-to-be, much older than I.</span> <span id="s279">If not much older, certainly he was an adult before the war.</span> <span id="s280">So there must have been Jewish who formed some kind of a community, and maybe they were the ones who worked with ONR to start bringing things.</span> <span id="s281">So I remember going there probably, and trying to get lists of people who survived.</span> <span id="s282">My girlfriend, Esther, started volunteering in a hospital.</span> <span id="s283">I probably took care of things in the room.</span> <span id="s284">Maybe I was the one.</span> <span id="s285">Because everybody was doing something.</span> <span id="s286">I was probably the one who would go and get the food.</span> <span id="s287">I was probably still weaker than the other girls there because I had come out of the hospitals, and they were not -- they came directly from the camp.</span> <span id="s288">There were some, I have a memory of sitting on the grass.</span> <span id="s289">So I think that behind the barracks, there may have been some lawns.</span> <span id="s290">We probably would sit around and talk.</span> <span id="s291">We probably talked a lot about what happened to us and about our family and whether we're going to find anybody.</span> <span id="s292">That was in the beginning, I had a very difficult then with my girlfriend, Esther.</span> <span id="s293">I found Frieda, remember I told the story what happened.</span> <span id="s294">She was already at that point sharing a room with some other people with whom she was, so we never -- we did not get back together that way, because I had found Esther.</span> <span id="s295">But our relationship was great, that was the problem.</span> <span id="s296">I was -- my girlfriend, Esther, was very hopeful that her boyfriend survived.</span> <span id="s297">She came from Lódz, and she was in Auschwitz, she was an only child.</span> <span id="s298">But she went to Auschwitz with her parents.</span> <span id="s299">She was separated from her parents, but managed to go through Auschwitz with her boyfriend's mother and sister.</span> <span id="s300">They went to Auschwitz together, they ended up at some, I don't know what camp.</span> <span id="s301">I think they were in Mauthausen, but I don't remember, and they ended up in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s302">And my girlfriend, Esther, who as I told you was about five years older than I, that she mothered me because, you know, I was -- in 1945, I was born in 1946, so I was 19 right after the way, not quite 20.</span> <span id="s303">So my -- no, I wasn't even -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s304">I was born in 1946, I was not even 19; I was 18, going on 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Let me turn the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: This an interview with Bella Tovey.</span> <span id="s308">This is Tape 1, Side 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: So what happened to her that she was in Auschwitz, talking about my girlfriend, Esther.</span> <span id="s310">With her boyfriend's mother, and she was practically engaged to be married to this guy.</span> <span id="s311">Having been five years older than I, she was -- I know that she graduated from Gymnasium before the war.</span> <span id="s312">She was born in 1921, yeah, so she was about five years older.</span> <span id="s313">Anyway, she buried that future mother-in-law and her boyfriend's sister in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s314">In other words, they didn't survive, but she had hoped that her boyfriend survived.</span> <span id="s315">She had heard from somebody that he was in a camp with his brother.</span> <span id="s316">And then, must have been about a month after the liberation, maybe a little longer, but I remember that we were together in this room with the other girls.</span> <span id="s317">And somebody came with the news, must have been a friend of her husband -- of her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s318">In fact, it was a friend, I remember, who was his friend and told her that -- his name was Manik (ph), I don't what, the Polish name was Manik, whatever.</span> <span id="s319">That he was killed a day -- he died or something happened a day after liberation.</span> <span id="s320">Just a day after liberation.</span> <span id="s321">And my girlfriend, Esther, went into what I now know, into a deep depression.</span> <span id="s322">She refused to get out of bed, she stayed in the bunk.</span> <span id="s323">And I was very concerned for her.</span> <span id="s324">And I do remember that I would sit and I would sing to her for hours.</span> <span id="s325">The other girls, we all tried to take care of her, but I was the closest to her.</span> <span id="s326">And I would sit there for hours, and I would sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: What would you sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: All kinds of songs.</span> <span id="s329">Polish songs, anything that I remembered.</span> <span id="s330">I came from a bit of singing family.</span> <span id="s331">My mom had a beautiful voice, and we always sang at home.</span> <span id="s332">So I sang whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s333">And I would try to make her eat, and friends came.</span> <span id="s334">In fact, Henry, my husband, who was not my friend then, but he knew Esther because he comes from the same city.</span> <span id="s335">And they were together in the ghetto in the same area.</span> <span id="s336">Anyway, I remember he would come and bring some goodies.</span> <span id="s337">Men always managed to bring some food.</span> <span id="s338">They managed to -- he probably already was getting out of the camp occasionally.</span> <span id="s339">But I don't remember how long it lasted, but I think that what I did then and I talked to her.</span> <span id="s340">And I would have a talk to help, and then -- originally, first, of course, she was talking about her boyfriend and Manik and what friends they had and how much she loved him and all that.</span> <span id="s341">But then I would -- today, I suppose I could say that maybe I acted as a therapist.</span> <span id="s342">But I didn't have any schooling, I just did something instinctively trying to help her.</span> <span id="s343">So I started to ask her to tell me about life before the war, what she did before the war.</span> <span id="s344">What school she went to, who were her friends.</span> <span id="s345">And then she told me that she had a boyfriend before the war, that she had a boyfriend, and they were kind of like childhood sweethearts.</span> <span id="s346">And in 1939 when the war broke out, her boyfriend, whose name was Lolak (ph), and his father -- his father was a professor at the Jewish Gymnasium, and they knew because they were intelligentsia that they're going to be -- they were in anger.</span> <span id="s347">They were told that the best thing for them is to get out.</span> <span id="s348">At that time it wasn't because he was Jewish, this was when the Germans were removing the Polish intelligentsia, and among them, of course, the educated Jews, too.</span> <span id="s349">So Lolak's father, his name was Seka and Lolak decided to run away to Russia.</span> <span id="s350">And they came to Esther, and they wanted her to go with them.</span> <span id="s351">Lolak, her boyfriend, was a year older than Esther, and he graduated from the Jewish Gymnasium in 1938.</span> <span id="s352">He was accepted at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, but he waited for Esther, who was also accepted.</span> <span id="s353">And they were going to go in 1939 to Israel, but they missed it because war broke out.</span> <span id="s354">So they were really serious about each other, and he wanted her to go with him to Russia.</span> <span id="s355">But she was an only child and she couldn't leave her parents, so they parted company and he escaped to Russia with his father.</span> <span id="s356">When she started to talk to me about Lolak, I kept going back to Lolak.</span> <span id="s357">Whenever she would mention her boyfriend, then apparently life took its course.</span> <span id="s358">Lolak was in Russia, she was a very pretty girl.</span> <span id="s359">She met this guy in the ghetto, and they became close and had he survived, I'm sure she would have ended up with him.</span> <span id="s360">But I just wanted to know about all of that, and I made her talk to me about all that.</span> <span id="s361">And I was singing to her, and she was so -- I think that I probably spent probably the rest of that month, May, maybe into, I would say -- I would say that it took about maybe a month to get her back out of bed.</span> <span id="s362">And she did get out of bed, and she went back to work in the hospital where she had started before she decided that life is not worth anything.</span> <span id="s363">And I want to tell you that -- two things: Number one when she came back, when she came back to herself, somebody came and told me that my father is alive and was in Munich.</span> <span id="s364">I had . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: That's your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: My father.</span> <span id="s367">That somebody by the name of Aaron Nakabovich (ph), that's my father's name, is alive, and he should be somewhere in the camp near Munich.</span> <span id="s368">Now, I had not seen him on the list, but somebody said that they saw him on the list.</span> <span id="s369">I did find my sister at that point -- no, I didn't.</span> <span id="s370">I knew my sister had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s371">No, I didn't know anything about my sister, but I put my name on the list.</span> <span id="s372">And when I heard that my father is alive, I decided to go and look for her.</span> <span id="s373">Now, this is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s374">Because what happened is that traveling through Germany at that point was impossible, but people did.</span> <span id="s375">We were looking for people, so the first thing that was necessary was to outfit me for the trip.</span> <span id="s376">And my girlfriend, Esther, who was not a wonderful thief, stole -- I didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s377">I had like cloppers, it was summer.</span> <span id="s378">And I probably had some clothing that the ONR gave me, but where I'm going to go on a trip, I need something a little more decent than that.</span> <span id="s379">A warm jacket maybe.</span> <span id="s380">Evenings in Europe, even in the summer, are cold, colder.</span> <span id="s381">So she stole shoes, two shoes for me.</span> <span id="s382">But they were two left shoes, they were, you know, kind of like, you know, like shoes with lace.</span> <span id="s383">Good walking shoes.</span> <span id="s384">So she stole them, or organized them as we used to call it in the hospital.</span> <span id="s385">Somebody gave me, or maybe I had a pair of slacks.</span> <span id="s386">And then another girl -- the whole room got together and they outfitted me.</span> <span id="s387">So I got a pair of slacks and I got a nice shirt and a shirt to change, and a sweater or a jacket, and even a kerchief.</span> <span id="s388">And Esther was telling me how to, if I need to get off the train or I need to step down or something, since I'm wearing slacks, you can't tell that they are two left shoes.</span> <span id="s389">But if I always step out with my left foot, then nobody will notice that I have two left shoes.</span> <span id="s390">Managed very well with these two left shoes, so I went, but I didn't go.</span> <span id="s391">It had to be arranged.</span> <span id="s392">I didn't go alone.</span> <span id="s393">I went with, actually, Henry and a friend of his, because they had had pneumonia and they were being sent to a sanitorium just to make sure that it doesn't develop into something else.</span> <span id="s394">So they were going to a place called sanitorium near Munich, and I wanted to go to Munich, so I went with them.</span> <span id="s395">And it was an experience, because you couldn't buy tickets.</span> <span id="s396">You had to -- some of Henry's friends literally carried us and threw us into a train that was leaving Hannover.</span> <span id="s397">I don't know how we got to Hannover.</span> <span id="s398">I know how we did.</span> <span id="s399">Henry had a friend who was already working for the British, he spoke English.</span> <span id="s400">So he managed to borrow a Jeep.</span> <span id="s401">So the three of us, with his friend -- his name was Alexander, took us to the train to the nearest city which was called Hannover.</span> <span id="s402">We went from -- and a couple of his friends must have gone along, because I remember being thrown into the train through the window, okay.</span> <span id="s403">And somehow the three of us got on the train, and the train went to the -- stopped at the American zone.</span> <span id="s404">Because, you see, we're in the British zone.</span> <span id="s405">So we had to get through to the American zone, but this was the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s406">The soldiers were very sympathetic to us, they knew who we were.</span> <span id="s407">All we had to do is tell them that we are Jewish, DP, you know, people -- refugees.</span> <span id="s408">And the Americans let us through, we didn't have to -- later on that became much more difficult, but at that point, it was easy.</span> <span id="s409">I do want to tell you this, and this was very important.</span> <span id="s410">The American and the British, I don't know about the Russian soldiers were extremely nice to us in the beginning.</span> <span id="s411">When they shipped the American boys home, and they knew the young -- I don't know -- the young, they knew what Americans, I suppose, wanted to do and maybe the British did the same.</span> <span id="s412">They wanted to send the war-weary soldiers home, so they sent them home.</span> <span id="s413">And then when the new soldiers came in, those who didn't see the concentration camps, those who didn't see what we went through, they started fraternizing with the frauleins, with the German girls and they were much nastier to us.</span> <span id="s414">They were not so understanding, it was much harder.</span> <span id="s415">It was painful, too.</span> <span id="s416">So that's -- but, you know, I remember at that time being very angry about it, but I now understand why a little better.</span> <span id="s417">But anyway, I went through, we went through to the American zone.</span> <span id="s418">I got to Munich, turned out that this was not my father, of course.</span> <span id="s419">But when I came back, oh, I also want to tell you -- I also want to tell you that the train wasn't always -- then one of the trains that we took on that was really funny.</span> <span id="s420">We had -- Germany was devastated.</span> <span id="s421">The cities were bombed out.</span> <span id="s422">The train -- the trip that should have taken maybe, I don't know, 10 hours, we were traveling for a week.</span> <span id="s423">We would stop in places, we would stop in DP camps, some Jewish inmates would take us in.</span> <span id="s424">Then we would go farther.</span> <span id="s425">It was a whole undertaking.</span> <span id="s426">I remember being, for one stretch of the road, we hitched -- we managed to hitch-hike or something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s427">We managed to get on a train that carried oil or gas, because they were those round -- what do they call them?</span> <span id="s428">I suppose, trying to remember.</span> <span id="s429">They looked like a big, round barrel, and you couldn't -- there was no way, and the only thing it had like a little balcony in front for I suppose the conductors.</span> <span id="s430">And I remember Henry and I and his friend, we were sitting on one of those little, it looked like a little balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Was this the tank car?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: It was like a tank, but it was like a round.</span> <span id="s433">And in front on both sides, it had these -- there is a name for it.</span> <span id="s434">It looked like a little balcony, but it wasn't a balcony, with the little railing.</span> <span id="s435">And I suppose you could stand on it, or if you were weary, as we were, we would sit down.</span> <span id="s436">And since it was night, we would hold onto the railing, and since it was night, we would doze off.</span> <span id="s437">Because I remember occasionally, the trains were moving very slowly, but nevertheless, I remember once in a while kind of feeling that I'm sliding down.</span> <span id="s438">I suppose when you're young, you don't worry about it, but it was not always the safest way of traveling but we did it.</span> <span id="s439">And, as I say, I did get to Munich, but by that time I had parted company from them.</span> <span id="s440">And, you know, I don't recall how I got back from Munich, because that was probably an experience; I was alone.</span> <span id="s441">But again, what was helpful is that if I met some Jewish -- I remember getting on a trolley in Munich, and I don't remember how I paid for the trolley.</span> <span id="s442">I think what probably happened is that somebody -- I said something, and somebody said to me, "Am ______ who?"</span> <span id="s443">It means -- it was kind of a Jewish password, which meant are you from my nation, are you from my people?</span> <span id="s444">Because there were a couple of guys who I think paid for me and asked me where I was going.</span> <span id="s445">And I was telling them that I was looking for -- I had an address, but it was already in the evening, so they suggested that they would take me to their house, to wherever they were staying in Munich.</span> <span id="s446">And it's funny, there were two guys; I didn't know them from Adam, and I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s447">Well, I had no choice anyway.</span> <span id="s448">I could have, I suppose -- to stay on the street would have been ridiculous.</span> <span id="s449">They felt that it was too late for me to get to where I was going, so they took me with them.</span> <span id="s450">And I think they had some kind of an apartment, they must have gotten an apartment from a German family.</span> <span id="s451">And they gave me a room, and there was no other -- there were just the two of them.</span> <span id="s452">You know, when I think about it, they could have raped me.</span> <span id="s453">It doesn't matter, they actually they were very nice, they gave breakfast.</span> <span id="s454">And I think they even took me to where I needed to go, and then I found that my father was not alive.</span> <span id="s455">But I found a cousin, a distant cousin.</span> <span id="s456">Who was it?</span> <span id="s457">My mother's cousin, who was younger than my mom.</span> <span id="s458">Anyway, she survived, and she already had a boyfriend or something.</span> <span id="s459">Because I remember she gave me some money, she gave me some clothing.</span> <span id="s460">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s461">And she told me that my sister's alive.</span> <span id="s462">So that was great news, so I somehow managed to get back to Bergen, to the DP camp.</span> <span id="s463">And I'm trying to remember how I got back there, but I don't recall.</span> <span id="s464">I probably took the same, you know, chance with trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Why did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: To Bergen?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Because that was my base.</span> <span id="s469">I had no intentions of not going -- if I had found my father -- I didn't leave for good.</span> <span id="s470">Even if I had found my father, I would have gone back.</span> <span id="s471">I would have gone back to see how Esther is; I had made friends.</span> <span id="s472">And they gave me clothing, not all of it was mine.</span> <span id="s473">Besides, it was my base, but I went back, so I went back.</span> <span id="s474">Also, I knew that if my sister is alive . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did you never think about not going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: From where?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: From Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Munich was also in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And who wanted to be in Munich?</span> <span id="s481">I didn't have anybody in Munich.</span> <span id="s482">There was no reason for me to stay there.</span> <span id="s483">That cousin, maybe she even offered to keep me, I wouldn't have.</span> <span id="s484">I didn't know her that well.</span> <span id="s485">I felt much closer to the people I had in Bergen, so -- but I also knew that if my sister's alive and I was registered on the list, then she would know that I'm in Bergen.</span> <span id="s486">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s487">When I came back to Bergen, it must have been already early July.</span> <span id="s488">My sister was there.</span> <span id="s489">She had come from Poland to Germany.</span> <span id="s490">Now, she was liberated by the Russians, and because she was liberated by the Russians, she was sent -- the Russians sent most of the people who could walk, they sent them back home.</span> <span id="s491">Home, for my sister was Poland, Szydlowiec, the city where I was born, and that's where my sister went.</span> <span id="s492">And she didn't stay there that long because she was alone and she met with some unpleasantness.</span> <span id="s493">Some Polish neighbors were extremely nice to her, and then she walked out into the street and some s.o.b. said to her, "So Hitler left some of you."</span> <span id="s494">And my sister decided this is not for her.</span> <span id="s495">So she went to another -- she found another cousin who, by the way, is my cousin whom I knew much better and stayed with her for a little while.</span> <span id="s496">And when she found out that I am alive, she decided to smuggle herself to Germany.</span> <span id="s497">And she did come with an aunt of mine, who also wanted to come to Germany.</span> <span id="s498">So she, my sister, and my aunt -- this was mother's youngest brother's wife, who had lost two children but survived with her niece.</span> <span id="s499">And she and her niece and my sister, which was a niece on her husband's side, they managed to smuggle themselves through to Germany.</span> <span id="s500">That was a little more difficult because you had to go through the Russian zone, you see.</span> <span id="s501">And but I have a feeling that my aunt who was an adult, she had been married before the war, she had two children, she may have had some money with her already.</span> <span id="s502">And they managed to come to Germany and to Bergen and to the DP camp, and my sister found her way.</span> <span id="s503">She knew where I was, and when I came, she was in that room with, you know -- and, of course, we took her in.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Do you remember coming into the room when she was there the first time?</span> <span id="s505">Do you remember the meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I probably -- you know, it's funny.</span> <span id="s507">I remember that I couldn't recognize her.</span> <span id="s508">She was also very thin.</span> <span id="s509">By that time, some of the girls started to gain weight.</span> <span id="s510">It took me a much longer time to gain weight.</span> <span id="s511">I never got real heavy, but I already looked a little better.</span> <span id="s512">My sister was still very thin, and she was -- she's little.</span> <span id="s513">My sister was only 16, she was a kid.</span> <span id="s514">And -- so I think I was in a state of shock when I saw her.</span> <span id="s515">She looked so vulnerable, you know, so small.</span> <span id="s516">But she's not a vulnerable person, she's very strong.</span> <span id="s517">She's a strong woman.</span> <span id="s518">She was even then strong.</span> <span id="s519">It was wonderful to have my sister.</span> <span id="s520">And then, then we had some rough times because we, you know -- well, first of all, I had to tell her that I thought that my father's alive and he isn't.</span> <span id="s521">So we cried about that, and it was a mixed thing.</span> <span id="s522">It was good to find her, it was probably wonderful for her to find me.</span> <span id="s523">But, you know, until my sister came, I remember we were looking for things, but we were in a kind of a -- it was kind of a never-never land.</span> <span id="s524">I don't know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s525">With my sister's coming, the reality that this is it, the two of us.</span> <span id="s526">And at that point -- and at that, I was lucky, I had a sister.</span> <span id="s527">There were some of us who survived all by themselves.</span> <span id="s528">The reality set in that this is it, that I'll never my mother.</span> <span id="s529">That I'll never see my father.</span> <span id="s530">That I'm never going to see my kid sister or my kid brother.</span> <span id="s531">That was it.</span> <span id="s532">And in that sense, I think that was hard.</span> <span id="s533">We also started to fight, and we fought mostly because of ideas.</span> <span id="s534">She was going to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s535">She came in, she had been -- when she was in Poland until she came, she was involved with a group of young people who were being already -- I don't want to use the word "indoctrinated," but yeah, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: The Zionist group?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What was the name of the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s540">I belonged to a Zionist organization during the war, it was Dror.</span> <span id="s541">It was probably the general Zionists.</span> <span id="s542">I was not opposed to going to Palestine, but I had a fight with her.</span> <span id="s543">The reason was simple.</span> <span id="s544">When she came, she also brought a letter from my uncle here in America.</span> <span id="s545">I had four uncles in America, and after the war they were looking for family.</span> <span id="s546">And when she was in Szydlowiec, she found letters from my uncle written to the Jewish community asking whether anybody by our name from our family is alive.</span> <span id="s547">So she managed to get the letters and the address.</span> <span id="s548">And when she came, she brought all of it so that we could write to our family and tell them who we are and where we are.</span> <span id="s549">So I said to my sister, "Nina" . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Her name's Nina?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Nina, her name's Nina.</span> <span id="s552">Her name actually was Piena, but when she came -- Piena, I don't know how she got the name.</span> <span id="s553">Her name was Sabena, but when she was little she couldn't pronounce her name, and when people asked her what her name is, she probably said, "Piena."</span> <span id="s554">So the name stuck, and we called her Piena.</span> <span id="s555">When she got to Israel, she found out that Piena means corner.</span> <span id="s556">Well, she wasn't going to be called corner, so she changed it to Nina, that's how -- but anyway, my sister and I started to argue, because I felt that we had four uncles in America and we should go to America.</span> <span id="s557">If we don't -- oh, there was another reason, and I do have to be honest about it.</span> <span id="s558">If we were permitted to go to Palestine from the DP camps -- and when I say "we," I don't mean just myself, I mean most of the survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s559">At that time if they had opened the gates to Palestine, I think that 90 percent of us would have gone to Palestine.</span> <span id="s560">There would have been no question about it.</span> <span id="s561">Given what we went through, all of us felt that this is the place to go.</span> <span id="s562">So I didn't have any quarrel with her on that subject, but I was looking at reality and my sister was not.</span> <span id="s563">The British were not letting anybody in, and it didn't take much time for us to find out what was going on in Palestine.</span> <span id="s564">And I didn't want to enter already.</span> <span id="s565">I needed -- you asked me why I wasn't getting out.</span> <span id="s566">Except for the trip that I took, I stayed in Bergen.</span> <span id="s567">I'm beginning to think -- I wasn't interested in getting out of Bergen because I couldn't stand to see German children.</span> <span id="s568">I couldn't stand to see German -- I hated -- I hated the kids because they were not my sister.</span> <span id="s569">I was very -- I knew it was probably a very normal feeling for a lot of us, and I didn't like those feelings.</span> <span id="s570">I didn't want -- I needed to get out of Germany, and I kept saying to my sister, "We have a chance to get out of Germany."</span> <span id="s571">My uncle wrote us immediately that he's already applying.</span> <span id="s572">That as soon as they permit anybody to come to America, we will be the first people to get the papers.</span> <span id="s573">My uncle was very wealthy, and he wrote; he said he has contacts.</span> <span id="s574">He's going to make sure that the Polish corridor was after all open.</span> <span id="s575">He was going to make sure that his nieces -- we were the first ones that he found out that we were alive -- that his two nieces were going to come.</span> <span id="s576">So I knew that we can go to America, and I knew we can get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s577">And I said to my sister, "Look, if things change in Israel," in Palestine, it wasn't Israel, "we'll go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s578">I agree."</span> <span id="s579">I said to her, "You are my younger sister, I'm older.</span> <span id="s580">We're going to do what I say."</span> <span id="s581">This is what I thought I have the right to say.</span> <span id="s582">And she -- well, first we fought because she said to me, "It doesn't matter what you're saying.</span> <span id="s583">I am not going anywhere but Palestine.</span> <span id="s584">Nobody will send me to another crematorium."</span> <span id="s585">She was absolutely convinced that if she goes to any other place but Palestine, the same thing that happened to her parents is going to happen to her.</span> <span id="s586">She's not going anywhere, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Did a lot of people believe that way, or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Oh, she wasn't the only one.</span> <span id="s589">As I said, look, most of us would have gone to Palestine.</span> <span id="s590">Some of that feeling was there.</span> <span id="s591">I didn't come to America with a feeling that this is the best place for me.</span> <span id="s592">I came to America because it was better than being in Germany.</span> <span id="s593">I mean, I wanted to get out of Germany, I would have gone to the moon.</span> <span id="s594">And I definitely would have gone to Palestine if I could, but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s595">So the fights between us -- and that's kind of, it took its toll.</span> <span id="s596">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s597">There was no point fighting her.</span> <span id="s598">I figured she's only -- she's a kid.</span> <span id="s599">I'm going to take care of the two of us, and we'll manage.</span> <span id="s600">Fortunately for me, my girlfriend, Esther, went to Poland to see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s601">She took a trip, she brought some pictures back.</span> <span id="s602">Talking about my girlfriend, Esther.</span> <span id="s603">She came back and she decided she needs to -- gee, I didn't know I had that much to tell you.</span> <span id="s604">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s605">She decided that she knew that she probably could go, get to Palestine legally, because she was accepted at the University before the war and she had family in Palestine.</span> <span id="s606">But she also knew that it would probably be better to be in the American zone.</span> <span id="s607">So she managed -- and also, things were easier in the American zone.</span> <span id="s608">The Bergen camp was not an easy camp.</span> <span id="s609">When winter set in, we were cold.</span> <span id="s610">We were not so very well taken care of, I found out later.</span> <span id="s611">So she managed to get over to Szczecin near Frankfurt, which was close to a DP camp and sent for me.</span> <span id="s612">Well, I wanted to take my sister.</span> <span id="s613">There was no talking to my sister.</span> <span id="s614">My sister by that time had joined a Zionist organization in Bergen.</span> <span id="s615">She was going to school, she was learning Hebrew.</span> <span id="s616">But I decided okay, so I said to her, "Look, I'm going to go see what I can do."</span> <span id="s617">So I went over to Szczecin, it must have been about November of 1945.</span> <span id="s618">Don't ask me what I did in between there and Bergen; I honestly don't remember, honest.</span> <span id="s619">But I did go to -- as I said, I went Szczecin.</span> <span id="s620">In fact, Henry came to get me.</span> <span id="s621">Again, he was just a friend.</span> <span id="s622">He was a very good friend of Esther and he had at that point enrolled at the University.</span> <span id="s623">He was already in Szczecin, he was studying medicine at the University of Frankfurt, and Esther asked him to come and get me.</span> <span id="s624">And so he came and got me and I went to Szczecin.</span> <span id="s625">When I came Szczecin, Esther already had a room that rented with a German family, and it was moved in.</span> <span id="s626">And I found work, I started working through Henry who had a girlfriend whose sister worked in the Hias.</span> <span id="s627">My husband had a lot of girlfriends after the war, but that's okay.</span> <span id="s628">And then -- so I started working the Hias.</span> <span id="s629">Well, you know what the Hias is, and when I went to work to the Hias, there was -- again, you see, I was very, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s630">What's the word?</span> <span id="s631">There was one thing on my mind.</span> <span id="s632">I wanted to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s633">I was just concentrating on one thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Very focused.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Very focused.</span> <span id="s636">I certainly was.</span> <span id="s637">So I was working the Hias, and hoping that this will help me.</span> <span id="s638">And, indeed, the first papers that came to the office of Hias were for me and my sister from my uncle who later I found out, as I said, he was a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s639">And he probably was able to get his congressman to send through the papers.</span> <span id="s640">Whatever it is, my papers came in first.</span> <span id="s641">And then, of course, other papers came.</span> <span id="s642">So I knew that I'm going to go to America.</span> <span id="s643">Now, what do about my sister?</span> <span id="s644">In the meantime, I was going back and forth to Bergen.</span> <span id="s645">First of all, when I came to Szczecin, I registered myself and I registered my sister, as if she -- because she had to live in the American zone to go to American.</span> <span id="s646">So she was registered, the papers were written, she was in Bergen.</span> <span id="s647">I brought her once or twice to visit me when I went there, but God helped us, we were called to the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s648">And first, I think to the doctor for examination, so I brought my sister.</span> <span id="s649">I don't remember how, somebody brought her; she came.</span> <span id="s650">She went with me to the doctor, she went with me to the Consulate.</span> <span id="s651">And we were issued probably already the permission, the papers to come to America, and we were supposed to wait for tickets because at that point nothing was yet leaving Germany for America.</span> <span id="s652">This must have been March.</span> <span id="s653">Now, my sister went back, and she said that she needs to take care of things.</span> <span id="s654">And we were waiting to hear, and I think that I got -- when I -- I don't remember exactly how I heard . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s655">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: This is Tape 2, Side 1 interview with Bella Tovey.</span> <span id="s658">I'm Nina Ellis.</span> <span id="s659">It's June 10th, 1996.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: On one of those trips back to Bergen when I was trying to get my sister to either come or go, I found a letter written to Esther from Lolak, her first boyfriend.</span> <span id="s661">And I remember I ran like -- I don't remember, but I made it back to Szczecin within a short time, and I brought her that letter.</span> <span id="s662">He was alive.</span> <span id="s663">He had survived in Russia with his father, and I was the one who brought her that letter.</span> <span id="s664">That must have been sometime early in 1946, maybe February, one of those before.</span> <span id="s665">And then I remember, of course, that I kept saying to Esther, "I have to wait till Lolak comes.</span> <span id="s666">I have to meet him."</span> <span id="s667">I never did then, because what happened is that we were issued tickets, and the first ship, I think, came to this country in April or later April.</span> <span id="s668">And our ship was supposed to leave Bremerhaven, that's the port of Bremen, I think on the 10th of May.</span> <span id="s669">Because I came to America on the 24th of May 1946 on the second ship.</span> <span id="s670">In between, my sister while I was running back and forth said to me, "Bella, I'm not going to America.</span> <span id="s671">We are leaving in two days."</span> <span id="s672">That must have been April, still late April, and I already knew that she's supposed to come with me, too.</span> <span id="s673">"I'm leaving tonight or tomorrow with Aleah Allah (ph) to Palestine."</span> <span id="s674">She was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s675">The bill that Truman worked on to commit the children to go to Palestine was apparently the British agreed.</span> <span id="s676">If you remember history, the British did permit children to be taken to Palestine, and my sister was one of those who was permitted to go because she was not yet 18; she was 16.</span> <span id="s677">So we parted company.</span> <span id="s678">Of course, I didn't realize that we parted company for such a long time.</span> <span id="s679">As far as I was concerned, I was going to America, and then I was going to take a walk through Palestine one of these days, you know, when things straighten out.</span> <span id="s680">And I came back and I couldn't wait for Lolak to come from Russia either because the ship wasn't waiting for me.</span> <span id="s681">And I remember that -- I do remember how this was organized.</span> <span id="s682">The Americans took us to a special place, it must have been some kind of a school that was turned into some dormitories.</span> <span id="s683">We had to report a good week before the ship left from Bremen.</span> <span id="s684">They took us, we spent there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s685">After that, they put us on trains, and those trains took us -- when I say "us," I'm talking about -- I think I have pictures from those trains.</span> <span id="s686">They took us by train, all of those people who were going to take that ship to Bremen.</span> <span id="s687">In Bremen we were again put up in some kind of a barrack or something for about a day or so.</span> <span id="s688">Then we were put on the ship.</span> <span id="s689">These ships were -- I think that what they did for us, they transported us the way they were transporting soldiers back home, because that was the only way.</span> <span id="s690">This was only '46, and we were put on a ship.</span> <span id="s691">Then the ship was Marine -- the first one, I think was Marine Perch and I came on Marine Fletcher, or the other way around.</span> <span id="s692">These were the two ships that were going back and forth bringing some of the first refugees to America.</span> <span id="s693">And we were on the ocean for 14 days, 14 miserable days because I was very seasick, and then we came to America.</span> <span id="s694">And Henry came on the same ship with me, had nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s695">He, too, wanted to get out of Germany even though he was in medical school.</span> <span id="s696">And he was able to get to America without the help of anybody through what was called the corporate affidavit.</span> <span id="s697">What happened is that the Joint was trying to bring some refugees to America, and since they were trying to fill the quota, they knew that the quota isn't going to be filled, we'll be lost and not everybody had sponsors.</span> <span id="s698">So what the Joint was doing, they were getting out corporate affidavits.</span> <span id="s699">What it means apparently that companies, some companies got together and they sponsored.</span> <span id="s700">So Henry was not sponsored by a family member, but he was sponsored by Joint.</span> <span id="s701">And he came to this country, and we were -- since he was a friend of mine, we kept together on that ship.</span> <span id="s702">And we did not, as I said, this was not at that point, there was nothing between us yet.</span> <span id="s703">But I think it did bring us together, and then in America in the beginning when we were here.</span> <span id="s704">Totally two lost souls.</span> <span id="s705">Not knowing any English.</span> <span id="s706">You know, just feeling very lost.</span> <span id="s707">I didn't get the best reception in my family, although, again, in retrospect probably there were many things I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s708">But . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Tell me about coming -- you arrived in New York?</span> <span id="s710">Tell me about, do you remember, Bella, was that an important moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Well, I remember -- I do remember something.</span> <span id="s712">I remember the day when the ship came to the -- when it came close to the port of New York.</span> <span id="s713">I remember standing on the -- by that time I was feeling better.</span> <span id="s714">I think the sea must have gotten calmer, and I was already not -- because I was sick.</span> <span id="s715">I was a mess.</span> <span id="s716">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s717">I remember a difficult passage, but the last couple days things were easier.</span> <span id="s718">And I remember looking at the lights of New York.</span> <span id="s719">You have to understand we came Germany.</span> <span id="s720">Germany was dark, it was devastated.</span> <span id="s721">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s722">Suddenly I thought I am coming to an absolute paradise.</span> <span id="s723">And I also remember because I must have seen from a distance the roads and cars.</span> <span id="s724">Cars going, they looked like little match boxes because it was far away, but so many of them.</span> <span id="s725">And I remember we were so overwhelmed, it was a beautiful and scary sight.</span> <span id="s726">It was absolutely beautiful, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s727">I'll never forget that first impression of New York from the ship.</span> <span id="s728">And then it was Friday I remember when we arrived, so my four uncles were waiting.</span> <span id="s729">Some, probably other members of the family.</span> <span id="s730">Mostly also a little curiosity, you know.</span> <span id="s731">But it looked like, you know, we were the first or the second group to arrive from concentration camps, so there was a little bit of that.</span> <span id="s732">And I do remember saying good-bye to Henry.</span> <span id="s733">I don't -- I suppose Henry was taken by the Hias, because he didn't have anybody to, you know, nobody was waiting for him.</span> <span id="s734">But my uncle arranged with his son, who he was married.</span> <span id="s735">I think he had, his wife was pregnant.</span> <span id="s736">It was a young couple, so they took me to their house in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s737">They were very religious.</span> <span id="s738">Somehow he thought that because I'm coming from Europe that I'm very religious, so they took me.</span> <span id="s739">But they felt that I'm observant, so they took me for Shabbat to their house.</span> <span id="s740">And I have to say that my cousin's wife was -- my cousin and his wife were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s741">Particularly she, Miriam, I didn't have much language with her.</span> <span id="s742">She didn't speak Polish; she didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s743">I don't speak Yiddish, I could understand some.</span> <span id="s744">So were probably communicating.</span> <span id="s745">She was speaking in Yiddish, I was answering her in German.</span> <span id="s746">And I spent that Saturday, that Shabbat, with them.</span> <span id="s747">And then on Sunday, I don't remember what I did on Sunday.</span> <span id="s748">She may have gone with me shopping or something.</span> <span id="s749">I probably called Henry in Hias, although I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s750">And I do remember that on Monday, I was taken by my cousin who worked in my uncle's factory to the factory.</span> <span id="s751">My uncle owned a jewelry factory -- not a jewelry factory, it was making bracelets for watches.</span> <span id="s752">The name of the firm was Jacobi &amp; Bender.</span> <span id="s753">It was a very, very big factory at that point.</span> <span id="s754">My uncle, as I told you, was a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s755">He employed a couple of hundred people, probably.</span> <span id="s756">So anyway, I was brought into his office, and I had a problem with my uncle anyway.</span> <span id="s757">When I first saw him, I don't remember that impression when I first saw when I got off that ship.</span> <span id="s758">I think I was probably overwhelmed, but when I walked into his office I went into a state of shock.</span> <span id="s759">He looked like my father, it was my father's brother.</span> <span id="s760">My father had five brothers.</span> <span id="s761">He looked most like my uncle -- I mean, this uncle looked most like my father.</span> <span id="s762">And here was this man who was this big, rich uncle who I didn't have any language with.</span> <span id="s763">I couldn't talk to him, my benefactor, if you will.</span> <span id="s764">He brought me to this country, and he looks like my father but it's not my father.</span> <span id="s765">So I think it had an effect on me, it was hard really.</span> <span id="s766">He -- I don't remember exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s767">Things were going on probably, but he sent me with a cousin of his who was a refugee from Germany.</span> <span id="s768">He had brought -- we had some family in Germany apparently, and my uncle did bring -- you know, he was a good man, but he was insensitive.</span> <span id="s769">And I don't think he meant -- he meant to be a good person to me, but he just didn't do the right thing, perhaps not knowing how to do the right thing.</span> <span id="s770">But, as I said, he brought his family from Germany, some of his cousins, you know, before the war.</span> <span id="s771">And one of them, her name was Dora, had already was working already in the factory for him.</span> <span id="s772">She was working in the office, and she spoke German.</span> <span id="s773">So I had a common language with her, and he sent her with me shopping.</span> <span id="s774">Because I didn't have clothing, I had -- I really didn't look very presentable.</span> <span id="s775">So she went with me to the stores, I remember, in New York.</span> <span id="s776">And he probably gave her a carte blanche or whatever and she bought me clothing.</span> <span id="s777">But she was afraid of him, too, I suppose, so she was very careful.</span> <span id="s778">And I can understand, so she bought me three pairs of panties and two bras.</span> <span id="s779">In other words, she was very -- she wanted to make sure that I had enough for a beginning.</span> <span id="s780">And after that, that evening, my other uncle -- I had, as I told you, four uncles.</span> <span id="s781">My other uncle who was his -- who was Uncle Max's, the rich uncle's -- he was the one who was contracted.</span> <span id="s782">He was the one who was taking care of things.</span> <span id="s783">He was a very religious Jew.</span> <span id="s784">He was the one whose son's house I went to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s785">So it was that uncle who lived at that point in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s786">He had lost his family in Germany, but he had two sons.</span> <span id="s787">Not Germany, during the war in Poland, but he had two sons that he managed to bring to America before the war.</span> <span id="s788">So lived in the Bronx, that religious uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: His name was Uncle Favish (ph), and Uncle Favish was a very religious, ultra-Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s791">And he rented a room for me in the Bronx somewhere not far from where he was with some person.</span> <span id="s792">And I think he was stingy, and perhaps he didn't want to exploit his brother again.</span> <span id="s793">But he was not -- again, there are all kinds of members in the family.</span> <span id="s794">He rented a room for me for $35, and he paid this woman.</span> <span id="s795">Her name was Mrs. Fox, he gave her $15 and said to her -- maybe he gave her $20.</span> <span id="s796">But I remember that I had -- no, I think he gave her $15.</span> <span id="s797">And he said that when I come, I'll pay the rest.</span> <span id="s798">In other words, he didn't have brains to pay for one month's rent for me.</span> <span id="s799">I don't know where he thought I was going to get the $20 from, but that's what he told her.</span> <span id="s800">So I come into this room, I get this furnished.</span> <span id="s801">And, by the way, it was very difficult to get rooms in New York after the war.</span> <span id="s802">So, you know, the fact that he found me a room was a nice thing.</span> <span id="s803">I move into this -- I get into this room, this is Monday evening, and I'm supposed to come to work Tuesday morning to my uncle's factory.</span> <span id="s804">So I come in, and Mrs. Fox takes me -- the first thing she does for me is she takes me to the bathroom to show me how to flush a toilet.</span> <span id="s805">And I started to cry, because I knew how to flush a toilet.</span> <span id="s806">I didn't come from -- when I started to cry and I said to her, she spoke German.</span> <span id="s807">And I said to her, "Why are you showing me how to" -- She said to me that when she came to America, she didn't know how to flush a toilet.</span> <span id="s808">So I said, "Well, you know" -- she came from Hungary somewhere or something.</span> <span id="s809">I said, "Well, you know, there may have been places in Poland where they didn't have toilets in your time, and maybe even in my time.</span> <span id="s810">But, you know, also didn't stand still in these 30, 40 years that you've been here."</span> <span id="s811">And I -- we had a bathroom in our house, and we even had a toilet and it flushed water.</span> <span id="s812">But anyway, so that was my beginning.</span> <span id="s813">She also didn't let me use the Frigidaire, because that was not in the agreement, which meant that I had to eat out.</span> <span id="s814">So I had a rough beginning, if you will.</span> <span id="s815">You know, if you can understand it.</span> <span id="s816">Funny thing is it wasn't, I'm sure, it wasn't meant that way.</span> <span id="s817">I had -- I started working, and I, you know, I got my first check and I made my arrangements.</span> <span id="s818">I had my rough couple of months in the beginning.</span> <span id="s819">Actually, I have to say that my wealthy uncle took me to his house finally.</span> <span id="s820">On July 4th, the factory closed for one week.</span> <span id="s821">And he had told me before that he is going to take me to his house for a week so I can meet his wife and his daughter and spend a week in his house on Long Island.</span> <span id="s822">He lived in Lawrence, Long Island.</span> <span id="s823">So I went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: You hadn't been to his house before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s826">This was the first time I was invited to his house to spend a week.</span> <span id="s827">And I went to his house.</span> <span id="s828">Oh, I want to tell you something else that happened to me which very interesting.</span> <span id="s829">I was very upset in the beginning because I couldn't manage my money.</span> <span id="s830">Later on, when I could admit to Henry that my family was not treating me the best way, Henry would -- he managed much better having come to strangers.</span> <span id="s831">But sometimes this works out.</span> <span id="s832">So anyway, but at one point when I was sitting and eating my lunch, and my lunch consisted for the first couple of weeks until I could get myself -- because I was making $18 a week after taxes.</span> <span id="s833">And I had to pay $35 for rent and the first $20, I had, too.</span> <span id="s834">So I was having trouble managing, and I ate my main dinner in the automat.</span> <span id="s835">But for lunch, I couldn't afford to go out, and I couldn't keep anything in the fridge.</span> <span id="s836">So I bought a loaf of bread in wax paper, and I would take two pieces of bread and I would wrap it in the wax paper.</span> <span id="s837">And when people sat down to have lunch at work, I would take my two pieces and I would eat my two pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s838">And I was feeling sorry for myself, to be very honest.</span> <span id="s839">I wrote to my girlfriend, Esther, that I wished that I were back in Szczecin.</span> <span id="s840">So one day, Dora came over, and I was sitting and I was probably feeling sorry for myself so I looked say.</span> <span id="s841">Or maybe I was crying, and she said, "_________?"</span> <span id="s842">"Why are you crying?"</span> <span id="s843">So I couldn't take it anymore, so I opened the two pieces of bread to show her that I'm eating -- you know, after all I went through, I'm also telling you that in 1946, I wasn't quite 20, so I wasn't that grown up.</span> <span id="s844">So I was feeling sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s845">I think that if I had been more adult, I would have managed my uncle better, too.</span> <span id="s846">You know, I could, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s847">So I opened those two pieces of bread, and I said, "_____________."</span> <span id="s848">"That's why I'm crying."</span> <span id="s849">And so she got very upset.</span> <span id="s850">You know, I was telling her that I was eating two pieces of dry bread.</span> <span id="s851">You know, this is my lunch.</span> <span id="s852">So she got a hold of me and dragged to my uncle's office.</span> <span id="s853">And then she started to talking -- I didn't know what the hell she was saying.</span> <span id="s854">And he looked at her, looked at me.</span> <span id="s855">And he pulled out $50 from his pocket, and he told her to tell me that -- oh, the first thing she said to him, because I had asked her, that they are not paying me enough.</span> <span id="s856">That if they paid me a little more, she would -- you know, I could manage.</span> <span id="s857">So he said, and I understood that, because my English was -- I was beginning to understand.</span> <span id="s858">This is what they pay here, meaning -- now, maybe this was policy that he wasn't telling anybody what to pay me.</span> <span id="s859">I was working in the wrapping department, and that was what they were paying.</span> <span id="s860">By the way, I was working on accord, this was piecework.</span> <span id="s861">And eventually, I was able to make more money because I quick.</span> <span id="s862">But at that point, I was still having trouble, so he gave me the $50.</span> <span id="s863">So he said to her, but he can give me $50.</span> <span id="s864">And he said to me to her, through her that if I need more money, I should come him.</span> <span id="s865">Now, you see, this is where he was not sensitive.</span> <span id="s866">I never went back to him for another $50 or for another $10.</span> <span id="s867">What he should have done -- see, when he died in 1966, I came to this country in '46.</span> <span id="s868">So that's 20 years later.</span> <span id="s869">When he died, he left me $20,000 in his will.</span> <span id="s870">I mean, I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s871">He left for all the survivors, for all the children who survived, because I and my sister and then later on he found a couple of nephews.</span> <span id="s872">There were a couple of people who survived from my family.</span> <span id="s873">All of those, there were about eight of us -- all of us were given some money.</span> <span id="s874">You know, he left them in the will.</span> <span id="s875">He was a very wealthy man, but, you know, this not even a Jewish -- Jews usually leave their estates to their family.</span> <span id="s876">But he did have in his will, he left for all of the children who survived, for all those, some money.</span> <span id="s877">And he left me -- now, if he had given me in 1946 $1,000 and send me to school to teach me how to type.</span> <span id="s878">I did go to, of course, evening classes, and I started to learn English, and I was reading.</span> <span id="s879">So, you know, but if he had given me a kind of a help in the beginning, it would have been worth more than the $20,000 in 1966.</span> <span id="s880">It was nice to get the $20,000, and he was working and earning good money.</span> <span id="s881">And it was -- I think it was -- I want to tell you something nice about his wife.</span> <span id="s882">His wife, when my uncle took me to his home in Lawrence, Long Island, I took my little valise with my belongings and my aunt waited for me.</span> <span id="s883">She may have met me before, she may have come to the factory.</span> <span id="s884">But I didn't -- I was never in their house.</span> <span id="s885">I had a room, and they welcomed me very nicely, and she came in and she asked did I need anything.</span> <span id="s886">And I said, "No," and she wanted to see what I have.</span> <span id="s887">She looked through my clothing, and she said, "Tomorrow we're going to go shopping."</span> <span id="s888">And she did not take me to Klines on 14th Street or whatever.</span> <span id="s889">She took me the same stores where she shopped; she was a lady.</span> <span id="s890">She shopped in Saks Fifth Avenue or wherever.</span> <span id="s891">She took me those stores, and she bought me some very beautiful things.</span> <span id="s892">She bought me shoes that I wore for years, and clothing.</span> <span id="s893">That I remember, she was, you know -- so that was my beginning in America in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Did you start to socialize and have friends and meet other people fairly quickly, or did it take a while?</span> <span id="s895">You knew Henry, and did you keep in touch with him and -- how did you sort of . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: . . . get beyond just working in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Mostly it was I stayed -- in the beginning, I didn't make friends, although I am a sociable person.</span> <span id="s899">But mostly I saw Henry.</span> <span id="s900">Henry and I started getting closer, and we became a kind of a twosome.</span> <span id="s901">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s902">Henry's very good friend survived the war and came to America.</span> <span id="s903">He worked in Philadelphia, but he would come for weekends.</span> <span id="s904">So often the three of us would go to the zoo.</span> <span id="s905">We would go to museums.</span> <span id="s906">I remember Henry took me to Radio City the first time, dropped me off there.</span> <span id="s907">It was a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s908">I worked, I started to -- I found out that my sister was turned back.</span> <span id="s909">They attached an illegal transport to the legal transports, and my sister was sent back from Marseilles.</span> <span id="s910">When I came to America, my sister was supposed to be in Palestine.</span> <span id="s911">It turned out that she was back in Bergen because they had turned back the whole transport because, you know, the Haganah was -- well, they needed to do it.</span> <span id="s912">They were attaching some illegals to the legal transports.</span> <span id="s913">And so, but then about a half a year later my sister ended up in Palestine.</span> <span id="s914">And I remember I started sending her packages because things were rough in Palestine.</span> <span id="s915">Did I make friends?</span> <span id="s916">Yeah, I think what happened is that I started to make friends with people who survived the camps.</span> <span id="s917">The same probably -- as a matter of fact, the first years in New York, most of my friends, and, in fact, many of them I just met somebody who reminded me -- I found them work.</span> <span id="s918">Many of them ended up working in my uncle's factory, because they came in and they needed work.</span> <span id="s919">So I would, you know, ask whether there is a need for somebody, and they would come to work.</span> <span id="s920">So I became friendly with one girl whom I brought in and we sat across from each other and we spent time talking while we were working.</span> <span id="s921">And she was a concentration camp survivor, she was already married.</span> <span id="s922">Some other friends came from Germany.</span> <span id="s923">In the beginning, I'm just trying to remember, Henry and I did not get married till 1949.</span> <span id="s924">And I lived in the Bronx and Henry lived in Brooklyn, and that was a little difficult.</span> <span id="s925">So I finally moved to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s926">I didn't like the lady I lived with, so it was not a pleasant situation.</span> <span id="s927">It was not bad, but I didn't -- so I moved into a much nicer place, where the lady permitted me to use the fridge.</span> <span id="s928">I could make myself a cup of coffee, a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s929">And eventually, I moved in where Henry stayed.</span> <span id="s930">Henry found a wonderful family, American Jews who came in, their daughter got married.</span> <span id="s931">They had a room.</span> <span id="s932">I understand Mr. and Mrs. Rhinehart (ph) was wonderful to Henry.</span> <span id="s933">They took him in like a son.</span> <span id="s934">And then when Henry and I got kind of engaged and when we were going to get married, I moved in.</span> <span id="s935">And after we were married, we stayed with the Rhineharts for several years, and then we managed to get an apartment in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s936">So we moved into this apartment, and at that point, as I said, I was working.</span> <span id="s937">And Henry, he had started going to Brooklyn College in '48 just before we were married.</span> <span id="s938">And he was going to school, he was riding a bike every day, so that he could save some money on transportation.</span> <span id="s939">But these were good years, and, as I said, he was probably older than many of the students at that point, except for some soldiers who had come back.</span> <span id="s940">You know, they were veterans, GIs who were going to school.</span> <span id="s941">So I think Henry befriended a few -- I think Henry may have had two friends who were American.</span> <span id="s942">It started because they studying together, but my friends at that point, most of them were people who survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s943">I think it was probably still very important to be -- we spoke Polish with each other.</span> <span id="s944">That was not so good for my English, although, as I said, I did become friendly with some people at work.</span> <span id="s945">The first person who really befriended me, interestingly enough, was an Irish lady.</span> <span id="s946">She was much older than I, her name was Sarah.</span> <span id="s947">I don't remember her -- who said that I reminded her of her when she came to this country.</span> <span id="s948">I was freckled, I probably could have passed for Irish at that point.</span> <span id="s949">I had kind of reddish hair.</span> <span id="s950">And she remembered herself, more or less that way, so she was very friendly to me.</span> <span id="s951">And then there were a couple of Italian girls, I do remember as a result of becoming friendly with Toni and Annette -- that was their name, because we had lunch together.</span> <span id="s952">That I would come home and show off my English to Henry, and Henry was much more meticulous about his -- about everything.</span> <span id="s953">He was much more of a perfectionist.</span> <span id="s954">I was picking things up, and I would say -- this was even before we were married.</span> <span id="s955">And I would say to him that I am going to -- maybe we should go and see a picture.</span> <span id="s956">And Henry didn't understand why I wanted to see a picture, because that was picture, a movie.</span> <span id="s957">Or if I wanted to make myself a sandwich.</span> <span id="s958">But I was picking up the English that was spoken in the factory by some of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Some of the people then that you were mixing with were, a lot of them also immigrants, sound like.</span> <span id="s960">This Irish woman . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: This Irish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: . . . and some Italian girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: The Italian girls were born in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Oh, they were born here?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: But they were Italians, and they lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s966">And if you've ever been around there, I don't know how it is now, let me tell you they do sound a little different, I suppose.</span> <span id="s967">Then after we were married -- but, as I said, these were just acquaintances.</span> <span id="s968">Most, I agree with you that most of my friends in the beginning, it was language, common experiences I'm sure had a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s969">All of my friends in New York before I came to Washington were survivors.</span> <span id="s970">It isn't just that they were Polish, they were survivors.</span> <span id="s971">We may have met some people here and there.</span> <span id="s972">I remember we met a very lovely German lady who was much older than we were.</span> <span id="s973">She befriended us, and took our horror, I remember later.</span> <span id="s974">She was a -- she had come to American shortly before the war.</span> <span id="s975">I remember that she had a son in Long Island who was a physician, and I don't remember where I got -- we got terribly upset when she told us that she couldn't have us meet -- she wanted us to meet her son, but she couldn't have him invite us to his house, because when he came to this country, he had converted, and he didn't want to admit that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s976">And so he didn't want -- she didn't -- now, she didn't.</span> <span id="s977">She remained Jewish, but it was -- and I remember to me this was so upsetting.</span> <span id="s978">On one hand, I understood why, because I was contemplating doing something like this shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s979">I was thinking of going back to Poland, and I was thinking that if I go back to Poland I'm not going to admit that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s980">Or I was thinking I would go somewhere, because why go through that again?</span> <span id="s981">But I couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Go through what again?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Go through what I went through.</span> <span id="s984">It never left me, the possibility that someplace somebody -- I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s985">Whenever something happens in Israel, I get into a Holocaust mode.</span> <span id="s986">The best place for me to be when something is going on in Israel is actually Israel, because there I see that the ship isn't sinking.</span> <span id="s987">But when I'm away, I always think that if something happens in Israel, I always think that it's another Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: And when there's a bombing or something . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Anything.</span> <span id="s990">So in that sense, but then when I actually met somebody who did it, I remember I was so terribly shocked that he did that.</span> <span id="s991">But I remember that she . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: This is Tape 2, Side 2 with Bella Tovey.</span> <span id="s993">Can you say at the end what you -- I'm afraid that we missed what you said at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Well, about this man who converted.</span> <span id="s995">Well, he -- I mean, one part of me understood him because I remember people saying maybe he didn't want his children to go through what he went through.</span> <span id="s996">But another part of me found it very upsetting.</span> <span id="s997">Well, it's like well, he handed Hitler a victory, I thought, you know.</span> <span id="s998">There weren't going to be any Jews, you know, insofar as -- so it's a very mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s999">I have a question for you.</span> <span id="s1000">Did any of the people who you interviewed ever talk about the fact that they thought about not being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: A lot of people went through kind of crisis about whether or not they were going to be Jewish, observant, very . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: So I didn't think so.</span> <span id="s1003">Not on your . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Especially in the DP camps, you know.</span> <span id="s1005">People maybe weren't practicing any religion at all.</span> <span id="s1006">It was very difficult for a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Oh, neither was I. I want to tell you that until 1959, well, actually -- yeah, until 1959, I never came near a temple and I was not a practicing Jew at all.</span> <span id="s1008">Didn't light candles, and I had a real detour with God.</span> <span id="s1009">I mean, I got married in 1949.</span> <span id="s1010">Henry and I wanted a civil ceremony, and they only reason I agreed to get married in a rabbi's study is because of my four uncles, you know.</span> <span id="s1011">So we had a religious ceremony, but that was -- I didn't have any dealings with -- but that's different, but I wasn't denying my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1012">I was not religious, I wasn't going to be observant.</span> <span id="s1013">It was my detour with God.</span> <span id="s1014">In other words, that had to -- if I were a Catholic, I would have the same feeling.</span> <span id="s1015">In other words . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: What is the word you're using?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Dean (ph) Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Dean (ph) Torah means dean, a misjudgment; Torah, based on the Torah.</span> <span id="s1020">It's a court based on the Torah.</span> <span id="s1021">In old times when two Jews had a -- in Poland, for instance, when Jews had some of their autonomy, if you will, then often when there was a problem between two people, some kind of a -- they would rather than go to the civil court, they would go to a rabbi and have what you call a dean (ph) Torah in front of the rabbi.</span> <span id="s1022">It's basically a court case.</span> <span id="s1023">Well, I had that kind of a dean (ph), Torah with God, but to deny my Jewishness, you see, was different.</span> <span id="s1024">That I couldn't -- I couldn't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: You got married in 1949, and you stayed in New York because your husband was in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: What happened then to you in the '50s, say, leading up to when you went to visit your sister in 1959?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Okay. '</span> <span id="s1029">52, Henry got a job in Washington.</span> <span id="s1030">He got out of Brooklyn College with a -- he graduated, and he had a bachelor's degree in chemistry.</span> <span id="s1031">And he had a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s1032">He applied -- actually, three experiences.</span> <span id="s1033">First of all, he was -- it was suggested to him that he go on to graduate school.</span> <span id="s1034">He graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, but we couldn't afford it at that point.</span> <span id="s1035">And he just wanted to go work, so he applied to DuPont; they didn't respond.</span> <span id="s1036">Then he applied to Kaiser Pharmaceutical Company, and he got an interview, and to all purposes, go the job.</span> <span id="s1037">And then just as courtesy, he was taken into the office of the Vice President.</span> <span id="s1038">And the Vice President -- this was 1952 -- the Vice President said something to him in German and Henry answered him in German.</span> <span id="s1039">And he said to him, "So you're not an American, where were you during the war?"</span> <span id="s1040">And Henry said, "I was in Germany."</span> <span id="s1041">And "Where were you in Germany?"</span> <span id="s1042">And Henry said, "Courtesy of Hitler, in a concentration camp."</span> <span id="s1043">And that was the end of his job, he didn't get the job at Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1044">That was '52, chemical companies did not employ Jews very readily.</span> <span id="s1045">But he did get a job a month later with Berikson (ph) Research Laboratory, and he was sent by Berikson, who was a Swede educated in America.</span> <span id="s1046">And he employed Henry and gave him a job in Washington, and Henry opened an office in Washington for him where he was going to do some research and literature search.</span> <span id="s1047">And that's how we -- Henry came to Washington, and I was very upset.</span> <span id="s1048">I didn't want to leave New York, I really didn't want to leave New York.</span> <span id="s1049">I had made my friends, it was my place.</span> <span id="s1050">It was very hard for me to move.</span> <span id="s1051">And, as a matter of fact, Henry was commuting between January and May.</span> <span id="s1052">He would come here every week and come home for weekends, come to New York.</span> <span id="s1053">And the commute was difficult because we didn't have the turnpike.</span> <span id="s1054">It was a real trip, but he did and he finally -- but, you know, we had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s1055">He wasn't going to go back to New York, he had a job and a job that was a good job.</span> <span id="s1056">I remember when Henry came home and told me that he's going to be making $75 a week, and I said to Henry in all earnest, seriously, I said, "Henry, what are we going to do with all this money?"</span> <span id="s1057">Because it was a lot of money for us, it was.</span> <span id="s1058">So I came here in April, and the cherry blossoms were out and the city was beautiful, I remember.</span> <span id="s1059">And Henry's boss, Berikson, was here, and he literally wined and dined me.</span> <span id="s1060">And then so I agreed that I had to move, so we moved and I was miserable in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1061">First of all, Washington in 1952 was a very provincial town, and New York was really an exciting city.</span> <span id="s1062">And I didn't have any friends, and I was very lonely.</span> <span id="s1063">I was really lonely, it was really difficult.</span> <span id="s1064">So what we would do often is spend a week here and go to New York for weekends.</span> <span id="s1065">So we were going back and forth.</span> <span id="s1066">But then I met some friends, I made my first American friends.</span> <span id="s1067">I met two neighbors, they were both my age.</span> <span id="s1068">Their husbands were Henry's age, so we were kind of the three couples, the six of us.</span> <span id="s1069">The funny thing is that they were all from outside; they were not Washingtonians.</span> <span id="s1070">One, Shirley, was from Allentown, Pennsylvania and the other was from New York.</span> <span id="s1071">So that made it that was our kind of bond, and we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1072">And we stayed friends till this day, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1073">These were my first friends in Washington, and in 1954, I think, I had my daughter.</span> <span id="s1074">I became, you know, I gave birth to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1075">That was five years after we were married, and then about a year and a half later, I had Craig, we had Craig.</span> <span id="s1076">And we had the townhouse, a little townhouse, a semi-detached home in Silver Spring not far from here.</span> <span id="s1077">And I was doing absolutely one thing, I was saving money to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1078">By that time, of course, my sister was already married.</span> <span id="s1079">She had two children, her husband had already been in the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s1080">And we were in contact all the time, I was forever sending packages.</span> <span id="s1081">Times were rough in Israel, in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1082">I mean in comparison, I was rich.</span> <span id="s1083">But I was saving money to go to Israel, and in 1959 I took my five-year-old daughter and three-and-a-half-year-old son; in March of '59, we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1084">I took a ship, I had to because I was taking an awful lot of stuff with me.</span> <span id="s1085">As I said, things were rough in Israel.</span> <span id="s1086">And I went to Israel, and I spent -- I left my poor husband for all this time.</span> <span id="s1087">He came for a month, actually.</span> <span id="s1088">I'm sorry, he was gone a month.</span> <span id="s1089">He had, at that point, he had started working and had left Berikson.</span> <span id="s1090">He was working for the National Cotton Council, and it was a very good job.</span> <span id="s1091">And he had some trips that he needed to take to Europe, so he came to Israel.</span> <span id="s1092">But I was in Israel from March to September 19- -- I was in Israel for a half a year.</span> <span id="s1093">I saw my girlfriend, Esther, of course, who was by that time married and had a little boy.</span> <span id="s1094">And I was with my sister, she had three children at that point and I fell in love with Israel.</span> <span id="s1095">At that point, I think that's when I started making peace with God a little bit.</span> <span id="s1096">I walked the streets of Es Salt and Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1097">I walked into the first synagogue that was in Jerusalem, and my sister who was not religious would light Shabbat candles.</span> <span id="s1098">She wouldn't say a prayer, she would say, "Shabbat, Shalom."</span> <span id="s1099">And I thought this was a very nice custom for a beginning for me, and I started -- I became very interested.</span> <span id="s1100">I always loved history.</span> <span id="s1101">It's funny, you said you liked it because I always like history, always loved archeology.</span> <span id="s1102">If my life had normally, when I was child I used to tell my father that I'm going to be an archeologist, I didn't do that.</span> <span id="s1103">But when I came back from Israel, I had already been enrolled.</span> <span id="s1104">I was going to night school in Maryland, and I seriously thought of becoming an accountant.</span> <span id="s1105">I thought it would be a good thing to do, I wouldn't have to work maybe full-time, you know, raising kids.</span> <span id="s1106">But I switched, I decided to study Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1107">And I started to really, I started studying Torah.</span> <span id="s1108">I enrolled at Baltimore Hebrew College.</span> <span id="s1109">I took all my courses there in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1110">I got my degree in Hebrew letters, and I became a licensed Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s1111">And while I was going to school, I started teaching Hebrew in different synagogues.</span> <span id="s1112">For a while I taught at Northwood when they had Hebrew as a language.</span> <span id="s1113">And then the last 10 years before I retired, I was supervising the Hebrew Department at Washington Hebrew Congregation, so that was my last -- but studying Hebrew, studying Torah, studying the town, I did it a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s1114">And I also for the first time, I did not before, I didn't talk much about the Holocaust and I didn't read much.</span> <span id="s1115">I started reading a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: I started -- well, it kind of came together.</span> <span id="s1118">I needed to understand, I needed to understand a little bit.</span> <span id="s1119">I couldn't make peace with the Holocaust emotionally myself.</span> <span id="s1120">I don't think anyone -- occasionally, sometimes, you know, if they tell you, you know, that a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist can help.</span> <span id="s1121">These are not problems that a psychiatrist can -- I mean there was nothing that I could work out with a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1122">It isn't that I needed to understand why my mother didn't treat me right or I didn't -- there wasn't anything like that.</span> <span id="s1123">To understand the Holocaust, you can't understand the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1124">In other words, I can't imagine that anybody can be helped by a psychiatrist in terms of the experiences of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1125">Perhaps some people, if they have some guilt relate it to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1126">I'll be very honest with you, I never felt guilty that I survived and some didn't.</span> <span id="s1127">Because I didn't survive, I didn't do anything to anybody to survive.</span> <span id="s1128">I survived by sheer luck.</span> <span id="s1129">Some Holocaust survivors have this guilt, even if they survived the same way as I did.</span> <span id="s1130">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1131">Maybe that kind of a thing can be cleared up or helped through some therapy, just to understand that there's no guilt in having survived.</span> <span id="s1132">On the contrary, if anything, perhaps a little triumph that Hitler didn't accomplish everything, that somehow we're here.</span> <span id="s1133">And, you know, I married and I have a son and a daughter, so, you know, why should I feel guilty about that?</span> <span id="s1134">But to go somewhere and try to understand and to make peace with the Holocaust on an emotional level, I don't try and I can't.</span> <span id="s1135">When I get a bad dream, when I have a nightmare, I either take a pill or I get up and read a book.</span> <span id="s1136">Henry does it all the time.</span> <span id="s1137">When he sees his father's face -- he doesn't tell me much, but I know that he was -- the last person, he was Auschwitz with his father, and he can't get rid of that face.</span> <span id="s1138">He sees his father with that -- once in a while, he tells me that he sees his father because they were on a train together, and he had this three, four-day, you know, gray growth.</span> <span id="s1139">And his father gave him something that he had, they came out of the ghetto of Lódz.</span> <span id="s1140">That was a horrible place to begin with, and so he didn't have much.</span> <span id="s1141">Maybe he had some cigars and maybe he had some -- maybe he a silver dollar or something.</span> <span id="s1142">And he gave it to Henry and he said, "Take it.</span> <span id="s1143">I don't need it anymore."</span> <span id="s1144">Or something.</span> <span id="s1145">And I know when Henry has that dream or when he sees this, he just gets out of bed.</span> <span id="s1146">I don't ask him.</span> <span id="s1147">Goes down to the den.</span> <span id="s1148">Take a crime story and he reads.</span> <span id="s1149">You can't solve anything about that.</span> <span id="s1150">But I needed to solve for myself, I don't mean solve.</span> <span id="s1151">I needed to understand how God could permit that.</span> <span id="s1152">Now, Henry doesn't have this problem because I think he's an atheist or he' an agnostic.</span> <span id="s1153">So he's not asking God how God could allow it.</span> <span id="s1154">Insofar as he's concerned, he has an expression, he says, "Shit falls."</span> <span id="s1155">Look what's going on all over the world.</span> <span id="s1156">There are people killing people in other places.</span> <span id="s1157">So maybe in that sense he doesn't have, but I have -- I'm not an agnostic.</span> <span id="s1158">I have some kind of a belief, I don't necessarily believe in a Jewish God.</span> <span id="s1159">I believe in a Supreme -- I believe in God.</span> <span id="s1160">So I have to figure out for myself, I had to, how this could happen.</span> <span id="s1161">And they way I have solved it, and I think I've said that perhaps in other places, when I read a book by Dr. Fakenheim (ph), Professor Fakenheim, I think he was a professor at the University of -- Canadian.</span> <span id="s1162">There's a University in Canada, I'm trying to remember.</span> <span id="s1163">I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s1164">Anyway, he was a professor of history in Canada.</span> <span id="s1165">He now I think is a professor in Moretus in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1166">And he wrote a book, "God's Place in History."</span> <span id="s1167">I don't remember exactly, you may not.</span> <span id="s1168">And he said something in the book, and it's absolutely true.</span> <span id="s1169">He said that God was not in Auschwitz, that God gave us -- when you speak to the Jews, he gave us the Torah, but that's not important.</span> <span id="s1170">He gave, he taught people what is right and what is wrong.</span> <span id="s1171">And if we choose to do the wrong thing, then we do it.</span> <span id="s1172">And God didn't create Auschwitz, the Germans did.</span> <span id="s1173">And what happened in Auschwitz was between the Germans and their victims.</span> <span id="s1174">And now, perhaps in the earlier history, according to Fakenheim, did interfere.</span> <span id="s1175">He took us out of Egypt, but that was a god of a different time.</span> <span id="s1176">In our time, God does not interfere.</span> <span id="s1177">So I have that kind of a peace with myself that I don't blame God for Auschwitz; I blame the Germans for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1178">Just as I blame, just as I will put the blame of the people who kill each other in Burundi, Rwanda, Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: I want to ask you something that you have not spoken about, okay.</span> <span id="s1180">First of all, I wanted to ask you this because to so many survivors it's an issue.</span> <span id="s1181">And that is did you talk to your children about your experience?</span> <span id="s1182">And if you did, when did you and why did you?</span> <span id="s1183">And if you didn't, why didn't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1185">Well, you know, it would be nice if my daughter could -- because I sometimes talk to her about it.</span> <span id="s1186">I did talk to my children.</span> <span id="s1187">I think at different times, and it depended -- when the reason came.</span> <span id="s1188">I didn't live it all the time with them.</span> <span id="s1189">Actually, when the kids were little, when they were growing up in the house, these were really happy times for us in many ways.</span> <span id="s1190">But I talked to them because when they were little, and they wanted to know, for instance, why Lisa Zidner has a grandmother who's coming to visit and Janie has a grandpa and grandma coming, and where are my parents and where are Henry's parents?</span> <span id="s1191">So I told them that both my parents and Daddy's parents are not alive.</span> <span id="s1192">Why aren't they alive?</span> <span id="s1193">I said, "Well, they died in the war."</span> <span id="s1194">"How did they die?"</span> <span id="s1195">"Well, they didn't die -- they died because of the war.</span> <span id="s1196">And when you will be bigger, I will explain it."</span> <span id="s1197">And I did, and, of course, in 1959 they were in Israel with me, and we talked a little bit more about it.</span> <span id="s1198">The children were still little.</span> <span id="s1199">When they got bigger -- and I did.</span> <span id="s1200">For instance, on Tu B'Shevat, I always lit candles.</span> <span id="s1201">That I did even though I didn't go to a synagogue because this was the anniversary of the destruction of my ghetto.</span> <span id="s1202">So I lit candles, and when the kids were big enough and they would ask me why I'm doing it.</span> <span id="s1203">And I told them I'm lighting the candles to remember my mom and my father and my sister and my brother.</span> <span id="s1204">And as they were getting bigger, I would tell them about some of the things that happened to me.</span> <span id="s1205">Depending on their age when they got big enough.</span> <span id="s1206">Henry did much less of it.</span> <span id="s1207">He had a lot of trouble talking about it.</span> <span id="s1208">On the other hand, and I did discuss this with my daughter, I asked her whether she feels -- because I wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1209">That was some many years later, whether she was -- when I read the book my Helen Epstein, did you read it?</span> <span id="s1210">Helen Epstein wrote a book called, "The Children of the Holocaust."</span> <span id="s1211">I think she wrote about that second generation.</span> <span id="s1212">And I was very upset when I read the book, because apparently she wrote the book, she based it upon a study that was done.</span> <span id="s1213">Or maybe she did the study, discussing it with a psychiatrist or some psychiatrist in Boston, whose children -- whose patients were children of Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1214">And she paints a picture of real neurotic, disturbed children, and I was upset.</span> <span id="s1215">First of all, the first thing I did at that point, I wanted to know from my daughter and from my son whether something like this -- after all, no matter how objective you think you are, you're not objective, you know.</span> <span id="s1216">Did I?</span> <span id="s1217">Did I fill them with these kind of -- some of the stories that she writes about, you know, these children really grew up in very dysfunctional, difficult homes.</span> <span id="s1218">So I talked to my kids, and both my children told me, and this was not right away, but through the years; this is the picture I got from them.</span> <span id="s1219">That theirs was a happy childhood, that they had a good home.</span> <span id="s1220">That they were aware of a lot of things and they were not totally not affected.</span> <span id="s1221">In other words, okay, in other words, what they -- then, as a matter of fact, let me tell you how they saw.</span> <span id="s1222">That they were not to be compared with the children that Helen Epstein is talking about fully.</span> <span id="s1223">And, in fact, it was Robbi (ph) who came out, my daughter, with the idea that perhaps we were lucky, Henry and I.</span> <span id="s1224">We had survived the Holocaust and we were young.</span> <span id="s1225">I had lost my parents, lost my sister and my brother, but I didn't lose a husband and I didn't lose children.</span> <span id="s1226">Many of the children described in Helen's books were raised as second children.</span> <span id="s1227">They were raised by people who had lost not just their past, but their future.</span> <span id="s1228">Some of these people lost their children.</span> <span id="s1229">Later I met some -- I know some people were -- sorry.</span> <span id="s1230">Robbi had a friend who told her -- he was a survivor's son -- that he didn't know that he had a sister until his father was on his death bed.</span> <span id="s1231">When his father was dying, he told him that before the war, he was married and he had a daughter.</span> <span id="s1232">Why these people could not deal with it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1233">I belonged to the generation, and there were many like me, who survived the war and did not lose husbands and children.</span> <span id="s1234">I was too young for that.</span> <span id="s1235">That may have made a difference.</span> <span id="s1236">I think that for anybody who studies the Holocaust survivors, I think they should draw that line.</span> <span id="s1237">That was more difficult for people who had that.</span> <span id="s1238">So in that sense, I'm not taking any credit, it may have been easier.</span> <span id="s1239">Did my children -- were my children affected by some of it?</span> <span id="s1240">Definitely.</span> <span id="s1241">In what way?</span> <span id="s1242">Well, first of all, the fact that Henry did not talk was not very good.</span> <span id="s1243">It would have helped if he did.</span> <span id="s1244">On the other hand, I can't say that he never talked.</span> <span id="s1245">He talked about before the war how things were at home.</span> <span id="s1246">He just didn't talk about Auschwitz, he couldn't.</span> <span id="s1247">And that was probably -- but I did.</span> <span id="s1248">And I think that was -- Robbi always felt that that was good.</span> <span id="s1249">That I had, that they didn't have to imagine things being worse than they were, so that was helpful.</span> <span id="s1250">On the other hand, Robbi said that I was neurotic about certain things, and, for instance, I was probably overprotective.</span> <span id="s1251">I tried not to be.</span> <span id="s1252">Up here, I tried not to be.</span> <span id="s1253">I sent my son and my daughter -- my daughter was 10 years old when she went for four weeks to camp, and my son was nine and a half.</span> <span id="s1254">In other words, I sent them to camp away from home.</span> <span id="s1255">I gave them a lot of freedom.</span> <span id="s1256">I did not -- but that was up here.</span> <span id="s1257">Emotionally, I suppose if Robbi was late from school, I may have been a little more upset than I should have.</span> <span id="s1258">Fortunately, even though Henry did not -- Henry acted in this sense as good balance.</span> <span id="s1259">When I, when we went -- when the kids learned how to swim and we'd be going to a swimming pool and I would go with the kids, and they learned how to jump from the, what is it?</span> <span id="s1260">From the diving board.</span> <span id="s1261">And so we made an agreement, so I said to them, "Okay, when I'm not here, you can't jump off the diving board.</span> <span id="s1262">You can swim."</span> <span id="s1263">And so the kids said, "Why?</span> <span id="s1264">Why can't we?</span> <span id="s1265">We're good swimmers."</span> <span id="s1266">By the way, I'm not a swimmer.</span> <span id="s1267">I can float.</span> <span id="s1268">So when we came home, but I said, "No, I won't allow you when I'm not here."</span> <span id="s1269">So the kids as usually they would take their case to their father.</span> <span id="s1270">So they would say to Henry, "Daddy, Mom won't let us jump off the diving board when she's not there."</span> <span id="s1271">So Henry looked at me and he said, "Bella, tell me what is the difference?"</span> <span id="s1272">First of all, he thought it was funny.</span> <span id="s1273">He said, "What could you do for them if you were there watching?"</span> <span id="s1274">So that was already -- but anyway, I said, "Well, I'll feel better if I'm there.</span> <span id="s1275">I'll holler for help."</span> <span id="s1276">Well, anyway, this was said to me.</span> <span id="s1277">Henry said to me, "You can either be there all the time, but you cannot restrict them."</span> <span id="s1278">So that was settled, and this was how we settled some of theses.</span> <span id="s1279">So yeah, I had some, I wouldn't let Craig ride a bike to the library until Henry said that this is crazy, and then Craig rode the bike to the library.</span> <span id="s1280">But we settled this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: You negotiated together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yeah, we did, we did.</span> <span id="s1283">Yeah, we did.</span> <span id="s1284">On the other hand, when Craig went to Harvard, he didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s1285">This is how I found out about the book.</span> <span id="s1286">He took a course on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1287">He has a library on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1288">That's not his field, but, you know, this his interest.</span> <span id="s1289">There's no question.</span> <span id="s1290">So were the kids affected?</span> <span id="s1291">I think so, definitely.</span> <span id="s1292">But perhaps not in a totally damaging way, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1293">I hope not.</span> <span id="s1294">My daughter had some problems, but I don't think they had anything to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1295">In fact, she used to say to me that when she had -- she had a chemical disorder.</span> <span id="s1296">She had a premenstrual, what is it?</span> <span id="s1297">Premenstrual syndrome, PMS, that led practically to depression until they finally medicated her.</span> <span id="s1298">It was just totally uncalled for, because it wasn't recognized.</span> <span id="s1299">But she said to me that it got to a point that when she was in Princeton and she started having problems.</span> <span id="s1300">And she would go for help, and she said, "Mom, I got to a point where I wouldn't tell them that I'm a Holocaust survivor's child, because they would get into it, " and she said, "and my problem had nothing to do with the Holocaust."</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: So she was aware of . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1303">But as I say, she's fine.</span> <span id="s1304">And she's on medication, but if it hadn't been neglected.</span> <span id="s1305">She had some rough years because of that.</span> <span id="s1306">But it was, she said on the other hand, she probably is a little bit more high-strung than she would have been if she hadn't been raised in a house by a mother who, when the phone ring, I would jump.</span> <span id="s1307">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: And now that your children are adults and out of the house and it's just you and your husband, does he talk more?</span> <span id="s1309">Do you talk more to other people about what you went through?</span> <span id="s1310">Is it even a different phase of your life now in your own thinking about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Well, this has been a process.</span> <span id="s1312">As I told you, originally, I did not talk about the Holocaust at all.</span> <span id="s1313">I started talking about it.</span> <span id="s1314">That was right away a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: We need to switch tapes here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: This is Tape 3 of an interview with Bella Tovey on June 6th, 1996 -- June 10th, 1996.</span> <span id="s1319">The question that I started to ask at the end of Tape 2 was, your children have left home now, and you and your husband are here together, and how is your thinking about the Holocaust today, compared to when you had children at home, or when they were young?</span> <span id="s1320">Where are you now in your thinking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Well, mostly, as I said, I didn't -- we don't, Henry and I -- it's funny.</span> <span id="s1322">We don't talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1323">I can talk to Henry about it, although I will say this: In 19- -- there are a couple of things that happened.</span> <span id="s1324">First of all, I talk about the Holocaust more mostly because -- and I started originally when I was a Hebrew teacher talking to my class.</span> <span id="s1325">First I talked to my children at home.</span> <span id="s1326">Then I talked -- but mostly that's why I agreed to interviews, I gave my oral history.</span> <span id="s1327">When I started reading that people were denying that the Holocaust happened, I think I took, I made a definite decision that I need to make some kind of a contribution if I can, because I realize that there are people who are denying that the Holocaust happened.</span> <span id="s1328">And particularly I remember reading about a Professor Butz, B-u-t-z, I think.</span> <span id="s1329">He was at the University of Northwestern, and he wrote a book called "The Hoax of the Twentieth Century," denying.</span> <span id="s1330">In other words, this is not just, you know, some of these skinheads denying the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1331">But this is scholarly work being written that the Holocaust never took place.</span> <span id="s1332">It's that kind of a thing that made me want to do it.</span> <span id="s1333">That, plus the fact that we did take Roberta and Craig to Poland in 1989, shortly after Henry retired.</span> <span id="s1334">We went back to my city, to Henry's city, went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1335">We went to all of these places.</span> <span id="s1336">We went to Mogilev.</span> <span id="s1337">Our son and our daughter wanted, they felt it was an incredible experience.</span> <span id="s1338">My husband paid for it by becoming -- and he's never been depressed.</span> <span id="s1339">He was depressed for three months after we came home.</span> <span id="s1340">It was a rough trip for him.</span> <span id="s1341">He did it for his kids, and it was at that time that he talked about his experiences because it was -- I mean we were in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: To the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yeah, to the kids.</span> <span id="s1344">Most of the time Henry and I do not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1345">When I'm called up occasionally by the Children's Museum, I go and talk, because I feel it's important.</span> <span id="s1346">I gave a talk at my temple a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s1347">Henry actually gave a talk once in his life last year at the Liberation.</span> <span id="s1348">We had a wonderful service dedicated to the liberators last year, and Henry was one of the people who the rabbi -- Henry's very fond of our rabbi, so he twisted his arm, and Henry gave a short talk.</span> <span id="s1349">That was the only time that Henry talked.</span> <span id="s1350">I will also say to you, though, that when some of my friends who are survivors -- I don't have too many friends here.</span> <span id="s1351">I have one couple, but we have some friends who occasionally come from New York.</span> <span id="s1352">When we get together, usually, and this is kind of a joke and a password.</span> <span id="s1353">That one of our friends will say, "Well, we came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1354">Why don't we go home?</span> <span id="s1355">Why don't we go to sleep?"</span> <span id="s1356">In other words, if I can explain what happens, yeah.</span> <span id="s1357">I think that when we are together, particularly with people who went through what we did, we find ourselves somehow drifting back.</span> <span id="s1358">And usually somebody then will say, "Okay, we're already in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1359">Why don't we call it quits?</span> <span id="s1360">And why don't we go to sleep?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: I don't understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: What happens is that we are together.</span> <span id="s1363">We can be talking about our kids, we can be talking about politics.</span> <span id="s1364">Henry and I volunteered this days in the Whitehouse, and we are very, very pro-Clinton, for instance, so we talk about politics.</span> <span id="s1365">We can talk about music.</span> <span id="s1366">My husband loves birds.</span> <span id="s1367">We can be talking, and then suddenly somebody will say something, remember something that happened.</span> <span id="s1368">And then we'll start talking about -- and one thing leads into the other, he'll mention something, then we start talking about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1369">And then somebody will usually say, "Well, we are in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1370">Why don't we go to sleep?"</span> <span id="s1371">Meaning, that somehow Auschwitz is the, what is it, is the synonymous thing with Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1372">So we got to Auschwitz, why don't we call it quits?</span> <span id="s1373">Why don't we stop talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Meaning, let's not talk about this anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Meaning that somehow it's -- no matter what we talk about, when we are together with people who went through what we went through, we somehow end up getting to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1376">So yeah, can I say that we do?</span> <span id="s1377">Yeah, we do.</span> <span id="s1378">Somehow it didn't leave us.</span> <span id="s1379">I remember you have on that big film, the big one in the Holocaust Museum, somebody said that she tries not to teach her children to hate.</span> <span id="s1380">I never taught my kids to hate.</span> <span id="s1381">And if they want to forgive, my son is flying to Israel today.</span> <span id="s1382">I hope he has a good trip, and he's so happens that his trip is paid for by his University.</span> <span id="s1383">And the tickets, he's going via Frankfort with Lufthansa.</span> <span id="s1384">And from there I think he's taking via -- to Israel, but he's stopping in Frankfort for a day.</span> <span id="s1385">I will not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1386">My son is going, he isn't going to visit Germany, but he is going to go through Frankfort and go on.</span> <span id="s1387">It's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Because you still have . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: It's okay for him, and it's fine, but I will not go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1390">I will not forget and I'm not forgiving.</span> <span id="s1391">Not where the Germans are concerned.</span> <span id="s1392">So am I left with something?</span> <span id="s1393">Yeah, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Do you have grandchildren yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: My son has three adopted children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Are they old enough to ask questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Probably, but we haven't gotten to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1398">His oldest daughter is 10 and a half.</span> <span id="s1399">Two are from Korea; one is from Peru.</span> <span id="s1400">And Kendall is going with Craig to Israel, so I don't know.</span> <span id="s1401">I'm sure that Craig has talked to her about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: It would be interesting maybe as they get older to see how you think about talking to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1404">Come to think of it, we have talked a little bit because they come home for Passover, and it is during Passover that we talk a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s1405">As a matter of fact, last year I was 50 years when we were liberated, and Robbi and Craig, our son and our daughter, and my son-in-law -- my son is divorced -- planted 50 trees, 100 trees, excuse me for us in Israel; 50 for me and 50 for Henry in honor of our liberation.</span> <span id="s1406">So we talked about being liberated and our children and grandchildren were here, so we do talk a little bit about it already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: How did your relationship with your sister turn out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Great.</span> <span id="s1409">I have a wonderful relationship with my sister.</span> <span id="s1410">My sister did what she needed to do, and as I said, once I came to America, I did not take a walk to Israel.</span> <span id="s1411">I did not go to Israel, I settled here.</span> <span id="s1412">I've pretty lucky in this country.</span> <span id="s1413">It's been a great country for us.</span> <span id="s1414">I have some moments where I feel that perhaps I should have gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s1415">Because I think that maybe all Jewish people should be in Israel, but it's nice coming to America.</span> <span id="s1416">I have my -- as I say, I have my mixed feelings occasionally.</span> <span id="s1417">But this is by now my country, so in that sense I think I'm like many of the first, what is it, immigrant Americans.</span> <span id="s1418">I'm probably more patriotic than even my children.</span> <span id="s1419">I find that Americans don't appreciate this country as much as people who have come here.</span> <span id="s1420">And I mean that honestly, with all its faults, this is a truly great country.</span> <span id="s1421">A very democratic country.</span> <span id="s1422">There's some problems, problems everywhere.</span> <span id="s1423">Wasn't it Churchill that said it's the worst of the best systems?</span> <span id="s1424">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1425">He said something.</span> <span id="s1426">It's a bad system, but it's the best of all the bad ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: It's come to my conscience here about a year or so, especially last winter during the presidential primaries, you probably are -- my assumption is that you are sensitive to hearing anti-Semitism expressed by political figures or aspiring political figures.</span> <span id="s1428">How does your experience play itself out in your political view of your life here?</span> <span id="s1429">Or maybe it doesn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Well, I am sensitive to it, and for instance, definitely when I make my decisions about voting, I am very careful to -- I definitely am sensitive to anti-Semitic or even, you know, that kind of an expression.</span> <span id="s1431">Henry worked with non-Jews most of his life, and some of them were truly wonderful people who had no -- they were not prejudiced.</span> <span id="s1432">But he had friends who would occasionally say I Jewed him down or something.</span> <span id="s1433">And when it comes to political people, I could not stand Baker.</span> <span id="s1434">I thought that the Bush administration was -- and it's not because they were Republicans.</span> <span id="s1435">Reagan had his faults, God knows.</span> <span id="s1436">I didn't care for some of his politics, but he was not an anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1437">Bush was an anti-Semitic, he was a kind of an aristocratic anti-Semitic, if you will.</span> <span id="s1438">And Baker, even worse.</span> <span id="s1439">Clinton is -- maybe that's why -- that's not the only reason I'm fond of him, but Clinton with all of his faults -- they accuse him of so many terrible things, but I think he's basically a totally unprejudiced man.</span> <span id="s1440">And to me -- to me, this is more important than anything else.</span> <span id="s1441">I don't worry about relationships between, I'm not God.</span> <span id="s1442">I'm not telling people how to live.</span> <span id="s1443">I don't care whether Clinton has a mistress or will have a mistress, that's not my business.</span> <span id="s1444">I think that the most important thing about a human being is to be fully accepting of other human beings.</span> <span id="s1445">And I treasure people who are able to see human beings as human beings regardless of the color and religion and whatever.</span> <span id="s1446">And Clinton, to me, with all of his faults, and God knows he's got lots of faults; everybody does.</span> <span id="s1447">Clinton is a truly unprejudiced man.</span> <span id="s1448">I sometimes wonder whether hopefully maybe this is true for this younger generation.</span> <span id="s1449">My daughter, for instance, I have some non-Jewish friends, but not that many.</span> <span id="s1450">We had more when Henry was working.</span> <span id="s1451">Robbi, even though she belongs to a temple and she's Jewish in the sense that she's more observant that I am, 50 percent of her friends are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1452">And maybe your generation is less prejudiced, maybe you have -- although God knows that's probably not true.</span> <span id="s1453">I work in the Whitehouse, and I hear all kinds of things when I answer the phones.</span> <span id="s1454">But to me, this is the most important thing about a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Is this something that you learned from your parents or something that you learned as a result of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: What?</span> <span id="s1457">Not appreciating a human being who can be without a prejudice?</span> <span id="s1458">I'm trying to think.</span> <span id="s1459">My father was a very tolerant man.</span> <span id="s1460">My father was a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s1461">My father was a very tolerant person.</span> <span id="s1462">When people would come and say that they saw a friend's son smoking on Shabbat, and my father did not smoke on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1463">He would say, "What's the matter?</span> <span id="s1464">Only the non-observant have a right to smoke on Shabbat?"</span> <span id="s1465">So I probably grew up in a very tolerant home.</span> <span id="s1466">That may have been, but I think that the war had a lot to do with it, too.</span> <span id="s1467">There's no question.</span> <span id="s1468">I mean our mind is a reaction.</span> <span id="s1469">When I meet people who survived the Holocaust, and there are some of us, who will say -- although I think if they start thinking, they wouldn't -- who will say something derogatory about blacks or something.</span> <span id="s1470">I get terribly upset, I think that we have absolutely -- if we didn't take anything out of those camps, we have to remember that we are all human beings.</span> <span id="s1471">And we have to remember something else, that it's so important, it's so important not to allow yourself a kind of a -- if people think that just saying something negative about another person is not dangerous, they're wrong.</span> <span id="s1472">I think that the minute you open up the possibility that somebody is not quite worthy of the same treatment as you are -- I'm always that when I talk to children and, you know, when I talk to any groups, that when somebody will try to take away one right, when somebody will try to tell you that you are not entitled to one thing of all the thousands things that other people are entitled, that's the beginning of the end.</span> <span id="s1473">I think we all have to be so sensitive to it.</span> <span id="s1474">To me, this is so important that every human being has to have the same rights.</span> <span id="s1475">And we have no right, I have no -- if I sometimes, think, you know, if I get angry at something or, you know, when I hear these stories about welfare, it doesn't matter that there are more blacks who are on welfare.</span> <span id="s1476">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1477">Use the words that there are more people in New York who are on welfare, but don't put the labels of black, white, green, yellow.</span> <span id="s1478">I'm very proud of the fact that my son adopted two children from Korea and one child from Peru.</span> <span id="s1479">It means that he grew up in a home where he didn't hear that being Jewish is better than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: And yet, you told me an hour ago that when you, in 1945, you couldn't stand the sight of German children, so you've made a lot of -- you've sort of come a long way in your thinking.</span> <span id="s1481">That's different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1483">That's different.</span> <span id="s1484">Let me explain.</span> <span id="s1485">When I said in 1945 that I had to get out of Germany, I emotionally was very troubled.</span> <span id="s1486">I adored my kid sister, and I lost a kid sister and a kid brother.</span> <span id="s1487">My brother was born in 1933, and he was 10 years old when he was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1488">I wasn't home anymore, and my sister was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s1489">I lost two children, my younger siblings, and when I saw families -- and I lost my parents.</span> <span id="s1490">And when I would occasionally get out of Bergen and I saw people, normal people -- a father and a mother and a couple of children -- walking on the street, and they took that away from me.</span> <span id="s1491">And they did it, so yeah, I hated them.</span> <span id="s1492">And frankly, I was afraid -- I didn't want to stay in Germany; I didn't want to hate that much, and I didn't know where that hatred would bring me to.</span> <span id="s1493">I don't think that I would have gone out and killed somebody, but I'll tell you this: When I heard, because I wasn't involved, when I heard that the inmates in Bergen-Belsen put a couple of barracks on fire where the SS men were put in.</span> <span id="s1494">When the British came in, they took some of the SS men who didn't manage to escape and put them in a barrack and they surrounded them.</span> <span id="s1495">And then some of the prisoners who can walk, some of us had -- not all of us were in my shape.</span> <span id="s1496">They put those barracks on fire, and the British soldiers walked away.</span> <span id="s1497">Of course, they later, the prisoners were not allowed near those.</span> <span id="s1498">These became suddenly prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1499">But I was delighted to hear it.</span> <span id="s1500">I think they should have killed more Germans.</span> <span id="s1501">Are you asking me now whether I still -- now, I don't hate the Germans who were born after the war and have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1502">I mean, obviously, emotionally -- even emotionally, I don't hate them.</span> <span id="s1503">But I have not forgiven the Germans who were involved in it.</span> <span id="s1504">And, by the way, I didn't read the book by Goldhagen, and I don't know how factual.</span> <span id="s1505">I don't know, but I'll tell you this: He is absolutely right when he says that many, many, many more Germans knew about what was happening, benefited from it, and were participators to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1506">There is no -- I don't, I have no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1507">I am not a historian, but I saw enough.</span> <span id="s1508">The German soldiers didn't have to kill us.</span> <span id="s1509">The Germans -- my God, it happened in my own house.</span> <span id="s1510">A month after the war broke out, a German bitch came in with two SS men or soldiers, and they took everything out of our house.</span> <span id="s1511">And what do you think these people did with all the things that they took from German homes?</span> <span id="s1512">They sent it back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1513">How did the Germans suddenly get all these things?</span> <span id="s1514">Insofar as I'm concerned, to me, the German nation was collectively guilty.</span> <span id="s1515">They followed Hitler, they did it.</span> <span id="s1516">But I don't hate the Germans because they have blonde hair or blue eyes or black hair.</span> <span id="s1517">I hate the Germans for what they did, that's different.</span> <span id="s1518">I don't like Farakan, not because he's black.</span> <span id="s1519">I hate Farakan for what he's preaching, that's different.</span> <span id="s1520">When I'm talking about tolerance, I'm talking about treating people as human beings.</span> <span id="s1521">But I will tell you this: I'm not a Christian, I'm not turning my other cheek, and I'm not forgiving those who hurt me.</span> <span id="s1522">In that sense, maybe I'm Jewish, yeah.</span> <span id="s1523">I'm not forgiving the Germans.</span> <span id="s1524">Let the pope do it; I won't.</span> <span id="s1525">And if there is a God, I hope there is a God, I also hope there's hell.</span> <span id="s1526">And in that hell, I hope Hitler is still burning.</span> <span id="s1527">Do I sound mean?</span> <span id="s1528">Fine, that's how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: When you talk to children in various places, what do they want to know?</span> <span id="s1530">What do they -- I'm sure it depends on how old they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Well, it depends, it depends.</span> <span id="s1532">And they ask some questions.</span> <span id="s1533">I will say this: I'm more careful, I wouldn't say what I just told you about Hitler burning in hell to children.</span> <span id="s1534">You know, you have to be a little more -- although I tell the children that I have not forgiven the German people who did it, those who did it.</span> <span id="s1535">And I may also say that if God wants to forgive them, that's his business but I'm not.</span> <span id="s1536">You know, that's -- children ask very interesting questions, very often what they will do, and this is so touching.</span> <span id="s1537">They'll come over and they'll say to me, they'll say to me, "Do you have children?"</span> <span id="s1538">And I'll say, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1539">And they'll say, "That's good, so you have somebody you can love now."</span> <span id="s1540">Which is really very touching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Is there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: No.</span> <span id="s1543">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1544">I think I talked more than enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1546">This is the end of this is the third tape.</span> <span id="s1547">This is the end of the interview with Bella Tovey on June 10th, 1996 at her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s1548">And I'm Nina Ellis for the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
