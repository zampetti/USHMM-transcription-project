Would you begin by telling me your name, now and at birth, as well as where you were born, and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My name now is Anita Sockol, and I was born in Berlin, September 17th, 1927.</span> <span id="s14">My name at birth, is that what you asked -- was Plachte, P-l-a-c-h-t-e, Anita Plachte.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you tell me something about your family?</span> <span id="s16">Did you have any siblings, and can you tell me about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My parents -- no, I didn’t have any siblings.</span> <span id="s18">My parents were Margaret and Ludwig Plachte.</span> <span id="s19">My mother’s maiden name is Schindler.</span> <span id="s20">And is -- they were both born in Berlin, which I think they were quite proud of, which tells you something.</span> <span id="s21">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What about their personalities can you -- can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father was sort of a -- a bachelor when he got married.</span> <span id="s24">He was a -- I don’t -- He was a good man, a decent man, but not full of humor.</span> <span id="s25">And bu -- quite set in his ways.</span> <span id="s26">He got married when he was 40, and he was 42 when they had me.</span> <span id="s27">And my mother was 27 when she got married, and was anxious to get out of Kemnets.</span> <span id="s28">She told me many, many times, that she got married to him very quickly, you know, he asked her to marry him, and she wanted to marry to get to Berlin, that’s what she wanted.</span> <span id="s29">So, but she was fun loving.</span> <span id="s30">She had a sense of humor, and I think my father sort of kept her down, or at least it wa -- it -- that’s how it seemed to me.</span> <span id="s31">He was a, as we say today, a ca -- mut -- a bit of a control freak.</span> <span id="s32">Or maybe more than a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Can you tell me something about the neighborhood where you were growing up in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I can see the house in my mind’s eye.</span> <span id="s35">It was, you know, I -- I would say like upper middle class, and it had a -- there was a park nearby, by Rushaplatz, or was it just a real -- a playground with a par -- I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s36">Not a big park, because Berlin has very big parks, that’s not one -- one of them.</span> <span id="s37">But it was like a comfortable neighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived nearby somewhere.</span> <span id="s38">My mother used to tell me that, not that I knew who he was at the time, but I knew he was somebody important.</span> <span id="s39">And I guess that was a different neighborhood, but where my -- when my parents got married, not that same building that -- that I grew up in, when they got married, before they had me, they lived in a noybow, as they called it, you know, a new building, and Marlena Dietrich lived in that building.</span> <span id="s40">These are things that were told to me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Can you describe the -- the home where you were growing up, in more detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes, it’s -- i-it was a very nice, spacious apartment, with long hallways, you know, and i-it seemed to me like it was quite large, and I know there were -- there was a -- what do you call that?</span> <span id="s43">Like bells that you could ring, you know, and it would ring in the back, in the -- near the kitchen, like which room the maid was supposed to come and s -- I was very impressed with this, I think, cause I still remember it.</span> <span id="s44">But it was, you know, middle class, nothing ultra fancy.</span> <span id="s45">I don’t even remember -- I guess it did have an elevator, the building.</span> <span id="s46">Yeah, it must have.</span> <span id="s47">I can see myself walking into the building, and yet it -- it’s murky.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Are there any sounds, or any smells that remind you of that home after -- after leaving there?</span> <span id="s49">Anything that’s come up in the years after?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s51">I -- Sounds perhaps, but I -- I don’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s52">I -- I remember feeling fear when they’d leave me alone at night, that I remember.</span> <span id="s53">Too early for a young child, at least for me it was.</span> <span id="s54">But I don’t -- because you said sounds, that’s what made me think of it, because I’d hear things that probably weren’t even happening, but in my mind they were.</span> <span id="s55">Creaking sounds or something, and I was frightened to be alone, five or six, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Had your parents gone out for the evening, and left you with a guardian of some sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, I -- I think I was alone, at least that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s58">It must have been later on, when you couldn’t -- you know, weren’t allowed to have a maid any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And what do you know about the neighborhood?</span> <span id="s60">Who else lived in the immediate area?</span> <span id="s61">Was this a Jewish area of Berlin?</span> <span id="s62">A Jewish quarter of sorts?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I don’t remember, but somehow I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s64">I don’t think it was -- no, they were well integrated.</span> <span id="s65">I’m sure there were Jews living around, but it was -- a-as far as I ca -- I remember, when I’d visit a friend, it was pretty far away, it was -- because this -- the school that I went to was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s66">But, I don’t think so, it’s -- it’s like saying, you know, where I live now in Manhattan, do I live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span> <span id="s67">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s68">A lot of Jews live there, but it’s not a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s69">I think that’s how it was in Berlin, because I didn’t really think that anything was going to happen.</span> <span id="s70">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Can you tell me where your school was located, and also in relation to where you were, growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, I -- I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s73">I-It was called -- I -- I can tell you what it was called, Prinsagetten Temple, which was a synagogue, and they had a school.</span> <span id="s74">But where it was in relation to my house, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s75">How did I get there every day?</span> <span id="s76">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s77">I -- Doesn’t -- nothing comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Do you have many memories of being in your home?</span> <span id="s79">Being with your parents, eating meals, observing any holidays?</span> <span id="s80">I realize that you were young, at the time, but do you have any memories like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I remember -- I remember meals in our dining room, I can see the dining room in my -- in my mind, but holidays, I think we were -- we were not very religious.</span> <span id="s82">My mother was, she always went to -- always went to synagogue on the high holidays, and she always fasted on Yom Kippur, that was very important to her, and she -- somehow she carried that through to, you know, very late in life, in New York.</span> <span id="s83">And I don’t remember her making holiday meals.</span> <span id="s84">We must have been invited, or something.</span> <span id="s85">I know we were invited here.</span> <span id="s86">It wasn’t like, you know, she invited people over.</span> <span id="s87">She was not that much of a housewife, or cook, you know, to -- to cook for many people was not her thing.</span> <span id="s88">And my father didn’t care, you know, as far as holidays were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did the three of you go to synagogue as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Someti -- I remember them being there, being at that synagogue, for -- but it must have been for me, cause it was Purim or something, and probably something that parents should attend, so it was more for parents attending than for the holidays, and yet that isn’t quite true.</span> <span id="s91">She had a Bible, and sh -- I think I have it at home still -- that she used, but I’m -- I’m a little confused whether that was in the United States, or there.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you have other relatives in Berlin, and were they living close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I had my father’s brother, and his wife.</span> <span id="s94">That’s my Uncle Martin and Tanta Trudy.</span> <span id="s95">I never called her aunt, cause I never saw her again, Tanta Trude, and my cousin, Ilsa.</span> <span id="s96">They had one daughter, and I was very fond of her, very close to her, or wanted to be, because I was an only child, and I was not very happy about that, so I wanted to think of her as a sister, was happy when once in awhile we’d get some dresses that were the same dress, you know, in -- in our respective sizes.</span> <span id="s97">But they lived -- I know they lived a subway ride away, and I -- I think I once went there.</span> <span id="s98">It was sort of as if we lived in Manhattan, and they lived in Brooklyn kind of thing.</span> <span id="s99">That’s what I s -- remember, and they were more modest -- had a more modest income, and I don’t know what he did for a living, but -- but we didn’t -- I -- I didn’t see her as often as I would have liked.</span> <span id="s100">She went to a different school, and she was a little older than I was, and -- but I -- I wanted to se -- to -- to -- wanted more of a connection.</span> <span id="s101">Why we didn’t, I -- I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s102">I was really a lonely child.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What other friendships do you remember from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I remember Hi-Hilda Lerbenthal, Lowenthal.</span> <span id="s105">She was at one -- somebody in my class, who I was good friends with, and she had a large family, so that must have been fairly -- she had a younger brother and two older brothers, and it was like a happy household, and I loved going there, because it was a lot going on, and you know, played with her brothers, and attention was paid, and meals of mi-milk and cookies, or whatever.</span> <span id="s106">And then I had a friend named Levia Aronfeld, who I’ve seen in New York, I’ve run into her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her, which was really quite something.</span> <span id="s107">And another person, Marion Faulk.</span> <span id="s108">There were quite a few.</span> <span id="s109">Eva Simon.</span> <span id="s110">I re -- just remember these names, and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I remember, had birthday parties, my mother made me birthday parties, and she had these lovely little cups and saucers, each one was different from another.</span> <span id="s111">I have just a couple of them left, I have them in my den, cause they -- eventually they chipped and broke, and this and that, but I li -- I loved them, and it’s serving -- served us cocoa in those cups, you know, each one, they were very pretty, china, you know, each one was totally different from the other.</span> <span id="s112">We called them Zameltussen.</span> <span id="s113">And maybe something will come to mind about holidays, but -- I remember a Christmas tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for when we had a maid, because she wanted it, you know, and she did it for her, we had a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s114">Of course, no Christ-like ornaments on it, but it had something on it, jelly rings, or something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Was the maid living with you full time at your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, yes, she was, because there was a room off the kitchen, a small room, and that was Emma’s room, that was the first one that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: While you were living in Berlin, were there more than -- was there more than one maid that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes, there was another one after that, named Lotte, and she was also there for quite a few years.</span> <span id="s119">I think she was there until it was prohibited to have maids.</span> <span id="s120">Then they said they could have Jewish maids, but I think that never came off, that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And what do you remember about your interaction with the maids that you knew in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: They were my friends, I mean I -- I sa -- I use the word maids, you know, I -- I shouldn’t really, it’s -- they were like my -- what’s the word -- like my companions, not really a -- they were like my babysitters, you know, my nursemaids is a better -- even though they did do the cleaning, I think, dishes, I don’t remember having any other -- anyone else in help.</span> <span id="s123">But my mother was very nervous when I was born, I know that, she’s told me that, and she gave me away, sh -- and I always thought, f-for years, until I -- til my late years, you know, that my friends who are psycho -- psychologists and -- and social workers said, “You know, that wasn’t really such a terrific thing.”</span> <span id="s124">She thought she did a wonderful thing, she didn’t have enough milk, and she gave me away to a clinic.</span> <span id="s125">Clinic is not what a clinic is here.</span> <span id="s126">Clinic is like a private thing where they -- Dr. Lungstein, she told me, out in -- it was a good distance, and she said she went there several times a week to see me, and they had a -- what do you call them, wet -- wet nurses, because she thought that I wasn’t going to -- going to make it, or something.</span> <span id="s127">I -- I don’t know if any of this really was necessary or true, but that’s what she did, and that’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s128">But it’s sort of interesting, you know, as a mother and grandmother when I look back on this, and what did that really mean, to give away a newborn, and I said, “How long was that?”</span> <span id="s129">And she -- It was like a half a year, which is sort of mind-boggling.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Do you remember as a child being close to both your mother and father, or more so to one?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I remember being closer to my mother, yes, definitely to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: He was a manufacturer of dresses and blouses, that was a -- I guess a common combination in -- in the garment area, in Berlin in those days, dresses and blouses, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: And did your mom stay at home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, she stayed at home.</span> <span id="s136">She -- She didn’t work, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And, do you have any specific memories of -- of any -- any interactions with the maids that you knew well during those times, or -- I know that you seem to have fond memories of them, but anything in -- specific that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Can you actually tell me what you remember, as far as the layout of your home, when you entered?</span> <span id="s140">I think you were mentioning this.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s142">Well, i-it -- it -- it -- to m -- to me, it seemed as if -- to me it seems now, like it was quite a large apartment.</span> <span id="s143">When you came in t -- i-it was a long -- there was a corridor to the first room, was my room, which was a -- as you -- as you came into the apartment, and then there was a living room, and a hamsimmer, as my mother called it, with a schockladenshun, which she had a key to, it means it was -- that’s where she kept the chocolates, and they were like a treat when you got some.</span> <span id="s144">And then the dining room, and then a long hallway, which led to the room that the housekeeper had, and then the kitchen.</span> <span id="s145">And I think that was it, but it seemed very large.</span> <span id="s146">Maybe they were very spacious rooms.</span> <span id="s147">It was sort of an elegant apartment, the way I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did you have friends in the neighborhood?</span> <span id="s149">It sounds like you mostly have friends at school.</span> <span id="s150">Any friends in the neighborhood that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Not that I recall -- I don’t recall going, you know, upstairs or downstairs, or next building or something, to play with anyone.</span> <span id="s152">I’m sure I must have, I -- I don’t know, I must have blocked it or something, but I don’t remember doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Do you remember having non-Jewish friends in Berlin, or even knowing if a friend is not Jewish at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Hm, it’s a good question.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t -- I don’t really know the answer.</span> <span id="s156">I guess maybe I was -- maybe I was subliminally aware of it, or even if you didn’t speak about it, because right from the beginning, I went to a -- I was sent to a Jewish school, and I knew why.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You were told why you were being sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah, yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What did your -- What did your parents tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: They wanted me to escape the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s161">They were afraid for the an-anti-Semitism, so that was -- I’m trying to think, 1933 or something, six years old.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t know when you begin school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Do you remember already having an awareness of anti-Semitism, besides what your parents were telling you about sending you to this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I was aware of it.</span> <span id="s165">Now, I don’t know if it was before, or after entering school, or it was simultaneous, but I do remember, I remember parades, and marches, and -- and you know, those banners, and flags, and -- and Hitler going -- I f -- remember seeing Hitler going through the streets with a -- you know, and that’s -- I -- I -- maybe I’ve heard it on -- on the radio, cause I probably didn’t wi -- makes sense that I didn’t read the paper, but we did have a radio, and you’d hear that screeching voice that we all know.</span> <span id="s166">Yes, I had strange feel -- I -- you certainly did feel it, but at the same time, we went to the movies, and I remember -- what was that place -- and it was a -- where there was a big movie theater, in the center.</span> <span id="s167">It must have been near -- what was that [indecipherable] main street there.</span> <span id="s168">Kudam.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Kuf -- Kuffus.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yeah, Kuffus and dam, yeah, that’s what the Berliners call it, Kudam, Krufust and dam, and there was a movie that I was -- aside from Shirley Temple, I was fascinated by the Dionne quintuplets, and I can still see like a big advertisement, you know, above -- the marquis above the mo-movie theater, like a painting or -- or a photograph, or whatever, huge, about those five quintuplets, and Gene Herschels, was an actor or something, who played the doctor -- or was he the doctor -- I -- I --who -- who delivered them.</span> <span id="s171">Anyway, the whole thing fascinated me.</span> <span id="s172">You’re bringing out very strange things in me, Amy.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did you have any experience of somebody in Berlin being anti-Semitic toward you, personally?</span> <span id="s174">Any recollection of anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I was always -- I was -- it -- it was like a -- like a feeling, like a -- I ca -- I can’t e -- with -- I -- I don’t remember, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s176">I -- I -- I don’t remember anybody calling me names, or I might have blocked it -- or hitting me, or sa -- or anything like that, but it was a feeling of caution, and always being told not to make waves, be careful, don’t do this, don’t do that, and -- and that kind of thing, it was more that.</span> <span id="s177">But I guess I felt comfortable as far as anti-Semitism was concerned, in the school.</span> <span id="s178">Not that I was happy in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Tell me more about your experiences at school.</span> <span id="s180">Why weren’t you happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I was just not happy in the school.</span> <span id="s182">I -- I did not -- I was not a good student, I felt very isolated, I felt lonely, I felt like an unhappy child, and -- I -- also I did not like Hebrew -- Hebrew lessons.</span> <span id="s183">I wasn’t good in it, I didn’t like it, I didn’t want to take it.</span> <span id="s184">I -- I was -- I did -- I didn’t enjoy school, I didn’t feel popular, you know how youngsters have to feel popular.</span> <span id="s185">All that came much later in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you talk to your mom or your dad about these feelings, do you remember?</span> <span id="s187">Express anything to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s189">I -- They were not that -- those kind of parents as they are today, or maybe then as well, but that’s, I guess, where their age came in.</span> <span id="s190">They were very -- not psychologically oriented.</span> <span id="s191">I don’t think if -- if I did, that it didn’t get me anywhere.</span> <span id="s192">They were the kind of parents that my mother used to tell me, you know, as -- as, I have a headache -- children don’t get headaches, and that was the end of that, and that her mother said to her, translating it into English, if she had a -- a sore throat, her mother would give her a scarf, put it around your neck and go to school, kind of thing.</span> <span id="s193">And -- What else did her mother say?</span> <span id="s194">She’d always tell me that [indecipherable] in a -- pestering her the way kids do, I’m thirsty, I’m hungry, I’m hungry.</span> <span id="s195">She says, “Well then, lick a little salt, and you’ll be thirsty, too.”</span> <span id="s196">You know, it’s sort of in fun, but not -- not paying all that much attention to children’s emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Do you have recollection of the first time that you learned about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s199">Her -- I -- I remember something about -- again, it must be the radio, or my parents talking, or people talking, about these elections, and that it’s -- it’ll blow over, or they were upset about the election, and I don’t even know what year that was, ’32 was it, that he came into power?</span> <span id="s200">But like most people said, and like you he -- see in movies now, you know, on that subject, like it’ll blow over, and that crazy guy, and it’s -- and that’s just exactly how it was, that’s how I remember it, that this was like an aberration.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: But you do actually, at some point, have more memories of hearing him on the radio, or seeing him in these parades.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What other -- What other memory is related to Hitler, and maybe some of the either SS troopers, or people in the street that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, I -- I remember going out to -- my father was very fond of going out to gunavagdet, was one of those big parks, park and woods combination, cause Berlin is very large, and we’d do that very often, every Sunday.</span> <span id="s205">Not that -- I didn’t like it, but that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s206">And then had to have a café in there, and you could sit down and have cake, and something to drink.</span> <span id="s207">And at a table very nearby, was Herman Goering, with his wife and kids.</span> <span id="s208">I think he had two.</span> <span id="s209">And when my father saw that -- and I knew that that was like a very bad thing, I -- I f -- without having explained too much to me, I don’t know wh-what I knew, or what he was going to be doing, but he paid the check, and we left there very quickly, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s210">And I remember another incident that -- with my Uncle Heinrich, my mother’s brother, th -- who had the nerve, or maybe it was foolishness, to -- when they came around with a collection box, when the parade was going by, the Nazi parade, that he too -- he had a button in his pocket, and he put a button into this box instead of money, which was a very dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s211">He told that -- you know, seemed like adventuresome, as long as he got away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did people, either your parents, or other family members, start talking much about Hitler and Nazis in your presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I think they tried to shield me.</span> <span id="s214">Th-They did try to shield me from all this.</span> <span id="s215">It may not have been, you know, the most demonstrative, and affectionate -- although my mother was affectionate -- parents, but I think they were -- they did want to shield me from this, and things are murky because they didn’t really explain things, didn’t really talk to me about these things, even as I got older, because after all, I was -- by the time we were leaving, it -- I was 10.</span> <span id="s216">And they also spoke -- and this was laughable, they spoke in English, in fr -- it’s laughable because I -- when I learned English, I realized how little English they knew, but they talked in some kind of language which I think was English, that I shouldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s217">That was one of their, you know, ways of -- that’s a -- that’s politics, money, children don’t have to know these things, you know.</span> <span id="s218">And I di -- It wasn’t somebody that I -- I don’t think I found it easy to confide in my parents.</span> <span id="s219">I -- Actually, I never really did, not to the day they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did they speak Yiddish at home as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No, no Yiddish, no, cause they were both born in Berlin, and they -- no Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Do you have any idea how they had learned English, whatever English they’d learned by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Well, I know that th -- a-actually they sent me for -- it wasn’t very long, nor successful, but they send me for some English lessons, in Berlin, while I was still there, and maybe they had taken some lessons, but I know they had these books, which I have to this day, I took it from my mother’s house, she took it with her when we left, and it’s called towsenwater English, and it’s got like little pamphlets in a holder, and it’s like, you know, when you go to another country, those simple phrases, and maybe they -- but I can’t imagine that they just bought them, and were self taught, they probably took some lessons, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Would you say that your parents, either one or both, were very politically interested, or involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s226">Certainly not my mother.</span> <span id="s227">And I don’t think my father was either.</span> <span id="s228">I think my father was interested, you know, as far as the newspaper and radio is concerned, but not politically involved, but interested in what was going on, had to be.</span> <span id="s229">[inaudible] End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Anita Sockol.</span> <span id="s231">I was wondering if you would tell me more about your vacations with your family, also perhaps your visits to camp, as a young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Those were nice memories.</span> <span id="s233">I remember going to a resort called Shpindlermueller, which is in Czechoslovakia, with my parents, and I -- and I liked that very much, and I think I had kids to play with there, and beautiful scenery, and they also sent me to some camp, I don’t reme -- maybe it was in -- in the Hartz, A -- H-a-r-t-z, or z, I’m not even su -- it’s some kind of mountain range, I’m not sure where it was, but it was a children’s camp.</span> <span id="s234">And I remember one time, this was a fond memory of my father and myself, which was that one winter afternoon or something, I came into my parent’s bedroom, and they had a surprise for me, and what was the surprise?</span> <span id="s235">That my fa-father was taking me to -- with th -- just he and I were going away in the winter, to a -- he was going to go skiing or something, and he was leaving me at a camp.</span> <span id="s236">They had winter camps, because in Germany, vacations are different than here.</span> <span id="s237">We didn’t have a summer vacation from, you know, all of June, July and August.</span> <span id="s238">They were shorter, but the winter vacations were longer, so you had a winter camp.</span> <span id="s239">I don’t know how much I enjoyed that camp, while learning how to ski, not so much, but I was thrilled to go away with him, and I remember an incident, we were very cold, we got off a train or something, on the way to this camp, and we were on a -- like a toboggan with some guy, you know, going through the snow, and it was -- it was great, and I was freezing, and he got some brandy or something, and he gave me a little sip of this to warm me up, and it was just like -- it was thrilling, that’s how I remem -- remember it.</span> <span id="s240">And then, I guess, eventually he came and picked me up, and maybe it was a week or something, it’s -- I -- I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s241">A week, 10 days, in this children’s camp, in the snow, in the winter.</span> <span id="s242">But it was -- I just felt very privileged to be alone with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Do you have an idea of how old you were at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I would say about eight, I imagine.</span> <span id="s245">Didn’t seem to have anything to do with Nazis, or with something that you could do, and all these things were -- were possible, you know, a -- it’s -- I -- I -- I imagine I’m -- would have been that age, I don’t think they would have sent me away much younger than that, though it couldn’t have been too much older, because by 10 -- by 10 years old, we were leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Did you know of any of the economic hard times in the early 30’s, taking place in Berlin and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">You mean the -- just the economic hard time -- my father -- they were -- in the 20’s if -- from what I remember my father saying, of course, I didn’t really know it was -- but he used to talk about them all the time.</span> <span id="s249">He’d always tell -- he said, you don’t know, he said, what in -- oh, maybe he told it to us -- told it to me here, when I was a youngster, that you have no idea what real inflation is like.</span> <span id="s250">He said, “We had baskets full of money,” and I would picture this.</span> <span id="s251">And he really meant it literally, like a large basket full of money, that was like toilet paper, it was like devalued maybe, you know, monthly, or whatever.</span> <span id="s252">And it took like a -- a shopping bag full to buy a loaf of bread, he says, “That’s what real inflation was like,” that the money was worth -- and he s -- and when I say that some sandwich or something was a little skimpy, he said -- he would always say, “You don’t know what it was like.</span> <span id="s253">When I was a boy, we would get a slice of bread, with butter on it, and there would be a like a smoked piece of salami, or something, and one thin slice, and we’d move it around for the flavor, from one end to the other.”</span> <span id="s254">Those were the little things, I remember he’d tell me these things.</span> <span id="s255">But this was like in general, I’d -- I did not experience any poverty, and that was really, I guess, before.</span> <span id="s256">But of course, that -- that period of time really led to Hitler, we all know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So it seems that while your father was still working, your family’s financial situation was stable?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Seems that way to me.</span> <span id="s259">It seems to me that in that respect, that my father definitely was -- not only seems, but you know, I’m -- I’m here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s260">We’ll always be grateful to him that he was very farsighted.</span> <span id="s261">As I’ve said before, he was sort of secretive about money and this and that, but it seems to me that he must have been kind of sophisticated about money and -- and maybe had some money in -- in Holland, or maybe in America, or -- I don’t know ho-how that was done, it was never told to me, even later on, when I used to ask, but in some way, that we could manage to be self sufficient, and get out without another person really vouching for us.</span> <span id="s262">It’s -- You know, it was no such thing as welfare, nor would we have dreamt of such a thing, but -- to get into the country, but we were very, very, very lucky, because as I read and see things at Ellis Island, reading history and how a few, you know, percentage-wise, how few Jews really were able to get out and come here, and be accepted in the United States the way we were, and I read that it was -- I don’t want to minimize the number, I forget, was it total 200,000 or something?</span> <span id="s263">It was a very small number.</span> <span id="s264">Or maybe less, I don’t know what that fi -- correct figure was, but I feel very, very, very fortunate and that [indecipherable] in to this history in words that I can’t even express.</span> <span id="s265">As I get older, I think about it more and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Were you aware, as a growing child, of the changes once the Nazis came to power?</span> <span id="s267">So there’s 1933, of course, as a pivotal point in time, when Hitler comes to power, and then, just to go forward for a moment, I know that you remained with your family in Berlin, until 1938.</span> <span id="s268">So, during that five year period, approximately, what would you say you noticed, if anything, as changing, either for your own freedoms, your parents freedoms, for other Jews.</span> <span id="s269">What other changes -- you know, did you notice?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, I guess I noticed I -- as I said that, it was almost you know, that when you see in a movie, nowadays with that green smoke, you know, when they tried to make something like the creeping crud, you know, it’s something that you just felt, not to make waves, to -- don’t draw attention to yourself.</span> <span id="s271">You see the Nazis walking around.</span> <span id="s272">The -- Then there was the issue about -- that I knew that my favorite, Lotte, had to leave, and no more maids.</span> <span id="s273">But as I said, my parents were secretive, trying to keep that from me, I th -- and my mother became very, very nervous and depressed, and I think she had what we would really call, in layman’s terms, a nervous breakdown, before -- she did not want to leave Berlin.</span> <span id="s274">She really didn’t want to leave, and then she -- there was a period there when my father left -- he left for Holland, because that was -- I guess it was beginning of ’38.</span> <span id="s275">I don’t know how long he was gone, when he had to leave his business.</span> <span id="s276">I don’t think he sold it, he split up with his partner, he had a partner.</span> <span id="s277">Plachte and Solomon was the name of the firm, and could no longer do business, and he left for Holland.</span> <span id="s278">And my mother sent me to some -- I was on the outskirts of Berlin, at some friends of her’s home, with other girls in some room, and I -- I lived there for awhile.</span> <span id="s279">Oh, and right before that, I had my appendix taken out, and to this day, I don’t know if it was really necessary, or if I -- it was one of those hysterical things, that I drew attention to myself, that I said I needed it, I -- that I had pain.</span> <span id="s280">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s281">But I did have it taken out, and I had to -- in those days you stayed in the hospital for a week, you know, with the sandbags on the -- on the incision.</span> <span id="s282">And then I went to those -- this house, somebody else’s apartment, it was sort of out in the suburbs of Berlin, while my mother, I guess, did something or other with the apartment, but I had to be away, and -- and then eventually, she and I left to go to join my father, hopefully, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Did you hear anything about things like the boycott in 1933, maybe later, since you were so young in 1933.</span> <span id="s284">Did you hear anything about the boycott against Jewish businesses in 1933, while you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: In 1933, I was only six years old.</span> <span id="s286">I’m just thinking back.</span> <span id="s287">I -- Not per se, and of course they didn’t -- in -- in Berlin, I -- I have the impression, maybe incorrectly, but I think that things in a quote unquote, sophisticated urban center like Berlin, that things came more slowly to Berlin, as far as, you know, real trouble and prejudice, it -- it came more slowly than in the little towns in -- in Bavaria, and other little places, where people emigrated much sooner, those that did, and felt it more.</span> <span id="s288">I think so.</span> <span id="s289">So, I -- I’m not sure, but at the same time, my -- I would hear my father talking with my -- it -- it -- it’s -- it’s a ch -- a child -- from a child’s impression of -- that he was working on something, trying -- you know, leaving.</span> <span id="s290">This was not done overnight, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s291">One da -- you know, I -- I -- we left just like that, but I’m sure this was planned in some way, and secretively.</span> <span id="s292">And the children in the school, in the classes, they would just sort of disappear.</span> <span id="s293">One would -- You know, this -- it wasn’t something that was talked about.</span> <span id="s294">They were just, those that could, left, and I think it was understood in the school, you know, one day would be one, one way would be another, and then you found out they went to Argentina, or this one went to Shanghai or wherever, Australia.</span> <span id="s295">Or maybe I found that out afterwards, I don’t -- I’m not sure myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you ever encounter any Hitler youth?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes, I do remember them, and I wanted -- funny little things that come to your mind, I wanted long hair.</span> <span id="s298">I wanted my hair in braids, just like all those ger -- little German girls, and my mother wouldn’t let me, because the Hitler youth girls had their hair in -- in braids, and what they called uffenshawkern, which means monkey swings, which is if you take a braid, long braid, and then you make it -- you double it and make a loop, and then they had bows, you know, and kind of cute, and I admired it, but she would never let me have my hair long, which bothered me, and I did see a lot of Hitler youth, young boys and girls.</span> <span id="s299">I remember their outfits with the -- with the kerchief and a leather knot, sort of like boy scouts, and yet not like boy scouts, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Do you remember asking about the Hitler youth, and -- and who were they, and what they did?</span> <span id="s301">Did you remember any discussions with friends or family?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Now that you mention it -- you have such interesting questions, but I -- I think I did.</span> <span id="s303">But, I think I was told again, in -- in that secret way, like -- like you know, somebody say, it’s not for you, don’t ask, don’t -- li -- it was something bad, but I don’t think they went into detail, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s304">Don’t remember any specific answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Although, what you were just describing about the braids, and that you wanted braids --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: -- like that, do you think that you -- do you think that your mother actually told you, you can’t have these braids because they are Hitler you --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: -- I mean, did she connect the braids with Hitler youth?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes, I think she did, I think she did, and she had my hair shingled in the back, just the way I always hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So as you were growing a little bit older as a child, were you aware of any official growing restrictions on Jew’s freedoms?</span> <span id="s312">The Nuremberg laws in ’35, and any other restrictions?</span> <span id="s313">I realize that you were at a Jewish school, but of course some -- some people were not allowed to go to swimming pools, you know, certain things that may have affected you if you were not, perhaps, in a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: I think they ch -- my parents must have tried to circumvent that, you know, that if you couldn’t go to a pool, then we went out to Vunzi, or -- or for some -- there were a lot of lakes and -- and things, outside of Berlin.</span> <span id="s315">It’s a huge city, you know, and it’s surroundings.</span> <span id="s316">Remember all these outings, and going to rowboats and stuff with my father, and I have pictures of myself in -- name comes to mind, and that -- one of the pictures that I just gave you, in a place called Pinz, but that was a resort, yeah, you know in bay -- I don’t have the f -- I -- except for those, what happened later on with the yellow benches, in -- in that -- by Rushanplatz, and it was not safe to play there any more, and that you had to pay to sit down, or something, that somehow was, for my mother, you know, i-it was like the end, like something was really happening, but they did shield me from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Can you describe more what you remember from that time period, with respect to the benches?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Ah, it’s -- this is before you had to wear a star, that happened later, but the benches -- and there were benches in the park that were painted yellow, for Jews to sit on, and it was like, you know, when, from out of nowhere, you know, now in retrospect it may not seem so terrible, but if you imagine it, you know, it was like a noose tightening, it just seemed incredible, you know, and -- and who is going to sit on those benches?</span> <span id="s319">And I -- I do remember that, and that must have been shortly -- I’m sure there were other things happening at the time, oth-other restrictions, but I don’t remember what they were.</span> <span id="s320">I ju -- I just can’t think of it, but it -- it just felt very uncomfortable, you know, every day.</span> <span id="s321">And my cousins, I didn’t see them -- my cousin, rather, just one, because my other cousins lived elsewhere, lived in different cities, Kreenesbergen.</span> <span id="s322">But the one that I mentioned, my father’s brother’s -- the Plachtes, she had problems in her school, too, but I don’t remember what they really were.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Do you remember sitting on one of those benches yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No.</span> <span id="s325">I think that m-my -- my mother didn’t allow it, we wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And was there a fee associated with those who would sit on those benches?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I don’t think so, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: You told me a little bit about friends that you remember, and I’m wondering, as you were getting a little bit older now, and before you left Berlin, if you remember any other friendships from that time period, or maybe you’ve already told me of the friends you remember the most, but from your sort of seven year old, eight year old, nine year old period.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: The people that I remember were mainly in that class, they were all girls, because it was -- I guess it was all girl’s classes, boys must have been in a different class, and if I had that picture that I have of -- several picture -- I’d -- I don’t think they’re here, I think I have them at home, I can name those girls quite well.</span> <span id="s330">And what -- what did you ask me, about --</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Just wondering if there were any other friend-friendships that you remember from this time frame, of being around seven year old, you know, seven, eight, nine years old in Berlin, or maybe you already covered that before, when I asked about friends before.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, you know, I gave the Holocaust Museum my autograph album, and in there you can see what they wrote, you know, and in those days it was not done like here, it was really something.</span> <span id="s333">When you gave somebody an autograph album, they took it home, they wrote very carefully, they drew little pictures, or -- or put on decals, and as you can see, it’s really quite interesting, and they didn’t take it lightly, not scribbled in, as you can see the contrast, you’ll see fa -- I have some from junior high school in New York, and you just scribbled whatever.</span> <span id="s334">I wish you -- I wish you luck, I wish you that, da-da da-da, and one 15, and just went on, you know, from public school to junior high school.</span> <span id="s335">No gus -- A-And you could -- Some of them sort of wished me well, and when you read the poems in German, you realize that they were -- it was sort of like the end of something, like they were -- we were going to part, you say, well, we’re just little girls, it wasn’t like we were going on to high school, or something.</span> <span id="s336">It was like as if we were going to part.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What’s the first time you remember your parents talking to you about the possibility of leaving your home, leaving Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Again, an interesting question.</span> <span id="s339">I really don’t remember, yi -- they were, again, not the kind of parents that would discuss anything with me, and I just -- and I never really questioned it, even in my -- until my young adulthood.</span> <span id="s340">You know, they were what they were, and I had to do what they said, and I was not -- my opinion was not considered, or -- it was like a fait accompli.</span> <span id="s341">And, but I think by the time I went where my mother send me, to that home that seems so blurry in my mind, with these other girls who lived there, I know somebody a -- I guess she was unraveling her apartment situation, or selling furniture, or -- I don’t know what she was doing while I was away in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s342">That’s when I realized -- and also at -- at the same time, I was recovering from that appendix surgery, which was quite something the way they -- old-fashioned way that they did it in those days.</span> <span id="s343">That’s when I realized that things were really changing, that’s what I seem to remember.</span> <span id="s344">And then she came and got me, but I don’t remember any real discussions that we were -- nor did -- let me say at this point, that they never expected to go anywhere but to Holland.</span> <span id="s345">That was the end of the journey, hopefully that we were going to get there, cause that’s where my father was, they had no intention of going to America, or anywhere else.</span> <span id="s346">That seemed far away enough, which sounds crazy today, but not then.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: I’m wondering as you grew up in Berlin, did you ever get in trouble with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I’m sure that I did.</span> <span id="s349">I’m sure that I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s350">It didn’t take much, my father had quite a temper, and my mother would often say, “Ludwich dus kins,” [indecipherable], cause he had quite a temper and he would smack me and whatnot, yeah, and my mother would try to shield -- shield me from him, you know, cause he was -- didn’t -- he had a short fuse.</span> <span id="s351">He was a good man, but not cut out for raising a very young child.</span> <span id="s352">He was already very set in his ways, you know, and very German.</span> <span id="s353">I had a parak -- I was very lonely that I -- I w -- I said that before, but I wanted a sister, or a brother, or a dog, or a cat, in that order.</span> <span id="s354">And I used to have recurring -- recurrent dreams about that, very, very often, and I felt very -- I really wanted that desperately, one -- when I never got it -- didn’t get any of them.</span> <span id="s355">I never got a pet either, except for a parakeet, which thrilled me, and then one day he -- we let him out of the cage, and I don’t know what was wrong with this bird, I thought he flew around the room, but he s -- flew into the walls until he dropped dead, and I -- it was very traumatic for me, it really was, cause that little parakeet -- and that was the end of my pets.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Did you ever ask your mother or father for a sibling?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s358">But my mother always told me, I don’t know if she told me this then -- no, probably not, I was too young, but later, that, she said, “Well, in Hitler time this is -- it was fashionable, everybody -- everybody just had one child, cause you never knew what was going to happen.”</span> <span id="s359">That’s wh -- I guess she told me that later on.</span> <span id="s360">And then I found out much later on, which made me very angry, that she’d had an abortion after me, and she knew it was a -- a male child, and -- but by that time, I didn’t care, you know, any more.</span> <span id="s361">Maybe I was married by then, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s362">But she always used to tell me -- and indeed, a lot of the kids that I knew, they were single ch-children.</span> <span id="s363">Not all, but a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Do you have recollection of the 1936 Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s366">I do remember that.</span> <span id="s367">I remember the hoopla, and I am tempted to say I saw it on television, but of course that wasn’t true.</span> <span id="s368">But I do remember it, now how do I remember it?</span> <span id="s369">I don’t know, but I do remember it, and I remember getting one of those Olympic pins.</span> <span id="s370">I was very proud of that, you know, with the Olympic circles, and -- and I -- I remember it, maybe it was in the newspaper or magazines.</span> <span id="s371">Surely it was, it must have been a very big thing in Berlin.</span> <span id="s372">And I even seem to remember some -- I don’t know, was it then or was it later, it’s hard -- something about, you know, what turned out to be Jesse Owens and Hitler’s disappointment that he won, you know, a bl -- a Black man, cause I remember that you rarely saw one, I -- there were, once in a blue moon, on the street in Berlin, you would see a -- a Black person, and you’d say, “Ah, a nigger.”</span> <span id="s373">It was like seeing somebody with two heads, it was just -- you just didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s374">But I do remember the Olympics and the -- everything that -- the excitement that it was -- you know, that involved in it, probably banners, and who knows what.</span> <span id="s375">I can’t say I went there, but I do remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So most of your recollections would be positive, if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: -- for instance, didn’t know about what may have been happening with Jewish athletes, with African-American athletes, you had mostly positive associations of the Olympics at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I think so, yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you know anything about the anschluss in March of ’38, which I realize is very soon to when you would up leaving Berlin, correct?</span> <span id="s381">Did you leave in April of ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: From Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Left in April of ’38, for Holland.</span> <span id="s385">Was the anschluss at that point, or was it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: March of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: March of ’38.</span> <span id="s388">Yeah, I -- I do remember that things got really, really bad, you know, that like a no-noose tightening, and that we were -- we had to go, and that it seemed like the right thing to do, you know, as far as my mother was concerned, or whatever was happening there.</span> <span id="s389">And her speaking to her brother, something about her brother [indecipherable] and his wife.</span> <span id="s390">I didn’t see them very much.</span> <span id="s391">Now that I thi -- I don’t even know where they lived, did they live in Berlin?</span> <span id="s392">Heinrich Schindler, and my little cousin Margit.</span> <span id="s393">I never even mentioned her til now.</span> <span id="s394">Also one child, and my c -- the other cousin, one child.</span> <span id="s395">And my Aunt Kate, one child, my cousin Ernest, who died recently in -- in Manchester, England.</span> <span id="s396">And who else?</span> <span id="s397">My cousin in Israel, one child, MaryAnn from my mother’s sister Ann -- Anna.</span> <span id="s398">There were -- In other words, there were three girls and one boy.</span> <span id="s399">Heinrich, my mother Margaret, her sister Kate, who went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s400">Her sister Anna, who managed to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s401">And each one of them had one child, so maybe that’s -- I accepted this one child situation maybe because of them, but where did Margit live?</span> <span id="s402">I know that -- that they didn’t make it, and I am going to look it up, either today, or soon, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s403">But my mother was concerned about him, was he ill, he had a nervous breakdown or something, all at that time when we were leaving.</span> <span id="s404">But you know, I was 10, and they didn’t talk to me, so that’s why it’s difficult, besides the memory, of course.</span> <span id="s405">But they really didn’t discuss these things with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did you have any favorite hobbies or activities as a child in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Well, I loved going to the movies, which of course wasn’t very often, but love it, I love it to this day.</span> <span id="s408">And I was absolutely crazy about Shirley Temple.</span> <span id="s409">She seemed to personify everything glamorous, and -- you know, the way people felt about America and Hollywood, and I had, not a Shirley Temple doll, but I got those -- I guess they were all made for -- for export, like a paper dolls, and then you cut them out, and put the clothes on -- on the -- and I played with it for hours.</span> <span id="s410">And then of course, what I had, the way ba -- the way kids here have baseball cards, this was my prize possession, they were actual black and white photographs of Shirley Temple in these different movies that she was in, which came in sets like baseball cards, and I bought them, and I have a -- and I had a photograph album of her, and also I collected another -- it was a young Austrian movie star, her name was Trowdel Stark.</span> <span id="s411">And I have this album, I took it with me, I have it to this day, and I probably -- probably nobody else would have it.</span> <span id="s412">I should write Shirley Temple Black and tell her about her album.</span> <span id="s413">And once in awhile, when I see these movies on TV, for instance when she’s wearing a -- when she was seven or eight, whatever, and wearing a satin pajama with appliqued bunnies on it, and I’ll look at her in this scene, I say, “Oh, my God, I’ve seen this picture, this photograph of her in that particular outfit so many times, leafing through my album.</span> <span id="s414">And you’re not getting that album.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did your family identify as being German as well as Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I would say so, yes, I would say so.</span> <span id="s417">It didn’t seem at the time that there was anything wrong with it.</span> <span id="s418">My father fought in World War One.</span> <span id="s419">He fought in the Austrian army, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Anita Sockol.</span> <span id="s422">Would you continue telling me about your family identifying as Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, I -- I really, you know, it’s -- I’m sort of embarrassed to talk about it, because it isn’t very nice, but it’s the truth, it’s the way mo -- many Germans felt.</span> <span id="s424">I know I have this feeling, from my father especially, that he -- you could almost say it’s almost like an anti-Semitic feeling about Jews from eastern Europe, you know, with payess, and with, you know, that kind of clothing, and all the other accoutrements, I had that feeling, carrying it over to America, that he felt like he was a different kind of Jew, very secular.</span> <span id="s425">And didn’t really -- And s-spoke no Yiddish, I don’t think they were brought up with that.</span> <span id="s426">We ate -- my mother’s cooking was not particularly wonderful, not everybody’s mother is a good cook, or a great housekeeper.</span> <span id="s427">But when we came here, and I learned, you know, about all these Jewish dishes, I was not used to them because I never grew -- I never grew up with them -- with these things from eastern Europe like latkas and chopped liver and kasha varnishkas, and -- and -- or anything that was -- you know, that people make, that when they’re kosher, it was very strange to me.</span> <span id="s428">And so I would say that that -- maybe that’s also why I don’t remember any -- I don’t remember any seders, per se, in my house.</span> <span id="s429">When we went to seders, they were in New York, in the early days, people that they met.</span> <span id="s430">Now, we were refugees, and we were at other people’s houses, but it’s not something that we had.</span> <span id="s431">And yet, we did go to synagogue somewhere.</span> <span id="s432">I -- It’s not clear.</span> <span id="s433">I think that’s something I would remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Did your family observe Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No, definitely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Will you tell me when you learned that your father had to stop working, and what you learned about that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: He -- He could no longer run his business, you know, it -- he was self-employed, and I remember something about his breaking up with his partner, maybe the partner was leaving, or maybe he s -- was still able to buy him out, or sell it, or leave it.</span> <span id="s438">It’s not clear, but I know that he had to leave that business, and I don’t know if, in 1938, he c -- he could sell the business for any kind of -- you know, that had any value, or he just had to walk away from it.</span> <span id="s439">This, again, was not something that they told me.</span> <span id="s440">And same with the apartment, you know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s441">No one ever came to look at it, or to rent it, or you know, and that we would leave the way you would normally do now, if -- it wasn’t that kind of leaving.</span> <span id="s442">I think we just left it, that’s what people did.</span> <span id="s443">And my mother had a nervous breakdown over her new dining room set, I remember that she did not want to leave her dining room set behind.</span> <span id="s444">We just took some things, you know, that were -- that seemed -- that’s how I ended up with these pictures that I have in my autograph album, and my Shirley Temple album, cause those little things were important to me.</span> <span id="s445">But, we did not move with -- with furniture, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Do you remember the process of packing?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No.</span> <span id="s448">I think that’s when I was in this other home, don’t remember the process of packing, and I was just thinking about it before you asked me, but you know, they’re perfectly logical questions, but for some reason, I don’t remember any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: I read from your telephone interview summary, something about you seeing an image of Hitler in, I believe your superintendent, the building superintendent’s home.</span> <span id="s450">Can you tell me about that incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes, I do remember that, cause that was very scary to me.</span> <span id="s452">For some reason, I used to go to -- I was friendly with the superintendent of the building -- with the wife of the superintendent, I don’t remember him at all, but I do remember her, and I remember her name.</span> <span id="s453">She was a -- I guess a middle aged woman, with grown sons.</span> <span id="s454">I think she had three children.</span> <span id="s455">She must have had a younger one that I played with, and for some reason, often after school, my mother wasn’t home, I would ring her bell, and I would have some cookies and milk, or some refreshment, and she was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s456">And one day, everything changed.</span> <span id="s457">I walked into her living room, and I se -- now I saw a huge picture of Hitler over her couch in her living room, and her older boys were in SS uniforms, and I knew what that meant, they were in black uniforms, and they were very tall.</span> <span id="s458">Course I was just a little kid, I mean they seemed like, you know, really men, scary young men in that dreaded SS uniform.</span> <span id="s459">And then my mother told me I can’t go there any more, and it impressed me somehow.</span> <span id="s460">I was really frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Mrs. Tetslaff.</span> <span id="s463">Yeah, strange how you remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Do you remember her being mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No, but -- not mean, but her attitude changed.</span> <span id="s466">Colder.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to any of your friends before you left Berlin?</span> <span id="s468">Did you have that opportunity to do so?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Only those girls in that home.</span> <span id="s470">Was there any of my f -- any of my close friends there?</span> <span id="s471">I don’t know who those girls were, sleeping in a room with three or four girls, I don’t -- I just -- it’s all so weird.</span> <span id="s472">And I felt very strange, I knew that something was very wrong, and -- and about to change, but really I -- I do remember saying goodbye to the Lerventhals, Hilda Lerventhal in some way, or maybe they left first, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s473">I-It’s a feeling that is hard to explain, because you don’t -- it’s all in retrospect, and you -- just things were changing, but it’s -- it’s not like in the movies, you know, that you say goodbye, and you hug each other, and -- because nobody really knew what was going to happen next, or where they were really going, or for how long, cause you didn’t know what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So, when did you leave Berlin for the outskirts, where you were staying in this home?</span> <span id="s475">When was that, and how long do you think you were there?</span> <span id="s476">What -- What are the memories that you have of being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I remember being there, I would say about a month, something like that.</span> <span id="s478">And also I remember that that appendix surgery was -- it was not a good time, it was er -- already dangerous for me to ha -- you know, have a doctor operate on me.</span> <span id="s479">My mother was not happy with this whole thing, and I would say it all must have been at the beginning of 1938, somewhere between the beginning of 1938, and then April, I think we left in April of 1938.</span> <span id="s480">Can really tell -- I have given you -- I just thought of it, pictures I -- I -- actually, you have the actual passports, and you could check in the passport when that really was, if my memory is incorrect by the dates that they put in there.</span> <span id="s481">And of course that was the other thing about the passports, that we had a s -- a statenloss passports, stateless, no more German.</span> <span id="s482">So there was another thing, I do remember my mother telling me, and I also have my own passport.</span> <span id="s483">One day I will find it in my apartment, and when I do, I will give it to the Holocaust Museum, but I’ve looked high and low, I can’t find it.</span> <span id="s484">But you have several, you have my father’s and one with a German passport, and one with the stateless.</span> <span id="s485">And I think my mother’s as well, if I’m not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So, by the time you left your home in Berlin, your father had already left for Holland.</span> <span id="s487">And what did you know about your father at this -- at this point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Nothing really, that we were going on this -- we’re going to meet him in Holland, and I have a feeling like it was going to be, once we got there, like it was going to be pleasant.</span> <span id="s489">We were going to a resort that was ou -- on the outskirts of The Hague, called Tre-Treverningen.</span> <span id="s490">That’s how the Dutch pronounce it, I believe.</span> <span id="s491">And it was a -- a beach resort that was sort of -- Treverningen to The Hague, is like Atlantic City is to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s492">You know, nearby.</span> <span id="s493">And it had a pier, like an amusement pier, and a big beach, and we were living in a boarding -- we’re going to -- well, that’s when I got there, but the trip going, was -- was dangerous, that I do remember.</span> <span id="s494">Do you want me to tell you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Sure, and when -- when was that?</span> <span id="s496">So you met up with your mother for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: That was -- wi -- yeah.</span> <span id="s498">I met up with my mother for that.</span> <span id="s499">I guess I -- she took me back to Berlin, or you know, we left, you know, by train, and I guess we didn’t have very much with us.</span> <span id="s500">What could it have been?</span> <span id="s501">I mean, suitcases, can’t carry more.</span> <span id="s502">And we’re in the train, and she was very nervous about the border, and she told me not to talk, not to say anything, bec -- cause you know how they come in at a border, first you -- the Germans come in, and then the other country, in this case it was Dutch.</span> <span id="s503">And we were in a town called Bedtime first, and these people sort of hid us.</span> <span id="s504">We were there one or two nights.</span> <span id="s505">And it was a border town, and we stayed in -- in an attic, and we did not come down for meals or anything.</span> <span id="s506">They were very nice, I guess it was in Germany, and they -- they hid us, even in those days.</span> <span id="s507">And then -- I don’t know quite why -- why we couldn’t go directly to Berlin -- to Holland, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s508">And then we made a connecting train on another day, and that’s when these -- these German Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s509">There was a conductor, German, you know, regular conductor, but then the Nazis came in, looking at your passport, or officers of some sort, and my mother said, “Don’t say anything.”</span> <span id="s510">And I, of course -- she se -- he said, “How old are you?”</span> <span id="s511">And I said, “I’m -- I’m -- I’m 10, but my mother said I should say I’m nine,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s512">And my mother thought she would die, she was ready to kill me, cause any discrepancy could, you know, if -- I don’t know why I did that, or -- it was one way or the other, but it -- they let it slide, but I remember that, and I remember how I felt inside, that I knew I made a big mistake, but that’s kids.</span> <span id="s513">And then we did get there, and then my father met us.</span> <span id="s514">Where we were, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s515">Maybe went directly to that town, to -- or maybe it was in The Hague, and then got to it -- but we stayed in a boarding house until -- through the summer -- spring and summer of 1938, til we left for New York, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: The boarding house was in this resort?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s518">It was like i-in a house, you know in a -- a boarding house.</span> <span id="s519">The reason I say boarding house is what I remember is that we had these communal meals, and as a matter o -- there was an actor at -- there, at that boarding house, at -- I didn’t know it then, but I since then saw him the -- he was in many, many American musicals.</span> <span id="s520">His name was S.Z. Sakall, S-a-k-a-l-l, or something, and he was called Cuddles in a lot of movies.</span> <span id="s521">He was in movies, you know, in musicals with Betty Grable, and Don Ameche and played a -- the roly-poly, good-natured funny role in lots of movies, but he was emigrating, and we had these communal meals, you know, like in a boarding house, which I’ve never had before.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did you get the impression that other people there besides him were also planning to leave, planning to emigrate from there?</span> <span id="s523">Was this a place for people to gather who were trying to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s525">I didn’t really know what we were doing, again the secretiveness, the secrecy, I should say, until -- oh, I must say an asi -- a footnote, I saw -- everybody has bicycles in Holland, you know, and we saw the queen, Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, riding around on her bicycle, and -- very, very casual, not like England.</span> <span id="s526">One day, my father said that he was going to Rotterdam, to see if he’d get tickets to come to -- to go to New York, that he -- and the reason, I guess by that time they told me that much, that he could not -- he was under the impression that he could work there, or start a business, or something, but he could not.</span> <span id="s527">It wasn’t permitted.</span> <span id="s528">So, it would have been just a question of time until his money would run out, so he went to Rotterdam, he said he was going to Rotterdam to see if we get tickets to go to New York, that’s how it seemed.</span> <span id="s529">And if we could, we would, and if not, not.</span> <span id="s530">It seemed so casual, like if we can get theater tickets we’d go, and if we can’t, we can’t.</span> <span id="s531">And he came back a day or two later, and he had tickets to -- on -- on a ship called the Startendam, and we went.</span> <span id="s532">And when I’d ask him about this, you know, years later my daughters would always urge me, “Talk to Papa, talk to Papa.</span> <span id="s533">Ask him how this happened.”</span> <span id="s534">But he never wanted to talk about it, you know, he’d always say, “Ach,” you know, “stop, I don’t want to,” -- you know, he’d gesture with his hand, and he al -- he’d say, “Ach, you think it was easy?</span> <span id="s535">Ah, it wasn’t easy.”</span> <span id="s536">So I presume what he meant by that was bribes.</span> <span id="s537">What else could it have been, you know?</span> <span id="s538">But he must have had the foresight to have money or whatever, cause that’s the only way you got anywhere in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Was there any problem with you having the stateless passports, you and your parents, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, I guess they were good for something, in -- at that time, y-you have to remember, it changed like monthly, or less.</span> <span id="s541">You know, there were always new -- I’m sure they would have been worthless.</span> <span id="s542">I -- I mean in -- that was September.</span> <span id="s543">We arrived here in New York, in September -- on September 18th, 1938, and the Crystal Night was not even two months later.</span> <span id="s544">So, the timing was very, very fortuitous.</span> <span id="s545">And we were hearing things, we were hearing things, you know, reading things about, I guess the -- I -- I -- I -- well, not the anschluss, but Hitler going into the other countries, or maybe it was right after, because my father, very soon after we got here, the first thing that he did was to get -- send tickets to my Uncle Martin, and his wife and my cousin Ilsa, the ones in Berlin, for him to ge -- to -- to emigrate to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s546">For some reason or other, that was easier.</span> <span id="s547">Couldn’t get her to the United States, but that was possible, but they didn’t use them, they didn’t use them.</span> <span id="s548">And I have found out since, here at the museum, that unfortunately they were all killed in Auschwitz, the three of them.</span> <span id="s549">I sa -- I looked it up, and it was very -- it was very sad, and to -- to actually see it, you know, on paper.</span> <span id="s550">I never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What was the trip like to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: The trip, the way I remember it, was quite pleasant.</span> <span id="s553">I mean, it was a -- I guess a Dutch ship, and it was, you know, just on the cusp of something, they were -- it was a real -- it was a -- it -- it was like going on shi -- on a ship.</span> <span id="s554">It was not a refugee ship, we were going second class, which I realized not long a -- not long ago, when I went to Ellis Island, and I was listening with the headset to Tom Brokaw, I found out why I never went to Ellis Island, because we were -- I never knew, we just got off the ship when we got here, and cousins, you know, second cousins, whatever, were waiting for us here.</span> <span id="s555">But the reason was, if you weren’t in third class, you didn’t have to go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s556">That’s what he said, and -- but it was quite pleasant.</span> <span id="s557">I remember meeting this American family, with their children, who had gone to Europe on vacation, cause it was, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me because the mother, the father, they wanted their children to meet a little -- a real little German girl.</span> <span id="s558">And I remember they took me into the lounge of the ship, for a -- in-into the cocktail lounge in the afternoon, for a drink.</span> <span id="s559">And this drink turned out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned out to be Coca-Cola, which was something that I had never -- i-it’s a very, very strange flavor, if you’ve never ever had it, and I don’t like it to this day.</span> <span id="s560">But -- And then I -- My mother bought me -- I had it til not so long ago, a little sailor doll from that ship, with a -- with a little sailor hat, the way they had them, you know, a little white, like a little brechen is it?</span> <span id="s561">And the little black ribbon around it, with the name of the ship, and it was like a little stuffed doll, with velvet, and I lu -- I wanted it desperately, I wanted this doll, and they did get it for me, and I had it for years and years and years, you know, little sailor from -- as a souvenir.</span> <span id="s562">I do not ha -- remember this as an unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- it was like going -- sort of like on some kind of vacation.</span> <span id="s563">I mean, I didn’t know the difference, I’d never been on a ship before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn’t say primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- it seemed fine to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Did you know that you were moving to another country at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I must have, but I -- it’s -- for some reason, it has like no -- no memory, or no great meaning.</span> <span id="s566">I -- I -- I -- I just -- of course I must have known, I mean, we were going to -- but it had no -- I didn’t know what -- what to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What do you remember first seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: What I -- First seeing, I remember getting -- I don’t really recall s -- being o -- seeing the Statue of Liberty, like in the movies, I guess it’s all mixed up with a million documentaries that I’ve seen.</span> <span id="s569">But I do remember the pier, getting off the ship, and I guess they did have people coming onto the ship, you know, it wasn’t such -- you didn’t just get off.</span> <span id="s570">People who -- you know, health examiners, or whatever, you know, and -- were looking at your papers, it’s a whole process, and then eventually getting off on this huge pier in New York, and then getting into these relatives’ car.</span> <span id="s571">These relatives were my mother’s relatives, and -- who were -- the -- the woman was the sister of Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of the Boston Pops, which didn’t mean anything to me at the time.</span> <span id="s572">And I remember get -- driving from the pier to this -- wherever we stayed in that first apartment that they rented for us -- probably did, and I said something ab -- you know, I said, “Oh, these skyscrapers, they’re not so tall,” or something like that, I said, having expected -- “They don’t seem like anything so big.”</span> <span id="s573">I remember saying something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: In German?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: In German, of course, I didn’t speak a word of English, not a word.</span> <span id="s576">It was always just done.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Can you tell me the date on which you arrived to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes, that was a day after my birthday, it was September 18th, 1938, I do remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How old did you turn that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: 11 on that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Do you remember your birthday on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That must be when I got the sailor doll, I think, as a present.</span> <span id="s583">Yeah, my birthday was always you know, to me, a big deal.</span> <span id="s584">After all, I was an only child, and children like their birthdays, so I think that probably celebrated it in some manner on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: What do you remember about starting school in the United States, in New York City?</span> <span id="s586">Correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Mm, yes, I do remember -- I remember the s -- the school very well.</span> <span id="s588">Eventually, after a few years, we moved across the street from that school, but at -- the first apartment was, I remember the address, 650 West 172nd Street.</span> <span id="s589">That was off between Broadway and Fort Washington Avenue, and the public school, PS 173 was on the corner of Fort Washington Avenue and 173rd Street, so I just had to walk dow -- you know, two blocks, one down and one across.</span> <span id="s590">I remember an interview, vaguely.</span> <span id="s591">My father taking me to school, and they telling me, whoever, maybe it was the principal, that -- what grade they were putting me into.</span> <span id="s592">They put me into four A.</span> <span id="s593">In those days the semesters were split up, A and B, ha-half a year, you know, not like fourth grade, A and B.</span> <span id="s594">So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, four A, which was five sem -- five semesters less than what I should have been in, two and a half years.</span> <span id="s595">And they said that when I would learn English, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true.</span> <span id="s596">And I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these young kids.</span> <span id="s597">Again, it’s -- it’s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I was not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn’t speak any English, and also, I don’t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to, because there were other little German girls or boys in the class.</span> <span id="s598">It was just me.</span> <span id="s599">So I guess they came later, or at other times.</span> <span id="s600">And eventually I did become a very good student, and it was only because of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went to summer school somewhere in -- you know, before finishing public school, that I made up at least a year or two, and then I -- then in junior high school, I was put in what they called RA, it was called rapid advance classes, you know, for kids who were doing well, and made it two years out of three, or something like that.</span> <span id="s601">But in the end, after high school, graduating high school, I just a pi -- I came out just about right, so if I hadn’t been, I’d be going to school til I was -- the end of my 18th year, I think.</span> <span id="s602">But school, I remember my f -- early on, I had to -- I came home with a poem, which I had to learn by heart.</span> <span id="s603">And my father, as I told you, was -- didn’t have much patience, and I just couldn’t get it into my head, I couldn’t seem to grasp it, the engli -- an-and he smacked me, you know, for again not getting it right, and it turned out to be “The Star Spangled Banner,” that’s what that poem was.</span> <span id="s604">I didn’t enjoy school ats -- at first, but the kids were -- I -- I guess they were all -- all right.</span> <span id="s605">I -- I don’t remember, I don’t remember them being particularly -- I felt isolated, but I don’t remember being, you know, taunted, or -- particularly one way or another, particularly cruel, or -- but isolated.</span> <span id="s606">And early on, going to the -- as a school outing, going to the 1939 World’s Fair, that was very thrilling.</span> <span id="s607">I re -- I remember doing that, and enjoyable.</span> <span id="s608">And I think I only did it once after that, on my own with family or somebody else.</span> <span id="s609">But once I got the language, then -- and also I was becoming a teenager, I became a much happier child, and really sort of found myself, which wasn't easy with my parents and these circumstances, you know, little apartment and I was -- I felt -- I never had a room of my own, I slept in the living room.</span> <span id="s610">My parents never had a bedroom again, ever.</span> <span id="s611">The other room was -- was had always two rooms, and it was sort of like a -- with two couches in it, each -- they slept separately, sort of like a studio, like you sometimes get in a motel, L-shaped, one couch here, one couch there.</span> <span id="s612">In that apartment as well as the next apartment, as well as their last apartment, long after I was married.</span> <span id="s613">And I slept in the living room, I was -- this is sort of personal, has -- I don’t know, much to do with anything on this subject, but I was always -- well, I guess sort of ashamed of the way we lived, and also, you know, I didn’t -- the friends that I eventually made, their apartments seemed much nicer, and they had sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s614">It was not all that happy at home, and my mother was working right from the beginning here.</span> <span id="s615">My father, on the other hand, wasn’t.</span> <span id="s616">He -- I guess he came with a little too much money, that he didn’t need to be forced into taking a job, or -- or getting -- or starting all over, or like most of their friends -- friend’s husbands did.</span> <span id="s617">Some of them were doctors, and they started off, you know, the way they do, doing I don’t know, working as -- I don’t know, in -- in -- learning how to s -- you know, their English, and taking medical exam -- and much more difficult things they -- but my father never really did, and my mother -- my mother worked in the -- no, that came later.</span> <span id="s618">She worked in people’s apartments, cleaning or something, it -- it -- I -- it’s not such a happy childhood.</span> <span id="s619">And she was not happy with my father’s being home, so she got up and did something, and eventually she worked in the garment center in New York, which she liked.</span> <span id="s620">She liked being out on her own, and working.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Did your father ever go back to work, eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Not in the way that I presume you mean.</span> <span id="s623">Never at a job where he had to be there nine to five, or answer to somebody.</span> <span id="s624">He did something with -- with fluorescent light bulbs, he sold them to -- to businesses or something, for their fixtures.</span> <span id="s625">It was never quite clear to me what he did.</span> <span id="s626">I think he mainly played with his stocks, and -- with his stocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Anita Sockol.</span> <span id="s629">If you’d like to continue telling me about your father, and his work in the New York area?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I think -- now that, often I think did come up, that he thought that he had enough money, and -- invested in stocks, that he could live on that, indefinitely, for the rest of his life.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t think he -- he counted on -- what did we have, depression, inflation, whatever it was, that it turned out not to be so.</span> <span id="s632">I thought he -- He thought he could live better, or maybe they were just ve-very frugal people, but they always lived very simply, I think, sort of below their means.</span> <span id="s633">And my mother was really never -- never really adjusted to America.</span> <span id="s634">She always dreamt of her life in Berlin, and how it was.</span> <span id="s635">She was never really, really happy here.</span> <span id="s636">Never really perfected her English, neither did my father, even though my father read the paper, and -- with a dictionary next to him, looking up every word that he didn’t know, he did that.</span> <span id="s637">But -- But n-neither one of them really became all that Americanized.</span> <span id="s638">They lived up in Washington Heights, we lived there all their lives, with the other so -- you know, so-called refugees.</span> <span id="s639">And they enjoyed that life, and everybody spoke German, and they had café and kuckin in each other’s house, and -- and other -- you know, and that was the -- but the other people, who came with less, most of them lived a much better life.</span> <span id="s640">They went to Florida, and they went here, and did this and does that.</span> <span id="s641">I always had the feeling that my parents never really -- never really became Americanized, and allowed themselves to live a really full life.</span> <span id="s642">Always like -- it’s something from that change of coming here in the way they did, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Was it a real change from how you lived in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I would say so, yeah.</span> <span id="s645">That’s i-it seems to me, even though I was a little kid, that it was a much -- I mean, my mother never had a cleaning lady.</span> <span id="s646">I mean, nor was the apartment all that f -- was she that fastidious.</span> <span id="s647">Didn’t care about those things.</span> <span id="s648">No, it was always very modest, and the way we ate, and -- and what she bought, and -- and the dinn -- it was always sort of cheap, which is something I had to learn to get over.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What language did you speak at home with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I guess German and English both, sort of mixed together.</span> <span id="s651">And then, of course, when I got older, o-other than the American friends that I had from the different schools, I also had f-friends, you know, at ca -- from wa -- one way or another, friends who also were emigr-emigra -- immigrants?</span> <span id="s652">And I knew that they spoke German, and we would -- used to -- we u -- whatever came to mind first, we’d sort of mix it up, because we knew that we understood each other.</span> <span id="s653">But now, I’ve sort of lost it, because I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Do yo -- Do you speak fluent -- fluently still?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I th -- I th -- Yo -- I could say I do, but I really don’t, because when I’m -- been, on occasion with people who speak perfect German, and -- intellectually, there are lots of words that I don’t know, and I guess never knew, because I left too young.</span> <span id="s656">Like when you read documents, you know, that you get, or from the [indecipherable] stuff, my prunci -- pronunciation is good, but a lot of words that I don’t know, and the sentences are so endless, you know, when you read that stuff, I forgot what the beginning was when you get to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Was it particularly challenging for you to learn English at that age, when you arrived to the United States?</span> <span id="s658">Do you remember special challenges, and how you went about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Another good question.</span> <span id="s660">Yeah, I was a little older than some, so it -- it was -- it was challenging, and I remember the penmanship, and the -- the script was something different, because -- never thought of that til just now, that the script in Germany that I learned, which was quite difficult, was different than the -- the way we write here.</span> <span id="s661">And -- But then they had penmanship classes, we all had to take penmanship.</span> <span id="s662">And it -- it took awhile.</span> <span id="s663">I think it -- it -- it wasn’t all that easy, and how I learned it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s664">But my parents were not for education.</span> <span id="s665">It was a difficult -- they were difficult.</span> <span id="s666">I wanted to learn how to play the piano, for instance, desperately.</span> <span id="s667">There was a period in my life, you know, like a window of time, and finally I mean, I nagged so -- so much that my mother did give me piano lessons, but I had to practice, and I practiced for awhile in the -- in the piano teacher’s house, which is ridiculous, I mean, how long can you keep that up?</span> <span id="s668">And I didn’t, and then after awhile -- but I loved doing it, and I lu -- but then I -- I lost interest because they wouldn’t let me.</span> <span id="s669">They were not, in that respect, not like Europeans, who are so much for education -- Jew -- I mean, European Jews.</span> <span id="s670">No, they fought me in college, and I just needed to learn a trade, something to -- to -- that I could make a living, or could support myself, if necessary, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Were you helped at all by a refugee organization when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: We must have been.</span> <span id="s673">I remember the word HIAS, in what respect, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s674">I know they exist today.</span> <span id="s675">We must have been, but -- and there was somebody who -- that my father knew here, some man who was not really a rela -- a f -- a relation, I -- but he -- who had to vouch for us, but didn’t have to put up any money, or however that was in those days.</span> <span id="s676">You know, you had to be sure in those days, that you would not become a burden to the U. S. government, and that was never an issue, but we lived very simply, frugal, and it was really -- was still the -- toward the end of the depression.</span> <span id="s677">Wasn’t really until World War Two that we got out of the depression.</span> <span id="s678">I remember penny candy, and eggs were a nickel a dozen, and you know, I ga -- I -- we -- we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: As you were adjusting, do you remember noticing many cultural differences being in the United States, being in the schools, meeting friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: I -- I -- I liked it, I know I liked it.</span> <span id="s681">I liked going to these other wa -- once I got acquainted enough with the cl-classmates to become friendly and be invited to their house, suf -- I liked doing that, and it somehow -- it was different.</span> <span id="s682">I liked the American way of doing things, it -- it seemed more casual, more lighthearted, more spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s683">People seemed generous with their milk and cookies, or candy, or whatever.</span> <span id="s684">I -- I -- It’s just a feeling that I ha -- that I have, you know, not specifics.</span> <span id="s685">And I do remember going -- [indecipherable] certain people that were friends of mine.</span> <span id="s686">Carol Shiff, and somebody named Edith Pearlmudder, something.</span> <span id="s687">This is early on, you know, it must have been 1938 - ’39 -- 1940.</span> <span id="s688">And some kids, you know, that -- but it -- it -- I began to really like it, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s689">My parents, I don’t know, but I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Were most of the students in your school Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s692">No, mixed.</span> <span id="s693">No, mixed.</span> <span id="s694">I mean, there were a lot of Jews living in Washington Heights, but they were mixed.</span> <span id="s695">I think there were a lot of Irish and Italian.</span> <span id="s696">No Blacks or Hispanic, that wasn’t -- that wa -- they -- you know, that was not an -- they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s697">But I -- I think it were -- they weren’t just Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: And do you remember having friends who are not Jewish then, as you progress through your years in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s700">I remember somebody named Barbara Krunendonk, and her father was a -- was a musician, and he played in that orchestra, was it Lawrence Welk, or some famous orchestra, that was famous at the time.</span> <span id="s701">I’m not sure it was Lawrence Welk.</span> <span id="s702">But somebody that -- that at the time was a very well known orchestra, and we were friends, and yeah, there were others.</span> <span id="s703">But there was a Y, a YMHA, where now is a Port Authority building, right at the George Washington Bridge, on the New York side of the George Washington Bridge, that became like my haunt.</span> <span id="s704">That’s where we hung out, so to speak, you know.</span> <span id="s705">Cause after all, I was already almost a teenager, you know, after I learned the language, and met a lot of -- so tha -- there were -- that was definitely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did you ever, yourself think, or did your parents ever think that you would return to Germany, or to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s708">I never -- I never thought of it, you know.</span> <span id="s709">My mother, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s710">I think she would have if she could have, but my father, no, he wouldn’t -- wouldn’t hear of it.</span> <span id="s711">He was perfectly happy here.</span> <span id="s712">And -- But she just never -- never got -- my mother was like a dreamer, you know, and she’d love opera, and she would buy herself records, and she loved, you know, travel, and she’d see a movie, and I’d say, “Why don’t you go on a trip, instead of seeing a movie?</span> <span id="s713">Why don’t you buy yourself a ticket to go to the opera, instead of listening to Mario Lanza,” or whatever, on the record.</span> <span id="s714">But she didn’t, as we say, fagin herself.</span> <span id="s715">Not that they couldn’t have, but that’s how they lived.</span> <span id="s716">She was like a [indecipherable] happy with her -- her record, scratchy record.</span> <span id="s717">You know, and -- and the furniture that she bought early on, I think she had it for the rest of her life, that when my mother died, I just liquidated that apartment with my daughters, in a day.</span> <span id="s718">I told the day care person, “Take what you want.”</span> <span id="s719">There was just nothing.</span> <span id="s720">But she never -- never really settled in, or bought herself things, or buy herself a fur coat, or like her friends did, go a lot to have her nails done, or something.</span> <span id="s721">You know, it just wasn’t -- not that she was an intellectual who -- su -- for some -- she felt like she wasn’t worthy, I think, of doing these things for herself.</span> <span id="s722">Talk about it, but didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Did you feel safe in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, I think I felt safe in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And how long do you think it took for you to no longer feel so isolated after first arriving, and perhaps even to feel as if you were an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I think -- I think it took -- took a few years.</span> <span id="s727">I think it took until I began to go to junior high school.</span> <span id="s728">Now, I -- I said they put me into four A, but it didn’t take until the end of six B, it wasn’t two years, I skipped somewhere.</span> <span id="s729">I told you I skipped five times, but I don’t know when all those five times were.</span> <span id="s730">One of them was in high school.</span> <span id="s731">So I would say it took -- I’d say at least a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: And when did you receive your U.S. citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Ha -- I have those papers at home.</span> <span id="s734">I’m not sure, because first -- it -- it was twice.</span> <span id="s735">Once I became a citizen through my parents, cause I was too young to be a citizen on my own, and I forgot how many years it took, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: I’m not sure, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s738">Was it five years, was it seven years?</span> <span id="s739">No, probably wasn’t.</span> <span id="s740">I don’t know how old I had to be, did I have to 21, or was it 18?</span> <span id="s741">But I had like two certi -- but I do have a certificate which I have at home.</span> <span id="s742">I don’t -- I don’t really remember, but I know it was a -- it was a thrill.</span> <span id="s743">I’m very proud of the certificate, and studied for the questions, and all that stuff, which were not difficult at the time, or maybe not for a kid who was learning history, wasn’t difficult.</span> <span id="s744">I think they’re much harder now.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So, as far as hearing news from abroad, from Germany, and from elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: How much do you remember hearing during those years, especially as you became a teenager, the beginning of course, too, and then as you got older, and became a teenager, perhaps more aware of events anywhere, but how much did you really hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I think we -- like everybody else, we weren’t really aware about the concentration camps, until much later.</span> <span id="s749">I don’t really know it -- but we did know about, like you said earlier, about the aschluss, and then very soon after we came here, you know, what happened in Holland, and Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and you know, as -- and France, and what was happening, and then the concern about my -- the relatives, and where they were.</span> <span id="s750">And somehow then, my mother did find out -- and of course she was in touch with her sister in Palestine, and she knew -- she found out, I as -- surely that she must have been involved with those organizations, because how did she find out that my Aunt Kate was in Theresienstadt, survived Theresienstadt, and somehow came to the United States, and she was just thrilled to have her sister here, because she was very close to that sister, as a child.</span> <span id="s751">They were closer in age than anybody else, and they were just closer.</span> <span id="s752">But it wasn’t to be for very long, because she died before I got married, and I got married in 1947, my first marriage, and she wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s753">But I do remember her coming, and she was a tough bird, and I would -- used to be very angry at her, because she was another one of those, like my father would, in Germany, go back to Germany, always afraid I’d have too much -- too much pleasure, like a birthday party, and go to the movies all in one, and no, no, no, no, and she was of that same -- she was tough, she was very smart, and was, I think, quite a figure, an important person in Theresienstadt, you know, like a -- a leader within the circles, whatever they did there, and a Bridge player, and so on and so forth, and I think she even had a romance there, which I wrote in the -- one of those guest books that they have, when I was there last year.</span> <span id="s754">It was -- I -- I met that man, they both survived, even though she was married to somebody that -- you know, not a happy marriage, she managed to fall in love there, which is sort -- sort of, you know, as an adult, life goes on, even those things happen there.</span> <span id="s755">But anyway, when she came, she -- I would be angry with her for not -- for being str-strict, you know, and -- and sort of siding with my father on issues, whatever they were, things that I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s756">It was not -- not easy for me as a -- the upbringing of my parents.</span> <span id="s757">I think that was one of the reasons I got married very early.</span> <span id="s758">The other was that my mother pushed me into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: How did -- What did you hear specifically of Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: What did I hear?</span> <span id="s761">Well, we must have heard about it, I mean, I -- I -- I really -- I don’t remember d -- I -- I really don’t remember, probably you know, I don’t want say something that’s incorrect, and say, oh we heard this and that, only to find out -- I mean this is something that’s easily checked through American newspapers.</span> <span id="s762">Did we hear about it at that time?</span> <span id="s763">Did we?</span> <span id="s764">Yes, we did?</span> <span id="s765">Well, if -- if it was so, then we -- then we did, and we were very upset.</span> <span id="s766">I just don’t know whether it was as it happened in the newspapers, or it came later.</span> <span id="s767">Well, maybe we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: And, did you get the sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Oh, I -- Yeah, you’re right, we did, because of my Uncle Martin who did not take my father’s -- he did not use those tickets that he sent him for Shanghai because he felt like he was going to be -- I used to say that, like he was -- sent him a ticket to go to the moon.</span> <span id="s770">I mean, he was a very provincial guy who, I don’t know, worked for the mu-municipality or had some kind of civil service type job or -- and if he lived in something that’s comparable to Brooklyn, and just go to Shanghai, when he’s never been out of Berlin, and you know, in a -- it was just -- he c -- he couldn’t seem -- you know, couldn’t get himself to do it, and he didn’t have much time to just get up and leave, and he didn’t, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Do you remember hearing from them -- from him, or your other family members --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: -- about Kristallnacht, or other incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I think that was -- that was soon at -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s775">I have no letters or anything among my memoirs, you know, and things that my parents have, or that they saved, that they were actual letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Did you have the impression, over the years of the -- of the war, that things were getting worse for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah, yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And as you were growing -- growing up, and of course by the end of the war, I -- I believe you’re about 18 years old at -- at that stage perhaps.</span> <span id="s779">Is that ga --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Well, you know what I really rememb -- as -- as a -- I became very Americanized, and I -- as I think about the war, I remember th -- I think about the war from an American girl’s point of view.</span> <span id="s781">I went out with -- my friend had a brother who was in the army, and he took me this -- my first date, my first play.</span> <span id="s782">Because he was in the army, he got tickets to see “Oklahoma!”</span> <span id="s783">, which was a play, and nobody could get tickets for anything, except G.I.’s, you know, and I was thrilled to go to the theater.</span> <span id="s784">But I thought through -- and -- and then you -- you got some -- the soldiers gave you their -- their -- whatever they are, insignias, the bar from a lieutenant, or -- and these were the -- and working for the -- what was it, AWVS, something, and do-doing things for the war effort.</span> <span id="s785">I remember, as a kid in the -- as a -- in junior high school, doing things after work, saving silver foil, the ration stamps.</span> <span id="s786">I -- I see it, myself, as like a little American girl, an-and seeing it through the eyes of American soldiers, and sailors, and Marines, and Air Force, and the songs and the tremendous patriotism that we all had.</span> <span id="s787">That’s what I think this generation doesn’t quite have that, it’s a -- and of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I mean, he was like a god to me at the time.</span> <span id="s788">Didn’t want to read the things that I read, you know, on Ellis Island and -- and not knowing about the -- the SS Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s789">Didn’t even know there was a German ship til I read your things from the Holocaust Mu -- cause Saint Louis, you know, you think it’s an American ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: When did you -- When did you learn of concentration camps, and the mass murder of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: I don’t know when I learned it.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">Again I have to -- I mean, I know that my aunt is like, you know, by that time I knew, because she came here, but I -- I -- I guess I knew it when everybody else knew it, whenever that was.</span> <span id="s794">I -- Certainly my parents were very interested to s -- an-and worried about their relatives not knowing what happened to my -- her brother, and th -- and the -- and the family, and I -- I -- if I’m -- I’m going to look it up when we conclude this interview, but -- so they -- whatever wa-was news on the radio, and in the paper, they kept up with, but when exactly -- I mean, I guess I learned it as everybody else learned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Did you meet many Holocaust survivors then, coming to America after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yes, yes I did.</span> <span id="s797">People came, I did meet people.</span> <span id="s798">I met -- meet people who were eventually friends, you know, through, because I have these -- s-some American friends, others that weren’t American, and I met people who had been in Auschwitz, I -- I was friends with Holocaust survivors who had been in concentration camps, cause I remember their tattoos, you know, on their arm.</span> <span id="s799">But I me -- I had a lot of fr -- I had a lot of friends who were from -- early on in my first marriage, met a lot of people who were -- they were really mixed friends, friends who were born in Germany, and others who were American.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did you ever experience anti-Semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I rememb -- Yes, I think I did.</span> <span id="s802">I -- When I finished junior high school -- was just telling this to a friend of mine the other day, cause my father was such a disciplinarian, that he insisted that I go to -- everybody was leaving for George Washington High School from this -- almost everybody, all my Jewish friends, yes, they were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s803">Somehow you just -- naturally you gravitate to them, you know?</span> <span id="s804">He insisted that I go to Washington Irving High School, which is a sort of high school that -- with an emphasis on needle trades, because he -- being that’s the business he was in, he wanted me to become a designer, or learn how to sew.</span> <span id="s805">He pushed it so that to this day I hate sewing.</span> <span id="s806">And then, at any rate, I -- under duress, I went to George Washing -- to Washington Irving High School.</span> <span id="s807">Had to take the train downtown, all my friends went to the other school.</span> <span id="s808">And one of the -- on the first days in the school, I saw that everybody was Italian, and I sort of felt I had to -- sort of -- I felt out of place, and one girl said to me, she says, “You want to hear a joke?”</span> <span id="s809">Said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s810">And she said, “What’s the fastest thing on two legs?”</span> <span id="s811">And I said, “I don’t know, what?”</span> <span id="s812">And she said, “A Jew passing a draft board.”</span> <span id="s813">When I heard that, I really put my foot down, I went home to my father, I didn’t want to be there in the first place.</span> <span id="s814">I said, “I am not staying in that school, I am not going to stay there.”</span> <span id="s815">And I insisted on being transferred to George Washington High School, which they did do, and then I was much happier, and I was a very -- was a good student, I was an arrister, and I sort of found myself.</span> <span id="s816">Actually in junior high school, I -- I did well, but then I, you know, found myself in my teenage years, but they were turbulent, I was never -- I had a lot, I think, to contend with as a teenager, more than, you know, had I been born here with parents who were, but that’s obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: When did you and your parents get contacted by the German government as part of reconciliation efforts?</span> <span id="s818">I believe that’s called vidogutmachen.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I cannot remember when that was, but I know f -- I know it was uf -- early on, when they began to do that, it wasn’t really I think the German government so much, as the Berlin government, because they were getting these checks, you know, so -- from the German government, for lost property, or -- my mother got something that was sort of like the equivalent of -- loosely speaking, like Social Security, because she could prove her -- she had her employment records or something, and taxes that were taken out, sounds strange, but it was based on that.</span> <span id="s820">And she di --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: You mean she had worked in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes, she did --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: -- as a -- as a young woman.</span> <span id="s825">Remember, she was 27 when she got married, and she worked, as a matter of fact, for my uncle.</span> <span id="s826">She worked in -- he manufactured hats in Kemnets, and when she lived it -- she worked there and somewhere else.</span> <span id="s827">Not a profession, but something, you know, sales.</span> <span id="s828">And so there was a connection between her and -- and the government, and they were contact -- I know they didn’t contact -- my parents didn’t contact them, because when they got this information -- also, it was around Washington Heights, everybody was -- knew about it, or people here and there were getting these invitations.</span> <span id="s829">But they did not want to go.</span> <span id="s830">And then we just sort of let that -- and I said, “Why don’t you,” you know, “why don’t you go?”</span> <span id="s831">“No, no, no,” my father said, “Don’t want to ever go back to Germany, no, not interested.”</span> <span id="s832">So we just dropped it.</span> <span id="s833">And then there were years in between, I presume it was like in the early 70’s or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: How did your mom feel?</span> <span id="s835">She had shown so much interest in -- in perhaps in staying in Germany at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: She -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s837">I guess she just -- he absolutely didn’t want to, and they never really went anywhere, or did anything.</span> <span id="s838">You know, going to Florida for a couple of weeks was -- that he wanted to do, and she hated it, because they did it year after year after year, again [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s839">But if she did want to go, it was sort of crushed, you know, that desire.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: How did you become more involved in either receiving things from Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Let me just add, yes, she did really want to go places, because she finally went to -- to Europe, I forgot about that, my mother, by herself.</span> <span id="s842">She went to Israel to visit her sister, she said she wanted to go.</span> <span id="s843">Her sister Anna.</span> <span id="s844">Kate had died in 1946, I guess, because I got married in ’47, and she was no longer alive, died of cancer here, recurrence.</span> <span id="s845">But, she went by herself, my father did not want to go anywhere, and she picked herself up, she went to Rome by herself, and she went to Israel by herself, and that was pretty cons -- for her, quite a feat, and she loved it, but that was, you know, the biggest trip.</span> <span id="s846">And she always used to talk about when her sister Anna, and her brother-in-law, who lived very well, very comfortably, took her and her mother, Frieda to Nice on the Riviera.</span> <span id="s847">Must have been in the early 30’s or something.</span> <span id="s848">No, I don’t know when it was.</span> <span id="s849">Was it after she was married?</span> <span id="s850">I don’t know, but how she loved that trip, and how glamorous and how wonderful it was, you know.</span> <span id="s851">So, she might -- she might have wanted to go, but never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Tell me about some of the items that you started to receive.</span> <span id="s853">I believe it’s books, I don’t know if there are other items from Berlin, from -- and who did you receive them from, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: From Berlin, yes I started to receive a lot of things.</span> <span id="s855">Some things were annual, some things were quarterly.</span> <span id="s856">Annual were calendars, very beautiful calendars, I -- I think I get those to this day, they’re still doing that.</span> <span id="s857">But they sent books, you know, Berlin 1979 - ’70 - ’80 - ’81, every year, and always relating to Jews, they were like soft cover books, very interesting, in German, with pictures, and I’d get something about a famous cartoonist, who had -- her name was Zille, Z-i-l-l-e, and -- who died at -- in the late 1920’s, and was very famous and it was very funny, to -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Anita Sockol.</span> <span id="s859">Would you like to continue talking about the items that you received from Berlin, through the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: And among these books, you know, that had -- we receive every year, they we -- in 1988, I believe it was, I got a book about the Jews of Berlin, and it went back from the 19th century, into the 20th century, up until 1939 or ’40, whenever, you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s861">And I leaf through this book, and I couldn’t believe it, there was a picture of me and my cla -- in my classroom, with me in it, my -- all the -- all my classmates from, I think, 1935.</span> <span id="s862">And when I saw that, I said, I’ve got to -- I said, “How did they got ahold of this picture?”</span> <span id="s863">Well, obviously, somebody else had the same class picture, I found that out subsequently, somebody who lived in England, and submitted it to them.</span> <span id="s864">At any rate, I -- I -- it -- it piqued my interest, and I now -- I thought I wanted to go to Berlin, and get this trip that my parents never took advantage of.</span> <span id="s865">So I got in touch, it’s a lengthy involvement, I won’t go into it.</span> <span id="s866">And we had a lot of corens -- correspondence back and forth.</span> <span id="s867">I told him about the picture, they were very interested in the picture, and I traced it, and said I could identify the g -- most of the girls to this day, which I did do, and then they published it in yet another publication that they had, a g -- like a newsletter, that went to all former Berliners, and I started receiving mail from all these people because they -- I -- it said something about Anita Sockol in New York, blah, blah, blah, and I started receiving them.</span> <span id="s868">And because of this -- so I had two things going on at the same time, it was very exciting really, receiving these letters, and also questions.</span> <span id="s869">Did I know somebody named Ilsa Plachte, and -- because that was a very good friend of mine, and where does she live?</span> <span id="s870">And I would call that person back, they lived in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span id="s871">I said, “That was my cousin, I heard that, you know, she died in Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s872">Other people wrote to me, they were -- th -- this woman just knew the name, and as I was busy writing and corresponding with these other people, I was also talking to this woman in Berlin, and sort of pushing it to get the trip.</span> <span id="s873">She said I was too young, if I wanted to come with my mother.</span> <span id="s874">And I said, “At this point, my mother couldn’t possibly travel.”</span> <span id="s875">And -- But because of it, I think they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s876">And I did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the spring.</span> <span id="s877">March, I believe it was, before the wall came down.</span> <span id="s878">And it was a very interesting trip, with many -- with wonderful things that they did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange feelings, everybody did, you know.</span> <span id="s879">And I have a cousin who lives -- second cousin who lived in Berlin at the time, and the free time that we had, he showed me the railroad tracks, you know, over a bridge, that’s where the Jews were shipped to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that looked like a closet, you know, you’d walk right by.</span> <span id="s880">And he said, “In there is an Orthodox shul,” which you’d -- you’d never think there was anything in there.</span> <span id="s881">And told me -- So, I had very mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s882">At night I couldn’t sleep from all the things that were -- that my -- my feelings were, you know, accosted with.</span> <span id="s883">And we met the mayor of Berlin, he talked to us, and there were cocktail parties.</span> <span id="s884">We met a senator, a woman senator, and they made these speeches, dear former citizens, and it was very strange.</span> <span id="s885">Very difficult to explain the -- can’t say love, but the -- some kind -- some kind of memories, and yet the -- the anti-German feeling that you -- that sort of rides over everything.</span> <span id="s886">It -- It was very strange, and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to wherever they lived.</span> <span id="s887">And there was a man who was [indecipherable] from this area, I think he was from Maryland, and he lived near where I lived, and we went to -- by train through eastern Berlin, to where I lived, and the address existed, but not the building, so they must have kept the address, but -- you know, but it was some modern, ugly building, cause of -- obviously that whole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: What is the address?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Tw -- Bamburger Street, 26, number 26, in Vilmasdorf, is the section, cause Berlin is very big, very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: How were your interactions with other Germans, non-Jewish Germans living in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Well, they were, of course, all hand picked people for this thing.</span> <span id="s892">They were younger, and very sensitive to the issues, you know, but I -- I realized that.</span> <span id="s893">And one -- I had a very interesting conversation on one of the days with one of the tour guides, when we went to the -- not the Reichstag, but the -- that stadium, the Olympic stadium where Hitler spoke and he showed us, you know, and I -- then I remembered it from, I guess newsreels.</span> <span id="s894">I forgot to mention newsreels, was i -- cause there was no TV, but how did I hear the voice?</span> <span id="s895">Of course, it wasn’t just the radio, newsreels in the movies.</span> <span id="s896">And he said that h-he -- something I never thought of, he said, “Oh yes,” he said, “it still exists very much.”</span> <span id="s897">He said every Sunday when he goes to his grandparents house for Sunday dinner with his -- he -- they talk about the old -- good old days, you know, they’re died in the wool -- I don’t know if they’re still Nazis, but they long for those Hitler days, and they talk about it.</span> <span id="s898">And he said there was a lot of neo-Nazi stuff going on that he knew of, and he felt -- he and his fiancée, that if it got any worse -- this was in 1989, that he was going to move to Canada, he just didn’t like what was going on.</span> <span id="s899">It was interesting to hear it from a young German fellow.</span> <span id="s900">And I really didn’t think about that two generations back, that the young ones are exposed to all that, and they’re still alive and -- and not ashamed, or anything.</span> <span id="s901">They are what they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Did you feel unsafe, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No.</span> <span id="s904">No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s905">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s906">It was so stra -- you know, I -- I felt sort of pleased with myself that I could speak German in Germany, you know, it made it easy to get around, and it gave you like a -- it’s very strange feeling, it’s hard to put into words.</span> <span id="s907">That this was once your home, and yet it’s not recognizable, it’s -- I -- I -- I can’t put it into words, the -- the feeling.</span> <span id="s908">Like a real love-hate relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Did you feel any anti-Semitism while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, but I’m sure I could have.</span> <span id="s911">I was in a control group, really -- controlled group.</span> <span id="s912">We went -- They -- We saw what they wanted us to see, you know?</span> <span id="s913">Took lovely boat ride on the river, and oh, the whole thing was conducted in German, though, and had wonderful -- we went to the theater, everything was brand new, the acoustics, the sou -- everything was better than -- I -- I never ex -- I never expected to have such a trip, you know, I thought it was -- I didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s914">Didn’t know everything would be so deluxe.</span> <span id="s915">The hotel, the -- even, you go -- show your passport at a certain bank, and they gave you money, spending money.</span> <span id="s916">It’s all part of it, I mean, they do a very, very good job, so that you go home and say it was wonderful, which I can’t really say it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: How did you feel about divided Berlin at that time, and -- you were both in east and west?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s919">They -- A tremendous difference, tremendous difference, it -- it was like night and day.</span> <span id="s920">East Berlin was very d -- you know, just like you would expect a Communist place to look like, very old and stodgy and -- and neglected, and even the food.</span> <span id="s921">We had coffee and cake or something there in the afternoon, was awful.</span> <span id="s922">And when you went -- when we came back to East Berlin, it was -- dusk was falling, and you see the neon, and the lights, and the -- and the music, it was like night and day, was really amazing dichotomy between the two places.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: You mean when you came back to West Berlin, in the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes, when I came back to West Berlin in the evening, jus -- as you cross the border, it’s like you’re in a different world.</span> <span id="s925">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s926">But as far as what I felt was concerned, I have no -- I -- you know, I had no fear for anybody who seemed -- they seemed poor, and a lot of people seemed unemployed or whatever, but I didn’t -- I certainly didn’t have any great feeling for them, nor the other way -- and -- and still don’t.</span> <span id="s927">And if it costs Germany a fortune to com -- you know, to integrate it, I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s928">They took it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: How about memorials regarding the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s930">What memorials did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Oh, something else that just came to mind.</span> <span id="s932">I was in Germany in 1949, not in Berlin, but when I went back to Europe for the first time with my husband, my first husband, we went to Frankfort.</span> <span id="s933">He wa-was on business, and first time I ever went back to Europe, and we’re in Frankfort, and the city was absolutely decimated.</span> <span id="s934">You could see for miles and miles and miles, it was just rubble.</span> <span id="s935">And way in the distance you saw the famous Kerner Dome, which is a cathedral.</span> <span id="s936">And they did this precision bombing, and I remember seeing all these Germans, this is ’49 now, rolling around on makeshift -- like torsos rolling around, lots of them, on a wooden crate, with like the wheels of a -- of a -- from roller skates, you know, one on each corner, so that they could -- you know, their legs blown off, and -- and I remember -- and they wer -- the food was terri -- no, the food was good, it was bad in England, and in -- in London, and in Paris, you couldn’t, but in Germany, through the PX’s, you could get almost anything, and it just bothered me, and I -- it just -- seeing these people rolling around, I just couldn’t have cared less, is -- it’s -- you know, I had no sympathy whatsoever on how difficult the war was for them.</span> <span id="s937">It was very strange being there, I had forgotten that I was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: How do you feel about Germans, and Germany today?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: To be honest with you, almost the same.</span> <span id="s940">I am sure that I will die with that feeling.</span> <span id="s941">Don’t know quite why I feel that way, being that I -- you know, didn’t have to go through a concentration camp, but I’m very -- just so grateful, you know, that -- and feel so fortunate that I -- like, I missed it by a hair, and I just feel a -- a tremendous -- a tremendous feeling of something to all the people that died there.</span> <span id="s942">I -- I just -- To me, that’s sort of like my religion.</span> <span id="s943">I just feel compelled to read, you know, almost anything on that, or see every film, or every documentary.</span> <span id="s944">I just feel very drawn to it, and I’m always very annoyed with people -- most of them are Jewish, who say -- and there are many, I -- I can’t deal with that, I -- I can’t watch it, I can’t look at it, I can’t read it, and I always feel like, I said, “You can’t look at it?”</span> <span id="s945">I said, “You di -- it -- it’s like you -- you ought -- you know, you didn’t have to go through it, why can’t you look at it?</span> <span id="s946">I feel like that’s your duty to look at it.”</span> <span id="s947">Or, I couldn’t go to a Holocaust Museum, and it -- I find that very annoying, and many people say that to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What are your impressions of how Germans are dealing with, or not dealing with the history of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Well, I’m certainly no expert on it.</span> <span id="s950">I -- I see -- you know, I read these -- the answer -- you know, that Daniel Goldhagen’s book is such a hit in -- in Germany, and that they like klesma music, which is sort of weird to me, like it -- I’m sure there are some -- I -- I really don’t know, maybe it is a generational thing, but I -- I think that many Germans -- and I’ve learned that they’re -- heard this from really very well known, and very knowledgeable professors, I take courses in international politics in New York.</span> <span id="s951">They -- They don’t really know what to do with democracy.</span> <span id="s952">It’s sort of inbred.</span> <span id="s953">I’m not generalizing, but they feel comfortable under -- you know, being told what to do, and as long as it’s orderly, and clean, and neat, and no crime, you know, at least, you know, the ordinary kind of crime, that they feel comfortable with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: What are your impressions of the memorials that you saw in Germany?</span> <span id="s955">And I think you were in Germany in recent years twice, in 1989, as well as 1998?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I was, yeah.</span> <span id="s959">’89 was that trip, and 19 -- October 1998 was a -- a couple of days in Berlin, a trip of eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s960">I was in Budapest, Prague -- Budapest, Prague, where else was I?</span> <span id="s961">Vienna.</span> <span id="s962">Vienna and Berlin.</span> <span id="s963">And I have that same feeling, by the way, for the Viennese.</span> <span id="s964">I mean, Austria and Germany, as far as I’m concerned, I lump them together.</span> <span id="s965">If anything, I dislike them more, because they’re so -- you know, so like our southern people or something, you know, with that smaltzy Viennese, but that’s just me.</span> <span id="s966">What was your question, how?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: About the memorials that you’ve seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Oh, the memorials.</span> <span id="s969">I th -- I -- I -- I didn’t see anybody looking at them, or noticing them.</span> <span id="s970">I’ve seen some, they’re -- they’re very subtle, you don’t even know what they are.</span> <span id="s971">And I’ve seen chil -- they’re like in a children’s playground, and kids climb on them, or play around them.</span> <span id="s972">They’re not revered.</span> <span id="s973">They’re just up here and there, again, only the ones I’ve seen, maybe there are some, but -- but there was one ri-right on the Krufensadum, and very -- right by the main -- the main subway station, right near the Kaufasdesvestens, this famous department store.</span> <span id="s974">And it’s -- that one referred to different -- it just mentioned different concentration camps, like on a -- on a post, but it’s -- it’s well done, and I think that people just go about their business, nobody looks at it.</span> <span id="s975">And that’s a spot sort of like Times Square.</span> <span id="s976">What they do look at, and it is interesting, is that church.</span> <span id="s977">You must have seen that church, we bombed out that famous cathedral, and they left that standing there in the middle of modern Berlin, which is quite interesting, but that’s just a reminder of the war, not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews.</span> <span id="s978">It’s very dramatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Did you notice many differences after the wall had come down, on your second trip to Berlin, in 1998?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yes, I did, I did.</span> <span id="s981">I -- They are building there like crazy.</span> <span id="s982">I’ve never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s983">And our tour guide, who was excellent, a guy from Munich, told us, among many other things, that 90 percent of building cranes in Germany were all in Berlin, and this really wasn’t a good time to visit Berlin, if you wait a year or so, it’ll be like a whole new city.</span> <span id="s984">It was just amazing.</span> <span id="s985">All the -- you know, the Fortune 500 companies, or whatever, of the world, were building there, and they weren’t just building buildings, they were building like whole plazas, and it’s ju -- tremendous, un-unbelievable the building going on, which was -- there was nothing going on in -- in 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did you have much communication with Jews living in Berlin today, or in the modern day?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, none.</span> <span id="s988">We were at a very nice hotel, and then we went and did things, you know, on our own, really.</span> <span id="s989">And of course, a famous muse -- you know, went to a museum, the thing that tourists do, including the zoo, which is spectacular, and the -- you went to that museum, I know you did, the Pergamon Museum.</span> <span id="s990">And -- And went to -- to try that Berliner food, which -- which was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Was the Jewish museum constructed when you were there in 1998?</span> <span id="s992">Did you visit the -- the new Jewish museum in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: I did not go, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s994">I don’t -- no, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: How would you say -- Oh, one more question about visiting Germany, have you -- did you have a chance, in Germany, or elsewhere in Europe to visit concentration camp sites?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes, for the first time.</span> <span id="s997">I know that -- that -- that other time I was -- yeah I’m -- as I realize it now, I was also in Munich once, forgot about that.</span> <span id="s998">But I did not go to -- to Dachau.</span> <span id="s999">I was near it, but I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1000">That was years ago with -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1001">But this time, in 1998, I did visit Theresienstadt, because it was part of the tour.</span> <span id="s1002">We were on our way from Prague to Vienna, I believe.</span> <span id="s1003">It’s that right?</span> <span id="s1004">Think so.</span> <span id="s1005">Whatever, and via Dresden, and we -- we went to -- yeah, because Theresienstadt, I think, was near, or in Czechoslovakia, and it was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s1006">I -- And I knew that that was not the worst ones.</span> <span id="s1007">I remember hearing that from my aunt, and she did survive, and -- and they had, you know, some kind -- some sort of a life there, but I don’t think I could bear visiting Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t ever want to go to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: What would you say, if you can identify this, is the long term impact that your experiences, of having to flee Germany, and be a refugee, and then, in general, the Holocaust has had on your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: It’s a hard question to answer, but I am sure that it has had a profound affect on me.</span> <span id="s1011">You know, you think it hasn’t, but it has.</span> <span id="s1012">It has -- I probably would have be -- been a different person.</span> <span id="s1013">I mean, it’s hard to speculate, but I mean, I’m happy that -- that I came to America, but coming as a refugee, I think if I -- if I had been born here, I would be a different person today.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe not everything for the better, but I think most of if, yes, s -- educa -- and it’s hard -- hard to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Do you think that the Holocaust has had an impact on either your politics or your religious faith, or any sort of, career decisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I think on my career decisions, because my parents -- well then, of course, that was my parents.</span> <span id="s1017">Had I been -- Had it -- had not happened, I probably would not have gone on to much higher education.</span> <span id="s1018">In Berlin, I guess nobody did it, or almost nobody.</span> <span id="s1019">Here, you have more opportunity, and still my par -- it was maybe more my parents doing than -- and their feeling -- I think they always felt like refugees, all their lives, and therefore, you know, passed that on to me, to get married, and you know, get -- I -- I don’t know why I had to, you know, get married, so I -- I just had turned 19 -- no, just had turned 20.</span> <span id="s1020">My birthday’s in September, I got married in October, but I -- in those days, chronologically, you know, I was just 20, but otherwise, I, emotionally, I was like 16.</span> <span id="s1021">And I was, you know, something that really should not have had -- I should have gone, you know, and furthered, you know, gone for more of a career, and so it -- it did affect me.</span> <span id="s1022">But what did you ask me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And also whether you think the Holocaust has had any effect on your political interests and inclinations, and also your religious faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: I think it -- on my political inclinations, yes, I think most people are pretty democratic, and liberal, and I think it has something to do with that, of course, because you can see yourself in that same position, in relation to Blacks, or whatever, minorities.</span> <span id="s1025">As far as religion is concerned, well, I wasn’t brought up on a religious home.</span> <span id="s1026">My first husband was very religious.</span> <span id="s1027">I was not, that was a bad combination.</span> <span id="s1028">And it sort of, if anything turned me against it, I found it very cumbersome, and cumbering and -- and I just have a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust, and still more as I get older, as I said earlier.</span> <span id="s1029">I still do.</span> <span id="s1030">I -- I -- I have more -- more and more so.</span> <span id="s1031">And that, somehow, is like my religion, you know.</span> <span id="s1032">I -- I don’t really -- I’m not a religious -- I like tradition, a little bit of it, you know, with the family, and we spend the holidays together, but it means more to my children than it does to me, to be honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: How do you feel about the ways in which the Holocaust has been portrayed, especially in this country, in the United States, especially in popular culture, movies.</span> <span id="s1034">Also, even portrayed in this museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Oh, I think the museum is fantastic, I really do.</span> <span id="s1036">I think it’s a fabulous museum, it’s portrayed very, very well, and all the high tech things, and all the little films you can see.</span> <span id="s1037">I haven’t really begin -- begun to scratch the surface, if I really wanted to see everything, cause I’m never here long enough.</span> <span id="s1038">If I lived in the area, I probably would have done it, but I -- it’s not the end, I’m going to continue to do it.</span> <span id="s1039">And in films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it’s -- much more is still being said, and I think as we get more sophisticated, and as the generation is ready to die out, that there are scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then -- and researching it from different angles, and different points of view.</span> <span id="s1040">Especially, I’m interested -- I am interested a lot in -- well, like that Daniel Goldhagen book, sort of to prove to myself that -- about the basic German, how could this really happen, that it isn’t just the hierarchy and everything that we know, that it could not really have happened without the cooperation of the ordinary German.</span> <span id="s1041">I feel like it’s in their blood, I really do feel that.</span> <span id="s1042">There are exceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the little things that happened day to day, how c -- how could anybody take just stones, and smash windows, and take an old man in -- into the street, you know on an individual basis, when you look at it that way.</span> <span id="s1043">Nevermind the concentration camps, before the concentration camps, people that you knew, and were your neighbors, and you knew them all your life, and all of a sudden you turned your back on -- what does it take in a person to do that?</span> <span id="s1044">You know, one to one.</span> <span id="s1045">I -- I have to wonder about that.</span> <span id="s1046">What kind of people are those?</span> <span id="s1047">And other countries, you know, you take a country like Denmark, was it?</span> <span id="s1048">And they’re just like good people.</span> <span id="s1049">They just didn’t, and they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1050">You know, it’s -- I don’t know what that is, when you lump it together as one country.</span> <span id="s1051">Or the people of -- I -- I -- but I -- and I feel that way, yes, to this day, and I feel that about Polish people, Austrian people, the whole Ukraine, all those people that, you know, when you see modern day movies that were made in this -- last year or this year, and you see these old ladies, with the babushkas, and a couple of teeth, it -- it -- you could transpose them into a movie of 1938, and if I understood their language, they’re still -- they -- they’re born with that anti-Semitism, that’s -- I feel that, I really do.</span> <span id="s1052">That’s why I never want to go to any of those other countries.</span> <span id="s1053">I only went to Berlin, because after all, well, it was offered to me, and it was -- there is a fascination, it’s a morbid fascination to see the city.</span> <span id="s1054">And it’s also an interesting city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Would you say that you feel hate toward Germans, Germany, and perhaps other countries that collaborated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s1057">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1058">Yeah, I don’t forgive.</span> <span id="s1059">I -- I’m not -- I don’t have -- I’m a very -- like a very practical person, and I don’t really have religion to fall back on.</span> <span id="s1060">I’m -- I -- I’m not forgiving in that sense, or can turn to God.</span> <span id="s1061">I -- I just see it -- what -- what’s the right word, I’m a very literal person.</span> <span id="s1062">Is that the right word?</span> <span id="s1063">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1064">Yeah, I see it, you know, the way it was, or read the way it was, and no, I cannot forgive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Do you have any particular impressions of movies such as “Schindler’s List,” and more recently, “Life is Beautiful”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Oh, don’t get me started.</span> <span id="s1067">We’ll be -- We’ll -- You’ll need another tape.</span> <span id="s1068">I hated that movie, that shi -- that -- that “Life is Beautiful.”</span> <span id="s1069">“Schindler’s List” was an interesting movie, it’s a story about one person, I mean.</span> <span id="s1070">But it was well done, I like Steven Spielberg, and what he’s doing, The Shoah Foundation and all that.</span> <span id="s1071">But I hated that -- that “Life is Beautiful,” and I’ve had endless discussions with people about that movie.</span> <span id="s1072">You had to ask me that at the end.</span> <span id="s1073">I just -- I -- It’s a fable, and I also take a film course, and we discuss it in the film course.</span> <span id="s1074">An-And people loved it, and I -- I just -- and when that -- that guy climbed over those chairs at the Oscars, I ju -- I just -- I -- I said, “Let it end already.”</span> <span id="s1075">But there is no end.</span> <span id="s1076">Do you know that they’re making another movie?</span> <span id="s1077">Yup.</span> <span id="s1078">S -- Th -- Oh, no, they’re -- they’re -- they’re putting it with eng -- in the -- making it in English, without titles.</span> <span id="s1079">I knew I read something.</span> <span id="s1080">And I just feel that -- like, it’s like a sacred thing, that you can’t write a fable about -- a movie about a -- an experience like that.</span> <span id="s1081">And I feel that anybody who went through the experience, that it was like an insult to people, that nothing in that movie could have possibly have happened.</span> <span id="s1082">That they -- he took the little boy with him into -- I felt such an affront, I -- I don’t know why, but I just hated it.</span> <span id="s1083">And I hate that little guy, and his annoying interviews, so don’t ask me any more on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Did you -- Well, can I ask you at least, did you talk about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Of course you can, of course.</span> <span id="s1086">I’m just being, you know, cause I’ve discussed it a million times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did you talk about the movie with several other Holocaust survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes, and the ones that I know, which are limited, because they were in my class, I take a -- a film course at the new school in New York, and almost everybody there, for some reason or other is -- well, they’re retired people, and most of them are Jewish, and some of them are survivors.</span> <span id="s1089">And the survivors felt as I did, but I don’t know if they were as vehement.</span> <span id="s1090">I -- I just -- I just found that movie very annoying.</span> <span id="s1091">I just -- I didn’t like the humor, and I didn’t like any of those things, and I don’t agree with people who say that well, at least then they -- more people would be exposed to it, you know, who wouldn’t see it, because they’re exposed to something that never could have happened, it was so much more horrible.</span> <span id="s1092">And how can you make a fable about anything, but not -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Tape number three, side B, of in interview with Anita Sockol.</span> <span id="s1094">I’d like to ask you how you talked with your children as they grew up, about your experiences in Germany, leaving Germany, and about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, through the years, I -- I guess the -- we talked, you know, it came up naturally, but they -- well, one of my daughters is quite interested in it, my older daughter.</span> <span id="s1096">She wanted to come with me today, you know, but that was not appropriate.</span> <span id="s1097">But she is interested, she reads books on it.</span> <span id="s1098">She is interested through her synagogue, she’s very involved at the Washington congregation, I forget where Hebrew -- Washington Hebrew, yeah.</span> <span id="s1099">My other daughter is not all that interested, and also I tried, you know, even though it’s German, but it is a language, when they were young, I tried to speak German to them.</span> <span id="s1100">My mother always said it doesn’t hurt to know another language, which we all know.</span> <span id="s1101">But they really fought me on it, and I just gave up after awhile.</span> <span id="s1102">My grandchildren are sort of interested, but I think they’re interested because it’s a school project, you know.</span> <span id="s1103">I’m suppose -- because they in turn are learning about the Holocaust, or in Hebrew school, or they have to do something in history, and sometimes they question me the way you’re questioning me now, but not that -- not that closely, especially my youngest one, Michael.</span> <span id="s1104">But how did -- did I speak to them about it?</span> <span id="s1105">I -- I guess it was maybe -- they would -- they did become interested, but I think they spoke more to my parents, probably, than to me.</span> <span id="s1106">And they became interested when they were adults, but then they didn’t really say much.</span> <span id="s1107">My father didn’t want to talk about it, and -- how he came here, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1108">I -- I -- We lived in -- in Forest Hills, and I’m trying to think back, I -- I don’t know how much it really came up, except that the friends that I had, as I said earlier, they were from Germany as well, or German speaking, at any rate, and they would grow up hearing mixed things, but they knew a little, but nothing much has really remained, they are really just very American, Americanized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did you try to talk to your own parents about Germany, about the Holocaust very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Boy, I have to really think about these things.</span> <span id="s1111">I -- No, not so much, just about this, as they call it Ausvanderon, you know that leaving, that process of leaving.</span> <span id="s1112">And the immediate, the relatives and what happened to them, and where they are, but then, after years, you know, when the war was over, and we knew that there wasn’t going to be any -- you know, weren’t going to hear from anyone, except their -- her sister, Kate, and the other one, who lives in Israel, we -- we didn’t talk about it very much any more.</span> <span id="s1113">I -- I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s1114">I guess I sort of just accepted it or something.</span> <span id="s1115">My father -- I don’t remember my father talking much about his brother, you know, as the years went by.</span> <span id="s1116">He was a very self-involved man, not really a family man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Did you feel a close connection to the creation of Israel, and thereafter feel a connection -- strong connection to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Myself, I was happy, we were proud, you know, when watched those proceedings at the UN, and -- but as a -- as an American Jew, no I don’t have a very strong connection to Israel.</span> <span id="s1119">I -- I never felt that I wanted to move there, or live there.</span> <span id="s1120">As a matter of fact, when I was there the first time, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful trip to Europe.</span> <span id="s1121">Europe was very luxurious in 1963, and then hitting Israel, it was big disappointment.</span> <span id="s1122">I was not very happy there.</span> <span id="s1123">No, I -- it’s -- I’m -- I don’t have a -- I’m happy that it exists, but I don’t, personally no, I don’t have -- and I have relatives there, and I care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years, letters and sometimes phone calls.</span> <span id="s1124">And they just were very hospitable this last month to my grandson David, who lives in Bethesda.</span> <span id="s1125">He was in Israel, as was my la -- grandson Lawrence.</span> <span id="s1126">He went two years ago, and they were lovely to them.</span> <span id="s1127">And they stayed with them when they had time to visit people on their team tour, each one.</span> <span id="s1128">And they were saying that I should come, we talked on the phone a couple of weeks ago, that I should come, they have a new house, I should stay with them.</span> <span id="s1129">And I’m considering it, maybe, to go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s1130">But otherwise -- it’s -- it’s really because of them, and to see Isra -- and then my other experience was in 1993.</span> <span id="s1131">I’d had the bad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour, it really wasn’t a tour at all, and I -- if it weren’t for my cousins there, it would have been a pretty disastrous trip, cause I was really on my own.</span> <span id="s1132">It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when you got there, it was really like a day tour.</span> <span id="s1133">I could have booked that myself, to see, always with different people, and different places, you know, and put -- it was like a day tour in Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1134">And at the end of the day you were plunked down at your hotel, and you had nobody.</span> <span id="s1135">But as I said, I had my family there and they really saved the trip for me.</span> <span id="s1136">So I don’t have such a gra -- it wasn’t -- I -- I -- I think I’d want to try Israel again, and I might consider going there in the near future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Well, I think I’m just about done.</span> <span id="s1138">Is there anything else you would like to say or mention in closing our interview today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, I -- It was a very enjoyable experience to c -- trip down memory lane, which is kind of big hyphens there, spaces missing, but it was very interesting, and I’m glad to have done it, and if it’s -- if it is of any value to future researchers, or whatever you do with it, then I’m very glad to have done my small share.</span> <span id="s1140">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1142">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1143">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Anita Sockol.</span></p>
