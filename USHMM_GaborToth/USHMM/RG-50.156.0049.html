History Project by Bonnie Dickel at his home in St. Paul on June 29.</span> <span id="s5">1982.</span> <span id="s6">First will you tell me where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: And your parents were born there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: And what did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Well, they had some business -- they traded horses, clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What were your primary sources of information -- newspaper, radio?</span> <span id="s13">How did you get information on what was happening in the world when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: When I was growing up, we didn’t hear too much.</span> <span id="s15">At first we lived in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Until you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I lived up till about 12 years and then I left my town.</span> <span id="s18">I went to a bigger town.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your family, everyone moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No.</span> <span id="s21">I myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: You moved by yourself at 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, to an uncle.</span> <span id="s24">And I lived and took my trade in the same town.</span> <span id="s25">A bigger town.</span> <span id="s26">I stayed with my uncle, my father’s brother, and I took tailoring trade.</span> <span id="s27">I worked for three years and I moved up to a bigger city -- one of the biggest cities in Poland -- not Warsaw, but another one -- Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And you were a tailor there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And you moved by yourself now.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Where were you and what was happening to you when you first started to hear of trouble in Poland, and how did you hear about it, and what did you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well this was about three days before the war started, in the last part where I lived, I heard about it.</span> <span id="s34">So this next day, the guy -- I worked for him -- he went home and I left -- back to my home small town.</span> <span id="s35">This was like a Friday morning.</span> <span id="s36">I got home and I heard that the Germans declared war already with Poland.</span> <span id="s37">And Saturday, Sunday, most people took off -- ran away.</span> <span id="s38">We didn’t have a chance to take off ‘cause all the buses left already.</span> <span id="s39">There were no more buses.</span> <span id="s40">And then we run into the forest.</span> <span id="s41">We came there Sunday till Monday morning.</span> <span id="s42">Some Polish people came to us and told us that the Germans is in town.</span> <span id="s43">So in the afternoon we went home.</span> <span id="s44">Where we lived wasn’t burned down.</span> <span id="s45">Three quarters of the town was destroyed.</span> <span id="s46">And the second day we got home they start already shooting again -- the Germans with the Polish army.</span> <span id="s47">And we got down to the river -- that wasn’t far away where we lived -- and hundreds and hundreds of people were laying down there.</span> <span id="s48">And all of a sudden some Germans came down the next day.</span> <span id="s49">They said, “Everybody, hands up!”</span> <span id="s50">And they took us to town and we thought for sure we would be killed -- facing the walls everybody -- only the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s51">They only wanted the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s52">And somehow about four, five hours standing around, and they let us loose.</span> <span id="s53">We got home.</span> <span id="s54">For a beginning, wasn’t so bad, because we could understand them.</span> <span id="s55">We spoke Yiddish in Europe.</span> <span id="s56">The German language is not the same, but we could understand each other.</span> <span id="s57">For the Poles it was much harder than for us.</span> <span id="s58">We went out to the Germans and we asked for some candies, they gave us candies, but the Polish people could stand around and say, “ Oh, they are Jude!</span> <span id="s59">“Those are the Jews!”</span> <span id="s60">They didn’t care much about that at the moment, because a lot of Germans wasn’t the Gestapos.</span> <span id="s61">If it would be the Gestapos, it would be different.</span> <span id="s62">And it start getting worse as day by day went by and we had to go to work under the Germans.</span> <span id="s63">Very hard work.</span> <span id="s64">They didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s65">As long as you paid them off with money, you still could stay in the city.</span> <span id="s66">The money started running out.</span> <span id="s67">We were home in ’39, ’40, ’41, and July of ’42 we worked on the freeway, and here the Germans came along the freeway and they picked us up and took us downtown -- not our brothers and sister -- I was with my brother all the time.</span> <span id="s68">We were at home seven children, father and mother.</span> <span id="s69">And so they took us to the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Just you and your older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: My younger brother.</span> <span id="s72">Not in the city outskirt, so nobody could go down see us.</span> <span id="s73">The ghetto was inside, and the outside, nobody could move around.</span> <span id="s74">Couldn’t go out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s75">Anyway, that is the life, and they came to see us, and in fact they brought us two breads, they give us.</span> <span id="s76">And they said we shouldn’t worry by them.</span> <span id="s77">They’re going to be fine.</span> <span id="s78">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s79">You’re not going to be fine.</span> <span id="s80">We’re going to be all right but you’re not going to be all right.”</span> <span id="s81">So.</span> <span id="s82">Your heart, everything, your whole body start getting already like numb and dead.</span> <span id="s83">For every person in Europe, already, because you don’t know what’s going to happen from one minute to the other, you lived by the second.</span> <span id="s84">You see?</span> <span id="s85">You want to live; when you see the Germans, you know you’re dead.</span> <span id="s86">So they took us, me and my younger brother, I would say maybe about 200, 300 miles from where we lived, to a camp.</span> <span id="s87">It wasn’t a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s88">In Poland was no concentration camps.</span> <span id="s89">So we worked there in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s90">I was lucky with my brother because it was like A-B-C.</span> <span id="s91">We got in ammunition factory “A”.</span> <span id="s92">“A” wasn’t bad, beside you were threatened with your life every second.</span> <span id="s93">Your working condition wasn’t as hard as was “B”.</span> <span id="s94">“C” was murder!</span> <span id="s95">Because the people, they worked by a powder that the whole body, face got yellow.</span> <span id="s96">Even if a prisoner wanted to escape, he couldn’t, because when he escaped they saw he got a yellow face from where he comes from -- from what camp.</span> <span id="s97">So we worked there, very hard, too, but clean!</span> <span id="s98">Because we work with ammunition, bullets.</span> <span id="s99">And we did a lot of sabotage with them, too, because we didn’t care much, anyway.</span> <span id="s100">Coming to work your life wasn’t worth anything because you are afraid they’re going to call you out from the line and they kill you.</span> <span id="s101">That’s what they did.</span> <span id="s102">They didn’t care who, what and when.</span> <span id="s103">Walking home, you are afraid whether you walk straight maybe it’s too much, and they’ll notice you.</span> <span id="s104">If you walk like this, crippled down, wasn’t good, neither.</span> <span id="s105">So either way, it was just, shall we say like “luck” anyway, at that time, because a lot of them was called out.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">And we were going to work like this.</span> <span id="s107">There was two shifts, dayshift and nightshift.</span> <span id="s108">We switched around.</span> <span id="s109">If we worked in day, when we went to work, whoever was left in the barracks, the Germans called everybody out and asked, “ Are you the nightshift or the dayshift?”</span> <span id="s110">Because the nightshift was home, and the dayshift’s supposed to be at work.</span> <span id="s111">That’s what I say, we were like dead.</span> <span id="s112">You couldn’t even say you’re the nightshift, because you’re afraid.</span> <span id="s113">So you had to say you were the dayshift, because you were sick.</span> <span id="s114">Now if you’re sick, you don’t have no rights to live!</span> <span id="s115">You have to die.</span> <span id="s116">So they could take out and kill off, kill the people, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">In the factory, we worked with a lot of Polish people which they were coming in from outside working.</span> <span id="s118">We used to trade with them a lot of times.</span> <span id="s119">We got bread, we give them bread.</span> <span id="s120">Or we give them money we still had from home.</span> <span id="s121">And they trade with us something else they brought in from outside.</span> <span id="s122">But when coming in -- the Poles -- they’ve been searched.</span> <span id="s123">They brought in some bread for us, so they hung them.</span> <span id="s124">Like nothing.</span> <span id="s125">And we had to see this.</span> <span id="s126">Right now I can see it.</span> <span id="s127">I remember the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">And this was going on like this.</span> <span id="s129">And then there was a time at work during the day, one German got drunk.</span> <span id="s130">I remember like now, I can see it!</span> <span id="s131">And he called everybody out from the factory.</span> <span id="s132">He said, “The factory, let’s stop the factory, everybody out.”</span> <span id="s133">And as they walked around acting strong, he says, “ You!</span> <span id="s134">Out!</span> <span id="s135">On this side.</span> <span id="s136">You out!”</span> <span id="s137">It happened my brother was there, too.</span> <span id="s138">So what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s139">What are you going to say?</span> <span id="s140">I had some good friends, too, there.</span> <span id="s141">And I asked them, “ Could you give me a bread?”</span> <span id="s142">And I said, “ Joe, here’s a bread for you.</span> <span id="s143">Because I know where you’re going.</span> <span id="s144">They put you on the trains.</span> <span id="s145">See if you can run away!”</span> <span id="s146">Maybe if God help me and you live through everything, maybe we will be able to see each other.”</span> <span id="s147">So what happened is this; they took him out.</span> <span id="s148">Took all the people away.</span> <span id="s149">What they do, they connect with a city, and they take all the people and they send them away to die.</span> <span id="s150">And they took him in to the barracks and I was in another barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You were separated at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: At that time, because whoever they picked, they took them to another barrack.</span> <span id="s153">It just happened, I -- when I got to the camp -- I made myself friends right away.</span> <span id="s154">I made friends with the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s155">They were brutal, anyway, because they worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s156">Because they didn’t know what tomorrow is coming, they lived for the moment now.</span> <span id="s157">They knew everybody’s dying anyway.</span> <span id="s158">So I went over to the police, and I said, “ You know what?</span> <span id="s159">They took my brother, he’s out in the other camp.”</span> <span id="s160">He said, “Okay, let’s take care of it.</span> <span id="s161">We’re going to take care of it right away.”</span> <span id="s162">We took a wagon and we -- four people -- two of them pulled the front, two of them pulled the back --– like we deliver supper for one camp, from one barracks to the other one.</span> <span id="s163">And we just pretend so, by going out, from the camp so they count -- four people -- they don’t care who you are, what you are, so long as you go out four people, four people got to return.</span> <span id="s164">Not five, not three.</span> <span id="s165">So we took four people over there.</span> <span id="s166">One of them left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And your brother came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: My brother came back -- four people.</span> <span id="s169">I had a good friend, a German Jew.</span> <span id="s170">There wasn’t too many old people left.</span> <span id="s171">At that time, while we were working in the factory, he was there.</span> <span id="s172">And he knew the Germans, too.</span> <span id="s173">So the other one who got left came to work anyway, right?</span> <span id="s174">From the other barracks, because you count out -- 200 people go out, 200 people supposed to return.</span> <span id="s175">When he came to the factory, he started working, so the German Jew went over to the boss and was telling him he’s a good worker, he should be here.</span> <span id="s176">How must be from God that that happened that way.</span> <span id="s177">But then this was going on like this.</span> <span id="s178">You weren’t sure at the barracks.</span> <span id="s179">You weren’t sure at work.</span> <span id="s180">Because every German had the power in their own hands.</span> <span id="s181">They could do whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s182">I remember, there were days we were at home.</span> <span id="s183">You couldn’t sleep in the barracks, you were afraid to sleep there, they’re going to come, take you out.</span> <span id="s184">You try to lay down for a while and get out -- just to walk different directions.</span> <span id="s185">It wasn’t a big camp anyways .</span> <span id="s186">The barracks wasn’t big, because they didn’t want to let you go too far away.</span> <span id="s187">So we walked around.</span> <span id="s188">And one German, I remember was an old farmer, an older guy, and had a little pistol like this.</span> <span id="s189">He always used to say to a guy, “ Hey, why don’t you walk a little bit down, straight down?’</span> <span id="s190">So he starts walking.</span> <span id="s191">He takes out the pistol, like this.</span> <span id="s192">Boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s193">He’s dead.</span> <span id="s194">For no reason!</span> <span id="s195">For nothing.</span> <span id="s196">And he didn’t bother you, because like I said before, your body was dead in you.</span> <span id="s197">It was like cattle, you go into the slaughter house.</span> <span id="s198">That’s how we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">My son, the older one, he’s going to be 20 in October 22.</span> <span id="s200">He says, “ Why did you do this?</span> <span id="s201">Why didn’t you fight back?”</span> <span id="s202">Hitler knew how to operate, you know, slowly.</span> <span id="s203">Well, this was going on, ’42, ’43, ’44, we were there.</span> <span id="s204">We thought we’re the only one left.</span> <span id="s205">They picked up maybe about fifty people and they told them they were gonna, with trucks, to go ahead to the Warsaw ghetto, to pick up the clothes.</span> <span id="s206">All them Jewish people -- most people -- got killed in Warsaw, that’s what we heard, and the rest of them they took to different camps -- divided -- all over.</span> <span id="s207">They picked up the clothes and they brought it into our camp.</span> <span id="s208">We didn’t even want to wear them, because they were nothing but blood!</span> <span id="s209">Everything was blood!</span> <span id="s210">And they said, “Look at it!”</span> <span id="s211">We were living just for seconds, not minutes.</span> <span id="s212">In our camp was one guy, a humped guy, a little guy like this.</span> <span id="s213">He was like half and half; he was half Pole and half German.</span> <span id="s214">And he was impossible!</span> <span id="s215">He could take out anybody and kill them.</span> <span id="s216">We were at that time 5,000 Jewish people in that camp.</span> <span id="s217">5,000 men and ladies in that particular camp.</span> <span id="s218">This was going on like this, up till ’44 -- I don’t remember what month it was -- June, July.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">I want to just go back.</span> <span id="s220">The year when we got into camp -- this Polish camp -- I just came in the munitions factory where the Poles were.</span> <span id="s221">And we worked for the Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s222">And the same year, on the High Holidays, the train went through our camp, and all our parents were on that train, going through to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: And you hadn’t seen them because you were working on the outskirts of your city.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No.</span> <span id="s225">Since we left home, we hadn’t seen them till now.</span> <span id="s226">So they took them all, everybody, evacuated out to the train.</span> <span id="s227">Whoever couldn’t make it to the train was killed right away.</span> <span id="s228">And they took them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s229">This was the biggest camp in there.</span> <span id="s230">How did I know this was the train?</span> <span id="s231">We used to write home to our neighbors -- to Polish neighbors.</span> <span id="s232">And they told us they took them away.</span> <span id="s233">On that day -- they always did -- on the High Holidays!</span> <span id="s234">-- You know, they know, the Nazis -- because they said, “Where’s God?”</span> <span id="s235">They always used to say to us, “Where’s God?’</span> <span id="s236">“If there would be a God,” he says, the synagogues wouldn’t be destroyed, and the churches wouldn’t be destroyed.</span> <span id="s237">Everything was destroyed through them.</span> <span id="s238">They had that power!</span> <span id="s239">They were God!</span> <span id="s240">See, they were God!</span> <span id="s241">So an uncle of mine and his wife and children hid themselves out --after they took everybody out from home, took them up to the cemetery, they digged the holes, and they shot them all.</span> <span id="s242">I will just say what happened with me -- five, seven people gave our life for me and my brother.</span> <span id="s243">They were killed.</span> <span id="s244">Took them away.</span> <span id="s245">But you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s246">We all had thought we were the only ones left, because the Warsaw Ghetto it was destroyed.</span> <span id="s247">We didn’t know anything about the Warsaw ghetto anyway; those people went over there to pick up the clothes and they told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: That was the only information you had from the outside of your work.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s250">There was nothing else.</span> <span id="s251">And from there they said they were going to take us to Germany.</span> <span id="s252">We thought they’re going to kill us.</span> <span id="s253">But we had no choice.</span> <span id="s254">Because like I said, our hands, arms, were tied down.</span> <span id="s255">So we were traveling around on trains.</span> <span id="s256">When we came to a city, the Germans said we should not stick our head, because they were ashamed even for the German people to see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s257">Going by to a city, we always had to lay down on the floor, not to look through.</span> <span id="s258">We wind up in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Your brother was still with you now at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s261">From the moment we left till now, slept in one bed, ate one piece of bread a day, sliced and a water-soup a day.</span> <span id="s262">And we were always together till the last minute.</span> <span id="s263">So we got to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s264">We saw smoke coming out.</span> <span id="s265">And we seen so many people there, you know.</span> <span id="s266">All kind of nationality from the whole world.</span> <span id="s267">Gypsies and Germans and Poles - all kind of people were there.</span> <span id="s268">And then we got off the train and just like across the street, people stand and they say,” Hey,’ they said, “ You got something you want to trade?’</span> <span id="s269">“You got a watch?”</span> <span id="s270">They thought we brought gold, this and that.</span> <span id="s271">“You want to trade?</span> <span id="s272">We’ll give you some bread.’</span> <span id="s273">I said, “ What the heck do I need the bread?</span> <span id="s274">We’re going to die!”</span> <span id="s275">You see this is Germany.</span> <span id="s276">He said, “ No.”</span> <span id="s277">I said, “ What do you say ‘No!’</span> <span id="s278">Why do you say “No!’</span> <span id="s279">Because the smoke is going, day and night, twenty-four hours!”</span> <span id="s280">They told us, “It was doctors.</span> <span id="s281">Not long time ago they stopped.</span> <span id="s282">They stopped burning people over there.</span> <span id="s283">This was in ’44.</span> <span id="s284">I would say the hardest days was August, maybe.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s286">But I was with my brother and several friends.</span> <span id="s287">And we said to each other, “ You know, we’ve got some bread.</span> <span id="s288">We’ve got some sugar.</span> <span id="s289">Let’s eat the bread as much as we can, because we’re dying anyway.</span> <span id="s290">To heck with it.</span> <span id="s291">Before we die, lets eat something.”</span> <span id="s292">And we ate.</span> <span id="s293">And we said, “ Let’s be the last one.”</span> <span id="s294">Why?</span> <span id="s295">Because we see people going and going in, but nobody comes out!</span> <span id="s296">But they had no choice!</span> <span id="s297">What can you do?</span> <span id="s298">There’s nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s299">When we got to Buchenwald, we thought, “ This is the only camp in the whole of Europe left.”</span> <span id="s300">We didn’t know about other camps.</span> <span id="s301">We thought for sure we’re the only people left in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">We went in.</span> <span id="s303">First they ask us a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s304">This was in a nicer way, maybe because they knew the American and British are close.</span> <span id="s305">And then they shaved our heads and we had to sign papers, who we are, where we come from, so-and-so.</span> <span id="s306">And all of a sudden, while we’re walking, somebody comes along and throws a pail of water on us.</span> <span id="s307">I thought, “ Oh, oh!</span> <span id="s308">Here already we’re dead!”</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: A pail of water?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: “For sure,” I thought, “ maybe it’s a gas!”</span> <span id="s311">How else could you think, besides this?</span> <span id="s312">Because that’s what it was happened there.</span> <span id="s313">And finally we went out on the other side and we thought, okay, we’re out on the other side.</span> <span id="s314">We couldn’t recognize anybody because they give us Holland shoes, you know those Hollander shoes?</span> <span id="s315">Those clogs” --and shaved off the heads, and everything, and they put us on striped suits.</span> <span id="s316">Now we’re in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: You had different clothing in the work camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In the work camps we wore whatever you got, civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s319">And here was already a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s320">I didn’t have a number, because I wasn’t in those camps.</span> <span id="s321">Because we had a number right here, with the stripes.</span> <span id="s322">And we were working for a while.</span> <span id="s323">So where we worked?</span> <span id="s324">I’ll tell you where we worked.</span> <span id="s325">Did you see The Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: On television?</span> <span id="s327">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Did you see Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Where the artist lived -- the character who played the artist?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s331">Right.</span> <span id="s332">Down the hill where they carried those big rocks?</span> <span id="s333">That’s where we worked there.</span> <span id="s334">For a while.</span> <span id="s335">People had to pull out those big stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Huge logs and large stones for wheels.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s338">Did you see that?</span> <span id="s339">Yes!</span> <span id="s340">Out from there, and they had -- like with the horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: The harnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: If you didn’t make it right there you were killed.</span> <span id="s343">Kill!</span> <span id="s344">Kill!</span> <span id="s345">Kill!</span> <span id="s346">Kill!</span> <span id="s347">A thousand dead!</span> <span id="s348">A thousand dead!</span> <span id="s349">This was the first concentration camp in Germany when Hitler came to power -- 1933.</span> <span id="s350">This was the first one, Buchenwald!</span> <span id="s351">There were people there for many, many years, from the time when he came to power.</span> <span id="s352">The most was gypsies -- German gypsies, because he didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s353">He was the same to them -- Hitler was -- Jews and gypsies had to die.</span> <span id="s354">But at that time, when I got in, wasn’t killing!</span> <span id="s355">They killed, the kapo -- they call like here is a manager, you know, or the foreman -- that they called kapo.</span> <span id="s356">In Poland and camp, there was a lot of Jewish kapos.</span> <span id="s357">And like I said to you before, Jewish police -- and kapos wasn’t Jewish police -- they thought they were going to be fuhrers under Germans.</span> <span id="s358">They not going to be hurt or anything.</span> <span id="s359">But it’s not true.</span> <span id="s360">When they got into Buchenwald, we all killed them.</span> <span id="s361">Because they were the same as Nazis, because the Nazis gave them the power.</span> <span id="s362">This was the same thing in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s363">It was kapos.</span> <span id="s364">They took 2,000 people out from camp -- outside working -- they only could bring back 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s365">They killed off 1,000 people, a thousand came back.</span> <span id="s366">It was nothing but a slaughter house, slaughtering people.</span> <span id="s367">The Germans wouldn’t want to use the bullet -- for anybody.</span> <span id="s368">Only they had to save, they said, for the Jews -- the bullet to kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">In our town, if I go back again, right now I can remember.</span> <span id="s370">It was two boys.</span> <span id="s371">They went out to a farmer and they bought the cattle and they slaughtered it right downtown.</span> <span id="s372">They bought it and they sold it, secretly.</span> <span id="s373">They found out -- the Germans.</span> <span id="s374">I was downtown when they caught the two Jewish people.</span> <span id="s375">And two Germans took them in jail.</span> <span id="s376">The next day they started walking out with them from jail.</span> <span id="s377">They stopped in a liquor store -- and I was right there!</span> <span id="s378">I had an armband, but when I was out there, outside the ghetto, I took off my armband.</span> <span id="s379">Why I took it off, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s380">With the armband, I could never be there.</span> <span id="s381">If they would have caught me, probably, they could have sent me away or killed me.</span> <span id="s382">So I took it off, the armband, and walked around like nothing.</span> <span id="s383">So they were there, in the liquor store.</span> <span id="s384">Why did they go in the liquor store?</span> <span id="s385">They went in the liquor store to get drunk.</span> <span id="s386">Later I found out why.</span> <span id="s387">When they took them out of the ghetto -- outside, because nobody should see what’s going on, what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s388">We didn’t care.</span> <span id="s389">We just walked.</span> <span id="s390">They walked with the bicycles they had, those two Germans.</span> <span id="s391">And they told them to go down -- like on the freeway -- off the road.</span> <span id="s392">Took off their machine guns and killed them off.</span> <span id="s393">Then they came out and they stopped in the Jewish center, and they told them to go over, go and clean up the bodies.</span> <span id="s394">You went with two worlds.</span> <span id="s395">A lot of people ask me now, “ How did you survive?’</span> <span id="s396">Well, you can say, some people gave lives for us.</span> <span id="s397">They died, everybody died.</span> <span id="s398">And if you couldn’t help yourself in camps, you couldn’t survive four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: What sorts of things did you do to help yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, when I got into camp, in Polish camp, I was a tailor.</span> <span id="s401">I start making, in the barracks, a few hats.</span> <span id="s402">And I saw that my trade with the Polish people, I got bread for that.</span> <span id="s403">Then I said to those Jewish police, I say, “ If you need anything, I sew on a button.</span> <span id="s404">You bring me thread with a needle and I fix you the button.”</span> <span id="s405">“Fine!”</span> <span id="s406">They were in charge over the soup.</span> <span id="s407">And they give tickets, or passed out tickets.</span> <span id="s408">And they give you a ticket and you got a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s409">There’s times I had more than one soup and could have two, three soups.</span> <span id="s410">For a while!</span> <span id="s411">It wasn’t all that good.</span> <span id="s412">But still!</span> <span id="s413">This was the whole thing!</span> <span id="s414">You couldn’t die from not eating!</span> <span id="s415">I had the experience so many years.</span> <span id="s416">You could only die by killing .</span> <span id="s417">You can survive on a slice of bread and a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s418">You get used to this.</span> <span id="s419">You live with this.</span> <span id="s420">So I’m talking to you, I can see myself back in 1942, ’43 and ’44 and ’45.</span> <span id="s421">People survived.</span> <span id="s422">People could survive on one slice bread!</span> <span id="s423">They could.</span> <span id="s424">With water-soup.</span> <span id="s425">Bread was sliced thin.</span> <span id="s426">So you’d take a piece and eat.</span> <span id="s427">And hide it.</span> <span id="s428">You want it should last you for a long time!</span> <span id="s429">It’s hard to believe now, that this could happen.</span> <span id="s430">So, I could have another extra ticket.</span> <span id="s431">Sometimes they give us cigarettes, I’d give him cigarettes.</span> <span id="s432">A lot of friends of mine would say, “ For what are you giving him cigarettes?”</span> <span id="s433">Well, you know why?</span> <span id="s434">Because you had to make yourselves friends.</span> <span id="s435">If you couldn’t make yourselves friends, it wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s436">Was hard for you.</span> <span id="s437">It was much harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Well, we got to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s439">We went into another camp, too.</span> <span id="s440">All of a sudden, there was another foreman -- a kapo.</span> <span id="s441">He was a Budapest gypsy, and he could speak a little German.</span> <span id="s442">He could go into the kitchen and ask for his bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s443">He didn’t ate the same soup as we had.</span> <span id="s444">He had a regular dish soup.</span> <span id="s445">He went in and got the dish and he ate.</span> <span id="s446">Then we went out working.</span> <span id="s447">We worked, and we worked by ammunition, too.</span> <span id="s448">And while we were working there, I said to him, “ Hey, you look at those shoes.</span> <span id="s449">Do you want me to fix you shoes?’</span> <span id="s450">How can I fix them?</span> <span id="s451">But it’s better than nothing.</span> <span id="s452">You have to speak up!</span> <span id="s453">You have to see to survive, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: What did you get for fixing his shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: What did I fix?</span> <span id="s456">How did I fix?</span> <span id="s457">I took the needle with the thread.</span> <span id="s458">How can you fix how good a shoe.</span> <span id="s459">Go through it once, twice.</span> <span id="s460">It’s already loose anyway, but I got myself a friend.</span> <span id="s461">I said, “ You bring me a needle.</span> <span id="s462">Go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s463">Get me a needle with a thread.</span> <span id="s464">I’ll fix it.”</span> <span id="s465">So every day, we got to work, I says, “ You know what?</span> <span id="s466">Hey!</span> <span id="s467">Look at it!</span> <span id="s468">It came apart again!”</span> <span id="s469">So instead of working, I sat down.</span> <span id="s470">It came in the end he was the chief, to pass out soup.</span> <span id="s471">Everybody stood in the line.</span> <span id="s472">Pick up a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s473">Pour us in a dish.</span> <span id="s474">And he didn’t mix it.</span> <span id="s475">When it came to me, to my bowl, then he mixed it.</span> <span id="s476">So you got more.</span> <span id="s477">On the end was left, he called out, he said, “Rosenzweig?”</span> <span id="s478">He calls us by the name.</span> <span id="s479">He knows us.</span> <span id="s480">Otherwise, somebody else, he didn’t call by the name, he called by the numbers.</span> <span id="s481">So he gave us from the end what was left over.</span> <span id="s482">And then, when he took his bowl of soup out from the kitchen, we ate.</span> <span id="s483">So it’s like, “We have a little dog now.”</span> <span id="s484">And when we eat supper, I see that he stays around, watching, now.</span> <span id="s485">He wants something.</span> <span id="s486">That’s how we were -- around the table -when that kapo ate the soup.</span> <span id="s487">He didn’t eat much, because he had enough.</span> <span id="s488">He wants to go in, he can have another bowl of soup, if he wants it.</span> <span id="s489">So he give me.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">It’s a lot to say.</span> <span id="s491">There isn’t the words for five years!</span> <span id="s492">We were home to July ’42.</span> <span id="s493">It isn’t that we were home, because we went out working, almost every day, in the cold, without shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: No shoes?</span> <span id="s495">No gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Took a piece of rag over your feet.</span> <span id="s497">No gloves.</span> <span id="s498">And my mother had to risk her life to go out to the farmer, take off the armband and risk her life to go out about seven kilometer to trade -- pots and pans, she got flour.</span> <span id="s499">She bought some cheap and sold them, trays and she bought some flour, a little bread.</span> <span id="s500">A piece of bread from this farmer, and a piece of bread from this farmer.</span> <span id="s501">They were good.</span> <span id="s502">This I can say.</span> <span id="s503">The Polish people were not good to the Jewish people at all.</span> <span id="s504">Most of them were like the Nazis.</span> <span id="s505">But the farmers -- they were good to you.</span> <span id="s506">You went out there because they had a tough life, too.</span> <span id="s507">They were afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s508">And they went into another farmer and brought home a slice of bread from this one, this one, this one, brought home for the kids.</span> <span id="s509">But she risked her life.</span> <span id="s510">And on one Sunday morning, I remember, somebody knocks on the door.</span> <span id="s511">He’s knocking so hard at the door.</span> <span id="s512">And under the bed we made it like a cave, kind of.</span> <span id="s513">We kept potatoes there, because she used to being from the farm, saved up -- every day -- a little potatoes.</span> <span id="s514">And me and my brother hide ourselves underneath.</span> <span id="s515">And the other brothers and sisters were young.</span> <span id="s516">And they came, they said, “ Hey!</span> <span id="s517">Where’s everybody?</span> <span id="s518">Where’s this and this and this?”</span> <span id="s519">My mother went down and opened the door, and if they would see us underneath, we could have been killed.</span> <span id="s520">Your life wasn’t worth anything.</span> <span id="s521">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s522">It was so brutal!</span> <span id="s523">So murder!</span> <span id="s524">I didn’t see, but the way I heard!</span> <span id="s525">Right there!</span> <span id="s526">When they got in, the Germans to Poland, they took small kids, throw them to the walls!</span> <span id="s527">While we were in camp, we always said -- we’re sitting there at night, because nine o’clock, there’s no light any more -- “What’s going on here?</span> <span id="s528">Are we ever going to be out from here or are we going to be dead?”</span> <span id="s529">Even if the Russian, they would have to crawl on their “tootsie,” we used to say, they should be here.</span> <span id="s530">Or the American!</span> <span id="s531">That’s all we could hear, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s532">There was no communication.</span> <span id="s533">We didn’t know from anybody at all.</span> <span id="s534">Cut off and everything.</span> <span id="s535">And then we said, ‘ I think God is in the United States!</span> <span id="s536">He doesn’t want to see what’s going on!”</span> <span id="s537">You know, over in Europe.</span> <span id="s538">“Because there would be a God,” we said, “He wouldn’t want it we should suffer so.”</span> <span id="s539">You know that living was a suffering!</span> <span id="s540">There was nothing but suffering!</span> <span id="s541">One day I remember.</span> <span id="s542">I’ll go back to the first camp -- to the big one -- the one my brother was taken there.</span> <span id="s543">A bunch came up -- maybe about ten, twenty trucks, and “Everybody out!”</span> <span id="s544">If you were like this, they didn’t touch you!</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Right.</span> <span id="s547">To show them that you’re strong.</span> <span id="s548">The one who was weak, and they were sitting outside, like “crying.’</span> <span id="s549">Their feet was frost-bite.</span> <span id="s550">So many hundreds of people, they’re sitting.</span> <span id="s551">I see them now.</span> <span id="s552">From God I can see them now!</span> <span id="s553">I’m standing right there!</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Tell me what you see!</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Well, I’m standing right there.</span> <span id="s556">And then some Germans with the Ukraine – they were like worse than Nazis!</span> <span id="s557">They were murderers!</span> <span id="s558">They were under the Germans, they worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s559">With machine guns, they told, “Up!”</span> <span id="s560">Put them on trucks.</span> <span id="s561">Kicked them with the machine guns!</span> <span id="s562">They took them out in a field.</span> <span id="s563">That’s what they were doing all the time.</span> <span id="s564">Dumped them out like you dump out a truck of sand.</span> <span id="s565">And took the machine guns and went like this and killed them all.</span> <span id="s566">And this was going on day and night, all over, we found out.</span> <span id="s567">But here was two Jewish guys there -- of course I say “Jewish,’ they all were Jewish guys -- in one camp we were there with Polish people, too, but most of them we were alone, just Jewish people.</span> <span id="s568">The only time we were with ladies was in Poland.</span> <span id="s569">But in Germany, you were already separated.</span> <span id="s570">The men was just in one camp, the ladies were in a different camp -- just ladies alone.</span> <span id="s571">So you went to work.</span> <span id="s572">With that one, two piece pajama, the German stripe one.</span> <span id="s573">Nothing underneath.</span> <span id="s574">No underwear.</span> <span id="s575">And if you would only take from the barrack sometime, a quilt underneath, they stopped you going out.</span> <span id="s576">They could do anything to you.</span> <span id="s577">It just happened at that time in ’44, the camp where we were, in another camp -- the small camp was there -- two old Germans, that they told us once in a while stories about the First World War.</span> <span id="s578">But they took away, underneath, and when we came the next day -- everybody had to go out -- they called out two numbers.</span> <span id="s579">Two Gestapo came out.</span> <span id="s580">At that time they didn’t kill anybody.</span> <span id="s581">The only thing, you had to pull down the pants and they gave you about twenty-five rubber ones right there.</span> <span id="s582">I once had twelve!</span> <span id="s583">Took me in and I had to climb on a ladder and pull down the pants and give me twelve.</span> <span id="s584">He says, “ What were you doing there?’</span> <span id="s585">For nothing, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s586">For no reason!</span> <span id="s587">After that, I went in the washroom and while I was in the washroom, our boss comes in and comes to me and he says to me, “What happened?’</span> <span id="s588">If I could kill the guy, I would have killed him!</span> <span id="s589">He asked me, “What happened?’</span> <span id="s590">I says, “ You know what he did to me!”</span> <span id="s591">He’s laughing.</span> <span id="s592">You cannot stay long in a washroom, either.</span> <span id="s593">Why?</span> <span id="s594">Because you’re not supposed to be in the washroom a long time.</span> <span id="s595">Because everybody likes to go in.</span> <span id="s596">But you have to watch the bosses.</span> <span id="s597">You had to go right out.</span> <span id="s598">If you didn’t go out, he came right in with the rubber and again he start hitting everybody.</span> <span id="s599">Whether you worked or you didn’t work, you had to pretend that you’re working.</span> <span id="s600">You could work eight hours a day like a slave, but the second you stood like this, you were in trouble.</span> <span id="s601">So that you had to go circle around.</span> <span id="s602">Nothing but circle around.</span> <span id="s603">Circle around, circle around.</span> <span id="s604">Sometime I could get by with working, because when I had that gypsy one, he was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">My brother, he didn’t do anything!</span> <span id="s606">He worked, worked, and all of a sudden he thought of something, and he’s looking up to the sky, and the boss comes behind him and he tells the gypsy to take him down to the basement.</span> <span id="s607">And you know, f he takes him down to the basement, what he’s going to do to him.</span> <span id="s608">He’s going to get him, right here.</span> <span id="s609">But he knew us.</span> <span id="s610">So he took him like this.</span> <span id="s611">And he told him to holler.</span> <span id="s612">And he took the rubber, and he start hitting on the table, and he told him to holler!</span> <span id="s613">He came back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: You didn’t know this was happening.</span> <span id="s615">You didn’t know he was hitting the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Well, I didn’t know, but I had a feeling because we’d had cigarettes, everything, always, like two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: You were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Well I mean is, it was very hard for a doctor.</span> <span id="s619">A doctor didn’t live long -- couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s620">He couldn’t hit the wood.</span> <span id="s621">An engineer, a doctor, a dentist.</span> <span id="s622">A doctor, let’s face it, he was older.</span> <span id="s623">So that was a difference too.</span> <span id="s624">But he couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s625">He didn’t live long.</span> <span id="s626">He couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s627">He got sick, stayed in the barrack.</span> <span id="s628">They could take him out and kill him.</span> <span id="s629">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: How old are you now when you’re talking about this incident with the gypsy and your brother in the basement?</span> <span id="s631">How old are you when all this is happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: I didn’t even know how old I was at that time.</span> <span id="s633">I was twenty.</span> <span id="s634">And my brother was seventeen.</span> <span id="s635">But I was grown up.</span> <span id="s636">By twelve I left home.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: But physically you were in good shape at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I was never home in the barrack.</span> <span id="s639">A day when I worked I worked.</span> <span id="s640">If not I would be out or I wouldn’t be living.</span> <span id="s641">You see what it was?</span> <span id="s642">If you would have a headache, you stay at home.</span> <span id="s643">In the barracks they take you out.</span> <span id="s644">You’re not supposed to be “home.”</span> <span id="s645">You’re supposed to work.</span> <span id="s646">And if you can’t work, you’ve got to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: It was lucky that nothing happened.</span> <span id="s649">I mean you had to know how to do it.</span> <span id="s650">It was hard.</span> <span id="s651">You were afraid for every second, that you’re going to be dying.</span> <span id="s652">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s653">Very hard.</span> <span id="s654">There were around you, Gestapos -- with the dogs.</span> <span id="s655">I was scared to the dogs.</span> <span id="s656">I was so scared.</span> <span id="s657">You had to go in the washroom.</span> <span id="s658">Why did you go in the washroom?</span> <span id="s659">Just to get away for another two minutes.</span> <span id="s660">You didn’t need to go in the washroom.</span> <span id="s661">You didn’t eat anything to go in the washroom.</span> <span id="s662">We hardly drank.</span> <span id="s663">Because you haven’t got what for, you didn’t eat much to be thirsty.</span> <span id="s664">So you didn’t drink water.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">But to wash out a shirt, we washed it outside, and there were pipes outside, steam coming from the pipes, like you see a lot of times.</span> <span id="s666">Like if you go on downtown Minneapolis, steam a lot of times comes out on Nicollet.</span> <span id="s667">I’m ashamed to say now, but what we had, we had lice.</span> <span id="s668">And we tried to steam them off where that steam came out from the pipes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">But it’s impossible to believe yet again we could survive.</span> <span id="s670">You could survive so long if they didn’t kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">I was laying with one guy on the end almost, maybe three months before the liberation.</span> <span id="s672">At that time we knew every trick.</span> <span id="s673">You had, like I say, to be really strong to survive -- to make it.</span> <span id="s674">You couldn’t be down.</span> <span id="s675">If you would be down, in two days you wouldn’t be living.</span> <span id="s676">So, I said to my brother, “ You know what?</span> <span id="s677">We’re going out tonight to work.”</span> <span id="s678">This is the first time in four years, I said to my brother, “I feel like to stay home tonight.”</span> <span id="s679">At that moment, in that camp, that small camp we were in, there was not so much killing.</span> <span id="s680">And I said, “what I’m going to do -- I’m going to go out and pretend that I’m getting weak, and I’m falling down,’ which I did.</span> <span id="s681">That gypsy?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: The one who gave you the soup and you traded cigarettes, who helped your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s684">I says, “ I don’t feel so good.”</span> <span id="s685">I stood in the barracks.</span> <span id="s686">And all of a sudden, I didn’t feel good.</span> <span id="s687">And from there on, I wind up in a hospital.</span> <span id="s688">When you went for the hospital, that was not a hospital.</span> <span id="s689">It was a name -- “hospital” -- a name!</span> <span id="s690">Was a room!</span> <span id="s691">And I was laying in lice.</span> <span id="s692">Tons!</span> <span id="s693">Right now I can see this, this was in 1944.</span> <span id="s694">And if it was100 people, everybody was laying like this.</span> <span id="s695">(Sigh) So I was laying there a day, and I said, “ The heck!</span> <span id="s696">What the hell!</span> <span id="s697">I’m going to get out from here!”</span> <span id="s698">So they put me downstairs with another guy in one bed.</span> <span id="s699">He gave us a slice bread.</span> <span id="s700">I ate a slice.</span> <span id="s701">He had a slice bread.</span> <span id="s702">I talked to him.</span> <span id="s703">My brother came to see me.</span> <span id="s704">I felt it was so long I stood home a day.</span> <span id="s705">I wanted to rest up, maybe a few days.</span> <span id="s706">But if I would know where I wind up, I wouldn’t do this!</span> <span id="s707">He had a slice bread.</span> <span id="s708">He put it under the cushion.</span> <span id="s709">Fall asleep.</span> <span id="s710">At night I say -- the truth is from God!</span> <span id="s711">I can see him now -- I said to him, ‘ why don’t you move a little bit?”</span> <span id="s712">He was dead!</span> <span id="s713">I was laying all night with him!</span> <span id="s714">Didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s715">You know why?</span> <span id="s716">My body was dead.</span> <span id="s717">Every human body was dead.</span> <span id="s718">!</span> <span id="s719">Course, there was people that got sick.</span> <span id="s720">Most people could survive, as I said before .</span> <span id="s721">You can survive on a piece of bread and a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s722">You didn’t have anything else given to you.</span> <span id="s723">And this was going on for three years, for me.</span> <span id="s724">At home, we didn’t have much to eat, either.</span> <span id="s725">When mother brought something.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Potatoes…</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s728">Once some Germans came at home and says to me, “ You know how to ride horses?”</span> <span id="s729">I said, “Sure I will!”</span> <span id="s730">If you say “no” then it’s no good either.</span> <span id="s731">I said, ‘ Yes.”</span> <span id="s732">So I went over there to the palace.</span> <span id="s733">We had a palace in our town.</span> <span id="s734">It wasn’t good, because if would be burned down, there would be no Germans in our town.</span> <span id="s735">But still, in ’42, everybody, they took everybody to the train.</span> <span id="s736">And they sent them out to die!</span> <span id="s737">This was all over in Europe!</span> <span id="s738">So I went out with the German and in the farms with him, and we talked to each other like friend while we were riding in the little coach.</span> <span id="s739">I had two horses and he was asking me questions.</span> <span id="s740">He said, “ What do you think of these two horses?</span> <span id="s741">Should I trade in?”</span> <span id="s742">He says, “ Which one do you think I should trade?”</span> <span id="s743">And I says, “ The left one is fine.</span> <span id="s744">Maybe the right horse.</span> <span id="s745">Maybe we’ll trade in.”</span> <span id="s746">We’re on the farm.</span> <span id="s747">He said, “ Let’s go in here.</span> <span id="s748">How you like this horse?’</span> <span id="s749">“Fine.”</span> <span id="s750">We went in and traded.</span> <span id="s751">The farmers were so afraid.</span> <span id="s752">Stopped at a farm.</span> <span id="s753">Give us to eat -- the farmer -- and he gave us very much to eat, because first they thought I’m Polish, second they were afraid.</span> <span id="s754">They didn’t know who I am.</span> <span id="s755">While I was going like this, riding a horse, I see some Jewish people working on the farm.</span> <span id="s756">I slowed down.</span> <span id="s757">I had a feeling if he would have stopped then, I probably wouldn’t do them anything, because I would tell him.</span> <span id="s758">We got home.</span> <span id="s759">I said to him, what was his name, I can’t remember -- “Herr ‘What,’ vieleich kann haben bisschen mehl?”</span> <span id="s760">So he said, “ Sure!”</span> <span id="s761">I asked him for rye bread flour.</span> <span id="s762">Not for the good flour.</span> <span id="s763">I didn’t want to show him that I wanted the best one.</span> <span id="s764">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: That you had good taste.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: No.</span> <span id="s767">I said, “ I’d like to have some to make some bread.’</span> <span id="s768">He said, “ Sure!”</span> <span id="s769">Took about ten pounds.</span> <span id="s770">And the next day I said to my brother, “ The next day, if I go again.”</span> <span id="s771">He told me to go.</span> <span id="s772">So I told him I want to come to the other side village.</span> <span id="s773">You can go downtown with the armband.</span> <span id="s774">So he went to the other side -- all the way around -- and he met me and I said, “Vieleich kann haben bisschen mehl!”</span> <span id="s775">“White flour?”</span> <span id="s776">-- the good flour?</span> <span id="s777">So he gave me, “ Sure, now take it.”</span> <span id="s778">So while I was with him I felt kind of free with him.</span> <span id="s779">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s780">I think we were about 3,000,000 Jewish in Poland and everybody was killed off.</span> <span id="s781">They was killed off like nothing!</span> <span id="s782">Like nothing!</span> <span id="s783">You walked on the street.</span> <span id="s784">We as young boys, we used to wear hats -- everybody in Europe.</span> <span id="s785">It was the style here, too.</span> <span id="s786">Every time was the style -- we wore hats when we walk in the street.</span> <span id="s787">And we seen the Burgwemeister -- the mayor -- in town.</span> <span id="s788">He was half Polish and half German.</span> <span id="s789">And they were worse than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s790">They were much worse than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s791">And he had a brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: How can you be worse than a Nazi?</span> <span id="s793">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Well, you walk in the street.</span> <span id="s795">You take the hat off.</span> <span id="s796">He says, “ What do you think, am I your friend?”</span> <span id="s797">Slap your face.</span> <span id="s798">You didn’t take off your hat, he calls over, “ Come on over.</span> <span id="s799">Come over here.”</span> <span id="s800">He says, “ Why didn’t you took off your hat for me?”</span> <span id="s801">So there was no winner.</span> <span id="s802">An uncle of mine went, horses and wagon, to another town.</span> <span id="s803">You probably heard from that town -- Czestochowa?</span> <span id="s804">On the way, the Germans caught him.</span> <span id="s805">“Where you going?’</span> <span id="s806">Took away everything.</span> <span id="s807">Why” Because black market.</span> <span id="s808">They took some flour to another city.</span> <span id="s809">They make some money to be able to live.</span> <span id="s810">Because nobody supports you.</span> <span id="s811">Nobody gave you anything.</span> <span id="s812">You couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s813">Nobody said you have to have this and this.</span> <span id="s814">You had to do it on your own.</span> <span id="s815">If you couldn’t do it on your own, it’s too bad.</span> <span id="s816">They didn’t tell you it’s too bad.</span> <span id="s817">They just didn’t do anything for you.</span> <span id="s818">So they took him to the police to the Gestapo police, and he starts slapping the face.</span> <span id="s819">He says, “ Who hits you?”</span> <span id="s820">He says, “ I don’t know, I think the one guy was here.</span> <span id="s821">He had to make up a story that it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s822">They were so brutal!</span> <span id="s823">They were so brutal, we thought there was a time, if we ever survive, I think we are going to go out and slaughter every German -- we kill ‘em all out!</span> <span id="s824">Because we would have such power!</span> <span id="s825">But we lived with that big “mistake.”</span> <span id="s826">If you walk on the other side, it wasn’t good.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">B: At night, no light, that’s fine, everybody had the same thing.</span> <span id="s828">Every day they call us out of town and they made like don’t go to town, and then one day they said, “ No Jewish person should get out from the house!”</span> <span id="s829">Because a general was driving by.</span> <span id="s830">When they came to our town, the synagogue and the church was destroyed because a Polish officer not far from town start shooting on the freeway, which a very famous general got killed.</span> <span id="s831">Then they went and the staff destroyed the whole town.</span> <span id="s832">Three quarters of our town was burned down.</span> <span id="s833">And a Polish guy was in the church, started shooting out from the church, and they destroyed the church, the biggest church.</span> <span id="s834">And the synagogue was destroyed, but it was left walls.</span> <span id="s835">So the mayor’s brother-in-law called in all the people to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s836">They went in with a tallis.</span> <span id="s837">They went in to the synagogue and he told them-- the old people -- to put it on.</span> <span id="s838">Because they believed in God.</span> <span id="s839">In the synagogue, when it was destroyed, we worked.</span> <span id="s840">We took apart bricks from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s841">And the Poles could come and take them and build them back homes with the bricks from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s842">They told them to pray.</span> <span id="s843">And he said, “ Now can you tell me where God is?”</span> <span id="s844">Look at here!</span> <span id="s845">You’re praying --“ He took films.</span> <span id="s846">He made just fun.</span> <span id="s847">He took films so he can send home to his family to show them.</span> <span id="s848">Like now I can see it.</span> <span id="s849">And he said to them, “ Look, where is God?</span> <span id="s850">Can you tell me there is a God?</span> <span id="s851">I am God!”</span> <span id="s852">He said.</span> <span id="s853">“Look at here.</span> <span id="s854">You pray to God.</span> <span id="s855">You been praying this for two thousand years.</span> <span id="s856">And how could God go and destroy this synagogue?</span> <span id="s857">Let me, I should destroy you.</span> <span id="s858">Look at.”</span> <span id="s859">He takes out a pistol.</span> <span id="s860">He didn’t kill anybody at that time.</span> <span id="s861">“ Look at.</span> <span id="s862">See?</span> <span id="s863">If I take this, I got the power -- I’m God!</span> <span id="s864">I can kill anybody off here.”</span> <span id="s865">This was in ’44 -- and the Germans and the Americans are coming closer.</span> <span id="s866">They took us out from camp and they put us on cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: This happened shortly after you were in the basement of this hospital?</span> <span id="s868">That you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Right!</span> <span id="s870">From the hospital, from that camp, they took us.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: What happened is that you were in the hospital and then you realized…</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah!</span> <span id="s873">All of a sudden, the guy who died, he got his bread put under his pillow there.</span> <span id="s874">And the next morning, my brother comes in.</span> <span id="s875">He says, “ You know what?</span> <span id="s876">We’re going to leave everybody!”</span> <span id="s877">And I went, I got out right away from there.</span> <span id="s878">And we stay in the line already the same day, and we go on the trains.</span> <span id="s879">They going to send us out from here.</span> <span id="s880">Where we go, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: You didn’t know who was sending you, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Well, we thought they were going to send us out to die.</span> <span id="s883">Any time!</span> <span id="s884">When we left Poland to Germany, we didn’t know neither.</span> <span id="s885">We thought we’re going to die.</span> <span id="s886">Every time, we’re going to die.</span> <span id="s887">We got in trains -- cattle trains -- and we were there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s888">The train was going slow.</span> <span id="s889">They didn’t know where they’re going with us.</span> <span id="s890">We didn’t know where we’re going.</span> <span id="s891">And every train there was two Germans.</span> <span id="s892">At that time I started getting weak already!</span> <span id="s893">Again, I started getting weak!</span> <span id="s894">It was hot!</span> <span id="s895">Here I’m sitting with some guys talking, all of a sudden -- while I’m talking to them -- they’re already dead.</span> <span id="s896">Dead!</span> <span id="s897">So the Germans took them two people -- they should take them out and bury them any place.</span> <span id="s898">This was going on like this every day for two weeks.</span> <span id="s899">People already were dying off.</span> <span id="s900">It was too much already.</span> <span id="s901">The heat!</span> <span id="s902">The Germans didn’t the hell know where they’re going anyway.</span> <span id="s903">Later we found out they knew that the Americans were coming closer.</span> <span id="s904">They were mixed up, already.</span> <span id="s905">Then we stopped.</span> <span id="s906">There was only one German and they knew -- they were afraid for themselves, too.</span> <span id="s907">They thought, “ Maybe, any minute, American, if they come in.”</span> <span id="s908">they come in trouble.</span> <span id="s909">Maybe he wants to be good to us.</span> <span id="s910">Their Gestapo got signs and everything.</span> <span id="s911">So he says, “ Well, let’s go out!”</span> <span id="s912">Took a few guys.</span> <span id="s913">One German’s with us.</span> <span id="s914">One German went out to a small town there and went in the bakery, and stole all the bread and brought it back, and started passing out pieces of bread to everybody!</span> <span id="s915">And two guys start going -- walking away!</span> <span id="s916">Where would they go anyway?</span> <span id="s917">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s918">Where you going to?</span> <span id="s919">Go hide yourself.</span> <span id="s920">Where?</span> <span id="s921">To a German?</span> <span id="s922">They give you out right away.</span> <span id="s923">So while they’re walking away, the guy, he went and killed them.</span> <span id="s924">Gave us pieces of bread, and all of a sudden we start moving again.</span> <span id="s925">Slow motion.</span> <span id="s926">They start moving, and moving, and moving the train.</span> <span id="s927">All of a sudden, they stop the train, and there was Germans going out, and closing up!</span> <span id="s928">Outside, the machine guns were, because a lot of airplanes were.</span> <span id="s929">That was the last month.</span> <span id="s930">When they went, we could hear them going through – those bombers from America.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Oh, that’s the first time you knew the Americans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: The first time that we knew the Americans and then they told us, too.</span> <span id="s933">You could hear: V-v-v-v-v, the first time they went on Berlin!</span> <span id="s934">This was April already.</span> <span id="s935">And then we said to ourselves, “ What the heck!</span> <span id="s936">What is this going outside with the machine guns?</span> <span id="s937">They’re going to shoot us down!</span> <span id="s938">And destroy us!”</span> <span id="s939">Smart alecks.</span> <span id="s940">They came back in.</span> <span id="s941">They said, “ You know what guys?</span> <span id="s942">I think that you are going to be liberated pretty soon!”</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Who said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: That was the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s945">“ You’re going to be liberated pretty soon.</span> <span id="s946">And I tell you guys, I want you to do me a favor.</span> <span id="s947">Please.”</span> <span id="s948">Took off the coats.</span> <span id="s949">He said, “ Take off this from us.”</span> <span id="s950">He didn’t want to have the signs.</span> <span id="s951">Regular soldiers they wouldn’t be doing anything to “ It wasn’t our fault.</span> <span id="s952">We didn’t start the war.”</span> <span id="s953">They start talking to us.</span> <span id="s954">“We didn’t start the war.</span> <span id="s955">I’m the same human like you.</span> <span id="s956">I was given orders.</span> <span id="s957">I had to do the orders.”</span> <span id="s958">Every German said, “It’s not our fault!</span> <span id="s959">We only did the orders.’</span> <span id="s960">Everybody said the same thing.</span> <span id="s961">“And I think you’re going to be liberated any day now!</span> <span id="s962">Maybe won’t take longer than two days.”</span> <span id="s963">Then we said to ourselves, “ Oh my gosh!</span> <span id="s964">I wish we would be liberated!”</span> <span id="s965">To each other we were talking, slow motion.</span> <span id="s966">We would have killed ‘em off, right there!</span> <span id="s967">So went by two days, three days, four days.</span> <span id="s968">Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: And you didn’t take these off, or didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: We took them off anyways!</span> <span id="s971">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s972">And going on like this, finally we wind up in Czechoslovakia!</span> <span id="s973">And I was kind of a little weak.</span> <span id="s974">So many years!</span> <span id="s975">It wasn’t normal.</span> <span id="s976">We didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s977">There were days when you didn’t eat anything, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s978">Going out on cattle trains for two weeks!</span> <span id="s979">Where they going to get the bread for you?</span> <span id="s980">We didn’t have anything to eat!</span> <span id="s981">It was days -- two, three, four, five days – we didn’t eat anything!</span> <span id="s982">And my brother was kind of a little bit more healthy and stronger than me.</span> <span id="s983">You should have seen me --- bones!</span> <span id="s984">Whole body.</span> <span id="s985">No meat.</span> <span id="s986">Just bones.</span> <span id="s987">All the bones!</span> <span id="s988">And they took us off the stretchers, and then there was people around.</span> <span id="s989">They said, “ Oh, here is not dead.</span> <span id="s990">Here is not dead.’</span> <span id="s991">Because is the Czechoslovakia are taking care of.</span> <span id="s992">Czechoslovakia people was very good people.</span> <span id="s993">And they took us up in the hospital .</span> <span id="s994">You know what the hospital was?</span> <span id="s995">I think it was more than the one I was in the first one.</span> <span id="s996">Sostrichka we used to call them, because sostrichka, they wore -- like the nuns –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: You’re free now!</span> <span id="s998">You’re free now off this cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Free?</span> <span id="s1000">No!</span> <span id="s1001">Not yet!</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: You say the nuns took you to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: No!</span> <span id="s1004">No!</span> <span id="s1005">Because that town was -- thousands of Jewish people were there – Theresienstadt!</span> <span id="s1006">That’s the name from that camp was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: It’s another camp!</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1009">Actually this was not much working.</span> <span id="s1010">It was only the Germans send away old people there.</span> <span id="s1011">Like Czechoslovakia Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1012">See what I mean?</span> <span id="s1013">He still wanted to show from the war, he didn’t kill them off.</span> <span id="s1014">To give a little sample, if somebody’s going to be left, they shouldn’t say, “ He killed them all off.”</span> <span id="s1015">And it was old people there.</span> <span id="s1016">Czechoslovakia people most was there.</span> <span id="s1017">And then they sent some from Germany, too.</span> <span id="s1018">They used to have the Czechoslovakia military there.</span> <span id="s1019">It was a big barracks.</span> <span id="s1020">Big brick stones and everything.</span> <span id="s1021">And they took us off there.</span> <span id="s1022">And they talked to us.</span> <span id="s1023">And they said we shouldn’t worry.</span> <span id="s1024">You’re in good hands.</span> <span id="s1025">We are in good hands there because there was Germans, but mostly Czechoslovakian, working there.</span> <span id="s1026">And I was laying, it was on the attic, a house attic, but a big attic.</span> <span id="s1027">Laying there.</span> <span id="s1028">And they tried to help us as much as they could.</span> <span id="s1029">Went by a week, I went down to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1030">And my brother was in a different barrack.</span> <span id="s1031">They call on this side, “hospital.”</span> <span id="s1032">So my brother was on the other side.</span> <span id="s1033">And this was going on another four weeks, like this.</span> <span id="s1034">And I was there, and I didn’t see anything, but my brother seen more than me, because I was weak.</span> <span id="s1035">The only way he could come in to me, he had to smuggle himself in a certain place, so he came to see me a couple of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: How did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: He had a way to get in.</span> <span id="s1038">And he came in and he see me and he went back.</span> <span id="s1039">So, what happened, is, was May 7, ’45.</span> <span id="s1040">Outside, everyone started hollering and screaming and saying, “ You know what?</span> <span id="s1041">I think the Russians are close!”</span> <span id="s1042">I think any minute, I think we’re going to have the Russians!”</span> <span id="s1043">Because the Czechoslovakians told the people -- a lot of people, too -- that it’s like the Russians are this close.</span> <span id="s1044">And there were a lot of Germans there too.</span> <span id="s1045">They had an order in every camp, to destroy us the last minute!</span> <span id="s1046">All of a sudden -- it was on a Saturday night, I can’t forget this -- I’m looking out the window, and a bunch of guys says, “ Oh my gosh!”</span> <span id="s1047">All of a sudden, lights is off.</span> <span id="s1048">It’s no good sign, they took away the lights.</span> <span id="s1049">Then there’s no water!</span> <span id="s1050">They cut off everything -- the Germans!</span> <span id="s1051">Then they supposed to take us out and kill us off.</span> <span id="s1052">Everybody in every camp.</span> <span id="s1053">They had an order.</span> <span id="s1054">After we found out, but before we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1055">Because we knew, there’s no water, there’s no nothing any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">So I said to a bunch of friends, “ To heck with that!</span> <span id="s1057">I’m going to bed!</span> <span id="s1058">Whatever’s going to happen can happen!”</span> <span id="s1059">Went to bed.</span> <span id="s1060">Two o’clock I had to get up because there was so much noise.</span> <span id="s1061">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1062">We look outside.</span> <span id="s1063">We see people on tanks.</span> <span id="s1064">The Russians are here.</span> <span id="s1065">This was the next day -- May 8th.</span> <span id="s1066">May 7th, May 8th -- can’t forget those days.</span> <span id="s1067">And a lot of people got killed for joy -- hammering on the tanks – they got killed for joy, they were so happy and everything.</span> <span id="s1068">And I went downstairs and they opened up the gate.</span> <span id="s1069">Like we were free.</span> <span id="s1070">There were no Germans.</span> <span id="s1071">The Germans took off.</span> <span id="s1072">They were smart.</span> <span id="s1073">They opened the gate and everybody started running out!</span> <span id="s1074">And the tanks came.</span> <span id="s1075">(Crying) I was too weak again.</span> <span id="s1076">I went back to the house.</span> <span id="s1077">My brother came in when they opened the gate.</span> <span id="s1078">He says, “ I’m going to go out now.”</span> <span id="s1079">He went out and a lot of them killed a lot of Germans.</span> <span id="s1080">Took away everything, because they were riding on the wagons with horses.</span> <span id="s1081">They stopped them, they kicked them off.</span> <span id="s1082">They came in the homes and they said, “Take everything you want.”</span> <span id="s1083">And they brought back -- we all the time said, while we were in camp, “ If God gives us to live -- to survive -- the first thing we’re going to do is get a bread with a knife and slice the pieces, and eat up the whole bread,” because we could never believe we ever going to be able to have a whole lot of bread on our own, because we didn’t know that we’re going to survive -- they brought in the food.</span> <span id="s1084">My brother brought it in.</span> <span id="s1085">And I started eating a lot .</span> <span id="s1086">It wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s1087">I got sick.</span> <span id="s1088">More sick.</span> <span id="s1089">Thousands of people died.</span> <span id="s1090">Diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1091">I talked to a friend of mine from the same town.</span> <span id="s1092">Went in the washroom.</span> <span id="s1093">Dropped dead there.</span> <span id="s1094">It was going on like this a week.</span> <span id="s1095">Everybody got so sick.</span> <span id="s1096">They ate and they ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Your system can’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: I remember now, what I ate -- chocolate -- mixed up with all kinds of things that it’s impossible to believe, because there was no control over you.</span> <span id="s1099">Then my brother came up and started helping me.</span> <span id="s1100">If it wouldn’t have him I probably wouldn’t have survived.</span> <span id="s1101">All of a sudden, the Russians went and stopped everything.</span> <span id="s1102">Closed the gate.</span> <span id="s1103">They tried to take care of the people on this side hospital.</span> <span id="s1104">Tried not to give you to eat.</span> <span id="s1105">They gave you like a diet.</span> <span id="s1106">If they would be starting out from the beginning, it would be good.</span> <span id="s1107">So then I start feeling good.</span> <span id="s1108">Then I went out and I met one Russian guy and he just happened to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1109">He was very mad at Germany --Gehr-many he called them.</span> <span id="s1110">And I went out with a jeep with him.</span> <span id="s1111">I couldn’t speak his language, he couldn’t speak my language, but somehow we could communicate with each other.</span> <span id="s1112">The only thing I knew is, I asked him, “Ivrit?”</span> <span id="s1113">“Ivrit” is “Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1114">So he says, “Ivrit.”</span> <span id="s1115">And I told him how many we were killed, and he said the same thing.</span> <span id="s1116">He lost everybody.</span> <span id="s1117">Everybody got killed off to the Germans and he was very mad.</span> <span id="s1118">We had like eight days of freedom -- after May 8th -- eight days freedom in which everybody could go out and do whatever they wanted, but not those who were in hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">But there is so much to tell!</span> <span id="s1120">Like I told you about Buchenwald where people worked there, so hard.</span> <span id="s1121">You couldn’t die for hard work but you had to pull up those trains on your shoulders , and if you couldn’t pull, they killed you, right there.</span> <span id="s1122">Because they didn’t want so many people.</span> <span id="s1123">There was so much killing, I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s1124">It’s impossible to believe how brutal they were.</span> <span id="s1125">Everybody got their power in their own hand.</span> <span id="s1126">They could do whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s1127">Taking children and kill them.</span> <span id="s1128">Take off all the clothes and go in, take a bath.</span> <span id="s1129">Take the rings off, gold and everything to leave, and go in.</span> <span id="s1130">And gas.</span> <span id="s1131">And the kids.</span> <span id="s1132">First they put you on trains, which they had a certain chemical in the trains -- you couldn’t survive getting down to be killed, because you died right in the train, inside.</span> <span id="s1133">Packed!</span> <span id="s1134">Cattle’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1135">They packed you, squeezed you in.</span> <span id="s1136">And then we start making up Jewish songs in camp -- how the child says to the mother, and the child is crying -- for the Holocaust (reunion) in Israel, we went, and they sang, “ Where should I go?</span> <span id="s1137">There’s no way to go.</span> <span id="s1138">The whole world is closed for us.”</span> <span id="s1139">We went to the Holocaust [reunion].</span> <span id="s1140">I went with my wife.</span> <span id="s1141">She’s American, my wife.</span> <span id="s1142">It was something to see that.</span> <span id="s1143">Like somebody can say to me, “ Do you like to watch that?”</span> <span id="s1144">“Yea.</span> <span id="s1145">I like to watch it!”</span> <span id="s1146">Nobody should ever forget what happened.</span> <span id="s1147">I like to see everything.</span> <span id="s1148">I was right there.</span> <span id="s1149">I work with people -- American -- and they’ll be saying, “ Oh, there’s a German film, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1150">Do you like to watch it?”</span> <span id="s1151">I said, “ Sure I like to watch it, because I was right there.’</span> <span id="s1152">Because we cannot forget.</span> <span id="s1153">I wish my mother would come, in my dream.</span> <span id="s1154">I haven’t seen her since I left home.</span> <span id="s1155">There was a lot of people in home.</span> <span id="s1156">They said, “ If you ever survive, and you see there’s nobody left any more, would you go down to the stones and kiss the stone and ask the stones, Where are the people?</span> <span id="s1157">Where is my mother, father, brother and sister?</span> <span id="s1158">The stone would answer you.</span> <span id="s1159">The reason they said that, they didn’t believe that we’d be able to survive.</span> <span id="s1160">If we can, the stone is going to talk.</span> <span id="s1161">Isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s1162">Hitler didn’t know that, the Jewish people, he thought, were going to be destroyed for good.</span> <span id="s1163">But it isn’t so.</span> <span id="s1164">They’re going to be living forever!</span> <span id="s1165">So it was a very good experience; we went to Israel there, in the right time.</span> <span id="s1166">But it’s like when so-and-so said, “No, I don’t know how you people could ever stay and look and do whatever you wanted and not say a word, to the German.”</span> <span id="s1167">“Whatever they wanted, they did it with you and you didn’t say a word.”</span> <span id="s1168">Nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s1169">The Polish people didn’t helped us.</span> <span id="s1170">The Polish people could sell a Jew for ten pounds of sugar.</span> <span id="s1171">A German let out to the Polish people, “ If you bring me a Jew…” This was after everybody was taken away, after ’42.</span> <span id="s1172">Then a lot of people started hiding out -- a lot of people got left.</span> <span id="s1173">I’m not saying all Polish people were bad, but there should have been more good people in Poland.</span> <span id="s1174">There wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1175">He told them, “ For ten pounds sugar, if you can bring me Jew, then you have ten pound.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">B: In our town, I was with one guy, he was in the same first camp in Poland, work camp -- and his parents were rich at home.</span> <span id="s1177">One guy was a chauffeur -- a non-Jewish guy -- worked for this boy’s father.</span> <span id="s1178">So we were in camp.</span> <span id="s1179">He escaped from camp.</span> <span id="s1180">Where is he going?</span> <span id="s1181">He’s going home.</span> <span id="s1182">Home to whom?</span> <span id="s1183">You’ve got to have somebody to take you in, right?</span> <span id="s1184">Where would you go, if not to your own -- to the guy who worked for your father all the years -- supported you, gave you a home to live and everything, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: To the non-Jew who worked for his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: You know what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Turned him in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: It’s exactly what you said.</span> <span id="s1189">He said to him, “ You wait here.</span> <span id="s1190">I’m going to go out.</span> <span id="s1191">I’ll be right back.”</span> <span id="s1192">He brought in a Nazi, took him out and killed him.</span> <span id="s1193">I was back in Poland after the war for two months.</span> <span id="s1194">I didn’t go home.</span> <span id="s1195">Everybody was afraid to go home to their hometown.</span> <span id="s1196">Katowice was a town -- the biggest town, which in the First World War was a German town Poland took over -- I worked there as apprentice, too, in that town; where I lived was about seven kilometers -- I went to that town, Katowice.</span> <span id="s1197">It was at the German border.</span> <span id="s1198">When I got home, there was several places where Jewish found friends.</span> <span id="s1199">To be going home you risked your life to these Poles.</span> <span id="s1200">I don’t care what it is.</span> <span id="s1201">Any time I run into a Pole, I have a conversation, I tell him the same thing!</span> <span id="s1202">I tell him, “ You told us before the war we don’t belong there!</span> <span id="s1203">I was born there!</span> <span id="s1204">That’s my home!</span> <span id="s1205">.</span> <span id="s1206">But you said I don’t belong there.</span> <span id="s1207">I belong to Palestine!</span> <span id="s1208">.</span> <span id="s1209">They say, “Jew!</span> <span id="s1210">-- You go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s1211">They always used to tell us.</span> <span id="s1212">I’m not saying the whole country.</span> <span id="s1213">But they shouldn’t have been like that.</span> <span id="s1214">They shouldn’t have.</span> <span id="s1215">They should have helped us.</span> <span id="s1216">I wish we could have gone1 We couldn’t go!</span> <span id="s1217">The British didn’t let you in.</span> <span id="s1218">They gave you only so many people from Poland can leave every year, because they didn’t want to let you in anyway.</span> <span id="s1219">In Czechoslovakia, when the Russians came, they said, “ Okay.</span> <span id="s1220">Polish people can go to Poland, if you want to.</span> <span id="s1221">Where you from?</span> <span id="s1222">From Romania?</span> <span id="s1223">You want to go to Romania?</span> <span id="s1224">You can go to Romania.</span> <span id="s1225">You want to go to Poland?</span> <span id="s1226">If you’re from Poland, you’re not going to go to Romania or to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1227">The loudspeaker says, “ Everybody can go home.”</span> <span id="s1228">So everybody starts, here is Czechoslovak, here is Romania, Austria here.</span> <span id="s1229">So we went to the Polish side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1232">And other people, in a train.</span> <span id="s1233">We went home.</span> <span id="s1234">It didn’t take us long.</span> <span id="s1235">It wasn’t far.</span> <span id="s1236">We got home.</span> <span id="s1237">Got off.</span> <span id="s1238">We’re walking in the street.</span> <span id="s1239">I found a cousin.</span> <span id="s1240">I said, “ Oh, you’re Maryk?”</span> <span id="s1241">“Hi.”</span> <span id="s1242">He said, “ Oh hi.</span> <span id="s1243">How are you?”</span> <span id="s1244">He says, “ You know who else is here?</span> <span id="s1245">You got another cousin here, another cousin here.</span> <span id="s1246">They’re right over there.”</span> <span id="s1247">And we went over there.</span> <span id="s1248">And we stood with them for a while.</span> <span id="s1249">We slept there.</span> <span id="s1250">And then we went in to the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1251">In every big town there that’s what they would have, and they had names.</span> <span id="s1252">Like, if I came, I put down my name.</span> <span id="s1253">And everybody put down their names.</span> <span id="s1254">If somebody else came, they see, “ Oh, look at that, I found my brother…” A lot of people found brothers, sisters from these names.</span> <span id="s1255">From there I was another town, not far from that big town and we were there for a while.</span> <span id="s1256">All of a sudden, somebody came along and he says, “ Hey!</span> <span id="s1257">You’re a tailor, would you like to go work for my cousin?”</span> <span id="s1258">I say, “ All right.”</span> <span id="s1259">So then I went back to the big town, Katowice, where I used to be before, and I knew the town and everything.</span> <span id="s1260">And I was there two months.</span> <span id="s1261">I took the train to sleep with my cousin -- seven kilometer -- and I went in the morning.</span> <span id="s1262">At night I went home.</span> <span id="s1263">It wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s1264">But then there were a lot of people from our town.</span> <span id="s1265">They went home because they had a lot of money coming back from farmers -- from Polish people they left when they left to camps during the war.</span> <span id="s1266">So they came back.</span> <span id="s1267">They thought they going to stretch out the arms and say, “ I’m glad you came home!</span> <span id="s1268">I got everything what you left for me.</span> <span id="s1269">I give you back.”</span> <span id="s1270">And, “I’m so happy you’re back.”</span> <span id="s1271">No.</span> <span id="s1272">They were nice to them but you had to hide yourself.</span> <span id="s1273">They had a lot of parties --– Polish people, young guys -- that they just looked for a Jew, to kill ‘em.</span> <span id="s1274">You couldn’t believe your life!</span> <span id="s1275">I couldn’t believe that this would ever happen.</span> <span id="s1276">So those guys, they could stay with one, with Polish people, they knew them very good, overnight.</span> <span id="s1277">They used to come and knock at the door, “ Have you got somebody here, so-and-so!”</span> <span id="s1278">He said, “ No!”</span> <span id="s1279">During the day you could walk around.</span> <span id="s1280">You weren’t afraid.</span> <span id="s1281">But at night, you could stay by one family, and to sleep, you had to go someplace else, that they shouldn’t know that you been here.</span> <span id="s1282">During the day you might sleep here too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: You’re constantly running, even then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: It was not far from my town -- pogrom.</span> <span id="s1285">And this happened in 1945!</span> <span id="s1286">People take the trains.</span> <span id="s1287">They slide them out.</span> <span id="s1288">They killed them!</span> <span id="s1289">The name of the town is Kielce.</span> <span id="s1290">They killed them off.</span> <span id="s1291">A pogrom!</span> <span id="s1292">Nobody went home to their town.</span> <span id="s1293">Like I say, there wasn’t too many left.</span> <span id="s1294">Now if I were to go home, in our town, maybe, I could count them on my fingers.</span> <span id="s1295">Maybe 15, 20 people.</span> <span id="s1296">You wouldn’t want to be in town if you knew everything is gone.</span> <span id="s1297">The Jewish blood is there.</span> <span id="s1298">There’s nobody left.</span> <span id="s1299">Whoever was from small towns all over Poland, they came to the biggest town.</span> <span id="s1300">If they wanted to go, they could be in Warsaw and the town I was.</span> <span id="s1301">Several towns, they could be in.</span> <span id="s1302">Nobody touched you because it was more Jewish people already in there.</span> <span id="s1303">They should have been much better to us.</span> <span id="s1304">We didn’t do anything to them harm.</span> <span id="s1305">I was there about two months and all of a sudden I look out, I go out for lunch, I see that guy -- the boy who ran away and came to hide to that Polish guy who was the chauffeur, the one who worked for his father.</span> <span id="s1306">I seen him walking there!</span> <span id="s1307">And the Polish people told those guys, “ You know who came back?</span> <span id="s1308">This one came back, and he went over to this guy, and he…” They should have been good to us.</span> <span id="s1309">They didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s1310">Maybe 2%, probably suffered.</span> <span id="s1311">They didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s1312">(Sighs) You had no place to go, even if you would want to run away, to hide yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: What did you do after those two months that you worked again as tailor in a large city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: I worked and we’d help somebody and try to be occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: And your brother was still with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1317">Because I came home every night, because it didn’t take long.</span> <span id="s1318">Seven kilometers was four and a half miles.</span> <span id="s1319">Took a train.</span> <span id="s1320">Two months, we got back, and all of a sudden somebody comes along and says, “ You know who is over in Germany?</span> <span id="s1321">Your cousin!”</span> <span id="s1322">Which it was -- two sisters.</span> <span id="s1323">I stood with one sister, a girl, in one room; there was a lot of them, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s1324">And one cousin of hers left a day before I arrived in Poland from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1325">Where did she go?</span> <span id="s1326">She went back to Czechoslovakia because she worked there during the war with a Czech guy and they got married.</span> <span id="s1327">She was here last year, second time.</span> <span id="s1328">And she married him there and that’s why she went back.</span> <span id="s1329">She left her sister there in Germany.</span> <span id="s1330">Then one guy came and says, “ You know, her brother’s in Germany,” and he says, “ Let’s go back!”</span> <span id="s1331">So a whole group start going back, taking the train, smuggled through.</span> <span id="s1332">When we arrived in German, we missed each other.</span> <span id="s1333">He left for Poland because his girlfriend was in Poland.</span> <span id="s1334">He got there and he picked her up, and he came back with her.</span> <span id="s1335">And he took that sister, and the other sister got left in Czechoslovakia, and that’s how we were there in Germany up till ’49.</span> <span id="s1336">I was 27.</span> <span id="s1337">In ’49 we got brought over to the United States.</span> <span id="s1338">There’s people left for Canada, there’s people left for Australia, all over.</span> <span id="s1339">And we said, “ Well, maybe we’ll go to the United States.”</span> <span id="s1340">And that’s how we wind up</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: And did you and your brother come to the United States together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Did you go to New York?</span> <span id="s1344">Did you come right to Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And that’s where you met your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: No.</span> <span id="s1348">To Minneapolis and I didn’t stay long, stood six weeks, and I went right to work.</span> <span id="s1349">(Laughs) See, when you have a trade, you go to work.</span> <span id="s1350">I wish I wouldn’t have a trade.</span> <span id="s1351">I think it would be better.</span> <span id="s1352">(Laughter) and somebody came along, “ How about going to Fargo, North Dakota?”</span> <span id="s1353">I said, “Well, what’s the difference?’</span> <span id="s1354">I didn’t know Minneapolis, I didn’t know Fargo.</span> <span id="s1355">I might as well go to Fargo.</span> <span id="s1356">So I go and tell my boss, “ I’m going to leave.”</span> <span id="s1357">He said, “ what do you mean, you’re going to leave!”</span> <span id="s1358">Almost fainted.</span> <span id="s1359">He didn’t pay me much, and he figured I’m a good worker and he thought he’s going to keep me for a while!</span> <span id="s1360">“ How do you go?”</span> <span id="s1361">he said.</span> <span id="s1362">“ I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1363">“What do you mean you don’t know?</span> <span id="s1364">You’re a newcomer,” he says, “ You just came over, but you’re not that dumb!”</span> <span id="s1365">I said, “ I don’t know!’</span> <span id="s1366">“ Who told you?”</span> <span id="s1367">“ I don’t know, some guy.”</span> <span id="s1368">“ What do you mean, some guy!”</span> <span id="s1369">(Laughter) The guy that I’m supposed to work for, he was a German, American German.</span> <span id="s1370">It was good, because I could talk to him.</span> <span id="s1371">I got there to Fargo, and I had it very good in Fargo!</span> <span id="s1372">Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: What years did you live in Fargo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: In the 50s.</span> <span id="s1375">I had it good.</span> <span id="s1376">When I got to Fargo, he already arranged me in the Y.M.C.A., a few blocks off Broadway, a side street.</span> <span id="s1377">And I went to his house first -- he picked me up from the bus depot -- and we ate there.</span> <span id="s1378">I almost bust my stomach, I ate so much!</span> <span id="s1379">And we were talking!</span> <span id="s1380">This was a Sunday night.</span> <span id="s1381">And then he took me over to the Y.M.C.A., and Monday morning I went to work already.</span> <span id="s1382">I met a friend.</span> <span id="s1383">He was from Norway and I could speak to him German, so he could speak.</span> <span id="s1384">He worked for Goodman, a Goodman Jewelry on Broadway.</span> <span id="s1385">Later I heard they closed up.</span> <span id="s1386">And I had Fein, and he tried to introduce me to a lot of Jewish people across the street, to one German Jewish guy in there and then Strauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Strauss clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Strauss clothing.</span> <span id="s1389">One of them was a vice president of a bank, too.</span> <span id="s1390">From the bank right on the corner.</span> <span id="s1391">(Laughs) He knew a lot of Jewish people too.</span> <span id="s1392">That one I worked for -- the store name was Howards -- his name was Deniver.</span> <span id="s1393">Two people, they didn’t have any kids.</span> <span id="s1394">He gave me, the same week, everything, a hat and a suit.</span> <span id="s1395">I should pick out everything.</span> <span id="s1396">He only wanted I should stay with him.</span> <span id="s1397">Finally somebody found me, from the Mount Sinai Temple.</span> <span id="s1398">It was on Broadway, upstairs, and the Rabbi who was in the Mount Sinai Temple, were two brothers -- one was in Mount Sinai Temple here in St. Paul and one of them was in Fargo -- and they both were German Jews.</span> <span id="s1399">They came over.</span> <span id="s1400">I think they left in 1938, a year before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1401">Every Friday night, they picked me up from the Y.M.C.A., me with another American boy -- he was from New York -- and we stayed at the Y.M.C.A. , and they picked us up and we went to eat in his house and then we went over to the synagogue, introduced to everybody, then they found out who I am.</span> <span id="s1402">They wanted to know everything, how the past was.</span> <span id="s1403">And almost twice a week some Jewish family picked me up.</span> <span id="s1404">Oh, yes, Fargo - they were so nice to me.</span> <span id="s1405">And they called me up, “ Ben you wait and I pick you up and you come over to my house.’</span> <span id="s1406">Every Friday night in a different house was a party.</span> <span id="s1407">I like to eat.</span> <span id="s1408">And everybody was sitting around.</span> <span id="s1409">They wanted to hear my story, what happened to me in the past.</span> <span id="s1410">And I was only talking in mostly Yiddish, and everybody understood.</span> <span id="s1411">Not the young ones, but the middle aged, they understood.</span> <span id="s1412">It was a very nice town and I was there about eight months.</span> <span id="s1413">I came back to the city.</span> <span id="s1414">I stayed a year.</span> <span id="s1415">In 1955 I got married, and I got two lovely boys, and one, he’ll be 22.</span> <span id="s1416">He was already in real estate, and it didn’t work out too good in real estate.</span> <span id="s1417">And the other one is 19 and going on 20, so he’s in the second year of college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So when they ask you how you survived, how do you answer them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: We had to.</span> <span id="s1420">You could survive on a slice of bread and a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s1421">You could live for several years.</span> <span id="s1422">You lived with that.</span> <span id="s1423">You didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1424">You were hungry, but if you didn’t have, you work, too.</span> <span id="s1425">If you opened a Frigidaire and it’s empty, for example, there’s nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1426">What can you do?</span> <span id="s1427">But if you open a Frigidaire and in the Frigidaire there’s something, you’re going to eat.</span> <span id="s1428">And that’s how it was going on, day by day.</span> <span id="s1429">If we could have the peels from the potatoes, if we went down to the kitchen -- outside in the garbage -- and pick up some peels, this would be like gold to eat.</span> <span id="s1430">But if you couldn’t get those peels, neither, because they wouldn’t want you to eat this -- not because they didn’t want you to eat, you’re going to get sick -- they didn’t want you to have anything to eat except a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s1431">But again, if you work all day hard and if you didn’t know how to manage yourself with working you could get yourself more weak.</span> <span id="s1432">And when every day id going on like this you get weak and then just pass out, like nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: You’ve mentioned a number of times that you felt like your body was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Everybody’s body was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: But something had to be alive -- your mind or your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1437">For example, we have a dog.</span> <span id="s1438">I take him for a walk every time I come home from work.</span> <span id="s1439">He’s already used to that.</span> <span id="s1440">He’s waiting for me to take him for a walk.</span> <span id="s1441">You get used to it.</span> <span id="s1442">A couple years ago, he didn’t feel good, his leg was something wrong.</span> <span id="s1443">I felt so bad, I’d like to cry.</span> <span id="s1444">I could not see anybody should get hurt.</span> <span id="s1445">He cannot speak up what hurts him, so we took him to the doctor.</span> <span id="s1446">He gave him something.</span> <span id="s1447">He healed him up.</span> <span id="s1448">There’s times he walks around, I see he doesn’t feel good.</span> <span id="s1449">Everybody feels bad.</span> <span id="s1450">The kids, terrible.</span> <span id="s1451">They love.</span> <span id="s1452">They get very pained.</span> <span id="s1453">Very much!</span> <span id="s1454">It’s inherited.</span> <span id="s1455">They know!</span> <span id="s1456">It’s not that they showing that it’s like for me, but maybe it’s a kind of hurt, like it comes from, like, if somebody takes out a pistol, a gun, to show me, I say, “ No, no.</span> <span id="s1457">Stay away, stay away.’</span> <span id="s1458">Because I was burned already.</span> <span id="s1459">I seen guns every minute.</span> <span id="s1460">That’s when I meant there’s the body, dead.</span> <span id="s1461">“ Where should I go if the street is closed up?”</span> <span id="s1462">--you know, that’s a Jewish song we made up during the time, and it’s going on in Israel; it’s in English, too, the song -- in other words, there was no way for us to go.</span> <span id="s1463">That’s why you got to be there, and you got to die there.</span> <span id="s1464">And we seen them taking the men from that camp with a little pistol like this here.</span> <span id="s1465">They used to carry it like this.</span> <span id="s1466">At night you were laying with your clothes on, sleeping.</span> <span id="s1467">How clean could you be?</span> <span id="s1468">if you were laying in your clothes?</span> <span id="s1469">People could get sick just from the stripes.</span> <span id="s1470">Lay on the top, people in underneath.</span> <span id="s1471">If somebody need to go out in the washroom they didn’t go out, they did it right there, and the water was coming through.</span> <span id="s1472">They were afraid to go out in the washroom; if you walk out they kill you.</span> <span id="s1473">There was nowhere to go!</span> <span id="s1474">Everything was closed up for us.</span> <span id="s1475">You try to help yourself.</span> <span id="s1476">Why should I go ask for it?</span> <span id="s1477">To be killed?</span> <span id="s1478">So that’s why every body was closed, was dead.</span> <span id="s1479">It wouldn’t be dead, we would have to go out and fight for it.</span> <span id="s1480">When they picked us up from the freeway, it happened it was maybe 20 kilometers from our house.</span> <span id="s1481">I was out in the field.</span> <span id="s1482">I had to go out in the washroom in the field at that time.</span> <span id="s1483">All of a sudden I look out there and I seen Germans!</span> <span id="s1484">Everybody goes in the truck!</span> <span id="s1485">I couldn’t hide myself.</span> <span id="s1486">Where am I going to hide?</span> <span id="s1487">Where am I going to go from there?</span> <span id="s1488">So I figured, “ I’m going out.</span> <span id="s1489">I’m going to walk out there.</span> <span id="s1490">What happened to everybody is going to happen to me”.</span> <span id="s1491">Who is going to hide me?</span> <span id="s1492">Where am I going to go?</span> <span id="s1493">To a Pole, say, ‘I want to hide myself?”</span> <span id="s1494">They’re going to say, “ Oh, yes, you’re a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1495">They’re going to say, “I am afraid!”</span> <span id="s1496">They find out, he’s going to be killed, so why would he do this for me?</span> <span id="s1497">He wouldn’t do for me anything.</span> <span id="s1498">So I went out.</span> <span id="s1499">Like I said before, everybody’s body, because they wouldn’t be dead, we would fight back.</span> <span id="s1500">We would kill Germans.</span> <span id="s1501">We didn’t do anything to them because we know this.</span> <span id="s1502">If one Germans would be killed by a Jewish guy, in town, they would take the whole town out and kill them off.</span> <span id="s1503">So your arms like locked up.</span> <span id="s1504">And the body was dead.</span> <span id="s1505">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1506">They said, “Come,” we came.</span> <span id="s1507">That’s why mine older one says, “ Why didn’t you fight?’</span> <span id="s1508">He says to me now, “ I’m not going to be like that.</span> <span id="s1509">I’m proud to be a Jew!</span> <span id="s1510">I’m not going to be like that.</span> <span id="s1511">If somebody’s going to say to me bad, I’m going to tell him back.</span> <span id="s1512">I’m not going to keep my mouth shut,” he said.</span> <span id="s1513">“I’m going to speak up for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: And what do you say to him when he says that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I don’t say.</span> <span id="s1516">If I don’t say anything, means he’s right.</span> <span id="s1517">A lot of times I get scared.</span> <span id="s1518">I can sit like this, somebody comes in, and I’ll jump.</span> <span id="s1519">This is my feeling.</span> <span id="s1520">I’ve got to be occupied always.</span> <span id="s1521">I would say most people is the same from what they went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Do you relax?</span> <span id="s1523">Do you just sit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Hardly.</span> <span id="s1525">And I like it this way.</span> <span id="s1526">I can drive home in a car and sometimes it came in my mind, and the tears come, I start crying.</span> <span id="s1527">They say sometimes it’s better you cry.</span> <span id="s1528">It’s out.</span> <span id="s1529">And you just cry because how could this ever happen, something like this?</span> <span id="s1530">What’s going on over there in Israel, it’s like this: not everybody can be living there!</span> <span id="s1531">Around the world there’ve got to be Jewish people, too.</span> <span id="s1532">Not only over there.</span> <span id="s1533">To see, to fight, for Israel to survive.</span> <span id="s1534">I’m with Begin 100%, what he’s doing.</span> <span id="s1535">Because there isn’t a thing that he doesn’t do, because he comes from our home, where we were born -- this is in Poland -- in which the Poles said, “ This is not your home!</span> <span id="s1536">Your home is in Palestine!”</span> <span id="s1537">Was very much anti-Semitism in Poland in my time, when I was 12 years old, after we lost our president.</span> <span id="s1538">Somebody else came around and he wasn’t so good.</span> <span id="s1539">So we knew right away it’s going to be a change.</span> <span id="s1540">And that certain day, in the paper, right away it was no good.</span> <span id="s1541">Begin, he’s doing good.</span> <span id="s1542">He knows what he’s doing because he lived there!</span> <span id="s1543">He ran away!</span> <span id="s1544">Just happened he was lucky.</span> <span id="s1545">He ran away from Poland.</span> <span id="s1546">Wound up in Russia.</span> <span id="s1547">He was in Russia imprisoned for a couple years. ’</span> <span id="s1548">44, he took off.</span> <span id="s1549">Somehow they got in to Palestine in ’44.</span> <span id="s1550">He started fighting.</span> <span id="s1551">A lot of people were fighting the British before -- that’s 1933 -- as I was a child.</span> <span id="s1552">I remember everybody went to pray to the synagogues, to God, they should be left.</span> <span id="s1553">And they hanged them anyway.</span> <span id="s1554">They caught them making sabotage for the British.</span> <span id="s1555">He’s tough.</span> <span id="s1556">He has to be tough.</span> <span id="s1557">You got to survive.</span> <span id="s1558">If you cannot do now on your own, then it’s no good.</span> <span id="s1559">No Israel!</span> <span id="s1560">There isn’t too many Jewish people left.</span> <span id="s1561">The most, the majority, is here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1562">It’s not to say you got to be a Zionist to be going over to Israel to live there.</span> <span id="s1563">You don’t have to live.</span> <span id="s1564">You only have to think about that.</span> <span id="s1565">If they survive, the Jewish people can survive here.</span> <span id="s1566">God forbid, if they cannot survive, Jewish people cannot survive.</span> <span id="s1567">Because if we would have a state before the war, this wouldn’t happen in Europe.</span> <span id="s1568">Israel would know about it.</span> <span id="s1569">Particularly what happened before the war.</span> <span id="s1570">And people could have emigrated.</span> <span id="s1571">And we have other countries too.</span> <span id="s1572">The United States don’t make anything if you want to leave; you leave.</span> <span id="s1573">If you want to go to Israel, you can go.</span> <span id="s1574">You can have two citizen papers.</span> <span id="s1575">You can go over there and be a citizen, and be an American citizen, too.</span> <span id="s1576">From other Old World countries, they can leave, too.</span> <span id="s1577">As I say, if this would have happened like this before the war -- would be a State -- it wouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s1578">What they wanted, just to survive.</span> <span id="s1579">Is only just 3,000,000 Jewish people living there.</span> <span id="s1580">Why shouldn’t they have their power?</span> <span id="s1581">You’ve got to be tough to survive.</span> <span id="s1582">If you’re not going to fight for it, you’re not going to survive.</span> <span id="s1583">Then I’m going back to Germany again.</span> <span id="s1584">They didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1585">It was no homeland.</span> <span id="s1586">The German Jews said, before, “ I’m German, never mind I’m a Jew.’</span> <span id="s1587">They couldn’t believe this going to happen.</span> <span id="s1588">It can happen all over the world like this -- what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1589">Can happen all over.</span> <span id="s1590">Much worse!</span> <span id="s1591">Why?</span> <span id="s1592">Because everybody going here have the gun!</span> <span id="s1593">People got to have somebody to fight!</span> <span id="s1594">The Russian don’t need the Jewish people in Russia.</span> <span id="s1595">What do they need them for?</span> <span id="s1596">They got plenty of people of their own.</span> <span id="s1597">But they don’t want to leave them out!</span> <span id="s1598">Even to go to Israel!</span> <span id="s1599">They leave them out little by little.</span> <span id="s1600">But with whom are they going to fight?</span> <span id="s1601">The Arab countries, they’re fighting among each other.</span> <span id="s1602">They wouldn’t have Israel, they would fight more with each other.</span> <span id="s1603">It is the truth.</span> <span id="s1604">They’ve got to have something.</span> <span id="s1605">What happened last year in Poland?</span> <span id="s1606">Who’d they blame?</span> <span id="s1607">Jewish people!</span> <span id="s1608">You know what they said.</span> <span id="s1609">10,000 people.</span> <span id="s1610">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s1611">It’s a big lie.</span> <span id="s1612">It’s 500 people living there.</span> <span id="s1613">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1614">The whole Poland.</span> <span id="s1615">But the propaganda -- “ The Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1616">They the ones start it.</span> <span id="s1617">They’re the ones to blame!”</span> <span id="s1618">Out of the 500, probably half are on the Polish side, anyway.</span> <span id="s1619">Convert!</span> <span id="s1620">There’s no people.</span> <span id="s1621">First people from Poland went out.</span> <span id="s1622">Second time they went out, in ’60, they told them, if they’re not going to leave, they cannot leave any more.</span> <span id="s1623">The only people that are left -- most of them -- is the Romanian.</span> <span id="s1624">In Poland, the first thing, they have to blame.</span> <span id="s1625">So who are they going to blame?</span> <span id="s1626">“ Jewish people,” they say, “ They’re to blame.”</span> <span id="s1627">One person gets up and start talking.</span> <span id="s1628">Then everybody is against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">My mother -- I never seen her since I left.</span> <span id="s1630">She came with my sisters and brothers, the youngest.</span> <span id="s1631">The youngest at that time was a girl who was four years old.</span> <span id="s1632">One brother, the older one, got killed in Brunshaven.</span> <span id="s1633">I didn’t come home till the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1634">I came home Friday morning.</span> <span id="s1635">Six o’clock in the morning!</span> <span id="s1636">The cousin had a truck.</span> <span id="s1637">Not everybody could afford to have this.</span> <span id="s1638">The truck was going from where I worked in that town, to Warsaw, forth and back.</span> <span id="s1639">And I hadn’t seen her since.</span> <span id="s1640">Then they took and draft him; he went in the army in ’39.</span> <span id="s1641">He was supposed to come home for a week.</span> <span id="s1642">And he didn’t want to come home.</span> <span id="s1643">My mother wrote and told me that he wants to come home six months later, for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1644">He never came home.</span> <span id="s1645">Mother was crying.</span> <span id="s1646">She saw everybody’s coming home, he’s not coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">B: I tell you it’s hard to believe, a lot of people ask me, “ How did you survive?’</span> <span id="s1648">I can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1649">I don’t believe it myself!</span> <span id="s1650">I was there!</span> <span id="s1651">My memory is good.</span> <span id="s1652">Names is no good.</span> <span id="s1653">But to remember, I remember everything!</span> <span id="s1654">I remember everything!</span> <span id="s1655">The last day we went home from the factory, I said to my brother -- I have to swear it to you, because it is so true – “Joe!</span> <span id="s1656">What’re we gonna do now?”</span> <span id="s1657">We’re going home to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1658">From that day we supposed to leave for Germany.</span> <span id="s1659">We didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s1660">We thought, we gonna die!</span> <span id="s1661">They told us Germany.</span> <span id="s1662">And somebody came back and said, “ Oh, it’s terrible to go home now!</span> <span id="s1663">The guy with the hump in the back, he goes, Come on here!</span> <span id="s1664">No reason!</span> <span id="s1665">He calls you out and you going.</span> <span id="s1666">And we didn’t even know where.</span> <span id="s1667">He probably took him in back, and he killed him off.</span> <span id="s1668">For nothing!”</span> <span id="s1669">So we go home.</span> <span id="s1670">At that day they was taken away -- everybody.</span> <span id="s1671">And they went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1672">(Sigh) They took us that day out on the High Holiday.</span> <span id="s1673">So we fast that day.</span> <span id="s1674">We didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1675">Boss comes over to us.</span> <span id="s1676">He didn’t wear the Nazi uniform, he was a civilian, because he worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s1677">He was watching us.</span> <span id="s1678">He was the boss in the factory.</span> <span id="s1679">And he says to us, “ How come you’re not eating?’</span> <span id="s1680">We says, “ We’re not eating today.</span> <span id="s1681">We know what today is.</span> <span id="s1682">We fast today.</span> <span id="s1683">Today’s our High Holiday.”</span> <span id="s1684">We didn’t want to eat.</span> <span id="s1685">We knew where they’re going.</span> <span id="s1686">I had friends -- a lot of Polish good people, too.</span> <span id="s1687">In our town was one Jewish guy, a neighbor of ours, he hide himself.</span> <span id="s1688">His five children they took away in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">And he hide himself on a farm, which he did very big business with a farmer.</span> <span id="s1690">And he went out there and hide himself, and he let himself grow a long beard, with a cane, and he used to come downtown, once a week.</span> <span id="s1691">Most people didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s1692">He walked.</span> <span id="s1693">Was about four-and-a-half miles, he came in town.</span> <span id="s1694">And a few Polish people he knew, so he stooped over.</span> <span id="s1695">They thought is a Polish guy.</span> <span id="s1696">Nobody knew he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1697">But the one who he stopped, they knew he’s Jewish because he was his best friend.</span> <span id="s1698">Now there’s more.</span> <span id="s1699">Certain people, they couldn’t go out and say, “ Oh, here’s a Jew,” because something like this happens, that people could hide themselves with beards.</span> <span id="s1700">There was places that they used to hide themselves -- in attics.</span> <span id="s1701">Polish people used to hide Jewish people in attics.</span> <span id="s1702">And if they caught them, they killed off the Polish people, too.</span> <span id="s1703">I have one friend, he lives in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1704">He was in Russia, and he got in the woods.</span> <span id="s1705">He lived there for three years in the woods.</span> <span id="s1706">They had the ammunition, and they had machine guns.</span> <span id="s1707">He told me stories.</span> <span id="s1708">They met some Russians.</span> <span id="s1709">The Russians wanted to kill them off.</span> <span id="s1710">They didn’t know who they are.</span> <span id="s1711">Partisan!</span> <span id="s1712">And they had to eat, they went out to farmers, and they gave them everything, because they were afraid for their lives.</span> <span id="s1713">They wouldn’t dare say to Germans, “ You know, some Jewish people came over here.”</span> <span id="s1714">Because if something would happen to one Jewish guy, the whole town would be up in the air.</span> <span id="s1715">He was there about three years, living in the woods like this.</span> <span id="s1716">And he saw his brother, his own brother was going in a place, and he saw the Germans kill him off.</span> <span id="s1717">They killed a lot of Germans in the woods.</span> <span id="s1718">Took away the machine guns and practically everything from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">There are times you feel so depressed.</span> <span id="s1720">It comes to you, in the dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Does that happen to you often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: No.</span> <span id="s1723">I try not to let myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: What do you do so that doesn’t happen, besides keep busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: When I drive I start talking and I start thinking about way back.</span> <span id="s1726">How can this ever happen to human life?</span> <span id="s1727">I tell a lot of people here -- American people -- not the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1728">You get together.</span> <span id="s1729">You make conversation.</span> <span id="s1730">How could this ever happen!</span> <span id="s1731">To say, “ You have a right to live.</span> <span id="s1732">I don’t have a right to live.”</span> <span id="s1733">Why don’t you have a right to live?</span> <span id="s1734">Why don’t I have the same right as you?</span> <span id="s1735">That’s what they told us.</span> <span id="s1736">So I’m supposed to die.</span> <span id="s1737">And everybody got the power in their own hand.</span> <span id="s1738">They could do everything.</span> <span id="s1739">That camp -- the one we left, when I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1740">We were in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1741">It’s like I can see it right now.</span> <span id="s1742">My brother ate up the slice bread.</span> <span id="s1743">Right now I see it.</span> <span id="s1744">It was in the evening, maybe eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s1745">He took the slice bread and he finished.</span> <span id="s1746">I always like to last longer.</span> <span id="s1747">Then he asked me for another piece.</span> <span id="s1748">You haven’t got it, you open the Frigidaire.</span> <span id="s1749">There isn’t anything in there.</span> <span id="s1750">There’s nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1751">And then we go to bed.</span> <span id="s1752">We both sleeping upstairs, and downstairs in two beds somebody else sleeping.</span> <span id="s1753">All of a sudden I hear, “ Boom!”</span> <span id="s1754">The main thing, I was going to get to that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1755">I didn’t care what the heck’s going on!</span> <span id="s1756">I want to find my piece of sliced bread!</span> <span id="s1757">It’s dark.</span> <span id="s1758">Everything was shaking down, the bed and everything, and I say, “ What’s going on?</span> <span id="s1759">What is it?</span> <span id="s1760">A bomb they dropped?”</span> <span id="s1761">It’s dark, and I’m looking all over.</span> <span id="s1762">Finally I found the slice bread.</span> <span id="s1763">I put it in my pocket, and got my shoes.</span> <span id="s1764">We slept in clothes anyway -- two piece pajamas, that’s what it was!</span> <span id="s1765">And we go out.</span> <span id="s1766">“ Oh my gosh!</span> <span id="s1767">It’s burning.</span> <span id="s1768">The factory’s burning.”</span> <span id="s1769">Did we have it tough!</span> <span id="s1770">I wished this would not have happened.</span> <span id="s1771">You don’t know how tough we had it after that.</span> <span id="s1772">American bombed the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">We had one guy there -- a German.</span> <span id="s1774">He was “brute” side.</span> <span id="s1775">We always used to say, “ I wonder if he’s not a spy.”</span> <span id="s1776">Like he would be more on the American side.</span> <span id="s1777">He was “ talking tough.”</span> <span id="s1778">They were all ‘talking tough.”</span> <span id="s1779">The only thing we said, “ If we have to die, we should know how it comes -- from where.”</span> <span id="s1780">So.</span> <span id="s1781">Dropped the bomb, on the factory.</span> <span id="s1782">We were the dayshift.</span> <span id="s1783">We were home at night.</span> <span id="s1784">We went out right away.</span> <span id="s1785">And the Germans brought those dogs -- shepherd -- on the leash, and they start barking.</span> <span id="s1786">They wanted we should be in one place.</span> <span id="s1787">You don’t fight them.</span> <span id="s1788">They thought maybe we can escape!</span> <span id="s1789">Five thousand people?</span> <span id="s1790">We were 5,000 people in our camp.</span> <span id="s1791">We were out in the field.</span> <span id="s1792">All night.</span> <span id="s1793">When it got daylight, we went down to the factory and we had to start cleaning up.</span> <span id="s1794">One guy from our town comes out and he says, ‘ Ben!</span> <span id="s1795">Take a look here!”</span> <span id="s1796">(Cries) “I can’t even peek.</span> <span id="s1797">Why ask!”</span> <span id="s1798">The arms were here.</span> <span id="s1799">He recognized his brother.</span> <span id="s1800">He worked dayshift and the other, his brother, worked nightshift.</span> <span id="s1801">He was in the factory.</span> <span id="s1802">He was killed.</span> <span id="s1803">His head was this way.</span> <span id="s1804">I can see it now.</span> <span id="s1805">And his arms was in a different place, and he recognized it.</span> <span id="s1806">(Sighs) And then we had to start cleaning up.</span> <span id="s1807">We had so tough at that time.</span> <span id="s1808">Then you know whom they send out?</span> <span id="s1809">The Hitler Jugend.</span> <span id="s1810">Those are the brutalist Nazi -- the young -- the youth!</span> <span id="s1811">They were the worst ones, because they trained them from that certain age to become Nazi, Gestapos.</span> <span id="s1812">Did they give us a lecture!</span> <span id="s1813">They’re children -- 12, 13 years old -- and they were with the guns!</span> <span id="s1814">“ Come on!”</span> <span id="s1815">Beat us up!</span> <span id="s1816">When you worked in the fields!</span> <span id="s1817">For no reason!</span> <span id="s1818">We didn’t need to do anything in the fields.</span> <span id="s1819">Just to keep us occupied, we took some sand from here and put it over here, and we took some water and mixed it with the sand, and from this side we put it over.</span> <span id="s1820">That’s what we did.</span> <span id="s1821">Just to keep you occupied.</span> <span id="s1822">Shoveled sand.</span> <span id="s1823">Picked up.</span> <span id="s1824">Put on this side.</span> <span id="s1825">Took some water.</span> <span id="s1826">Made mud.</span> <span id="s1827">Then take the mud.</span> <span id="s1828">Put it on the other side again.</span> <span id="s1829">To get you not to be free!</span> <span id="s1830">Not to arise!</span> <span id="s1831">To be a slave right away.</span> <span id="s1832">And for no reason!</span> <span id="s1833">And they give us a lecture!</span> <span id="s1834">America!</span> <span id="s1835">“ Oh my gosh, we suffered.”</span> <span id="s1836">They wanted to help us?</span> <span id="s1837">It’s worse there for us!</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: When was that?</span> <span id="s1839">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: That was before we left.</span> <span id="s1841">Six months before.</span> <span id="s1842">We build up the factory right away, started work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: So did you think that you would be liberated soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: No.</span> <span id="s1845">We didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1846">The only thing was going around with us just like rumors.</span> <span id="s1847">But then we found out through the gypsy.</span> <span id="s1848">He told us that the American bomb was dropped.</span> <span id="s1849">He showed us.</span> <span id="s1850">We saw the big hole.</span> <span id="s1851">Really deep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: This was before Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1854">Six months before, I would say.</span> <span id="s1855">They build up the factory right away.</span> <span id="s1856">First we worked outside.</span> <span id="s1857">Four people work by one item.</span> <span id="s1858">Three people couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s1859">Had to be four because you had to pick up bombs in a sort of thing that you have to lift.</span> <span id="s1860">And if you did this all day, it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s1861">I had it good for a while -- a good foreman.</span> <span id="s1862">So when we came to work he said, “ Ten people working here, ten people here, and ten people here.”</span> <span id="s1863">So nine couldn’t work here anymore.</span> <span id="s1864">Had to be ten people.</span> <span id="s1865">There was a time I just walked away when I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: You have to know how to outsmart people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: The main thing that was important -- to count how many is.</span> <span id="s1868">To go home.</span> <span id="s1869">If you came in with 200, you have to bring 200 back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1870">So you start counting ,” Ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, zehn…” Then we had to walk to work with songs.</span> <span id="s1871">We had to sing German songs.</span> <span id="s1872">They taught us a song.</span> <span id="s1873">And you know what we sung?</span> <span id="s1874">“ We have you in Hell!”</span> <span id="s1875">That’s what we were singing in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: They didn’t understand what you were singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: No.</span> <span id="s1878">And we said, “ We got them to Hell,” not “ They have us in Hell.”</span> <span id="s1879">We switched around the song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: How did you manage to keep a sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Well, we had to sing anyway.</span> <span id="s1882">And we sung this way.</span> <span id="s1883">They tried to make you so occupied you wouldn’t have to know or think about anything.</span> <span id="s1884">They trained you to be like in the army.</span> <span id="s1885">First you move out your foot and you say, “ Ein, zwei, drei,” and “mitza dav.”</span> <span id="s1886">Take off the hat.</span> <span id="s1887">Then you have to back up -- you have to put it back again.</span> <span id="s1888">And then they let you stay out an hour and a half.</span> <span id="s1889">Stay outside -- coldness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Standing, waiting to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1892">And then, “ Turn around.”</span> <span id="s1893">If somebody didn’t do it right -- back!</span> <span id="s1894">Like the army.</span> <span id="s1895">They make you occupied.</span> <span id="s1896">All of a sudden they’re going to make us soldiers for Nazis.</span> <span id="s1897">Now I can laugh.</span> <span id="s1898">We didn’t laugh at that time, believe me.</span> <span id="s1899">Like I say, now I can laugh, because at that time I couldn’t laugh.</span> <span id="s1900">Because it hurt us.</span> <span id="s1901">Anyway, we start marching.</span> <span id="s1902">We came to the end.</span> <span id="s1903">We stopped, counting out.</span> <span id="s1904">We got out.</span> <span id="s1905">Went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">B: I’ll tell you what happened one time.</span> <span id="s1907">My brother – a German says, “ You ride the wagon with the horses?”</span> <span id="s1908">“Fine.”</span> <span id="s1909">“Get in.”</span> <span id="s1910">So he was riding the horses, one place to the other, at night.</span> <span id="s1911">It wasn’t much light anyway, because they wouldn’t have too much light to look.</span> <span id="s1912">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s1913">They say don’t shine the light for “the enemies!”</span> <span id="s1914">for the Americans.</span> <span id="s1915">Somehow they went to a cable, knocked off the lights.</span> <span id="s1916">The whole factory went off.</span> <span id="s1917">Can you imagine something like this?</span> <span id="s1918">Is like sabotage.</span> <span id="s1919">Finally, “ Who did this?’</span> <span id="s1920">I told you the one we thought, ‘ He’s a spy.’</span> <span id="s1921">They took my brother in to the police.</span> <span id="s1922">So he says, ‘ I don’t know!</span> <span id="s1923">I just riding the horses.</span> <span id="s1924">I don’t know what happened!”</span> <span id="s1925">They didn’t do anything to him.</span> <span id="s1926">They let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">B: You could have alarms at night, five, ten, fifteen, twenty times alarms.</span> <span id="s1928">Wherever you were, you hide yourself.</span> <span id="s1929">You lay down.</span> <span id="s1930">You worked in the woods, you lay down.</span> <span id="s1931">You worked in the factory, you lay down.</span> <span id="s1932">One time we worked in the factory, that night there was an alarm, 7 o’clock, we were sitting and talking.</span> <span id="s1933">There was a German working with us.</span> <span id="s1934">I asked him, “ Why do you here in the factory, working?</span> <span id="s1935">Why aren’t you in the Russian front?’</span> <span id="s1936">He says, ‘ You know what?</span> <span id="s1937">You see this beautiful apple here?’</span> <span id="s1938">He had an apple.</span> <span id="s1939">(Laughing) He says, “ Look how red this is.</span> <span id="s1940">Beautiful apple outside.</span> <span id="s1941">But inside is rotten!</span> <span id="s1942">I look good outside, but I’m rotten here.</span> <span id="s1943">How do you think they would keep me here if I would be good?”</span> <span id="s1944">They wouldn’t keep me.”</span> <span id="s1945">This way, he didn’t have to go front.</span> <span id="s1946">He was a nice guy!</span> <span id="s1947">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">B: Once happened with my brother again.</span> <span id="s1949">Was alarm.</span> <span id="s1950">He lay down in the woods.</span> <span id="s1951">He fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1952">Later we found out.</span> <span id="s1953">Five o’clock in the morning we have to go home.</span> <span id="s1954">Foreman starts counting out.</span> <span id="s1955">He says, “ Eins, zvei, drei, vier, funf -- hey -- Joe’s not here!”</span> <span id="s1956">We waited a whole hour.</span> <span id="s1957">We were looking for him all over.</span> <span id="s1958">I knew he’s someplace.</span> <span id="s1959">He probably fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1960">I wasn’t worried.</span> <span id="s1961">And would you believe we found him?</span> <span id="s1962">I think we found him sleeping still.</span> <span id="s1963">The foreman start just making like, “ Don’t do this next time!”</span> <span id="s1964">You cannot go home till you have all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">B: I was talking to one guy here one time about business.</span> <span id="s1966">He made very well in the business.</span> <span id="s1967">I said, “ Well, lucky.</span> <span id="s1968">You were lucky.”</span> <span id="s1969">He says, “ No.</span> <span id="s1970">it’s no luck.’</span> <span id="s1971">We used to say “luck” in Europe.</span> <span id="s1972">For every little thing, you say, “ we’re lucky.’</span> <span id="s1973">The same thing we said for every little thing we did in there, in camps.</span> <span id="s1974">We were “lucky.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: What is he if he’s not lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: That’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s1977">I don’t know there’s another word.</span> <span id="s1978">He says, “ No.</span> <span id="s1979">I don’t call this lucky.</span> <span id="s1980">I struggled for it!”</span> <span id="s1981">He did it himself.</span> <span id="s1982">Means “lucky” to him, he might think “ it came -- by itself.”</span> <span id="s1983">In Jewish we say, “ Griklo.”</span> <span id="s1984">It’s the same expression.</span> <span id="s1985">I mean any little thing you risk for your life.</span> <span id="s1986">We had the armband on, and you couldn’t go a certain place.</span> <span id="s1987">I went some place.</span> <span id="s1988">Certain guys were picked up and they took him out, and they put them in jail, and after the jail they sent them away someplace else in another camp.</span> <span id="s1989">Where are my brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s1990">But they died.</span> <span id="s1991">They killed them off.</span> <span id="s1992">And I would have been killed, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1993">Somebody said, “ How did you survive?’</span> <span id="s1994">The only way to say is “ Just for God.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Where’s your brother now?</span> <span id="s1996">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: He’s here.</span> <span id="s1998">He lives a few blocks from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Your story and his story are so close together.</span> <span id="s2000">I want to know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: The same thing.</span> <span id="s2002">We left the same time.</span> <span id="s2003">I was in the woods.</span> <span id="s2004">I came out.</span> <span id="s2005">We left the same.</span> <span id="s2006">I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s2007">I told my son, he said, “ Why wouldn’t you hide in the wood?</span> <span id="s2008">Where would I go?</span> <span id="s2009">To whom would I go?</span> <span id="s2010">If I go out in the street, Germans passing by, they kill me.</span> <span id="s2011">They send out the dogs, they kill me.</span> <span id="s2012">Was too far to go home.</span> <span id="s2013">Is my home there?</span> <span id="s2014">It’s not my home.</span> <span id="s2015">It’s the Germans’ home was out there.</span> <span id="s2016">And we didn’t say anything while we were home even.</span> <span id="s2017">Because when we were home, at the time till we went to the labor camp, you were threatened every second with your life anyway.</span> <span id="s2018">You didn’t know whether you can survive.</span> <span id="s2019">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2020">It was hard, very hard.</span> <span id="s2021">You didn’t know which way you should go.</span> <span id="s2022">Eight o’clock, you couldn’t be out anywhere.</span> <span id="s2023">I remember, I went with my uncle to another town, with a horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s2024">(Sigh) To transfer potatoes over there, from there we took coals back home.</span> <span id="s2025">And we got home, the coals we sold it.</span> <span id="s2026">Have it for yourself, and you sold.</span> <span id="s2027">We burned with coal in Europe.</span> <span id="s2028">After twelve o’clock you couldn’t drive.</span> <span id="s2029">Eight o’clock you couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s2030">And while we’re driving, two Germans stops us by a railroad, and they start talking to us.</span> <span id="s2031">And we didn’t pretend we aren’t Jews.</span> <span id="s2032">And right by the railroad was a Pole, watching the railroad there.</span> <span id="s2033">And he says, to him, to tell us, “Zwolf Uhr!”</span> <span id="s2034">“Twelve o’clock!</span> <span id="s2035">They shouldn’t drive.</span> <span id="s2036">Have them drive over on the side and stay overnight and in the morning they go.’</span> <span id="s2037">So he talks to the Poles.</span> <span id="s2038">He start talking to us in Polish!</span> <span id="s2039">Because he didn’t know who we were.</span> <span id="s2040">He thought we Polish people.</span> <span id="s2041">He said, “ I don’t know what he said to me!</span> <span id="s2042">He’s talking to me in German.</span> <span id="s2043">I don’t understand in German what he says!”</span> <span id="s2044">Then he says, “ Did you tell him?”</span> <span id="s2045">He says, “ Du verfluchtes schweinhund.”</span> <span id="s2046">“ You damn pig of a dog!”</span> <span id="s2047">They called the Poles “swine, pig.”</span> <span id="s2048">So he comes over to us, the German.</span> <span id="s2049">He says, “ Go a little farther and drive and stay right there.’</span> <span id="s2050">So we got there.</span> <span id="s2051">It was raining, pouring.</span> <span id="s2052">And we stood there maybe about half an hour.</span> <span id="s2053">And slowly, slowly we took over this, our life.</span> <span id="s2054">And we drove like this after that place.</span> <span id="s2055">We drove home all night.</span> <span id="s2056">It’s lucky.</span> <span id="s2057">All the way around were people who were lucky.</span> <span id="s2058">I told you this before with my brother -- they picked him up to be killed.</span> <span id="s2059">You remember when I told you before?</span> <span id="s2060">The German got drunk!</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">It’s like, you go out to the farmer.</span> <span id="s2062">You want to buy fifty chickens, ten chickens.</span> <span id="s2063">You see a bunch of chicken in a coop.</span> <span id="s2064">You say, “ Pick out this one.”</span> <span id="s2065">“ Which one?”</span> <span id="s2066">The one with the thin feather, the one with the white feather, this one.”</span> <span id="s2067">Just like that.</span> <span id="s2068">You bring him over.</span> <span id="s2069">Put him in and chop him off.</span> <span id="s2070">That’s what they did -- the same thing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Do you feel differently about God than you did before this experience, and about people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: About God?</span> <span id="s2073">No.</span> <span id="s2074">The same.</span> <span id="s2075">You don’t always use the word with everything.</span> <span id="s2076">I think most Jewish people use the word God in that song.</span> <span id="s2077">The only thing we said while we were there, “ How can God stay and look at that synagogue burning?”</span> <span id="s2078">And German takes you away, and he says, “ Put on the tallis.</span> <span id="s2079">Put on everything, and go up there and make the service.</span> <span id="s2080">And ask him, what did he do to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2081">Look at here.</span> <span id="s2082">He destroyed you!</span> <span id="s2083">How could he?</span> <span id="s2084">Where is God?</span> <span id="s2085">You know who God is?</span> <span id="s2086">I’m the God,” he says.</span> <span id="s2087">Joking around with you, and to say that.</span> <span id="s2088">And to take us.</span> <span id="s2089">And to tell us, “ Take apart all those bricks.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: And make Polish homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: “And Polish people can come down.</span> <span id="s2092">They can pick out the bricks and build homes for them.”</span> <span id="s2093">One Polish guy was there.</span> <span id="s2094">He was very well known before the war.</span> <span id="s2095">He was very religion.</span> <span id="s2096">He was nothing but talking with God!</span> <span id="s2097">“ How can he say,” he says to us, “ How can God look at that and see to destroy the Jewish people?</span> <span id="s2098">How can he see?</span> <span id="s2099">My God!”</span> <span id="s2100">I didn’t tell you about we had at home at that time a good horse.</span> <span id="s2101">Very good horse.</span> <span id="s2102">It was a young horse.</span> <span id="s2103">He’s kind of wild.</span> <span id="s2104">And one farmer came to us.</span> <span id="s2105">We know him good, he’s a good man.</span> <span id="s2106">He had two good horses.</span> <span id="s2107">In a certain time, you’re supposed to go down on a field, and the Germans took away the horses from you, because they sent them over to Germany.</span> <span id="s2108">They needed a lot of horses for the war.</span> <span id="s2109">So they came, and the Pole says, “ I got two good horses.”</span> <span id="s2110">We didn’t register our horse.</span> <span id="s2111">If we would have registered, ours they would have taken away, right away.</span> <span id="s2112">it was a Jewish horse!</span> <span id="s2113">But, I want to bring out here something about a Polish guy.</span> <span id="s2114">I went over.</span> <span id="s2115">My brother went over, and a sister and my mother went over there.</span> <span id="s2116">The Polish farmer, he said to me, if he would take our horse and make weak, and don’t feed him, one of his, they take away.</span> <span id="s2117">Then he trades with us.</span> <span id="s2118">Then he would buy ours later on, if we want to sell it.</span> <span id="s2119">When they got down to the field, they called all the names.</span> <span id="s2120">And ours wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2121">And I tell you, better let’s take a chance the way it is.</span> <span id="s2122">So what he did, he went down and weakened down His two horses, made them weak.</span> <span id="s2123">He didn’t feed them much, just for that purpose.</span> <span id="s2124">He got them back, because they were too weak.</span> <span id="s2125">But our horse, a nice horse!</span> <span id="s2126">We didn’t have registered.</span> <span id="s2127">But we still were afraid.</span> <span id="s2128">Everything, we were scared.</span> <span id="s2129">If they say to us, “ Lay down,” we layed.</span> <span id="s2130">We didn’t stand up for us, we didn’t fight -- till the Warsaw people found out what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2131">They said to them, “ We will take you now away to a camp.”</span> <span id="s2132">They said, “We don’t believe you any more.</span> <span id="s2133">You took all the others out and they were destroyed there.</span> <span id="s2134">Will you destroy us too.’</span> <span id="s2135">But you see films.</span> <span id="s2136">What you read about.</span> <span id="s2137">Boys -- ten year old boys -- was swimming over there, with the hand grenade, what they could buy from the Polish people.</span> <span id="s2138">And they were fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s2139">Kids and mothers were fighting because they knew they were gonna die anyway.</span> <span id="s2140">That time they stood up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">let me go back to the horse.</span> <span id="s2142">Even if we didn’t have registered, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s2143">We didn’t have to go with the horse, but we were afraid, if we wouldn’t bring over the horse, and someone find out, they would kill us.</span> <span id="s2144">We took over the horse.</span> <span id="s2145">They called out the names, and I says, ‘ They don’t know about our horse.”</span> <span id="s2146">The mayor -- the German burgomeister -- was in charge.</span> <span id="s2147">He was from the city.</span> <span id="s2148">So he took a lot of horses out and he had asked this one Polish guy, who says, “ Hey, here’s a Jewish horse!?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Your horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: They took him away.</span> <span id="s2151">My mother was crying.</span> <span id="s2152">And the whole family.</span> <span id="s2153">She cried so!</span> <span id="s2154">Somebody else they took away the horse, they gave ‘em another one.</span> <span id="s2155">Not a good one.</span> <span id="s2156">But they gave one back.</span> <span id="s2157">She says, “ Give me another one.”</span> <span id="s2158">It’s like talking to the wall.</span> <span id="s2159">They took away the horse.</span> <span id="s2160">It was pretty, three, four years old.</span> <span id="s2161">But it’s why, when they came to the Warsaw ghetto, you see?</span> <span id="s2162">We had big forests in Poland.</span> <span id="s2163">They couldn’t destroy all the forests, they need that.</span> <span id="s2164">In Poland was more than all over Europe, forests.</span> <span id="s2165">Wherever you walked was forest.</span> <span id="s2166">In our town, we walked away that Sunday, because we wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s2167">we didn’t have any buses.</span> <span id="s2168">If we woulda run away it would be good, because we wind up in Russia.</span> <span id="s2169">You could survive.</span> <span id="s2170">It wasn’t good, but at least in Russia they didn’t kill you.</span> <span id="s2171">Everybody ran away, when the Russian came close and you weren’t a Russian, because you want to go home.</span> <span id="s2172">You didn’t know what’s going on at home.</span> <span id="s2173">Because we left in the good time!</span> <span id="s2174">You didn’t see a German!</span> <span id="s2175">And now you are under the Russia.</span> <span id="s2176">You have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2177">You got to survive.</span> <span id="s2178">To survive yourself.</span> <span id="s2179">Because people did everything to survive -- if the war didn’t kill you --– because when a lot of people used to come to Europe from Russia, ’45, ’46, ’47, they said, “ Oh yeah, we was in Siberia, here and there.”</span> <span id="s2180">But you survived.</span> <span id="s2181">He didn’t kill you.</span> <span id="s2182">The Germans killed us.</span> <span id="s2183">“He didn’t kill you,” I said, “ But you left when the good time.</span> <span id="s2184">You didn’t see a German.”</span> <span id="s2185">They didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s2186">But if you have it good and later on you haven’t got good, then you don’t remember the bad time.</span> <span id="s2187">You always remember the good times.”</span> <span id="s2188">So when Russia took over, we couldn’t make it any more, so we ran to the woods.</span> <span id="s2189">I suppose if you would have start out right away fighting all over Europe, maybe he couldn’t destroy us.</span> <span id="s2190">If we would have enough power to help us!</span> <span id="s2191">But the Polish people didn’t help is.</span> <span id="s2192">If they would have only help us, we could have gone to a lot of places.</span> <span id="s2193">Auschwitz wasn’t far from where we lived; Auschwitz was Poland.</span> <span id="s2194">Maybe we could have destroyed Auschwitz before it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: But you had no help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: We didn’t have any help.</span> <span id="s2197">They just came in.</span> <span id="s2198">Automatically, slow motion, they did it to you.</span> <span id="s2199">Very slow.</span> <span id="s2200">They didn’t do it at one time.</span> <span id="s2201">Gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: What were some of the other signs?</span> <span id="s2203">Before that truck actually came and picked you and your brother up?</span> <span id="s2204">Loss of maybe some of your freedoms, or jobs?</span> <span id="s2205">Were there any signs that something was happening?</span> <span id="s2206">In the very beginning, when you were living at home with all your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Certainly.</span> <span id="s2208">Yes.</span> <span id="s2209">Already we heard -- and I seen it already -- that the Germans are sending out Polish, Jewish citizens from Germany.</span> <span id="s2210">That’s how it started.</span> <span id="s2211">He sent out Polish citizens which weren’t born in Germany.</span> <span id="s2212">They were born in Poland, so he sent them out.</span> <span id="s2213">He sent them out to the border and they only could take along so much with them.</span> <span id="s2214">They have to leave.</span> <span id="s2215">And the Polish government took them in.</span> <span id="s2216">Because they claim they weren’t born in Germany.</span> <span id="s2217">So where did they wind up?</span> <span id="s2218">They wound up in big synagogues.</span> <span id="s2219">At that time I’m talking Katowice.</span> <span id="s2220">Reform Temples was this.</span> <span id="s2221">Those Temples were from Germany, because in the First World War, up till 1920, was German, that town.</span> <span id="s2222">But Poland took over in 1920.</span> <span id="s2223">So it was most Reform Temples.</span> <span id="s2224">So people came back.</span> <span id="s2225">They sent them back.</span> <span id="s2226">We didn’t think about it anymore.</span> <span id="s2227">In fact, we didn’t know what’s going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s2228">In 1938, even, Germany want a part from Poland back.</span> <span id="s2229">And they said they’re not going to give it to them.</span> <span id="s2230">And they were ready to start a war at that time.</span> <span id="s2231">This I remember.</span> <span id="s2232">A lot of people got in the army then.</span> <span id="s2233">They called them in in the service.</span> <span id="s2234">They called them in and mobilized the town and they already started to show this in 1938!</span> <span id="s2235">They put in an alarm already.</span> <span id="s2236">How, if it happened, with masks and everything.</span> <span id="s2237">So finally it got quiet.</span> <span id="s2238">“Cause Hitler was very dumb.</span> <span id="s2239">He was smart in one way.</span> <span id="s2240">There’s a word for him.</span> <span id="s2241">My boy told me.</span> <span id="s2242">I said, “ How could he be smart?’</span> <span id="s2243">I called him not smart.</span> <span id="s2244">He says, “ No, he was very smart.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">PAGE 29</span></p> <p><span
