Troopers marched into Hungary, all Jews were transferred to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s7">I want to record in a documentary way how the deportations were carried out.</span> <span id="s8">Some of their officers were quartered in the Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s9">We also had two of them stay in our home.</span> <span id="s10">They got in touch with the Hungarian authorities to find out who were the prominent Jews, and they made them form a Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">This Council was responsible that all German commands would be obeyed by all the Jews.</span> <span id="s12">After establishing the Jewish Council the Germans went through the city, entered all the stores, forcing the owners to close down, and not letting them remove anything, even from the cash registers, and they were forced to hand over all the keys to them.</span> <span id="s13">The following days the Hungarian Nazis invaded every Jewish home and took out all the valuables they could find.</span> <span id="s14">We Jews were helpless.</span> <span id="s15">We were all struck beyond words, not knowing what was awaiting us.</span> <span id="s16">It made it worse that we were not able to continue in our jobs.</span> <span id="s17">In our minds we were fighting the feelings of resignation, on the one hand, on the other, whether to keep up our hopes for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">The next day they evacuated all the Jewish patients from the hospital and took them to a large convention hall.</span> <span id="s19">The curfew then was announced: Jewish people could not leave their homes.</span> <span id="s20">The next morning we were ordered to move into a ghetto, with two or three families occupying one room.</span> <span id="s21">They could take with them only what they could carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">We were kept in this ghetto a full week.</span> <span id="s23">We had some food with us, but there were some fine gentile Hungarians who smuggled food to all of us.</span> <span id="s24">After the end of the week, one morning one-third of the ghetto population was ordered out of their homes at 6:00 in the morning to go into the street.</span> <span id="s25">The Jewish Council had been ordered to get out all the able-bodied men to form a police force.</span> <span id="s26">This Jewish police force, supervised by the German Nazis, was to guard the people driven out on the street so that they could not move anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">At 2:00 P.M. the Germans started to fire bursts of gunshots into the air to intimidate people.</span> <span id="s28">Then they forced us to march to the two large synagogues in the city, where they separated the men from the women.</span> <span id="s29">We were kept there overnight without food, water, or toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s30">The next day in the late afternoon, we were forced to march again to the railroad station where 70 and 80 people were put in one cattle car under the same conditions—no food, no water, no toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s31">The cattle cars were locked so that no one could escape.</span> <span id="s32">The night came and the cars started running.</span> <span id="s33">They continued running all night till dawn.</span> <span id="s34">They came to a standstill at an abandoned track.</span> <span id="s35">We had no idea where we were or where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">The next night the train continued until dawn again.</span> <span id="s37">The third night we arrived at our destination in the dark.</span> <span id="s38">In the pitch dark we could make out the gate surrounded by barbed wires.</span> <span id="s39">We could see even more clearly three tall chimneys with big, burning flames.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">When the cattle car doors opened, we were quickly moved out with the use of whips.</span> <span id="s41">It took a while to have us lined up in rows of five, separating the men from the women and children.</span> <span id="s42">This was the last time I saw my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">I was in the same row with my mother, my sister, and her three children.</span> <span id="s44">My sister was pregnant, so I volunteered to carry her two-year-old child.</span> <span id="s45">After a few steps, my sister asked for her child back.</span> <span id="s46">My mother advised me to do what my sister had requested, knowing that a mother’s love for her child had to be honored.</span> <span id="s47">After a few steps, I was quickly directed to step out of the line to the right.</span> <span id="s48">I was told I was young and I could walk.</span> <span id="s49">The old people and children would get to ride on a truck.</span> <span id="s50">I was rushed away from my group with another group of young women.</span> <span id="s51">If I had not obeyed my mother’s words and had kept my sister’s two-year-old child in my arms, I would not be here today to report this horrendous story.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">From the time we were whipped out of the cattle cars, we were aware of some people around us not in Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s53">We tried to get information from them about our whereabouts and what was happening to us.</span> <span id="s54">One of them told us that if we entered through this gate, the only exit would be through the flames of those chimneys.</span> <span id="s55">Now we knew that what we saw were the ovens of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Before I continue this documentary in chronological order, I would like to relate three other incidents that occurred earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">The first of these incidents is one which I will never erase from my memory.</span> <span id="s58">At the end of our three-day trip, just shortly before arriving at Auschwitz, my father asked me to come to him and he told me the following: “Your mother and I have lived our lives.</span> <span id="s59">Promise us that you will do all you can to save your own.</span> <span id="s60">You must forget us now and think of your future happiness.”</span> <span id="s61">These are the words that continually rang in my ears in the ensuing days.</span> <span id="s62">These words gave me the courage and strength to bear all the excruciating physical and mental pains.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Two other incidents still haunt me today.</span> <span id="s64">On this morning two Hungarian gendarmes approached my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s65">One had a gun.</span> <span id="s66">He hit my father to get him to move faster.</span> <span id="s67">The other went to my mother.</span> <span id="s68">She was holding in her hands some family photos that were our most precious possessions.</span> <span id="s69">He hit her hand so strongly that all the photos went flying out of her hands onto the floor.</span> <span id="s70">These photos were never recovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">After I was torn from my family, S.S. soldiers with full equipment and police dogs escorted us to the bath house.</span> <span id="s72">We were taken into a large hall and were ordered to undress completely naked.</span> <span id="s73">We were to leave our clothes on the floor.</span> <span id="s74">After being undressed, we were taken individually to another room, where we were examined and searched again.</span> <span id="s75">Even the shoes were carefully searched so nothing could be hidden in them.</span> <span id="s76">Here our hair was sheared so we remained completely bald.</span> <span id="s77">After all this we finally were led into the showers.</span> <span id="s78">We did the best we could, as the soap we brought along for here was taken away.</span> <span id="s79">No towels were available.</span> <span id="s80">We were given a shirt and a short-sleeved summer dress.</span> <span id="s81">Before we had time to get dry, we were rushed outside and taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">In the meantime, the older people and children went through the same procedure.</span> <span id="s83">Instead of going in the real showers, they were taken into another room that had poison gas coming out of the pipes instead of water.</span> <span id="s84">Here is where they died.</span> <span id="s85">At that time I was not aware of these facts.</span> <span id="s86">When I got out of the showers I saw that my ski boots were over in a corner.</span> <span id="s87">There were wooden clogs lined up for us.</span> <span id="s88">I ran to the corner and grabbed my boots that were in excellent condition.</span> <span id="s89">No one hindered me from getting them.</span> <span id="s90">The wooden clogs were hard to walk in.</span> <span id="s91">Many got skin lesions and infections while they marched, and those people died.</span> <span id="s92">The fact that I had these ski boots on contributed to my survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Our next destination turned out to be the wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s94">They were one of the many barn-like buildings made of unpainted boards.</span> <span id="s95">Inside there were stable-type separations, which were three feet high and about two square yards wide and long, and in height about three quarters of a yard.</span> <span id="s96">In such a stall they placed fourteen of us; in the top tier even more, as it had no ceiling.</span> <span id="s97">The only way they could all get in was by pulling our legs under our bodies, sitting tightly together, but we had to bend down our heads, because there was not enough head room on account of the tier above.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Every day at 3:00 A.M. we were awakened.</span> <span id="s99">We were chased outside regardless of the weather.</span> <span id="s100">We had to line up there five abreast, not to speak, to be counted.</span> <span id="s101">This was the so-called Zählappell, head count.</span> <span id="s102">This lasted until 7:00 A.M.</span> <span id="s103">We were not allowed to move from our places.</span> <span id="s104">This happened twice daily.</span> <span id="s105">In the afternoons from 4:00 to 7:00 P.M., whether it rained or hailed, it did not matter.</span> <span id="s106">The Silesian nights were very, very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">While standing outside for head count, I saw a large group of camp mates, who had arrived at Auschwitz before me, now marching off to work.</span> <span id="s108">It was a horrible picture.</span> <span id="s109">Later I got used to it.</span> <span id="s110">I saw these faces reflecting death.</span> <span id="s111">Twice daily I watched thousands marching by with a deathly expression, painfully walking in their wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s112">Their deteriorated physical conditions made them look like walking corpses.</span> <span id="s113">Ironically, while they were marching, they were forced to sing.</span> <span id="s114">The newer workers were also subjected to an additional torture: After marching several kilometers before and after the twelve-hour work day, they were kept marching for continued hours in front of our barracks because they had not known how to keep in step.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">It needs to be said here that the minute Hitler occupied Hungary, all Jews were made to wear a yellow Star of David.</span> <span id="s116">Once we were taken out of the ghettoes, these yellow stars were no longer worn by us.</span> <span id="s117">This was a standard procedure by the Germans in all the countries they invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Every day after the head count, we were given coffee or tea.</span> <span id="s119">However, the beverage tasted like neither coffee or tea.</span> <span id="s120">They were served in small or large containers without cups or spoons.</span> <span id="s121">The small containers were for five, the large ones for ten people.</span> <span id="s122">They had to drink from the container one after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">At 7:00 after the second head count, the so-called dinner of undefinable color was served.</span> <span id="s124">The same way as breakfast, this stew had to be drunk from containers, only it was harder as it was thicker than the morning tea.</span> <span id="s125">Once a day bread was distributed, and those who were handy could cut as many as six slices for their portion.</span> <span id="s126">Once in a while we received a little salami or margarine with the bread, but it was very little.</span> <span id="s127">If we didn’t finish the bread, we had to keep it hidden in our dresses, as there was no other place to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">After three days, I discovered the wash barracks near by, but it was very hard to get there.</span> <span id="s129">The most cruel beatings continued.</span> <span id="s130">I then decided to get washed from top to bottom every day.</span> <span id="s131">I continued to receive severe beatings as I got into the wash barracks.</span> <span id="s132">Once I got in and was completely undressed, I was no longer molested.</span> <span id="s133">Although it was forbidden, sometimes I could even wash my belongings when they didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s134">One time the shirt, another time the dress.</span> <span id="s135">It was awful to be with only a single dress, to be without the handkerchief or towel, and even without a piece of toilet paper.</span> <span id="s136">These are such important items to have, and it was very difficult for me to be deprived of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">The mental inactivity was even harder to bear.</span> <span id="s138">During the first six weeks that I spent at Auschwitz, after the morning head count, we were all chased back into the barracks to our hot, unbearable cages to smother until the early evening.</span> <span id="s139">This lasted for six weeks or the equivalent of 42 days.</span> <span id="s140">During those long hours, our minds were filled with great anxieties and intense pain—not knowing what was to happen to us next.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Our immediate guards in the barracks were inmates who were in Auschwitz for several years.</span> <span id="s142">They were backed on the outside by Nazi soldiers.</span> <span id="s143">We were trying to get information from them.</span> <span id="s144">That’s when we found out that the place we were was called Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">There was a group of inmates who worked nearby.</span> <span id="s146">They were assigned to sort out the contents of the luggage, bundles, and packages, that the new arrivals were forced to leave behind in the cattle cars, with the promise that they would be delivered to them afterwards.</span> <span id="s147">They told us they saw the people enter the crematorium but never saw anyone leaving.</span> <span id="s148">Many of these workers were under the effect of these tragedies, so that for days they couldn’t eat or drink.</span> <span id="s149">I still didn’t want to believe this about the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">I actually didn’t believe the chimney stories until Liberation Day, at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s151">After we were liberated, I had the chance in Buchenwald to visit a similar chimneyed building as in Auschwitz, and I could clearly see it was a crematorium.</span> <span id="s152">It was smaller than in Auschwitz; there was only one in Buchenwald, but still many thousands were killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">I was among the optimists who would not believe that the chimneys were part of the crematories.</span> <span id="s154">To support my optimism was the fact that I had seen in Auschwitz from far away, old people and children, too, but I had no idea of their nationality.</span> <span id="s155">I could not believe that Satan or the devil could take over the whole world.</span> <span id="s156">How can such ideas as mass extermination of innocent people be conceived in human minds?</span> <span id="s157">I believed all the time that there is a God, but “Where was He?”</span> <span id="s158">“Did He fall asleep or go for a vacation?”</span> <span id="s159">Forgive me, dear God, for these thoughts, but why to deny those?</span> <span id="s160">I have to thank you for surviving and not going entirely insane; many people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Another inmate told me that older people, children, and sick people were being burned there.</span> <span id="s162">I asked her whether she saw it.</span> <span id="s163">The answer was, “I really didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s164">If I had been there to see, I would not be alive any more, but you are a jackass for not believing it.”</span> <span id="s165">I could also see every night two or three trains arriving, bringing more cattle cars.</span> <span id="s166">The transport I came in had about 3,000 people, which according to my speculation, meant 6,000 to 10,000 more people arriving every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">During these weeks that we were quarantined, it was a daily event that the people who got sick with colds or stomach aches were taken out from among us.</span> <span id="s168">They also searched daily for pregnant women.</span> <span id="s169">These were also taken away.</span> <span id="s170">Previous to this, one night while in our barracks, a woman gave birth.</span> <span id="s171">When it was discovered, a Nazi medic came in, strangled the baby before its mother and before all of us who were also present.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">We learned to live with these unbelievable atrocities.</span> <span id="s173">After the six weeks of quarantine, instead of the normal head count, we were made to line up for another selection of those who would be picked out to die.</span> <span id="s174">We were ordered to parade naked in front of two rows of Nazi officers.</span> <span id="s175">We found out later that the head of the Nazi officers was the infamous Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s176">He wore white gloves, and with the movement of his wrist his hands motioned either to the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s177">The right movement meant that those motioned to were put to work, and the left movement meant that death would be awaiting the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s178">This time, to our greatest relief, there were only 50 of us squeezed into one car.</span> <span id="s179">Soon we found out that our new watch were not S.S. officers.</span> <span id="s180">These new guards were made up of the men who had previously fought in Hitler’s army, but were now too old and disabled and given the responsibility of taking us away.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Our conditions improved from this point on.</span> <span id="s182">We received more food, and the guards spoke to us.</span> <span id="s183">We were, therefore, able to get some new information about what was happening.</span> <span id="s184">This trip lasted three days and two nights.</span> <span id="s185">During the day the cattle cars did not move, stopping in the open fields.</span> <span id="s186">The guards opened the doors of the cars while we were not in motion.</span> <span id="s187">The day of our departure from Auschwitz was July 2nd, 1944.</span> <span id="s188">We arrived at our new destination on July 4th, a day that I would never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">It was a beautiful, sunny day.</span> <span id="s190">I was now allowing myself to have thoughts of the possibility of surviving this ordeal, even though there was no obvious reason to believe it.</span> <span id="s191">Maybe it was an inspiration from above.</span> <span id="s192">I could still hear my father’s words repeatedly telling me to keep before me hope and faith.</span> <span id="s193">From the cattle cars we had to march a few miles.</span> <span id="s194">Then we saw two huge tents, disguised like the military installations as camouflage.</span> <span id="s195">These tents were our homes now.</span> <span id="s196">The whole area was surrounded by electrically charged barbed wires, just like in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s197">There were also some barracks in the enclosure, which served as housing for the guards, offices, the kitchen, and utilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">We had now arrived in West Germany, in the so-called Ruhr area that included Gelsenkirchen.</span> <span id="s199">Here there had been a concentration of Hitler’s whole armament industry, a place the size of the whole town known as the Krupp factory.</span> <span id="s200">Our tents where we were to live, and to go to work, were near this town.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">This complex was about 90 per cent bombed out.</span> <span id="s202">A small part of it could be restored, but first the ruins and the debris had to be removed.</span> <span id="s203">This required very hard physical work.</span> <span id="s204">Huge steel beams had to be put in wagons.</span> <span id="s205">It took about 20 people to lift one.</span> <span id="s206">Besides, it was very dirty work.</span> <span id="s207">Now we were in the midst of actual warfare.</span> <span id="s208">The sirens were sounding almost without interruption; bombs were falling day and night; there were no shelters.</span> <span id="s209">The British bombers came during the night, the Americans during the day.</span> <span id="s210">Chaos, desperation, fear, hysteria, reigned more often than not.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">I don’t know how to thank God that I was never afraid.</span> <span id="s212">After I was separated from my family, I had nothing to lose, only my life, but the message came to me in these dreadful hours, my father telling me, “Have hope and faith.”</span> <span id="s213">I tried to instill this message in my camp mates.</span> <span id="s214">It did result, sometimes, in a little calm.</span> <span id="s215">That gave me even more strength.</span> <span id="s216">This constant warfare gave us the hope that the war would end soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Our daily routine was marching about two miles to our workplace, work for twelve hours, then march back to our tents.</span> <span id="s218">In the morning, some liquid—you could not tell whether it was coffee or tea—two slices of bread with some margarine on it, two more slices of bread for lunch, returning in the evening to some mush not too thin, among other things with turnips in it.</span> <span id="s219">I still can smell it and can not eat them today.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">After Auschwitz our present lifestyle was like a life of luxury.</span> <span id="s221">We each had some kind of a dish, a cup, a fork or spoon.</span> <span id="s222">In the tents we had double bunks with some straw in it and even a blanket.</span> <span id="s223">We had the liberty of going to the bathroom when we needed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">The days and nights were interrupted or rather filled by sirens and bombs bursting.</span> <span id="s225">After two months I was lucky enough not to have to do the clean-up work.</span> <span id="s226">My camp mates elected me as a camp senior.</span> <span id="s227">They felt that I could help them some.</span> <span id="s228">Indeed I could.</span> <span id="s229">Some people were working in the kitchens, both the ones for the inmates and also for the officers.</span> <span id="s230">I was able to organize them in a way that they were able to transfer some essential food staples to the inmates’ kitchen, which they added to our food, or I smuggled it right into our tent.</span> <span id="s231">We had, this way, a lot more bread, sugar, some butter, Wurst [sausage], cheese, to add to our bread.</span> <span id="s232">It also meant more responsibility, but the fact that I was able to improve a little bit our condition was worth it.</span> <span id="s233">My camp mates respected me and helped me in carrying out the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">On the 10th of September the work resumed in one part of the factory.</span> <span id="s235">On the 11th, the English bombed this out again.</span> <span id="s236">The first bomb hit a large gasoline supply plant.</span> <span id="s237">The fire burned for the next two days.</span> <span id="s238">To top all this, the next day during the daytime, the Americans came flying very low and dropped bombs and hand grenades on our tents.</span> <span id="s239">Two hundred and thirty of my camp mates were killed; we were altogether 1,000.</span> <span id="s240">“Panic” is not enough to describe this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">I had the most horrid personal experience of my life: We ran out of the tents to the open fields.</span> <span id="s242">One of my camp mates held on with both of her hands to my right arm.</span> <span id="s243">A terrible thunder and darkness occurred for a moment and I saw my camp mate still clinging to me—her whole inside was out.</span> <span id="s244">I was full of blood, but miraculously without a scratch.</span> <span id="s245">They put the entire factory out of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">This event also terminated our usefulness at this place.</span> <span id="s247">After burying our dead, on the 19th of September we were on the road again in our cattle cars.</span> <span id="s248">We gathered all our possessions and even took the blankets with us.</span> <span id="s249">The trip lasted two days and two nights; we were heading toward the east.</span> <span id="s250">It took a few days till we found out that we were in Thuringia in the southeast of Germany.</span> <span id="s251">The name of the town was Sömmerda.</span> <span id="s252">There was originally a typewriter factory which was converted to an ammunition and gun powder factory, and also disguised.</span> <span id="s253">Our accommodations were the same: bunk beds with some straw in it, a blanket, in barracks, not in tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">This area was also surrounded by electrically charged wires, and guarded day and night.</span> <span id="s255">Next to our camp there was another huge area with a fence around it.</span> <span id="s256">It housed foreign forced laborers that were French, who got paid for their work.</span> <span id="s257">The complex had no guards.</span> <span id="s258">There were very many forced laborers from all the European countries that Hitler conquered.</span> <span id="s259">My camp mates insisted that I be the camp senior again.</span> <span id="s260">It was hard work and great responsibility.</span> <span id="s261">I had to draw water from a well so that when my camp mates returned from work dead tired, they didn’t have to do it themselves.</span> <span id="s262">Here, too, I continued to smuggle other essential supplies that I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">The winter was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s264">We had to get up every day, seven times a week, at 4:00 A.M. to be counted before my camp mates left for work.</span> <span id="s265">The food rations were about the same as in Gelsenkirchen.</span> <span id="s266">The factory was much further from our camp; it was a two-hour march both ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">At the beginning there were very few air raids.</span> <span id="s268">This was very discouraging, and it meant that it would take that much longer a time before our liberation.</span> <span id="s269">Each day it was somewhat comforting not to have the relentless fighting nearby.</span> <span id="s270">I don’t know how we survived the winter.</span> <span id="s271">The barracks were not heated, no warm water.</span> <span id="s272">I washed myself every day from head to toe with cold water that stimulated my circulation, and my work kept me all the time on my toes.</span> <span id="s273">Many people had colds and other aches and pains.</span> <span id="s274">I succeeded to get some real food from the officers’ kitchen for them.</span> <span id="s275">In Auschwitz such people were sent to the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s276">There was no crematorium here and they had no means to transport anyone anywhere.</span> <span id="s277">The rations were about the same as in Gelsenkirchen.</span> <span id="s278">As the months went by, the air raids came closer, the sound of sirens increased in frequency, the roar of the bombers took over again.</span> <span id="s279">Hope and desperation were high again.</span> <span id="s280">By April the factory ran out of supplies.</span> <span id="s281">There was no public transportation, there were no telephones, power failures were frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">The 5th of April we were on our way again—this time by foot.</span> <span id="s283">Our group was divided in two.</span> <span id="s284">Each group was led in a different direction.</span> <span id="s285">Again we were speculating what fate was awaiting us.</span> <span id="s286">There were rumors the order was to kill and scatter the inmates; by that time even the Germans knew they had lost the war.</span> <span id="s287">I thought that our guards didn’t carry out these orders because they were trying to save their own lives.</span> <span id="s288">April 5, 1945 was a Tuesday.</span> <span id="s289">Our group marched all day.</span> <span id="s290">Before darkness we were put up for the night in a little village in two wooden structures parallel to each other, with a space in between.</span> <span id="s291">Each end of the space was a gate—padlocked.</span> <span id="s292">The road was full of different groups of people going in different directions accompanied by the sound of sirens and aircraft.</span> <span id="s293">There was complete chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">The barns were filled with straw about ten feet high.</span> <span id="s295">We were so exhausted that most of us fell asleep immediately.</span> <span id="s296">I could not fall asleep and for the first time it came to my mind that now was the time to escape.</span> <span id="s297">I thought it was a good idea not to march with the group any longer, but hide myself in the straw.</span> <span id="s298">On a second thought, it went through my mind, “What if they set the straw afire?</span> <span id="s299">If I knew that there was a door in the back of the barn where I was lying, maybe I should stay.”</span> <span id="s300">At this point I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s301">I woke up having a strong pain in the back of my head.</span> <span id="s302">Imagine, it was a heavy wooden ledge that my head leaned against.</span> <span id="s303">There had to be a door there.</span> <span id="s304">I took it as a sign from above that made me decide to stay.</span> <span id="s305">At daybreak when my camp mates woke up, I told them what I had decided and proposed to a few who were close to me to do the same.</span> <span id="s306">Some of them agreed, some didn’t.</span> <span id="s307">At the end, nobody had the guts to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">I hid myself in the straw and lay there long after my group left.</span> <span id="s309">The sirens and aircraft were constant now.</span> <span id="s310">I knew it was a question of time only that the war should end.</span> <span id="s311">I carefully got myself out of the straw.</span> <span id="s312">The first thing I looked for was the door—for sure it was there.</span> <span id="s313">Then I carefully waded around in the deep straw looking for a crack in the structure.</span> <span id="s314">To reach these cracks I had to climb up on the rafters; this gave me something to do.</span> <span id="s315">All I saw was empty fields all around.</span> <span id="s316">All this time the sounds of sirens and aircraft penetrated the day.</span> <span id="s317">The air, day and night, it felt like the sky was falling off.</span> <span id="s318">At night I took some short naps.</span> <span id="s319">I was exhausted, hungry, and thirsty.</span> <span id="s320">Wednesday passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Thursday started the same way.</span> <span id="s322">While wandering around in the barn, I found a potato—needless to say, uncooked.</span> <span id="s323">I was feasting on it for a very long time.</span> <span id="s324">After I finished eating, I continued my search of the barn.</span> <span id="s325">All of a sudden someone appeared at the big front door.</span> <span id="s326">Every step and move in the straw caused a loud rustling sound.</span> <span id="s327">I threw myself down, and at every step of the person who entered, I grabbed a big handful of straw to cover myself.</span> <span id="s328">As soon as I was totally buried, the person who entered was coming so close to me that I realized there were only a few blades of straw that were separating me from his footsteps.</span> <span id="s329">That little bit of straw saved me from being stepped on and from being discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">It seemed an eternity to lie there motionless till the person left.</span> <span id="s331">The other event of the day was that I found an onion.</span> <span id="s332">I saved it for the next day.</span> <span id="s333">The nights seemed to be longer than the days.</span> <span id="s334">The third day was Friday.</span> <span id="s335">I ate my onion, found another potato, and I got very thirsty.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">In the afternoon it started to rain.</span> <span id="s337">I decided to collect some rainwater to alleviate my thirst.</span> <span id="s338">It took me a long time to slide out the front gate.</span> <span id="s339">This was an enclosed area; the other barn was facing mine.</span> <span id="s340">I held my mouth open, trying to catch the drops from the rain.</span> <span id="s341">I listened and watched all around for my safety.</span> <span id="s342">Fortunately, I still had with me a little dish that had been given me after leaving Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s343">With it I tried to catch the raindrops.</span> <span id="s344">All of a sudden, from the gate that connected the two barns on the side, I heard a man’s voice asking, “Who is there?”</span> <span id="s345">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MB: The clip-clop of the raindrops falling in my dish caught the attention of a passerby.</span> <span id="s347">I did not answer, slid back into the barn, and hid in the straw again, not knowing what would happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">In about 15-20 minutes the big gate opened and, peering through the straw, I could see 15 or 16 very young and very old men armed with guns.</span> <span id="s349">They were yelling that whoever was there should come forward, or else they would start shooting.</span> <span id="s350">I found it wiser to come forward than to stay hidden.</span> <span id="s351">Even after they saw me, they kept on yelling, thinking that there were more people hiding.</span> <span id="s352">They wouldn’t believe me that I was there alone; they kept on searching, poking in the straw with the butts of their guns.</span> <span id="s353">After the liberators were by, they ordered me to get out and walk with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">After a long walk in that little village, accompanied by a crowd, consisting of mainly women, a few young children and very old men, I beckoned the crowd to give me some water.</span> <span id="s355">It was the fourth day that I didn’t have anything to drink.</span> <span id="s356">People turned their heads away.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">I soon found myself in the front of the office of the mayor.</span> <span id="s358">I must have been quite a sight with my hair short, in my gray prison uniform, dirty and worn out.</span> <span id="s359">The mayor recognized that I was one of the concentration camp inmates, left over from those who had passed by a few days earlier.</span> <span id="s360">He looked at me and asked me whether I was Jewish or half Jewish.</span> <span id="s361">I would never have thought of denying my Jewishness, but he put the answer into my mouth.</span> <span id="s362">Of course, I said I was half Jewish, although I am completely Jewish.</span> <span id="s363">Then he began to interrogate me: “Where had our group come from?”</span> <span id="s364">“What had we been doing there?”</span> <span id="s365">“Why had I not been with my group?”</span> <span id="s366">I said that I had fallen asleep in the evening, and when I woke up the next morning buried deep in the straw, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s367">I was desperate, not knowing what to do, except to hide.</span> <span id="s368">I also told him at which town and factory we had been working.</span> <span id="s369">I knew that all I needed was to be in time.</span> <span id="s370">I didn’t tell him that the factory had closed.</span> <span id="s371">He couldn’t check on me because there was no communication at all, no telephones, no trains, no buses, no public transportation.</span> <span id="s372">He didn’t know what to do with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Finally he decided to send me back the next day to Sömmerda where the factory was.</span> <span id="s374">That pleased me a lot because it meant another day’s walk to the West again—closer to the Western Front.</span> <span id="s375">After the conversation, they put me for the night in a stall with horses, in an enclosure where I could hardly sit down on the floor.</span> <span id="s376">How I wished I had been back in the barn with the straw.</span> <span id="s377">Later in the evening after it got dark, two little children about five or six years old entered.</span> <span id="s378">One of them had some kind of a fabric draped on one arm.</span> <span id="s379">With his other hand he pulled out a thin mug with some coffee in it.</span> <span id="s380">He said they were children of the mayor, and were told to try to get here without anyone seeing them.</span> <span id="s381">I drank down the coffee; they had to rush back home.</span> <span id="s382">After a very long night, an older man who was a city elder came to get me.</span> <span id="s383">He was in charge of taking me back to Sömmerda.</span> <span id="s384">Before we started he came close to me and said if I slept with him he would hide me.</span> <span id="s385">Before he could finish his sentence, I kicked him so hard in his groin with my still-existing ski boot that he fell on his back.</span> <span id="s386">He soon got up, without further words, and we started off on our day’s trip.</span> <span id="s387">He had a bicycle; I had to quickly follow him on foot.</span> <span id="s388">From time to time he stopped, so I could catch up with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">The roads were crowded with all kinds of people, everybody on foot—sirens and the roar of aircraft penetrating everything.</span> <span id="s390">There were groups of foreign laborers from many countries.</span> <span id="s391">Then the crowds got a little thinner; my guard let me ride his bike for a little while, and he followed me on foot.</span> <span id="s392">When my guard saw that a military truck was approaching us, he told me to get off the bicycle and lie down on the ground.</span> <span id="s393">He did not want the truck driver to see a woman alone riding on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s394">Early in the afternoon, we passed by an inn; my guard took me in with him, told me to stay in a corner till he had a stein of beer.</span> <span id="s395">The minute he stepped away from me, I was surrounded by about a dozen French laborers who were housed next to our camp.</span> <span id="s396">They recognized me where I had been because of my shorn head and uniform.</span> <span id="s397">They asked me if I had any money.</span> <span id="s398">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s399">Within minutes they put their heads together, keeping an eye on my guard, handed me some money.</span> <span id="s400">I didn’t even have the time to say, “Thank you,” or ask for their names, when my guard came back.</span> <span id="s401">Only much later did I have a chance to count the money.</span> <span id="s402">It was 80 German Marks—to me it was a fortune!</span></p> <p><span id="s403">We continued our trip, and around 5:00 or 6:00 in the early evening we reached the factory.</span> <span id="s404">Of course, it was closed.</span> <span id="s405">My guard, not knowing what to do with me, took me to the police station.</span> <span id="s406">There I was put in a small cell.</span> <span id="s407">For a very long time, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s408">Then suddenly the door opened and the Gestapo Nazi secret police officer came in to interrogate me.</span> <span id="s409">I told him I was a Hungarian forced laborer and that I had gotten separated by accident from my group.</span> <span id="s410">I was now anxious to join them again, and I hoped he would help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">My story was credible since I had been on the road for two days.</span> <span id="s412">After he left, maybe another 10-12 people came in, one by one, all of them asking questions.</span> <span id="s413">I gave the same answers as before.</span> <span id="s414">When they were asking different questions, my answer was, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s415">When twilight came, the door opened again.</span> <span id="s416">I was led to a huge military truck full of soldiers in Russian military uniforms.</span> <span id="s417">This time I was really scared.</span> <span id="s418">I’d heard many stories about the invading Russian forces of the First World War.</span> <span id="s419">To my greatest surprise, they were courteous.</span> <span id="s420">They were sitting in the truck crowded together.</span> <span id="s421">They put two of their backpacks—one on top of the other—and then offered me a seat.</span> <span id="s422">The truck started immediately.</span> <span id="s423">The conditions of the road were the same—the deafening sound of sirens and aircraft, bombs falling, lighting up the dark sky.</span> <span id="s424">From time to time, the truck had to stop to avoid the firing bombs.</span> <span id="s425">I tried to talk to the soldiers in German and in English.</span> <span id="s426">They answered me in Russian.</span> <span id="s427">The only thing I found out was that they were prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Around 2:00 or 3:00 A.M. the truck stopped in front of an enclosure, which was a camp for prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s429">Everybody had to leave the truck and enter at the gate which was watched by a single old, toothless guard.</span> <span id="s430">When my turn came, the guard stopped me and said this was a camp only for men, and he couldn’t allow a woman to enter.</span> <span id="s431">I asked him quietly to let me stay there till the truck with the Gestapo men left.</span> <span id="s432">Then I begged him to let me in.</span> <span id="s433">I was dead tired, hungry, and thirsty.</span> <span id="s434">He took pity on me and gave me a little room with a cot in it.</span> <span id="s435">He also told me that at 6:00 A.M. his guard duty would be over and I would have to leave before that.</span> <span id="s436">I agreed to everything—I had no alternative.</span> <span id="s437">He gave me a mug of coffee and left.</span> <span id="s438">I fell onto the cot and was asleep within seconds.</span> <span id="s439">Soon I heard him knock on the door.</span> <span id="s440">He told me it was 5:45 A.M.</span> <span id="s441">It seemed to me that I slept just for a few moments.</span> <span id="s442">I had to get out.</span> <span id="s443">There was on the cot a very lightweight military blanket.</span> <span id="s444">I asked him whether I could take it.</span> <span id="s445">He agreed, but I had to wrap it around myself under my dress.</span> <span id="s446">It came in very handy because the early morning was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">It was a great surprise that I could leave alone without a guard.</span> <span id="s448">It was a beautiful spring morning; the sun was shining on the little hills around me.</span> <span id="s449">I was overwhelmed that I had reached the day.</span> <span id="s450">I said a thanksgiving prayer repeatedly.</span> <span id="s451">My ecstasy was greatly dampened the minute I started to think: What now?</span> <span id="s452">Where will I go?</span> <span id="s453">Who would talk to me in my dirty prisoner’s uniform?</span> <span id="s454">I started to walk on the only road that was leading away from the camp.</span> <span id="s455">It was Sunday.</span> <span id="s456">I walked for a very long time until I saw that I was reaching a little village.</span> <span id="s457">The few people I met were glaring at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">During my long walk I made a plan in my head.</span> <span id="s459">The best thing I could think of was to go to the nearest police station and ask for help.</span> <span id="s460">When I approached the center of the village, I gathered enough courage to stop people and ask where the police station is.</span> <span id="s461">A few people didn’t even answer, but in the end I succeeded to find the police station.</span> <span id="s462">It was on the second floor of a building in the center of the village.</span> <span id="s463">When trying to enter, the door was locked.</span> <span id="s464">A sign on it said that the office would be open only at 9:00 A.M. I had no idea what time it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">I went down to the street and discovered that on the first floor there was an inn, and the time was 8:45.</span> <span id="s466">I went in with the hope that I could get something to eat.</span> <span id="s467">I had money—I felt rich.</span> <span id="s468">When I ordered the food, the waiter asked me for my food ration card.</span> <span id="s469">I didn’t have any, so I couldn’t get any food, only coffee.</span> <span id="s470">No bread either.</span> <span id="s471">I went back to the police station.</span> <span id="s472">It was open.</span> <span id="s473">I told them that I’m a foreign laborer and got somehow separated from my group.</span> <span id="s474">I didn’t know how to find them.</span> <span id="s475">I was told that they couldn’t help me.</span> <span id="s476">Then I asked them to give me some identification papers telling that I voluntarily reported at this office and was not a fugitive.</span> <span id="s477">It took me some time.</span> <span id="s478">Well, finally they gave them to me but I couldn’t talk them into giving me some food ration cards.</span> <span id="s479">I was told that I had to report at the nearest labor office that was about 10 kilometers away in a neighboring town.</span> <span id="s480">On Sunday this office was closed, and the commuter bus was not running either.</span> <span id="s481">I had to look for a place for the night.</span> <span id="s482">The police officer told me to go to a few members of the Nazi Women’s Association.</span> <span id="s483">He gave me a list of five or six such members.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">After leaving the police station I was looking for a way to wash myself.</span> <span id="s485">Then I went back to the inn.</span> <span id="s486">They had stopped serving breakfast.</span> <span id="s487">In spite of this it was filled with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s488">The majority of those were high ranking Nazi officers with their families, who were most likely fleeing to save their own lives.</span> <span id="s489">One of these women was using her manicuring tools.</span> <span id="s490">I went over to borrow those from her.</span> <span id="s491">She looked at me astonished, but did not refuse.</span> <span id="s492">How my poor hands needed attention!</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Next I tried to find a way to wash myself.</span> <span id="s494">I found the kitchen of the inn.</span> <span id="s495">There were four women and a little child in it.</span> <span id="s496">I told them that I had money but no food ration card, whether they could give me something to eat.</span> <span id="s497">I was told to come back after the midday meal, and if there was any food left, I could have some.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Next I asked if they had a place for me to wash myself.</span> <span id="s499">There was a washroom in the yard, with a toilet and sink in it.</span> <span id="s500">It was the fifth day that I had no chance to wash myself.</span> <span id="s501">How delightful it was to feel the cold water on my body.</span> <span id="s502">My dilemma was what to wash—my undershirt or dress.</span> <span id="s503">I did my dress which had to dry on me.</span> <span id="s504">I spent the time till after lunch walking in the yard, looking for a spot with sun.</span> <span id="s505">Before they finished serving lunch, I was back at the inn, anxiously waiting.</span> <span id="s506">I got some spinach, a slice of bread, and some coffee.</span> <span id="s507">Fortified physically by the food, I went to find the women on my list that the police officer gave me.</span> <span id="s508">I saw three of them.</span> <span id="s509">In spite of showing them the identifications from the police station, and I had money to pay for it, they wouldn’t let me in, stating that they had no room.</span> <span id="s510">After the third refusal I had a brainstorm.</span> <span id="s511">Maybe I could count on the good will of the four women I saw in the kitchen of the inn.</span> <span id="s512">I went back there with the excuse of thanking them for the food.</span> <span id="s513">I told them that I had to report the next morning at the labor office in the next village.</span> <span id="s514">I had nothing to do meanwhile.</span> <span id="s515">I was so grateful for the food they gave me, in return maybe they would have some use for me.</span> <span id="s516">I announced that I am a dressmaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">This hit them like lightning.</span> <span id="s518">They looked at each other, then at me, then again at each other.</span> <span id="s519">Then they fell silent.</span> <span id="s520">I broke the silence asking whether they had any materials for clothes.</span> <span id="s521">At this point they told me that they had no chance to get anything new since Hitler got to power.</span> <span id="s522">They had fabrics piled up, not knowing what to do with them, and they asked me what I could do.</span> <span id="s523">I asked them to show me what they had, and then I would advise them.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Loads of fabrics came down to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s525">I picked out four pieces—one for each.</span> <span id="s526">Then I drew some sketches, advised what fabric to use, who should get what.</span> <span id="s527">I told them that I could cut, baste, and fit all four, and if they had a sewing machine they could finish it.</span> <span id="s528">At the end of the day, I had accomplished for them what I had said I would do.</span> <span id="s529">After that they gave me a decent and complete dinner, and I was asked to stay with them.</span> <span id="s530">I told them that I couldn’t, I was ordered by the police to report tomorrow morning in the next village in the labor office.</span> <span id="s531">Then I was told that they had a good relationship with the police officers, and could get permission for me to stay.</span> <span id="s532">Their cleaning lady would put me up for the night since her husband was in the army.</span> <span id="s533">It was good to sleep in a bed with linen after a year.</span> <span id="s534">For that moment, I was temporarily taken care of.</span> <span id="s535">I worked, had enough food, and a bed for the night.</span> <span id="s536">Now, only if the Americans would arrive!</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Since the police had been notified of my presence with them, I could stay a few days longer.</span> <span id="s538">Every afternoon I went into the inn to get some news.</span> <span id="s539">All kinds of people were coming in and out.</span> <span id="s540">Three days after my stay, the Americans arrived.</span> <span id="s541">I was excited to see the first American tanks rolling in.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">I stayed with this family, and when they wanted to pay me, I requested that they give me some time off to make some clothes for myself instead.</span> <span id="s543">I had the blanket I had gotten at the camp of the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s544">I made a skirt and an Eisenhower jacket from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">The traffic in the inn was very lively.</span> <span id="s546">One afternoon three American prisoners of war walked in.</span> <span id="s547">At that time I was still wearing my prison uniform.</span> <span id="s548">After a short conversation, they said I should wait for them, they will be back.</span> <span id="s549">When they came back, their arms were loaded with clothes.</span> <span id="s550">They didn’t say it, but I figured that they walked into some residences and grabbed whatever they could.</span> <span id="s551">I found out from them that within three days they would be flown back home to the U.S. I asked them also to take a note with them to my brother who lived in Philadelphia, and whose address I fortunately remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">On the note I put my return address of the place where I was staying.</span> <span id="s553">It turned out that one of the American prisoners lived in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s554">He was Italian-American, spoke to me in Yiddish, and promised to deliver the note in person, which he did.</span> <span id="s555">I was impatiently waiting for an answer from my brother.</span> <span id="s556">While waiting for that, one morning I came down from the attic; I found the whole family in tears.</span> <span id="s557">They told me that the Führer, Hitler, was dead—he had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s558">I ran back upstairs to the attic with a sharp knife in my hand that I had gotten from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s559">There was a large picture of Hitler in this attic.</span> <span id="s560">I took the knife and punctured his two eyes.</span> <span id="s561">Doing this brought me satisfaction.</span> <span id="s562">I now knew the war was over.</span> <span id="s563">Hitler’s reign had come to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">This happened at the end of April.</span> <span id="s565">The war ended officially on the 8th of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s566">Only now did I tell the family with whom I was staying that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s567">After that they treated me even nicer.</span> <span id="s568">I think it was the feeling of guilt that made them kinder to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">There were no newspapers.</span> <span id="s570">We only heard by word of mouth what was happening.</span> <span id="s571">It could be true or just gossip.</span> <span id="s572">My primary interest was to find out whether there were any other survivors of my family.</span> <span id="s573">I could only hope that the three near members of my family from whom I had been separated at Auschwitz had also survived as I had.</span> <span id="s574">The way we got information was that survivors of the many concentration camps, who were traveling on bicycles from camp to camp, were able to collect the names of all those who had survived.</span> <span id="s575">The nearest notorious concentration camp was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s576">The first American forces that had arrived in trucks were so shocked at what they saw.</span> <span id="s577">They immediately left the camp and forced everyone they encountered on the road into their trucks and returned to Buchenwald in order to show the unburied corpses piled up.</span> <span id="s578">They also saw the skeleton-like survivors who were still breathing, lying all over the ground.</span> <span id="s579">It was a few weeks before some local trains and buses started to run.</span> <span id="s580">When I found this out, I decided to go there.</span> <span id="s581">When I got there, the camp was cleared, the dead were buried, and different voluntary agencies were providing food and some services that made the camp fit for human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">It was now the beginning of June of 1945.</span> <span id="s583">Here in Buchenwald I met some people I knew from Hungary, but none of them were the members of my family that I had hoped to find.</span> <span id="s584">I met one of my brother’s friends.</span> <span id="s585">He had in his possession an American white nylon parachute.</span> <span id="s586">He remembered that I knew how to sew.</span> <span id="s587">He asked if I would make him two sets of underwear with the parachute.</span> <span id="s588">I first had to inquire around for a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s589">Luckily, I got one from a voluntary agent.</span> <span id="s590">I gladly made the two sets of underwear for him.</span> <span id="s591">I then used the rest of the material for my own needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">One afternoon, while walking around the camp, I heard someone call my name.</span> <span id="s593">It was an American officer.</span> <span id="s594">I identified myself.</span> <span id="s595">He handed me a letter that he had received from my brother in Philadelphia addressed to him.</span> <span id="s596">When I opened the letter I recognized my brother’s handwriting—I was in ecstasy!</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Behind the officer was an American soldier with a big box on his shoulders full of food.</span> <span id="s598">The officer had found this soldier who knew the Hungarian language and, therefore, could communicate with me.</span> <span id="s599">By coincidence he also had been born in Sighet, where I had lived.</span> <span id="s600">In my brother’s letter to the officer, my brother mentioned that he had been working for this officer’s brother in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s601">He asked him to find me and to give me whatever I needed.</span> <span id="s602">The officer was guaranteed by his brother that he would be reimbursed to the penny for any money he had to spend to find me.</span> <span id="s603">He asked me what I needed.</span> <span id="s604">I didn’t need any food.</span> <span id="s605">The only thing I wanted was for him to make it possible for me to keep in touch with my brother.</span> <span id="s606">He told me that he was stationed in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s607">This was 300 miles to the west from Buchenwald, and was the military headquarters of the American occupying forces.</span> <span id="s608">He took out a three-day leave to make this trip.</span> <span id="s609">First he drove to the little village where I was staying, and there he was told that I was at Buchenwald, where he found me.</span> <span id="s610">I begged him to take me with him, which he refused first.</span> <span id="s611">Afterwards I told him that there were rumors in camp that the Russians take over this area.</span> <span id="s612">He said that he will spend the night in Weimar where the nearest American troops were stationed and if the rumors prove to be true, he will come back the next day and take me to Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">He came the next day, picked me up, and after a long ride in a Jeep, we arrived in the late afternoon to the complex where his unit was.</span> <span id="s614">There were about a dozen buildings which housed the troops.</span> <span id="s615">One of the building housed female workers.</span> <span id="s616">They were former foreign laborers, and were doing all kinds of work for the troops, like cleaning the rooms, doing the laundry, ironing, etc.</span> <span id="s617">I got a room in that building.</span> <span id="s618">The next day I found myself a place to work.</span> <span id="s619">I sorted the laundry after it was washed and ironed, and did the mending wherever it was necessary, sewing on buttons and so on.</span> <span id="s620">I got three full meals a day and was also paid for my work.</span> <span id="s621">Whenever I had a chance, I went to explore the city of Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Wiesbaden is a famous and beautiful resort city.</span> <span id="s623">I was very much surprised that there was not much bomb damage.</span> <span id="s624">It had many beautiful stores.</span> <span id="s625">The stores were practically empty.</span> <span id="s626">I looked for some stores where I could buy some notions—toothpaste, other toiletries, etc.</span> <span id="s627">Eventually I needed some underwear too.</span> <span id="s628">Even sewing thread was very scarce.</span> <span id="s629">There was a beautiful huge department store that had almost nothing to sell.</span> <span id="s630">After I went there a few times and found out who the owner was, I told her that I worked for the Americans and could pay for the items that I wanted with butter, sugar, and other food items.</span> <span id="s631">After I said that, they had everything I needed.</span> <span id="s632">I was also able to correspond with my brother, who was trying to get me immigration papers.</span> <span id="s633">It took some time—there were no more diplomatic relations between the two countries.</span> <span id="s634">After three months, on October 15, the unit got orders to evacuate the civilian workers from this camp.</span> <span id="s635">I had to look for some other work and lodging.</span> <span id="s636">During those past three months I was very diligent studying English.</span> <span id="s637">I had some background.</span> <span id="s638">When I was six and one of my brothers, who was then 16, studied English taught me, too.</span> <span id="s639">It was easy to find a tutor in the military camp.</span> <span id="s640">My first task was to find a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">I succeeded within a few days.</span> <span id="s642">It was a furnished room with kitchen and bathroom privileges.</span> <span id="s643">Once a week we had warm water.</span> <span id="s644">All this time I was thinking where and what work I could get.</span> <span id="s645">A restitution committee was formed in the city to help the former concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s646">I was offered to live in an official displaced person camp with room and board.</span> <span id="s647">I didn’t want to become a parasite.</span> <span id="s648">I valued my independence more than ever.</span> <span id="s649">I borrowed 300 German Marks from this organization and bought a used sewing machine.</span> <span id="s650">To get some contacts, I went again to the department store, inquiring whether they knew someone who needed a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s651">They introduced me to a beautiful woman who was the wife of an American Colonel—Colonel Kincaid.</span> <span id="s652">She was Hungarian by birth, so we understood each other very well.</span> <span id="s653">I made her two dresses.</span> <span id="s654">She was very pleased, but had no more fabrics.</span> <span id="s655">She was planning to return to the U.S. shortly, gave me her address, and asked me to call her when I would arrive there later.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">In return I asked her to persuade her husband to get me some work with the American military government.</span> <span id="s657">Their headquarters were in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s658">Within a few days I was working there as a clerk, translator, interpreter, and typist.</span> <span id="s659">Besides my salary, I got one big meal a day without food ration cards.</span> <span id="s660">Another advantage of it was that I could always find someone in the office, under whose name I could keep in touch with my brother in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">I was kept informed here of the political news.</span> <span id="s662">Frankfurt was only one hour away, where the Americans had their non-military administration offices.</span> <span id="s663">I could get from the officers a ride to Frankfurt on a Jeep once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s664">I knew this would be advantageous for me.</span> <span id="s665">Then I could become better informed on the procedure of getting my identification papers, so that I could leave for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">During all this time my correspondence with my brother and his family was uninterrupted.</span> <span id="s667">At the beginning of May, 1946 my immigration papers and the ticket for the boat ride arrived, paid for by him.</span> <span id="s668">I got passage on the first official Displaced Persons ship, the Marine Flesher, which was a troop transportation ship during the war.</span> <span id="s669">It was scheduled to leave on the 9th of May.</span> <span id="s670">It took a two-day train ride to get to Bremerhaven, from where the boat sailed.</span> <span id="s671">This town and harbor hardly had any buildings that were not totally or partially bombed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">There all I did was recite thanksgiving prayers and ask God to let me leave behind all the horrid experiences.</span> <span id="s673">I was full of emotions, expectations, hopes, great joy to be shortly with my family.</span> <span id="s674">Maybe my only heritage of my parents, wishing me happiness, was to be fulfilled in the new world at last with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Now that I have finished describing my two years in Germany and the events that led to it, I feel as if tons and tons of weight have been lifted off my conscience.</span> <span id="s676">I am convinced that my surviving was not a coincidence.</span> <span id="s677">I had a mission to accomplish.</span> <span id="s678">I know that besides the ones that perished, there were countless others who suffered a lot more than I did.</span> <span id="s679">Thank God the physical difficulties were not as hard to take for me as the mental and emotional torture I went through.</span> <span id="s680">The Nazis who tried to eliminate the Jews killed them not just once, but by demoralizing us, breaking our spirits, taking away our faith, dehumanizing us to the level of animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">I want to emphasize that I did not describe my personal story out of hatred.</span> <span id="s682">I feel no hatred, only pain.</span> <span id="s683">The reason of sharing my experiences—and it is only one among many, many other personal stories of these horrendous happenings of World War II—is that these events must be recorded by those of us who experienced it in order that future generations should never forget it, and thus to be able to prevent that it should ever happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">I am dedicating this recording to my close and extended family.</span> <span id="s685">I have to give credit to the Kalman and Goldfine families who urged me to do it soon.</span> <span id="s686">To my friends, to future generations, and the whole world, and to, last but not least, my dear friend, Mary Nocera, who is not Jewish, but a lover of truth.</span> <span id="s687">Without her moral support, patience, understanding, and guidance I could never have done it.</span></p></body></html>
