id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rita Penn, on March 2nd, 2010, conducted by Ina Navazelskis, held at Leisure World in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you Rita, for coming to speak with us.</span> <span id="s13">I’d like to start this interview like we do almost all of ours, at the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And that is information about your birth, who were your parents, where were you born, did you have siblings, what did your family do?</span> <span id="s16">Provide us a context for the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">Well, I was born March 29, 1933, in Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s19">My parents are Simon – well, he used to spell it, s-z-y-m-o-n, but now, later it became anglicized, and it was s-i-m-o-n Knoll, k-n-o-l-l.</span> <span id="s20">And my mother, her maiden name was Appel, a-p-p-e-l, and I have no siblings, I was an only child.</span> <span id="s21">We lived in an apartment house in a two part apartment, and my – my father’s brother and his family, they had two children, their – they did not stay in Europe either.</span> <span id="s22">And we lived in the – the same building.</span> <span id="s23">Some years ago, I took my family to Vienna, and I knew the address, so I went to look at the building.</span> <span id="s24">And there was a plaque there that said this is not the original building.</span> <span id="s25">The original was destroyed in the war – in the World War II and I thought, good for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Was your family originally from Vienna, were they Austrian Jews, or were they from – s-z-y-m-o-n suggests Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s28">Both my parents were born in Poland.</span> <span id="s29">They came to Vienna as young adults, and I don’t know exactly when that was, and they married.</span> <span id="s30">My father had six brothers and three sisters, large family.</span> <span id="s31">And the family was in – they had a business that had to do with sewing machines, and they did something with cloth for sacks and things.</span> <span id="s32">But the whole family worked there, the sisters worked in the office, the three sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: This was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, this was in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Was in Vienna, I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s37">So they all worked there together.</span> <span id="s38">So, they – and I knew – well, some of them I knew later, because many – several of them escaped, a couple of them didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: So, I had – I – I still have one cousin who lived in the same apartment with us, she lives in New York; I don’t see her very often.</span> <span id="s41">Her brother, who I was a little closer to, he died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s42">He was a journalist, and he actually worked for “The Washington Post,” for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Irwin Knoll.</span> <span id="s45">He worked for the Post and then he went out to Madison, Wisconsin to edit “The Progressive.”</span> <span id="s46">He was very liberal.</span> <span id="s47">Good guy, but didn’t take very good care of himself.</span> <span id="s48">His widow still lives in D.C. now.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s50">And there – and he then also escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What are your earliest memories that you can remember of – of your home, your household, your – of Vienna, of your childhood, while you were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s56">Well, I was six when I left, so it’s not very, very clear.</span> <span id="s57">In fact, when we went back with the family, I walked around trying to think if anything looked familiar.</span> <span id="s58">At the time we were there, they were building a subway, so the whole city was sort of torn up, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: That we went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It must have been in the 70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s64">So it’s a good 30 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah, with my husband and two children we went there before they went off.</span> <span id="s68">You know, they’re adults now, with their own children, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: And do you – do you remember then, aba – about those first six years?</span> <span id="s70">Do you have any sense of Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I have vague memories, mainly of my family and my cousin, th-the one who died, who lived in the building with me, beating me up.</span> <span id="s72">That I remember very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: And I remember we had a fairly large extended family and we used to get together at – I think it was my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s75">But I don’t have very clear memories of as – you know, a six year old is not really too sharp.</span> <span id="s76">I do remember when we left Vienna.</span> <span id="s77">I remember it was kind of uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s78">My mother – we were not allowed to bring any jewelry with us or anything.</span> <span id="s79">And I re – I remember I had a necklace, a very thin little necklace, and I remember my mother sewed the necklace into the elastic of my underpants.</span> <span id="s80">And my father had left a little before us, because it was really very bad for men.</span> <span id="s81">And so my mother and I left, and I remember going on the – the boat from Calais to –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Do you remember the trip from Vienna to Calais?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, I thi – I remember being on the train, but not very clearly, you know?</span> <span id="s86">And then I remember on the boat over to Calais.</span> <span id="s87">And then we were in England and we lived in London.</span> <span id="s88">We were there during a lot of the blitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I remember wonderful times we had going to sleep in the subway, the underground, as they call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s92">What part of London, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: We were in – jeez, I don’t remember exactly where it was.</span> <span id="s94">Kilburn, I think [indecipherable] section.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I think that’s in west la – western part of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I – I’ve been back several times to London, but I don’t re –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Not east London.</span> <span id="s100">Not – not south London.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Yeah, I think Kilburn is west, if I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s104">We were there for awhile.</span> <span id="s105">The – there was a – a Jewish agency that – that helped at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So you weren’t on a Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I was with my mother the whole time.</span> <span id="s110">My father went to the Isle of Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: He was interned for 11 months, because the British were very nervous about people who spoke German.</span> <span id="s113">And of course, we spoke German then.</span> <span id="s114">So he was interned there.</span> <span id="s115">Also, my mother had a sister who had married a German, who tried to follow – who did follow her to England.</span> <span id="s116">And then he was sent on a transport to Canada and it was torpedoed, and he went down.</span> <span id="s117">And that was – she never remarried or anything.</span> <span id="s118">My father was there for 11 months.</span> <span id="s119">He had a great time.</span> <span id="s120">He became a cook, which he never did before or since.</span> <span id="s121">And in – it wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: He wasn’t mistreated?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No, oh no, no.</span> <span id="s124">He – he seemed to, you know, get along with all the people there, and when he was released, he came and joined us.</span> <span id="s125">By this time –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Do you remember not having him around?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s128">My mother was only able to work as a domestic.</span> <span id="s129">That was the only job that was available for the immigrants.</span> <span id="s130">And I remember we went to – she worked in what was called a – a boys’ college, it was like private school, with kids living there.</span> <span id="s131">And I got the measles.</span> <span id="s132">And so they shipped me off to the hospital very fast, before I spread it through the entire –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: – school population.</span> <span id="s135">And that was my – just my mother and I were there at that time.</span> <span id="s136">And then my – the school that I went to in England, and I don’t really have a clear picture of that school in London, decided to evacuate everybody out to the country.</span> <span id="s137">So they sent us out to Gloucestershire, and we lived in a little town – a little village outside of Cheltenham, and we were boarded with a family there.</span> <span id="s138">And I – I have very clear pictures of that.</span> <span id="s139">I went to school there, they had a – a regular school in a neighborhood.</span> <span id="s140">And I – I do remember one day the principal I guess it was, called me into the office and said, you – you understand German?</span> <span id="s141">I said, well, I don’t speak it much any more, because by then you – you didn’t speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: That was going to be – that was going to be one of my questions, is how was that transition for – for a young child?</span> <span id="s143">They – they soak up languages like sponges.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So, I could imagine –</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I was teaching my parents.</span> <span id="s147">My parents had been taking English lessons, you know, with – with records and stuff.</span> <span id="s148">And they – they died with an accent, okay?</span> <span id="s149">I picked it up immediately.</span> <span id="s150">And the principal said to me, you speak German?</span> <span id="s151">I – well, I understand German, cause I didn’t want to speak it any more.</span> <span id="s152">And apparently, there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me, the Germans.</span> <span id="s153">And I –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: – refused to talk to –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You must have been a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I must have been about eight or nine at the time.</span> <span id="s158">And I said no, I won’t talk to them.</span> <span id="s159">And I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s160">I would not talk – I wouldn't meet with them, I wouldn’t talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So tell me though, as an eight or nine year old child, to have such – such a very strong, marked position, how had things been explained to you by your parents, of what was going on, and why you’d left Vienna, and – and this war, and so on.</span> <span id="s162">Ti – can you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t remember ever actually discussing it with them.</span> <span id="s165">It was just sort of a fact of life that you left Vienna.</span> <span id="s166">You didn’t – you – you couldn’t stay there any more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms, and the boots, and – and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of there, the better.</span> <span id="s167">So, off we went to England, and I became an English child fast.</span> <span id="s168">I – I was – as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I – I picked it up, you know, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So, in other words, was it an English child saying to the principal that no, I don’t want to talk to the German prisoners of war, because they’re the enemy of England and we’ve just survived the blitz, or was it a –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No, I just said I don’t want to talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: And that was the end of it, yeah.</span> <span id="s173">And I didn’t.</span> <span id="s174">I never met them, and I – I wouldn’t speak with them, so I – I don’t know why they wanted to talk to me in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: I also find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I find it –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: It was – I don’t know, maybe – I don’t know, maybe they were being rehabilitated or something, I don’t know, I really don’t know, but it was kind of a strange episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: But other than that, did you wa – did you feel comfortable in – in England, in Britain?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders.</span> <span id="s181">We were the refugees.</span> <span id="s182">At that time, Britain was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the country, you know, London was a little different, but out in the country, you know.</span> <span id="s183">They didn’t know what Jews were.</span> <span id="s184">We sort of had to explain, you know.</span> <span id="s185">There was a woman who came from London, once or twice – I think once a week or twice a week, I don’t remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can’t read.</span> <span id="s186">And once in awhile, after things were not quite as bad, we – we had some relatives in London, so we would go to visit them in – in London occasionally.</span> <span id="s187">Meanwhile, my aunt, the aunt, my mother’s sister, the one who married the German, she had also been interned in the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s188">And she was released, and she stayed in London for – until after the war, and eventually came to the U.S.</span> <span id="s189">But we would go and visit her too, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on.</span> <span id="s190">That – that was pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Do you remember war – wartime sorts of episodes or experiences while in Britain, or was it blitz, and Cheltenham and – and this, you know, inter – non-interaction with – with the – the POWs, you know, that you were asked to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Were there more such things that – that – that are in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well, I remember listening to Churchill on the radio.</span> <span id="s195">I mean, everybody listened to Churchill on the radio, and he made things, you know, he was very positive, and – and upbeat and everything.</span> <span id="s196">I remember the sound of the – the bombs, you know, the – those things that – that made this noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: The V2 rockets?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yeah, and then they stopped, and then you knew they were gonna fall.</span> <span id="s199">And then when we went to the underground and – at night, we would come out in the morning and there would be rubble all over, because you know, the bomb had dropped not far away.</span> <span id="s200">But the – the underground was very safe, and everybody went to the underground.</span> <span id="s201">I loved it, because I – I have no siblings, and when we went to the underground, you know, we’d go with our pillows and our blankets and everything, and there’d be kids to play with.</span> <span id="s202">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s203">On the platform, you know, we – we’d run around and have a great time.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: What – what kids do.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: What kids do, and thank goodness they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s208">It was a very, you know, su-supposedly normal childhood.</span> <span id="s209">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Do you remember V-E day?</span> <span id="s211">Do you remember th-the day that war was over, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I remember I went to school, and the teacher said, do you know what day this is?</span> <span id="s213">It was V day – V-D day, V – the day that they landed at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: In Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And, of course, none of us knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: D-Day, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And she said, remember this day, because it’s very important.</span> <span id="s220">There – the place where we lived, it wa – there was a – a group of – th-there was a – an American base not far, and so the soldiers used to come in, and I had a – a friend who had an older sister who, you know, they used to go out with the G.I.s and everything.</span> <span id="s221">And we used to follow the G.I.s, and we’d say to them, got any gum, chum?</span> <span id="s222">And they would give us gum.</span> <span id="s223">And we thought that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: The coolest thing, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: – the won – wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s226">So that – that was – that was really fun.</span> <span id="s227">So I – I really didn’t have a deprived kind of childhood.</span> <span id="s228">I had a – a really, you know, pretty decent, considering, you know, when you look back –</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: The circumstances, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: – and you think about where – where I started, and what happened, it was really pretty normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did your parent try to get out of Vienna earlier than ’39?</span> <span id="s232">Do you – did they ever talk to you later, when you were older, about the circumstances, and the planning, and the, you know, everything –</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: – that went into leaving, and how they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No, they never did.</span> <span id="s236">The only thing, after the war, we – my father had a sister who married a doctor, and he survived.</span> <span id="s237">He – I don’t know if he’s still alive, he lived in New York, but I do – I don’t know if he’s still alive or not.</span> <span id="s238">He came to visit us in England, and he told my parents what went on.</span> <span id="s239">His – his wife, my – my aunt, and they had a child who died in the camps.</span> <span id="s240">And he told them, but they wouldn’t let me listen.</span> <span id="s241">They sent me to bed, and said you – you can’t hear this.</span> <span id="s242">So I never did hear the story, which – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And this large, extended family that your father came from, did most of them stay in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Just – well, one brother was severely beaten on Kristallnacht, I remember.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t know if he died after that, or if he disappeared, or what happened.</span> <span id="s246">Another brother was killed, I believe.</span> <span id="s247">His son is still alive, and his – his wife escaped, and they went to Canada, and he’s my Canadian cousin.</span> <span id="s248">He’s – I just saw him a couple of weeks ago, we were – he – he goes to Florida in the winter.</span> <span id="s249">There was one – let’s see, was that a – that was a – a brother of my father’s, and his family.</span> <span id="s250">He had wife and two children.</span> <span id="s251">They died.</span> <span id="s252">They stayed in the camps.</span> <span id="s253">As far as I know, my grandmother died, she never left.</span> <span id="s254">The rest of the – the family escaped.</span> <span id="s255">My father’s family.</span> <span id="s256">My mother didn’t have a very big family, she had a brother and a sister, both of them went to Canada.</span> <span id="s257">So they escaped.</span> <span id="s258">So, I basically lost two cousins, several uncles, and a couple of aunts.</span> <span id="s259">But I have an uncle who went to New York, and he is the father of the – the cousin who was the reporter, and I had another aunt who also came to New Jersey, and when we came to the U.S. we stayed with them in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s260">She married a man who, he had also, he had come from Austria, I think he was a native Austrian.</span> <span id="s261">But they – they had come earlier.</span> <span id="s262">And their son, who – who is another cousin of mine that I’m very fond of, he was born in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Post-war, while still in Britain –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: – are there any – what kind of a life was that, in those first, post-war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: We left the little village where we had been billeted with this family, and we went to Cheltenham town, and we bought – my father bought a house.</span> <span id="s267">You know, it was a duplex, so he bought the – half of the house.</span> <span id="s268">And I went to school there, not liking school all that well, because they made me do phys ed, which I didn’t like.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: I share that with you.</span> <span id="s270">I share it completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: I – I w – I went back to the school when I went with my family, and I said, could I look at my record?</span> <span id="s272">You know, here you can look at any –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Oh no, we can’t show you the records, they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: School records?</span> <span id="s276">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Because I – I – whenever we – th-they were very much into gymnastics, and I can’t do any of that stuff.</span> <span id="s278">And so when – when – whenever we – we would have one of these days where we would have to perform for the rest of the school, and everything was in teams, you know, you were on this team, and – and you had to do things for the good of the team, and – and all that.</span> <span id="s279">I would stay home that day.</span> <span id="s280">And I remember going back the next day and the headmistress – this was a girls’ school, said to me, why weren’t you here yesterday?</span> <span id="s281">And she said, you weren’t sick, were you?</span> <span id="s282">And I said no.</span> <span id="s283">And she said, why weren’t you here?</span> <span id="s284">And I said, I didn’t want to let my team down.</span> <span id="s285">I thought that was a good way to put it.</span> <span id="s286">And they whacked you over the head in those days, they did.</span> <span id="s287">I would get whacked.</span> <span id="s288">But, I could –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: But were – were you made to feel like a foreigner?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: We – we were never really considered English.</span> <span id="s291">We were always those people that came from Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s292">And after awhile it didn’t really bother me, particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Do you think it bothered your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: It – I think it bothered my father, because he couldn’t wait to come to America.</span> <span id="s295">He had family here, you know the – whatever remained of the family had come to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did they sponsor him in?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">The cousin, his father sponsored us in, and so we came.</span> <span id="s299">And I immediately felt much more at home, like I could belong here, you know, it was a different feeling.</span> <span id="s300">Although I – I love the British.</span> <span id="s301">I go back and I love to go to London and go in the theater and do all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s302">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: I think you caught it right, though, when you said that, after the war, it was not yet a very cosmopolitan society.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No.</span> <span id="s305">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And it’s harder to integrate into British society than it is into American society.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s308">And American society, even though I came here with a pronounced British accent, I went to high school, and people would say to me, talk British to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And they still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: But I don’t have the accent any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Tell me, did you ever use German again?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: The only time I used it was when I was in college, and you had to take two years of language, and I figured ooh, hey, this is gonna be easy.</span> <span id="s313">So I took first year German, which was hard because it was a lot of grammar, which I’d never done, cause I’d never gone to school in German speaking country.</span> <span id="s314">But the professor said to me, don’t take second year German, because you know the vocabulary, go right into third year German, which was basically reading a lot of literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: And it wasn’t in the old script, it was in new script, and so I took that and then that was really a goo – the extent.</span> <span id="s317">We have been back to German speaking countries.</span> <span id="s318">We took one trip for three weeks.</span> <span id="s319">We went to Germany, Switzerland and Austria, all in the German speaking parts.</span> <span id="s320">And by the end of the three weeks, I found I – I remembered more words.</span> <span id="s321">And I – I said to myself, if I ever had to learn German to really communicate, I could do it.</span> <span id="s322">Wouldn’t be a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: But it’s not something I’ve ever – I’ve tried to learn Spanish, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: – stuff like that.</span> <span id="s327">But I – I – I’ve really no desire to speak German, or to – we have a German club here, I’ve never gone.</span> <span id="s328">I just don’t want to even bother.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I have too many other good things to do here.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Can you tell me when you started to learn more about the context of what had happened to your family, of what – what had happened historically, politically?</span> <span id="s332">Were you already in the United States?</span> <span id="s333">Were you already a – an adult?</span> <span id="s334">Or, through childhood, did you know about the Holocaust, did you know about –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, when – when my uncle came to visit us, I sort of got the gist of what happened, even though they wouldn’t let me hear all of the details.</span> <span id="s336">There was a lot of information.</span> <span id="s337">This was right after the war, and there was a lot of information in the papers.</span> <span id="s338">I think I was aware of what had gone on.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: But it wasn’t that you had cut – that there was something particular, you’d go home, you’d talk about it, your parents would have conversations with you, and – and that it was a per – a more personal aspect because it could have been you.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: It could have been, yeah.</span> <span id="s341">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s342">It was okay, we’re here now, we have survived this, and now the next step is to go to the U.S.</span> <span id="s343">We had to wait four years before we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s345">So your father tried even from right at the very end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s347">We applied immediately, and it took four years, and now – we came in January ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s349">I see.</span> <span id="s350">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: I’m looking for the culprit who made the noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: For the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: The culprit, who made a noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: It was somebody walked through.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Oh, oh, I see.</span> <span id="s359">Is there anything that you think needs to be said, that I didn’t ask you about?</span> <span id="s360">About your story, about – about those early years in – in Austria, that you would want people to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Just that I don’t feel – you know, people say to me, where were you born?</span> <span id="s362">And I se – oh, Vienna, oh, that’s a wonderful city, and – and – and – you know, they talk about the music and dance and everything.</span> <span id="s363">Doesn’t do anything for me.</span> <span id="s364">I just have no strong feeling about it.</span> <span id="s365">None.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: No identity, no identi –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no, it doesn’t mean anything, it – it – it really – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And you di – when you went back, you saw that the building wasn’t the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Was there anything else that you recognized from the first six years of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s374">We walked around.</span> <span id="s375">Well, it may have been because of, you know, everything was dug up.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: But I was ready to move on to other places, and we enjoyed Switzerland.</span> <span id="s378">We basically flew in and out of Germany, we didn’t spend any time there.</span> <span id="s379">But, you know, we went around and we looked at things, but it – it’s not the kind of thing that I say to my children, oh, you must go back there, because it’s your heritage.</span> <span id="s380">It’s not your heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: So, I – I don’t have any – I would not – well, I – if I had to go to Europe, I would go to England, because I – I do have a feel for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: But Austria doesn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Doesn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: – doesn’t do it for me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Got it.</span> <span id="s388">Well, Rita, I’d like to thank you for talking with me today.</span> <span id="s389">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: – and this concludes our interview, the interview with Rita Penn on March
