at the time for that I was in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: That is right, after all you were born in 1930.</span> <span id="s84">So you have never been Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No!</span> <span id="s86">I was Bar Mitzvahed here, together with my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: A couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Oh really!</span> <span id="s90">Do you recall the exact year that that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: In 1978, in Dec. ’78.</span> <span id="s92">My daughter is now 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: She was Bat Mitzvahed…and you were Bar Mitzvahed at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes, at the same time, at Temple

Hebrew on special occasions like the prayer table or such.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Yiddish was your primary language?</span> <span id="s104">Yiddish more than Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">Yiddish more than Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: You grew up knowing Yiddish then, and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did your parents speak any other language?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: My father spoke a little German.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did you know German?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes, I could speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Any other language which you could speak at all?</span> <span id="s114">At that time, before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No, a little Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How would you classify yourselves in the community?</span> <span id="s117">It says here rich or poor but basically your economic status is what is meant.</span> <span id="s118">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: We were not rich.</span> <span id="s120">We just made a modest living, by European standard, we were average.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Your father was the sole source of income?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: But you still had what you think was a decent standard of living?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: By the standards of the time.</span> <span id="s125">We didn’t have any refrigeration any luxuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: No indoors plumbing?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: We had no radio!</span> <span id="s128">Yes, we had water.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: But no bathrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s131">We had electricity but we cooked on coal.</span> <span id="s132">This was the average standard of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: You said that you lived in a major city?</span> <span id="s134">Would you classify it as having been a ghetto, within the city -- that is, before the Germans came and the war.</span> <span id="s135">Was it an all Jewish neighborhood you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: It was a section where you could say it was mixed: Polish and Jewish.</span> <span id="s137">It was not an exclusive ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Since it wasn’t, did your parents relate to non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, basically just within the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s142">We had Polish neighbors right next door but we associated very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did you say that you were from Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Lodz.</span> <span id="s145">“LODZ”</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Is it a different name today?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No.</span> <span id="s148">The Germans did (give it another name) during the occupation.</span> <span id="s149">It was called Lismonstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: But it is known as Lodz today?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: To what extent was the synagogue important in your life?</span> <span id="s153">Your life as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Of course, it was the focus of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you attend regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Regularly, no question about that, we had to.</span> <span id="s157">My brothers and sisters went to the Zionist organization instead of the school, when I was small.</span> <span id="s158">But when my father was there we went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How about the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s160">Did you take part in the Jewish community as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No -- there were not the kind of organized activities we have here.</span> <span id="s162">That was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Was your family involved in any other Jewish organizations or religious associations aside from the synagogue?</span> <span id="s164">Was there anything, such as other institutions within the Jewish community they were involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span> <span id="s166">There were several traditional ones and some Zionist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were they active in Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes, my father and my older brother were active in Zionist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What about other institutions such as I believe there were in Poland, the Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s170">Were they involved with that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Cultural events?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A; No.</span> <span id="s174">We went to plays.</span> <span id="s175">I went to some with my parents but not participating.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Were your parents involved in politics at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Let’s now go to another area.</span> <span id="s179">You might want to make extensive comments on this, or brief comments.</span> <span id="s180">How would you describe your childhood to sum it up?</span> <span id="s181">I mean as a very young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: you have to understand the standards which prevailed at that time.</span> <span id="s183">We had a comfortable existence within the environment prevailing at that time.</span> <span id="s184">You know the focus was on education -- we went to public school and we went to Cheder, there was very little time for play, but those were the cultural mores.</span> <span id="s185">The family life was very satisfying because of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Were you the youngest child?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And you had a close relationship with your two brothers and two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s190">There were five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Is there anything which stands out particularly in your childhood.</span> <span id="s192">Any special events or event that stands out?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Not one event, but a lot of them, for instance: Friday nights, being together as a family -- that was always a very pleasant experience, Shabbos -- the whole family had to be there we stayed together, even if we did not have lots to eat during the week, but Shabbos was a very pleasant moment -- we sat at the table and we sang the songs, we discussed a lot of things.</span> <span id="s194">Friends used to come in, friends of my brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s195">Our home used to be full of social and cultural discussions.</span> <span id="s196">I learned a lot of things through osmosis, even if I was small, but I learned a lot of things by those discussions.</span> <span id="s197">This was something I enjoyed very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Now about you.</span> <span id="s199">I know that you attended school -- what kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I attended public school up to I think the third grade.</span> <span id="s201">You see in Poland you start attending public school at seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did you go to a secular school or to a religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Both.</span> <span id="s204">Public school started at seven, but religious school, Cheder, started at three.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Was there any problem for Jewish kids going to the regular schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, it was mandatory.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Otherwise said, there were Jewish and non-Jewish children in the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: In the same school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: But you also went to Cheder separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: That was after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: After school or before school or both.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How far did you get in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A; In public school I finished three and a half grades from seven to nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And then your education was interrupted, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And in Hebrew, of course, I went to Cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What language was spoken in school by the majority of the pupils?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Polish, at school, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did the Jewish children speak Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And not Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Among ourselves we spoke Yiddish but the prevailing and only language was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Now what language do you speak today?</span> <span id="s224">How many languages do you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I speak Polish and French and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Where did you learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I lived in France for five years after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Oh, that is where you lived after the war.</span> <span id="s229">All right what languages can you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: The same and I understand them also, but not as fluently as I used to because it has been years since I used them except for some correspondence which I have to take care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q; To what extent did you associate with non-Jewish boys and girls in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s233">We sat together, but very little interaction after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Was there animosity?</span> <span id="s235">Did you sense that in the non-Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s237">Oh there has always been in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Even at that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Oh yes they castigated us Jews.</span> <span id="s240">Almost fights continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Even at that age?</span> <span id="s242">That was inside school and outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes, inside the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s245">Now here is another category; we are getting into the more important areas.</span> <span id="s246">Prior to the war and the Nazi occupation, to what extent were you aware of anti-Semitism in Poland?</span> <span id="s247">You are very young at the time -- what were you aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: We were aware of it because there was a great deal of animosity between the Polish and the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s249">Almost fights!</span> <span id="s250">Usually avoiding fights!</span> <span id="s251">Running away from fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Did you have to stick together, so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, going to school several kids always walked together.</span> <span id="s254">And going home we planned to go together.</span> <span id="s255">Going into an exclusively non-Jewish neighborhood, we were afraid to go.</span> <span id="s256">We wouldn’t go there alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Was there an understanding that you really should not come into those neighborhoods?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Well, if you went in it was a risk, as it is when you go to Harlem today.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Let me ask you something; were you easily identified as Jews?</span> <span id="s260">You weren’t Orthodox and wear payas and yamulkas?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes, but most of the European Jews were identified by how they dressed.</span> <span id="s262">Particularly the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: You did dress differently from the other kids?</span> <span id="s264">In what respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: First of all, we had to wear a hat all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Oh you did?</span> <span id="s267">That is Orthodox!</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Orthodox, yes.</span> <span id="s269">We wore a long coat, nearly a dress.</span> <span id="s270">But in later years, we gradually discarded this and took these things off.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Are you talking about the late 1930’s, but you still dressed similarly to what we know as the Hassidim dress today.</span> <span id="s272">Is that the right kind of style you were wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: There are gradation the extreme Hassids with the wide hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: But it made identification easy.</span> <span id="s275">Were these black for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes, always black, but later we wore suits.</span> <span id="s277">But there were still features you could recognize.</span> <span id="s278">Distinguishing features between Jewish and non-Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s279">As a matter of fact, when I was small, I had blond hair, and I used to be embarrassed by people because they told me I am the gentile.</span> <span id="s280">I had a neighbor who was mute -- she identified me as being a gentile from the church who was ringing the bell.</span> <span id="s281">That was very embarrassing.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Do you recall specific incidents of anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s283">Is there something particular which stood out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes, I remember in our immediate neighborhood, we lived in a big house as tenants.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: In an apartment house?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, in an apartment house.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You did not own your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Right, in a big city we did not.</span> <span id="s289">We lived in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s290">There were always neighbors.</span> <span id="s291">Some gentile kids who used to fight with me.</span> <span id="s292">One time I carried a pan -- maybe I should not put this on a record -- but anyway he challenged me and insulted me.</span> <span id="s293">I lost control and hit him over the head with the pan.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Did you say a pen?</span> <span id="s295">(That is what the two references sounded like).</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: A pan, a baking pan or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Oh, a pan like you cook in.</span> <span id="s298">All right!</span> <span id="s299">You hit him over the head with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Over his head, or over his back.</span> <span id="s301">Later on his mother came into our house with an axe and wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s302">My mother was barely able to protect me, she just stood in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Were there others, similar incidents at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes, for instance, another similar situation was the churches.</span> <span id="s305">You know after people come out of the churches we were ordered by our parents not to go outside, to stay off the streets because there were always a lot of beatings going on against Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did you have the impression that the clergy was stirring the people up?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Definitely, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You knew what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Definitely!</span> <span id="s310">The clergy was very anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So this is within the community.</span> <span id="s312">Tell me did you read regular secular daily newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s314">Of course we had a rather good Jewish newspaper; but we read secular ones too.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: In the press were you aware of things of an anti-Semitic nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: On a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes, anti-Semitic on a regular basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Was the press, as far as you know, controlled by the government?</span> <span id="s320">Was it censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I don’t know that…I cannot say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: I am wondering whether these articles were instigated by the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Well, I don’t know whether they were or not.</span> <span id="s324">I can only go by what I could observe.</span> <span id="s325">I couldn’t go behind the scenes.</span> <span id="s326">I was nine years old at the time.</span> <span id="s327">I remember, for instance, if there was a special anti-Semitic article, we discussed it at the table, at home.</span> <span id="s328">For example there was a Father Chechaek, I remember, who wanted to outlaw shicke.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: That is the ritual killing of the beef?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, but most people didn’t know how it was done.</span> <span id="s331">He wrote a lot of articles about it and I remember a caricature in the paper.</span> <span id="s332">That caricature said, “Maybe we should go on four legs so that they have pity on us and wouldn’t kill us.</span> <span id="s333">They kill Jews but here they are afraid to kill an animal.”</span> <span id="s334">You know they are cartoonists and he drew a Jew with a bow going on all four, and the other asked him:” Why do you go on all four (legs)?”</span> <span id="s335">So that is the answer he gave.</span> <span id="s336">So this is the type of thing that was in the paper!</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: How did your family react to these things?</span> <span id="s338">Did they get worked up about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A; Oh, bitter!</span> <span id="s340">Really there is no way we can fight (against their public rabble rousing).</span> <span id="s341">Another instance I remember was: my older brother, one day came home from school, or whatever, and a gentile attacked him.</span> <span id="s342">He ran after him and he beat him on a street corner, and he fought back.</span> <span id="s343">Then the police came and they arrested the guy and they arrested my brother for beating a Pole.</span> <span id="s344">We had to pay a fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Yes, he was fined?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, another cartoon was that in Gallostor, during a pogrom.</span> <span id="s347">You know pogroms occurred (so MW said that the locale wasn’t important) -- where a big gentile, you have a huge fellow, is complaining to the judge that the little, the small Jew attacked him.</span> <span id="s348">The Jew was sent to prison.</span> <span id="s349">This is the type of thing that was in the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: In other words, it was almost a daily occurrence and you were aware of these things.</span> <span id="s351">Let us go on now, into the particularly relevant things.</span> <span id="s352">Do you recall when your city was occupied by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I think that it was a few days after the invasion of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Very soon after September 1, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You were in central Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So they were in the middle of the country within a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What was the general reaction amongst the non-Jews?</span> <span id="s361">Are you aware of it in your town?</span> <span id="s362">How the Nazis were received?</span> <span id="s363">How the Poles felt about the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: They said: “It’s good for us!</span> <span id="s365">They are going to kill all the Jews!</span> <span id="s366">It’s good for us!</span> <span id="s367">That was their reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: But did the Poles themselves fear what may happen to them?</span> <span id="s369">After all the Nazis were determined to destroy them also!</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, they did not.</span> <span id="s371">They just had the kind of vengeful feeling that the Jews are going to get a tough deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: They did not fear the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: At least not initially?</span> <span id="s375">That was your impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well, initially you know the first couple of days, they, the Poles themselves, they robbed the stores.</span> <span id="s377">You know there were a lot of Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s378">And for days they took packages from the stores because most of the Jews ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Which way did they go?</span> <span id="s380">Did they go east?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yes, toward Warsaw and east.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So Warsaw was east.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes, it must be (actually Warsaw is nearly straight NE of Lodz).</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Was there still a Polish army resisting at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: The resistance had ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: After a few days it had ended.</span> <span id="s388">Maybe there were some pockets of resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: I think that the war went on for about a month; but Warsaw, itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, it did not, about eight days at most.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: But some people thought that they might be safer in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Or in the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s394">That is what they were heading for?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yes, many people headed that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Did many of the Jews leave as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s398">Many Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Would you describe most of them as having left?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No, not most of them.</span> <span id="s401">As a matter of fact, my father and myself were running, you know, and my older brothers, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Your family did leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No, just the males, we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s405">That is interesting, because -- I heard this described before, but that was in Western Europe, that the men left and tried to relocate, then sent for the women…was that the idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: But, what did you think might happen to the women left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s409">We thought that, maybe they wouldn’t bother them.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: That is an important point.</span> <span id="s411">You thought that they were more after the men than after the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s413">Military, fighting and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: In other words, they thought that they would take you in the army and that in some way, that would be it.</span> <span id="s415">Otherwise said: although you were Jewish you didn’t really know what awaited you?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: No, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You thought that they might force you in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A; That is right --or they would take us to work, that they might take us to work camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: It was obvious in, let us say in Sept. -- Oct., that no one knew what their plans were in the long run, for the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: There were wild rumors.</span> <span id="s421">Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s422">We started worrying about it because immediately when they came they killed here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Some of them did already?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">Some of them were killed already.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: But you and your older brothers and your father went east?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: We all went east, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you get to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No, we got close to Warsaw and there were signs on our road, you see we had no transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Were you walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We were on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: How far is Warsaw from Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s434">(Actually the straight line is about 60-70 miles or about 100 km, which is the guess Murray made later).</span> <span id="s435">But on the way, masses of people were walking.</span> <span id="s436">They were attacked and killed.</span> <span id="s437">So we went into hiding and eventually we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So you never made it to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s439">And you went back to your own cities?</span> <span id="s440">How long a period was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: We were about one week on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: When you got back, was your family still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: So, I had the conception of many of the Jews and of your family being taken.</span> <span id="s445">At that point, would say there were wild rumors?</span> <span id="s446">When you came back to Lodz you had no idea what fate awaited you?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well, we figured instead of being killed there, we might as well be killed at home.</span> <span id="s448">That was the reasoning.</span> <span id="s449">To be together as a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So, this says now: “how did this affect your life?”</span> <span id="s451">I think that this category is unique for you because I want to get, if it is possible, the blow by blow account of what happened to you personally, chronologically.</span> <span id="s452">But this says: “what happened to your family and to you after the occupation?”</span> <span id="s453">That is where I would like to get into chronological order.</span> <span id="s454">There are a lot of other questions; but some of them relate to family, but I want to know what camp you ended up in and it is your story so I will just let you talk about what happened to you and relate what happened to your family, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: We went back to the city.</span> <span id="s456">At that time we already had orders that you couldn’t go out after 5 P.M.,that you had to stay home at night.</span> <span id="s457">You couldn’t congregate.</span> <span id="s458">Foods staples were getting scarce.</span> <span id="s459">You had to fight for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s460">You immediately had to wear the yellow star and life was steadily getting more gruesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Did they create a ghetto immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s463">Then they started building the ghetto.</span> <span id="s464">It didn’t grow overnight.</span> <span id="s465">During the period from the beginning of the occupation to about Dec. 1939, they did a lot of preliminary.</span> <span id="s466">They built the ghetto and confined a lot of people into other areas.</span> <span id="s467">We stayed in our place.</span> <span id="s468">The place where we lived was part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s469">So once the ghetto was started, the food was limited.</span> <span id="s470">Fear was constant.</span> <span id="s471">Everyday they came to the houses and pulled people out.</span> <span id="s472">They took them to work and killed them in the process.</span> <span id="s473">So we tried to go out as little as possible.</span> <span id="s474">Commerce and activities like that came to a complete stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: You say that people disappeared regularly every day.</span> <span id="s476">They never came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s478">That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q; Well did you know that they were being eliminated?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: We heard from neighbors.</span> <span id="s481">We did not know where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q; I mean they could have been somewhere else?</span> <span id="s483">Right?</span> <span id="s484">You are not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s486">They could have been somewhere else.</span> <span id="s487">But we also heard that when they came back some had been beaten and mutilated, beaten with heads open.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: You saw some?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Oh yes sure.</span> <span id="s490">They came back mutilated and that created, of course, fear and we didn’t want to go out and minimize (our exposure).</span> <span id="s491">But of course, we had to eat -- we had to go to the bakeries to stand in line to get a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s492">Of course, then there was the question of money.</span> <span id="s493">Then they started rationing.</span> <span id="s494">So there were all the things that went into effect.</span> <span id="s495">Until Dec, and I don’t remember what date it was, one of the mornings I went to Cheder -- the public school was out -- but Cheder was still being maintained, probably the 5th, if I remember, I don’t remember how many blocks that were to Cheder (here Murray seems to have utilized a detailed map to indicate locations to Allan, since the actual locations did appear to matter).</span> <span id="s496">We lived here, and here was the Cheder and as soon as I walked out there was here, in the street trucks -- and everyone who came out they put on a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Otherwise said, if you went into the street you ran an additional risk to be picked up.</span> <span id="s498">Randomly on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: At this particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Oh, you are talking about just this one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, they put me on the truck and they put others on it, until it was filled up.</span> <span id="s502">So here I went.</span> <span id="s503">That is the end of my family.</span> <span id="s504">That is the end of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Oh, that is the way it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You just disappeared one day?</span> <span id="s508">And so your family never did know what happened to you after that afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, no, nor did I know what happened to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And you never heard from them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, I heard from the other side from different people who went through similar experiences and who were captured later what happened to my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: But you never saw them again?</span> <span id="s513">Not one member of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No, never again except for the one sister who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And this sister you located only after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did you find her through authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: What happened is that I wrote to the city from where I was captured.</span> <span id="s519">A postcard and she picked up the postcard there.</span> <span id="s520">She was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: She was still in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No, she was in a concentration camp and went home.</span> <span id="s523">She went home…I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: She went back to the city she was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So she was in Poland then?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: She was back in Poland because she wanted to see some family and that is how she thought she would go about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Was she married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: No, she tried to find the rest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: That is how you found her?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, I didn’t want to go back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: That will come up later.</span> <span id="s533">So we will talk about that.</span> <span id="s534">Now, how did you know what happened to each of your other family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Well, I gathered some history and came to some conclusions from talking to other people.</span> <span id="s536">No direct proof about anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: But you just know that they did not survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So that is about December 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: In December 1939 the truck was full.</span> <span id="s541">Here was the street where we lived and here was the truck with S.S. men around it.</span> <span id="s542">And here the S.S. men blocked every door and went into the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: It was S.S. men who took you into the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, I could not recognize the uniform at the time.</span> <span id="s545">I actually still don’t know.</span> <span id="s546">But they came with their guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And picked you up just at random?</span> <span id="s548">To fill their quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes, the truck was full of people and all kind of people, old, young, all men, no women.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Now that is an interesting point you brought up.</span> <span id="s551">They treat the women and the men differently and you had thought they would.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Yes, yes, I never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: They were looking for workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: That is what the men said: “Apparently they are taking us to work,” that is all the men who captured were not very old.</span> <span id="s555">“They will feed us and you have to go to work.”</span> <span id="s556">Some people even knew what they did in WWI, they related this to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: They were trying to reassure you, you then?</span> <span id="s558">Were you very much afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes, in the beginning I found more excitement, than fear -- more thrill than fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Really, you were not aware of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Not fully.</span> <span id="s562">As a young boy I thought, “what the hell, I will have a new experience.”</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: You were only nine years old and they took you off in the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: It was more excitement than fear, you know.</span> <span id="s565">First time away from house without father, but after a little while I realized that it’s not a joke and I started crying.</span> <span id="s566">I started hollering.</span> <span id="s567">The men started reassuring me.</span> <span id="s568">So it was December and they took us out in the truck to an area where a train was waiting.</span> <span id="s569">They took us to a railroad line, it was not a station, but just the rails on an embankment.</span> <span id="s570">A long train was standing and they chased off from the truck and they made us run, like exercise, back and forth.</span> <span id="s571">There was heavy snow, and then on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Now you are on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes, and at that time I was hungry and fearful and I didn’t even know what had happened.</span> <span id="s574">Apparently I fell asleep when I woke up the next day we were in a camp.</span> <span id="s575">They pulled us off, hundreds of people and showed us a pile of straw and they gave us sacks to fill and places where we can sleep.</span> <span id="s576">In that process, if someone did not move fast enough they shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: You saw people that had been shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Oh yes, they shot people right and left like nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And did it begin to dawn on you what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: I have to keep reminding myself that you were very young, nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Oh yes, then I stopped to think: “it is hell, that is what is happening.</span> <span id="s583">It’s no joke.”</span> <span id="s584">So they put us in a barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you know where you were at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: It was Gleiwitz, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Did you ever find out to be sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A; I know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes, that was in Germany (it is in the part of Germany which Poland annexed immediately after WWII to compensate for areas it ceded to Russia) between Poland and Frankfurt a/Oder.</span> <span id="s590">We were located there.</span> <span id="s591">Three miles from there they had a camp with several thousand people.</span> <span id="s592">There we worked on a road.</span> <span id="s593">Then they shifted us from one thing to another.</span> <span id="s594">They moved us around.</span> <span id="s595">Finally, in 1942 they sent us to Auschwitz (Auschwitz is located near Krakow).</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Now, all this time, from let us say the end of 1939 to 1942 you were working as a ten year-old boy.</span> <span id="s597">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A; Well, I did a variety of activities.</span> <span id="s599">In the first couple of days we had to go into the woods in the snow.</span> <span id="s600">We had to stomp out the snow we didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s601">I guess they stomped out the snow to measure the roads.</span> <span id="s602">They had a purpose we didn’t know anything about.</span> <span id="s603">I didn’t understand why we did this.</span> <span id="s604">Then we chopped the woods and pulled out the stumps.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: You were building a road, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yes, that is essentially what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: It is hard for me to understand how much labor a ten year-old boy can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A; Well you get surprised about what you can do under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s609">I didn’t do as much as they wanted me to do but I still did work.</span> <span id="s610">Well, you have to move in order to stay alive, so you do -- and to keep warm.</span> <span id="s611">So you do with the shovel even if you take it from one side and move it to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Would you describe this as a work camp then?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: That was a concentration camp, but we worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Otherwise said; there was no intention of exterminating the people who were there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: You see, it had the same characteristics.</span> <span id="s616">What they did is that every Friday they had a “Aufstellung” -- where you had to stand straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So the weak ones they did do that (they killed them)?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: That means that there were people being killed all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: A very large number would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: A very large number.</span> <span id="s623">Every couple of weeks there were people who got sick, couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s624">The food was rather mediocre.</span> <span id="s625">We had a slice of bread in the morning and a bowl of soup in the evening.</span> <span id="s626">That was it.</span> <span id="s627">It was very difficult to keep going.</span> <span id="s628">Well, people fell who couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s629">So there was a barracks where we could go for medical advice.</span> <span id="s630">They let you stay in the barracks during the day.</span> <span id="s631">Two weeks to the day we arrived they made a Aufstellung.</span> <span id="s632">You know they had a square where they counted us, when we realized that they allowed us to stay longer than necessary, just in the middle of the square.</span> <span id="s633">Then an extra group of soldiers came and saluted.</span> <span id="s634">So they picked up 27 people and we had to watch.</span> <span id="s635">There were two lines of S.S. men -- military people with axes.</span> <span id="s636">Literally everybody who was going up on the truck and a fellow with an axe hit him wherever it pleased him.</span> <span id="s637">27 people -- all of those who had said they were sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Good “G-d”!</span> <span id="s639">That is after they had already been treated by the medical unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: They had not been treated!</span> <span id="s641">They were left to stay in the barracks, instead of working.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Oh!</span> <span id="s643">In other words, they let them stay in the barracks and then they killed them since they said they couldn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And they said everybody who will refuse to work will have this happen to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: You remember specifically that it was 27 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Do you know when this occurred?</span> <span id="s648">Time?</span> <span id="s649">I asked you before about the time but it is hard to tell exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Not the exact date.</span> <span id="s651">We counted the weekdays.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: But what month and year this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: But you were in this particular camp through ’40 and ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, they shipped us.</span> <span id="s656">We were about six months to one year, you see when a group cleared out their job they were sent to another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: But you were in the same general area of Gleiwitz, in 1940 and 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yes, in the general area.</span> <span id="s659">To all the 27 people with blood flowing -- streaming surrounded by machine guns on both sides.</span> <span id="s660">They took the truck to a hole which we had already dug.</span> <span id="s661">They dumped the bodies out.</span> <span id="s662">Then they came back with the empty truck and said, “any one else who is sick?”</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I thought that you said that there was medical barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: There was one medical barracks where anybody could go and complain if they had a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: But then you learned that you better not do that or else you were through.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you had to work under any condition, no matter how bad you felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: We were afraid to go even if we got injured.</span> <span id="s669">Now the shoes were torn with the snow and the water of the winter, so we got wooden shoes to replace those.</span> <span id="s670">For instance, I had an injury here at the back of the foot and I was afraid to go there.</span> <span id="s671">As a matter of fact, I had a wooden shoe and when we went back and forth to work in uniforms, a Pole or Russian who was with us stepped on my feet and hurt me, so I started crying.</span> <span id="s672">So the Kopo or the S.S. man asked what was happening -- then he went and beat up the Pole or Russian for stepping on my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Do you think that because you were a young boy, that some people treated you better.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I am sure of it.</span> <span id="s675">Particularly, the Jewish people, with whom I worked.</span> <span id="s676">In another area, also in a similar camp they assigned me to work inside in a wood factory repairing the materials such as toilets and bowls which they needed.</span> <span id="s677">There was a lot of machinery which I was afraid to touch.</span> <span id="s678">So another prisoner, a man from Vienna, an older person, maybe in his 60’s -- his name was something like Wago, he said “young fellow, be careful” and he always protected me and helped me.</span> <span id="s679">He showed me a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Were there other boys your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, there were three other boys of similar age in my particular group.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: But it was not common to have boys that young.</span> <span id="s683">You were the exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: There were not too many of us.</span> <span id="s685">These were maybe 10% younger kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So you learned very early that you had to learn under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s687">You had to keep yourself working and yet with the amount of food you were getting, I imagine that it was extremely difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Very much so!</span> <span id="s689">Very much so!</span> <span id="s690">Very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Especially since you were growing?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Our main occupation was hunger, not so much fear of death, but hunger.</span> <span id="s693">But the hunger, continuous hunger, that was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Did you get the impression, let us say in 1940 and ’41, that as long as you kept working, you would stay alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, somehow I had an innate faith that I would survive those horrible times.</span> <span id="s696">One of the things is that in spite of the tragedy and pain we were suffering we joked and I contend that I have a sense of humor.</span> <span id="s697">I joke with the boys and relax.</span> <span id="s698">While using a shovel we told each other stories.</span> <span id="s699">We even used to sing to each other.</span> <span id="s700">There was a young boy who was with me who was in the choir of the Temple.</span> <span id="s701">I like cantorial music.</span> <span id="s702">He was maybe a couple of feet from me.</span> <span id="s703">So we used to sing to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Side two of Tape one.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: As long as you kept working and I think that you gave some indication that….</span> <span id="s706">.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Well, it is not so much the ability to work as the ability to maintain yourself, to maintain your faith, to maintain human dignity as a person you are not going to succumb to their pressures.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: But you gave me the impression before that you thought you were doomed anyways but that you had to make the best of it day by day.</span> <span id="s709">Is that really what you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I said that the majority felt this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Not necessarily yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, not necessarily myself.</span> <span id="s713">One indication of this is because they gave themselves up.</span> <span id="s714">They resigned themselves.</span> <span id="s715">That manifested itself in a number of ways.</span> <span id="s716">We look clean, keep ourselves clean, stay as well as possible and many people just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s717">They lost the stamina.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: At that point, they would kill them, is that what you are saying?</span> <span id="s719">They eliminate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Not always, they would kill them or the people would die naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: They did?</span> <span id="s722">So some did die on the work and they couldn’t take the conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: They couldn’t take the conditions.</span> <span id="s724">Either they committed suicide by running into the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Oh, it was electrified.</span> <span id="s726">So you saw some walking into the fence just to end it.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s728">Or when we went to work in the morning there were people still hanging on or who had fallen off.</span> <span id="s729">Or they had a slow death, they just laid down and refused to go to work.</span> <span id="s730">Refused to move.</span> <span id="s731">One said: “I want to die.</span> <span id="s732">I don’t want to die in the field.”</span> <span id="s733">Another manifestation of this was, for instance, many people were habitual smokers -- they exchanged a piece of bread for a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Otherwise said; they gave up their food?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: They gave up the piece of bread or a bowl of soup for a cigarette.</span> <span id="s736">This was just the first sign that it was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Do you think that it was a sign of a mental breakdown or just of the conscious willingness to die?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Both.</span> <span id="s739">Many had mentally broken down -- lost their balance -- lost control and some did the active part of it, to speed their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Now, I think that you said on the other side that at a certain point you were shipped out to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s741">This must be a particularly difficult part of it.</span> <span id="s742">Is there some particular reason why you were shipped at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: The whole camp was shipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Was the camp closed down?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, it was closed down because we were on a stretch of land and the job was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: So you went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s747">Do you know exactly when?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I know that it was the summer then.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: But was it in 1941 or ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: In ’41, late -- it must have been August or September.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Did you stay in Auschwitz for the rest of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No, I was in Auschwitz, then I went to Buna from there to Buchenwald, from there I went to Dura, and then I went back to Buchenwald where I was liberated.</span> <span id="s753">(Buchenwald was located near to Weimar.</span> <span id="s754">In eastern Germany today).</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: When were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: On April 11, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: OK, do you think that you will be able to remember many of the details of each of these camps?</span> <span id="s758">Of what happened to you in these periods of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Some, not everything.</span> <span id="s760">Some of the more striking points.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: How long were you actually in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s762">Would you say from the (late) summer of ’41 until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: I would say approximately a year.</span> <span id="s764">I can tell by the seasons, approximately a little less than a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And were you also working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes, there we were working the first couple of months at unloading trains of coal.</span> <span id="s767">This was an extremely painful miserable job.</span> <span id="s768">Most of it was outside work.</span> <span id="s769">They utilized part of this coal, just coal, to make briquettes for burning houses.</span> <span id="s770">This used to burn my eyes.</span> <span id="s771">It was extremely painful.</span> <span id="s772">I lost one eye because of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: You lost your sight completely in one eye?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yes, what happened was that the eyes were tearing so that you couldn’t open them; so I couldn’t work because I couldn’t see.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s776">I thought that we could have gotten to this earlier.</span> <span id="s777">You heard of a place like Auschwitz where many people died and you survived.</span> <span id="s778">You said that you believed in your fate and that you were fated to survive.</span> <span id="s779">Do you think this may not be relevant.</span> <span id="s780">That you almost had to be lucky to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Well absolutely!</span> <span id="s782">Absolutely!</span> <span id="s783">In terms of explanation of my survival there is no other way in which I can explain it.</span> <span id="s784">I cannot explain it by divine province or intelligence because a lot of people who are smarter than I am, more educated than I was and yet they died like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Is it almost like having to be at the right place at the right time to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: There is a whole set of circumstances.</span> <span id="s787">I couldn’t fully explain it.</span> <span id="s788">Maybe I tolerate hunger and pain in my body better than most.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Maybe your youth was in favor of you rather than the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yes, maybe that is probably so.</span> <span id="s791">For example, when we get the piece of bread in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: This was always the same diet, wherever you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes, the piece of bread in the morning and the bowl of soup in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: What kind of soup was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Most of it vegetable with a lot of water.</span> <span id="s796">It was water but it warmed you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: But it was real food?</span> <span id="s798">It was edible?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes, sometimes it was not edible.</span> <span id="s800">Sometimes, even in those conditions when you had some small rotten potatoes and they stank, if you could not bear to smell it you couldn’t eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Even if you could eat it you would get sick from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: But we ate grass, we ate anything we could.</span> <span id="s803">But to explain my survival in any logical terms, that is not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s805">I almost get the impression that you have to be at the right place at the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Not only that, but people right along side of me got killed.</span> <span id="s807">I give you an example: when I was in Dura, in that concentration camp, there they built the U1’s and U2’s</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Is this in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: So you went back to Germany again (after Auschwitz)?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, there they produced the rockets.</span> <span id="s812">I was outside working at clearing the access to it.</span> <span id="s813">That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s814">The Americans came down, flying down, and bombing the place.</span> <span id="s815">There were mountains of rocks which it would do no good to hit.</span> <span id="s816">So they hit the access.</span> <span id="s817">All right!</span> <span id="s818">So I was working with a group of people.</span> <span id="s819">The Nazis were there also, and everybody started running.</span> <span id="s820">One of the Nazis was in a locomotive which was used to maneuver the freight cars -- so I wanted to climb aboard the locomotive.</span> <span id="s821">He said, “You damn Jew, get away from here, you only work.”</span> <span id="s822">So I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s823">I was afraid to look up, so I just stood by a telephone pole and bent down like this.</span> <span id="s824">This locomotive and the Nazi was smashed to pieces, and I was watching this.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: So whatever it is, fate or not, it just happened.</span> <span id="s826">What is meant to be will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: And that is not the only circumstances.</span> <span id="s828">There were other instances where again I was injured.</span> <span id="s829">I didn’t work too well.</span> <span id="s830">You know I limped because of the injury to my feet -- so I was assigned one Friday morning to go to the crematory.</span> <span id="s831">I was assigned.</span> <span id="s832">He pointed at me and said, “You go here” and “You go there.’</span> <span id="s833">And I was pushed to a side, so I was between the people.</span> <span id="s834">You know I was small and I just ran away.</span> <span id="s835">Later on I heard from other inmates that they said, “Oh, we will catch him next time!</span> <span id="s836">Let’s forget about him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: But they never came back for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: No.</span> <span id="s839">It didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s840">They just got people off their hands, would they worry about one guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: It’s almost impossible to comprehend.</span> <span id="s842">They knew everyone who was in the camp, I presume, at any given time.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: They know who was in the camp?</span> <span id="s844">The individual names?</span> <span id="s845">Of course not!</span> <span id="s846">They accounted for numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: All right, numbers of people.</span> <span id="s848">Otherwise you could almost hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s850">You could for a little while.</span> <span id="s851">They all looked alike, in the same uniform, maybe a little smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Otherwise said, they did not care if they killed 10,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: One more or less --it didn’t really matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: That is the closest you ever came (to the crematory)?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yes, there were a couple of other situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: But some people were able to do that and most were not to manage to get away.</span> <span id="s857">When they were doomed they went marching off.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s859">Another time I jumped from a truck, a similar situation.</span> <span id="s860">I took chances.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I think that it would take forever if we itemized all the incidents.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: There were other incidents like this and again, to explain it that is beyond me.</span> <span id="s863">It is not that I am smarter or better I just cannot explain it in human terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Where was this, the truck incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: The truck incident was in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Were you back in Germany again?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No.</span> <span id="s868">Buna is a part of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s869">Yes, Auschwitz is the main camp, then there were surrounding camps; Buna, Birkenau, Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s870">They have little satellite camps and that was one of the satellites.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Wasn’t Gleiwitz the first camp you were at?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So you were always near Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: When you kept moving, you were always in the same area?</span> <span id="s876">Always in…</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: That is what I said earlier, from Poznan, Poland to Frankfurt on the Oder, this is the area where they built the road not far from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: I am trying to get it straight.</span> <span id="s879">First you went to Gleiwitz then you went to Auschwitz -- specifically into Auschwitz -- then to Buna.</span> <span id="s880">Then how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I was in Buna for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: That was also a work camp, primarily a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And then from Buna you went to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes, from Buna I went to Buchenwald and then to Dura and then to Buchenwald again.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Well, is Buchenwald near Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: No, it is far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Then you were shipped out?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: It is a couple of days, but we traveled for two weeks on the train from Auschwitz to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s890">That was in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Now, why were you relocated then, do you know?</span> <span id="s892">Was there a particular reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: They gave us no explanation for the move, but they took us to Buchenwald because the Russians were approaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Oh!</span> <span id="s895">Buchenwald was further west?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes, further in Germany.</span> <span id="s897">The whole camp was vacated.</span> <span id="s898">That was in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So you were in Auschwitz for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s901">At the end of ’41 I went to Auschwitz -- then I was about ’42 to ’43 in Buna; in ’43 I went to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: That is when you were moved west, because the Russians were advancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Yes, then we went to Dura and from Dura back to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Was Dura also in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Then you went back to Buchenwald and that is where you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: What army -- was it an American army?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yes, it was the American army, as a matter of fact, it was a Jewish fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q; Is that right!</span> <span id="s911">What an experience that must have been for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes, I have him on a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: I’d like to get more of the details on this, but maybe we should do this on another session.</span> <span id="s914">Now that I have chronologically where you were, I would like to get into some more of the details.</span> <span id="s915">If you can recall them.</span> <span id="s916">You know whatever you feel like telling me at another session.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: OK.</span> <span id="s918">Call me.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: You mentioned a couple of important events and I would like to hear about them.</span> <span id="s920">I think that we have been longer than we should have for the first session anyways, although it is going well.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: I hope that the taping is coming through well in terms of understanding what I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q; But let us continue this at another session.</span> <span id="s923">We should get some of the details and then we will talk about whatever you want to talk about and other aspects as well as the camp life.</span> <span id="s924">Then, of course we want to deal with what happened after that and right to the present day as much as you want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s925">Let’s break off.</span> <span id="s926">I think we should continue this at another session.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: OK, this is Allan Spetter and we will be beginning this second session at the home of Dr. Murray Weisman on Monday evening, February 4th, 1980 at 8:15 P.M.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Well, following the first session I tried to reconstruct and recollect dates and specific terms of what happened when I was in Camp (in WWII).</span> <span id="s929">Here I came up with these dates: Approximately late November or early December 1939, I was apprehended and shipped to Gleiwitz , that was on the border between Germany and Poland, near the Auschwitz complex of camps.</span> <span id="s930">I think, if I remember correctly, I was about one year in Gleiwitz, one year in Buna and ultimately ended up in Auschwitz (proper) till about Jan. 1944.</span> <span id="s931">I cannot tell with certainty how long I was in each of these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: But from the beginning of the time you were taken prisoner, until Jan. of ’44 you were in Gleiwitz, Buna, and Auschwitz and then you were moved from Auschwitz in Jan. ’44 because the Russian troops were advancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: To Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: In Buchenwald I was I believe for about three to four months, then I went to Dura.</span> <span id="s936">In about the last three months, that must be starting in Feb. or Mar. 1945, I was back in Buchenwald where I was liberated.</span> <span id="s937">This was the approximate sequence and the dates.</span> <span id="s938">Again, the specifics, individual dates are approximate.</span> <span id="s939">The only major thing which I remember is the mass transportation from Auschwitz to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: OK, you mentioned that to me and you said that the trip took about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes, two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Do you want to describe some of the details?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes, but first of all I want to make a couple of comments about the first day I came to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s944">Right at the very beginning, I was young, inexperienced.</span> <span id="s945">The people around me tried to quiet me down and they supported and helped me, but still I did not quiet down, I was hungry, frightened, but still it was more thrill than fear because I had never been away from my parents.</span> <span id="s946">Now I was away from my parents for the first time and riding on a truck and a train which I had never done in Poland since we didn’t have any transportation.</span> <span id="s947">So it was a little exciting…but as soon as I arrived in Gleiwitz and we got off the train, and we saw the camp from a distance and noticed they were wearing uniforms with shaved heads and wooden shoes and marching in formation of five, then appeared the huge tents, you know there were no barracks, the barracks were just being built, it appeared to me that it was a huge circus with thousands of clowns all over the place.</span> <span id="s948">This was my first reaction.</span> <span id="s949">I didn’t know anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: You were only nine years old.</span> <span id="s951">I don’t know how you could comprehend?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And until people started talking to us.</span> <span id="s953">When we were dressed they started talking to us and went through the procedure with the shaving and putting on the numbers and pushing us around, taking away our things.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Did you get a number that early, in Gleiwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Oh yes, the same number, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So this is the number which you had from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s957">In Dec. of ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No, at other times we changed numbers.</span> <span id="s959">When we came to different camps.</span> <span id="s960">Not in the Auschwitz complex.</span> <span id="s961">This (showing his arm) was the Auschwitz number.</span> <span id="s962">When we came to Buna, I got a different number.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: You were not tattooed yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: You were tattooed when you got to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes, that is right.</span> <span id="s967">So this was essentially my first impression until we began to realize, even at that time, at the beginning, either it was hysteria, or it was I don’t know what, when they took away our clothes and gave us the uniforms.</span> <span id="s968">They didn’t measure out sizes.</span> <span id="s969">You went through or they pushed you through the line and put it in your arms.</span> <span id="s970">I was short so I got a shirt like this and one pair of pants.</span> <span id="s971">And a guy who was tall got a jacket that was so short you couldn’t help but think that that was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Did you exchange clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Of course, we did, as long as we could.</span> <span id="s974">So now let us consider the transportation from Auschwitz to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: If you wanted to take this in some kind of order you could describe each camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: All right!</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: So you are at Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s978">Now you have had the chance to think over some of the details, since last week.</span> <span id="s979">You were in Gleiwitz for about one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s981">In Gleiwitz that was a very difficult, frightening experience.</span> <span id="s982">First of all, they were brutal!</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: What was particularly brutal?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: They brutally beat and killed at will.</span> <span id="s985">They killed 27 people just to make an example.</span> <span id="s986">It was a new exposure for us.</span> <span id="s987">It was hard to get used to it.</span> <span id="s988">The human mind has difficulties getting used to this type of brutality.</span> <span id="s989">It was indeed very difficult to adjust to this type of brutality -- besides that, you didn’t know when it was going to be your fate.</span> <span id="s990">The first three months were particularly difficult because of the hunger and the hard labor and the beating.</span> <span id="s991">A lot of people died.</span> <span id="s992">Many were killed.</span> <span id="s993">Many were butchered.</span> <span id="s994">As I described when I did talk about the 27 on the second or the third week.</span> <span id="s995">So this was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Let me ask you before you go on.</span> <span id="s997">Is there anything which stands out specially in your mind during that first year in the first camp.</span> <span id="s998">You did mention a few of the details, but I am thinking about anything else you might have thought about since your first interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1000">The fear and apprehension which we felt.</span> <span id="s1001">Of course, we saw our friends being killed and die.</span> <span id="s1002">We couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s1003">You know it really was a difficult and extreme psychological adjustment, not only physical.</span> <span id="s1004">Completely different rules than we used to live by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: After about one year, you moved to Buna.</span> <span id="s1006">Is this still in the Auschwitz complex?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, in the same complex.</span> <span id="s1008">Over there, the first couple of weeks I am talking about individuals, it was very difficult because the newcomers got the worst work.</span> <span id="s1009">Then we had to unload cement, loose cement, that’s difficult.</span> <span id="s1010">In Gleiwitz I had unloaded coal, some of it was old, that’s how my eyes got injured there.</span> <span id="s1011">I had unloaded coal for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1012">Then he (S.S. in charge) came one morning and asked who is a “Zimmerman” (carpenter)?</span> <span id="s1013">I was small so I said that I was a “Zimmerman”.</span> <span id="s1014">So he said, “You are small now where did you learn to be a carpenter?”</span> <span id="s1015">I said, “My parents are carpenters.</span> <span id="s1016">I worked with them.”</span> <span id="s1017">He said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s1018">I figured that I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1019">I was afraid that after a couple of more weeks at the cement detail I will be gone because I was going down.</span> <span id="s1020">The energy went down, so!</span> <span id="s1021">In other words: I took a chance…so he took me out and another S.S. man explained to me what was wanted.</span> <span id="s1022">He told me that he wanted a cage for rabbits.</span> <span id="s1023">He showed me how big he wanted it.</span> <span id="s1024">So I built it and then it was ok.</span> <span id="s1025">They gave me lighter work.</span> <span id="s1026">They took me away from the cement group and sent me out with a group that went to work at the I.G. Farben Industry Works where they made synthetic rubber.</span> <span id="s1027">There were a lot of pipes.</span> <span id="s1028">My job, my group’s, was to build the facilities where people can go up and stand to insulate the pipes.</span> <span id="s1029">It was way up high where you had to climb on pipes.</span> <span id="s1030">You know to take the bolts out and it was of course difficult.</span> <span id="s1031">Here you were afraid of the wind, the cold wind in the winter could in Eastern Europe, make you fall.</span> <span id="s1032">I did actually fall but an older Jew helped me out.</span> <span id="s1033">He was from Limburg.</span> <span id="s1034">A large, good-sized man and he protected me.</span> <span id="s1035">He hid me, didn’t let me go up there high.</span> <span id="s1036">He just held me to the lower pipe jobs and to hand the things up.</span> <span id="s1037">At least in the evening when I came back from work I had extra potatoes.</span> <span id="s1038">Things I could share with the other prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: When you were working for I.G. Farben, did you get a little more to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1041">The same standard of the evening: a bowl of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So where did you get this extra food (the extra potatoes)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Because I had to feed the rabbits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Oh, you did that project too while you were working on the pipes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1046">In the evenings and in the morning before I went to work I had to feed the rabbits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Is this where you met the French prisoners that you mentioned (it does appear that this was a reference to a conversation which was not on tape)…do you want to talk about that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1049">We had very little contact.</span> <span id="s1050">They were there only for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s1051">I suppose that it was a transition until they could accommodate them somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1052">The only contact which I had was to explain to them what I had to do and they gave me some tools.</span> <span id="s1053">From what we could see, occasionally was that they were working on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: They were kept strictly separated?</span> <span id="s1055">They were in a regular concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1057">They had nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s1058">That was a completely separate world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: You said to me that you spent about a year in Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And that of all the time (in concentration camp) that may have been the best time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes, the best time.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean the work was better.</span> <span id="s1064">This is the time where they had to cut the bolts in the factory, on the big machines and they had to be done inside and outside.</span> <span id="s1065">Except for occasionally the beatings and the hunger pains, you know, it was not as bad as it was in Buchenwald or it was in Dura and Gleiwitz and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: You gave the impression that Buna was not necessarily an extermination camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No.</span> <span id="s1068">it was primarily a working camp because most of the people worked for I.G. Farben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: That is primarily why you were there --- while most of you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yes, we worked in some capacity for the I.G. Farben Industries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: And you have no idea why they moved you then to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: No.</span> <span id="s1073">I know of no reason.</span> <span id="s1074">What happened is that they picked up a block out of two blocks and said: “this block goes to Auschwitz” and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: When you look back on it now you would think that if you are being sent to Auschwitz, they meant to exterminate you at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Yes, I would tend to think along that line, but the main extermination was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1077">That is also part of the Auschwitz camps.</span> <span id="s1078">Birkenau was only specializing in extermination and in gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1079">The mass -- gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1080">They had some in Auschwitz proper on a smaller scale.</span> <span id="s1081">They had them in Buna on a smaller scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Going to Auschwitz, (proper) did not mean automatically that you would die at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: We always had this in the back of our minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I mean you might not have known anything about it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: The thing is that first of all they did not tell you where you were going to go.</span> <span id="s1086">We did not know, but we always had a premonition, that this was going to happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did word ever reach around amongst the prisoners as to what each location meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1089">We knew this.</span> <span id="s1090">We knew this, because there always had been people shoved back and forth -- transported back and forth.</span> <span id="s1091">The S.S. men talked about themselves and we could overhear them.</span> <span id="s1092">So we had some information about what was going on and also we could, for instance, smell when we were in Auschwitz --the charred smell of the dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Do you think then that you may have been in Auschwitz for as much as two years?</span> <span id="s1094">I am still trying to (establish a time frame).</span> <span id="s1095">If you were one year in Gleiwitz, a year in Buna, you may have been two years in Auschwitz proper.</span> <span id="s1096">Because if you go out (to Buchenwald) in Jan. ’44, that is four years after you were trucked away.</span> <span id="s1097">Can you remember anything specific, I mean did anything stand out in your mind during these two years?</span> <span id="s1098">What kind of work were you doing in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: In Auschwitz we worked at building roads, around the camp and different facilities.</span> <span id="s1100">That is the type of work we did.</span> <span id="s1101">There and in Buna the situation with Chaim took place.</span> <span id="s1102">That is another thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: You wanted to mention him…these are the kind of incidents I wanted you to get to.</span> <span id="s1104">You want to talk about Chaim now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: So, in Buna there was kind of a group of people where the prisoners were very cohesive and supportive of each other.</span> <span id="s1106">At least a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s1107">Some of the Jewish people were in top positions there, like Chaim, for instance.</span> <span id="s1108">He was a good example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Now he was in a sort of management position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yes, in a management position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: What was his background, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: You don’t even know where he was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I know that he was from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1115">Not from Poland but from another part of Eastern Europe that we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: But you don’t know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A; No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: But he was a very big man, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yes, of a very large size, even by American standards.</span> <span id="s1120">He was in charge of distribution of the clothes.</span> <span id="s1121">You know, they got clothes, they accumulated clothes, shoes and uniforms .</span> <span id="s1122">If in wintertime you wanted to have a heavy coat, you saw him because he was the one who would have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: So he had some influence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yes, that was run by civilians essentially, in opposition to the S.S. running things.</span> <span id="s1125">So one time he gave me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1126">You know my wooden shoes fell to pieces.</span> <span id="s1127">I appealed to him and he gave me a pair, so he was a good man.</span> <span id="s1128">So at one point we heard that we have an “Anstellung”…you know, in the evening.</span> <span id="s1129">We heard the rumor spread that Chaim ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: He escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: He escaped.</span> <span id="s1132">So, after a while, we find out that Chaim and two other prominent prisoners plus two Polish prisoners ran away.</span> <span id="s1133">What I do understand is that they were in charge of the clothes and the shoes.</span> <span id="s1134">That one of the people had hidden in them something valuable, like diamonds or gold and they were able to dig it out and bribe somebody and then they were able to run away.</span> <span id="s1135">Somehow, they went outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1136">Here is about what happened… You see this is the camp and here is the work area, the I. G. Farben Industry, here were some other facilities…whatever they were…I don’t know exactly, storehouses, warehouses, whatever.</span> <span id="s1137">So, apparently while the two Poles who were also prominent prisoners, who worked in the kitchen…they also had access to a lot of stuff because people who had diamonds had been able to bribe and get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: We are actually talking about people trading diamonds for food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A; Yes, if they could smuggle them in.</span> <span id="s1140">So what happened was that the two Poles and the three Jews got together.</span> <span id="s1141">Apparently they arranged by influence that they went out to pick up some stuff, or whatever, from the supply place and disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: They probably bribed the guard, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: That is the understanding.</span> <span id="s1144">Either they bribed the guard or bribed some civilians from the surroundings.</span> <span id="s1145">Then they got some civilian clothes, because there in that area civilians had also been working.</span> <span id="s1146">Although we could not communicate with them because of the watching guards, in some instances, in some situations, they could not guard everyone every minute.</span> <span id="s1147">After these fellows escaped and after about two weeks one guy was brought back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: One of the five?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1150">One of the five, that is one of the three Jews.</span> <span id="s1151">The youngest one.</span> <span id="s1152">We couldn’t understand why…I was close to this guy so I asked him what had happened.</span> <span id="s1153">How did you get outside?</span> <span id="s1154">He didn’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s1155">He used to say, “Hair will grow on me if the others come back!”</span> <span id="s1156">Apparently what happened was, every time when they were in the woods waiting to make connections with the partisans, while he was on guard -- they always took turns on being on guard…the two Poles killed the two Jews.</span> <span id="s1157">When he came back and didn’t see the two Jews, he began to ask questions such as, “Where are they?”</span> <span id="s1158">“Why are they not here?”</span> <span id="s1159">So they went after the runaways and ultimately they caught them and he told the S.S. where they were.</span> <span id="s1160">They were apprehended.</span> <span id="s1161">This is a running situation where the German S.S. hanged the two Poles publicly in the camp for killing the two Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Do you know of any specific reason (for this)?</span> <span id="s1163">What were they trying to demonstrate (by doing that)?</span> <span id="s1164">Just killing them because they were criminals?</span> <span id="s1165">Because they had killed two people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: They did not explain their verdict!</span> <span id="s1167">They did not explain anything.</span> <span id="s1168">They just called everybody together and hung the two Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: It seems to me almost like some cynical way to boost your morale, by showing you that there was justice.</span> <span id="s1170">(In other camps from where people escaped it was standard operating policy of the S.S. to hang any recaptured escapee, whether the escapees were Jewish or not, summarily with all the other prisoners as witnesses.</span> <span id="s1171">It is possible that the one who returned voluntarily was spared the fate he would have had if discovered).</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: It actually boosted our morale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: I am certain that it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: When you saw the two of them killing their best friends…we were happy to see this.</span> <span id="s1175">To me it was rather cynical and this is a story I would like to elaborate and write about because of the perverted sense of justice.</span> <span id="s1176">Another thing is they didn’t want anybody else to have the privilege of killing Jews.</span> <span id="s1177">They wanted to keep that privilege for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: I get the impression though from various things I have read and seen that they were very strict on justice.</span> <span id="s1179">I think that for actual crimes, they were committed.</span> <span id="s1180">I mean outside the camps as well as in the camps.</span> <span id="s1181">So these two men had committed murder and therefore, they should be killed and punished for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1183">Another tragic event which took place and stood out in my mind which hurts me badly.</span> <span id="s1184">There was one guy who was an electrician.</span> <span id="s1185">There were two brothers, two young German boys…one was my age, a young chap like myself…the other was maybe a couple of years older.</span> <span id="s1186">One was working as an electrician, fixing electrical things…seeing that the wires are operating at all times.</span> <span id="s1187">We had frequent attacks from the Russians, bombing attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Was that in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No, in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Oh, you are still in Buna…ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Frequent attacks from Russian bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: So the Russians did bomb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes, small bombs.</span> <span id="s1194">Small strings of bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: They dropped these actually into the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, in the work areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: You know that is really one of the big arguments that goes on now.</span> <span id="s1198">“Why didn’t the U.S. and the British bomb the camps?</span> <span id="s1199">But you are saying that the Russians did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: The surroundings, not the camp proper, the work area you see, this area around the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q; I mean…they were bombing in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1203">Not the camp itself -- maybe they wanted to save the camps.</span> <span id="s1204">In this camp.</span> <span id="s1205">Of course, he communicated with his friends, the apparent leaders amongst the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1206">We had some leaders, a couple of doctors who were in the A.B., that means the dispensary, where you could get a bandage or something like that.</span> <span id="s1207">There were Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s1208">They were nice people.</span> <span id="s1209">They all know -- and they told me -- because I was close to those people.</span> <span id="s1210">I was friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1211">They had pity on me because I was so small -- that a Pole who was the co-worker of this electrician reported him to the S.S. and they hanged him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: For what, what did they report him for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Because he wanted to cut the wires during an airplane alarm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: To let some people escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1216">He was ready to make an announcement, when the cutting was done, such an announcement as “Let’s go!</span> <span id="s1217">Flee!”</span> <span id="s1218">They hanged this young man and I remember that he said in German, “Brothers, we are the last.</span> <span id="s1219">Yes, we are the last they won’t kill any more.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: You are saying that there really were attempts at mass escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Oh sure!</span> <span id="s1222">Sure!</span> <span id="s1223">There were plans but it was almost impossible to carry them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Even other than the Germans would turn you in, if they knew about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: And the major tragedy was that they took the young boy, the brother, they took him away, they put him in the health service barracks, so that he would not have to witness the hanging.</span> <span id="s1226">They didn’t tell him what it was all about or why they removed him.</span> <span id="s1227">He didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1228">They forced him to be in the dispensary and a couple of days later he found out that his brother had been hanged…so he killed himself.</span> <span id="s1229">That was a young boy, my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: He committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1232">He committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1233">I was chummy with him.</span> <span id="s1234">This was a very heartfelt incident which deeply affected the foundation of my own being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: This was someone you could relate to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: So these are some of the outstanding events I can remember.</span> <span id="s1237">In Auschwitz we had the constant fear -- fear became dominant in the concentration camp because they made murder selections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: I want to clarify something.</span> <span id="s1239">If you were going to be killed, would you have been sent to Birkenau first or would they do it right in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: They could do it in Auschwitz, but Birkenau was the major killing point for prisoners from outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: They brought them right in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: You see, there is one thing I can’t quite understand…that there are categories like you, who were working all these years and yet there are categories of people who come right in and who are killed right away.</span> <span id="s1244">Now what is the difference?</span> <span id="s1245">Do you know anything about that or do you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: People were brought in to be killed immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1249">You see the German government had an agreement with I.G. Farben and other industrial complexes or enterprises, such as those building the roads, to supply them a steady source of labor.</span> <span id="s1250">That is what they did.</span> <span id="s1251">In the concentration camps they continuously brought fresh people.</span> <span id="s1252">Let’s say, in a month, there was 10% or 20% or 50% attrition so they brought in new people from all over to fill the positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: What it boiled down to was that healthy young men probably had the best chance of survival because they could work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: That’s right!</span> <span id="s1255">No, the people whom they brought to Birkenau were those whom they considered useless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: So they went directly to the crematory to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Let me give you an example.</span> <span id="s1258">In Lodz there was, even when I was there, one German leader, his name was Biver.</span> <span id="s1259">Ye mach shemol; you know what “ye mach shemol” means don’t you?</span> <span id="s1260">It is “His name should be erased.”</span> <span id="s1261">The opposite of the “Blessed Memory.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Ah, you used that once before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: He spoke Yiddish like any Jew.</span> <span id="s1264">Maybe he was an S.S. man, but he was a civilian.</span> <span id="s1265">He went around to make speeches all the time, in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1266">He said: “We need you; you are our force, our backbone, we need you!</span> <span id="s1267">We are not going to do anything against you but give me your children.</span> <span id="s1268">We don’t want the children, they are useless.”</span> <span id="s1269">He gave an order to have people give their children after two years.</span> <span id="s1270">All right!</span> <span id="s1271">That is how it started out.</span> <span id="s1272">That was a major tragedy.</span> <span id="s1273">We did not want to give them to him.</span> <span id="s1274">He then sent the Jewish leader Rumkofski, who said in support: “We have a choice, either we give them voluntarily or they will come and take anybody they want.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: And this was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: This was in Lodz, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1277">I give you an example of how he went about it, that way of course while I was still there.</span> <span id="s1278">So we were told to be there to listen to a speech.</span> <span id="s1279">Whenever he wanted to give a speech he ordered the Jews to come to a market place where the farmers brought vegetables in the normal courser of business.</span> <span id="s1280">It was a big, huge place…surrounded by buildings.</span> <span id="s1281">Buildings formed a fence.</span> <span id="s1282">One time he asked all the Jews to come out, that he had something important to say.</span> <span id="s1283">This is the way he communicated since there were no radios and no other form of communications.</span> <span id="s1284">So he said, “Listen, let’s face it, you are the backbone of our military, you are our force.</span> <span id="s1285">You produce the textiles, you make the uniforms, and other things in Lodz.</span> <span id="s1286">We need you!</span> <span id="s1287">We want you to come to Germany, deep into Germany.</span> <span id="s1288">We need you there more than we need you here.</span> <span id="s1289">Besides that, it is not safe here.</span> <span id="s1290">The Russians are close.</span> <span id="s1291">We know that you like us better than you like the Russians…and more important (we will be able to protect you and help you).</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Note, that the tapes cut part of the conversation of one on both sides, and that the words within the brackets on both sides of this parenthesis are the transcriber’s best guess as to what was omitted).</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: (You were all gathered in a big place like) a market square?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Yes, our square was too small, but most towns had one.</span> <span id="s1295">They said,, “you bring along your dishes because we do not have any.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: I want to clarify something here - this was an S.S. man who was speaking Yiddish to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: He was dressed as a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: He was dressed as a civilian but you know that he was a civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yes, he was an S.S. man.</span> <span id="s1300">He said: “Bring along whatever clothes you have and bring along your dishes because we don’t have any dishes.”</span> <span id="s1301">Foolish people took him up on this.</span> <span id="s1302">People were hungry, starved for months and they said, “Is he fooling or is he telling the truth?”</span> <span id="s1303">It was an argument.</span> <span id="s1304">Thousands of the people lined up to take the train.</span> <span id="s1305">Thousands!</span> <span id="s1306">And those who didn’t go, they invaded all the homes and picked up the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: But you don’t know where those people went though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: No, they never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: But specifically, you are saying (that they were hoodwinked) but what I am getting to is that you were saying that some people were marked for extermination.</span> <span id="s1310">Remember what I was saying that luck was such a big factor.</span> <span id="s1311">Some people, when they got off the train, they were already bound for extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes, most of the people who came from the ghetto, where they selected various groups, had been destined for extermination.</span> <span id="s1313">You see they kept hauling people continuously and collecting people.</span> <span id="s1314">If they filled their quota, they didn’t need people for the work groups, they sent them to Birkenau or to Maidanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: In other words, if they had enough workers on any day that was the alternative they used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes, that was my understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: So you are there until Jan. ’44, then they decided to move you and you are pretty certain that it was because of the Russians were closing in</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: The Russians, yes.</span> <span id="s1319">The whole camp was evacuated.</span> <span id="s1320">So were we, and I don’t know but about 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s1321">They were all alarmed and evacuated in blocks.</span> <span id="s1322">You know they were searching with dogs and flashlights for all the people who were out very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1323">Trains were standing behind the camp and everyone was rushing to them.</span> <span id="s1324">There were open wagons which they packed (with people) and they shot those who could not climb in them quickly.</span> <span id="s1325">People were falling like flies…people were running away and were being chased by the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: At this point you think that you are being sent for possible extermination.</span> <span id="s1327">You truly don’t know what your destination is to be.</span> <span id="s1328">They are cleaning out the entire camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Yes, we were not sure that we would survive.</span> <span id="s1330">Then they took us on the open trains for days on end.</span> <span id="s1331">Sometimes we stayed for three or four nights on the train (in the same location) because the military were using the railroads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What do you mean when you say “open train”?</span> <span id="s1333">You were not even in enclosed cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: No, in each corner there was an S.S. man sitting, but we were standing in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: I had the image of boxcars which were closed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: No, these are wide open.</span> <span id="s1337">Wide open trains, at least the train on which I was, was wide open.</span> <span id="s1338">We were traveling for 14 days and 14 nights.</span> <span id="s1339">Many times we stayed for a complete day in one spot or a night in one spot.</span> <span id="s1340">We never understood why or what was happening.</span> <span id="s1341">Imagine you couldn’t go to the toilet -- you had to relieve yourself in your pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: There was no chance to go anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Oh no chance at all.</span> <span id="s1344">The only thing was I remember that we had a can which we attached to a string or belt to lift up a little snow while the train was moving to have something to wet our lips with as our only nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Oh they gave you no food for the 14 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: No, no food…nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: For 14 days how did people survive that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: A great many, I don’t have the count, but at least half of us died.</span> <span id="s1349">Every so often they stopped and we had to clear the train of the dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: They didn’t even give you water for 14 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: No.</span> <span id="s1352">Oh no!</span> <span id="s1353">We didn’t feel any hunger at that time we were so dehydrated.</span> <span id="s1354">We just felt thirsty, at least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1355">Fortunately it was not hot and we periodically could get a little snow to wet our lips.</span> <span id="s1356">So in our group we shared that little snow.</span> <span id="s1357">You were stiff from all that when finally we got to our destination, then you got off and they pushed you into a shower.</span> <span id="s1358">All you wanted to do was stay and drink the water.</span> <span id="s1359">That was the most horrible horrible experience of the entire time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: I remember that you had mentioned it just was in passing last week and I thought that we should elaborate a little…and amplify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: It’s indescribable because when people fell down there was no place.</span> <span id="s1362">You stepped virtually on people who were half dead half alive.</span> <span id="s1363">Because you didn’t want to throw them out -- you were hoping that maybe they will revive but at the same time you couldn’t stand and you couldn’t sit because of them.</span> <span id="s1364">Laying down they occupied more space because we were crushed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Now you would conclude from this that only the strongest people could survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Probably…what I remember is that I was in this corner…we were about a couple of people here like this in the corner.</span> <span id="s1367">We bend down and we stood up and we changed positions and rolls.</span> <span id="s1368">Then we had the string and I assume that others had and did the same thing -- we had an empty can for the snow.</span> <span id="s1369">But thousands upon thousands died.</span> <span id="s1370">The reason we know is that every time our train and the other trains stopped the physically healthier people had to take the dead ones out and throw them from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: I can’t figure out why they were bothering to move you?</span> <span id="s1372">I can’t figure it out, it is almost impossible to comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: This is the German mentality…everything has to be precise.</span> <span id="s1374">You know I will give you an example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: They did not want you to be liberated by the Russians apparently…ok!</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1377">To take us away from the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: But to bother to move you, using railroad stock to do it (when their need for railroad stock elsewhere and for military purposes was most urgent) and yet you are all dying along the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1380">The example is: when they undressed us -- you know, took away the watches, the clothes, etc., you had to have every piece of clothing in a separate container.</span> <span id="s1381">It had to be precise.</span> <span id="s1382">They had a bag for watches, they had a bag for teeth, they had a bag for glasses, for rings, etc.</span> <span id="s1383">Everything was marked for filing.</span> <span id="s1384">That was their mentality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: For instance, for the dead people -- for the big volume of people whom they exterminated, which was brought out at the Nuremberg trials, they all were listed alphabetically.</span> <span id="s1387">And the judge asked, “How come that they all died alphabetically?</span> <span id="s1388">The As one day, the Bs another day?”</span> <span id="s1389">this was the Nazis mentality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: OK…so you survived.</span> <span id="s1391">You got to Buchenwald, we figured that was early 1944.</span> <span id="s1392">You were in Buchenwald only for a few months, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Yes…a few months and we did work on some bricks.</span> <span id="s1394">Sorting bricks so that they could be taken from one place to another…cleaning them.</span> <span id="s1395">that really wasn’t very useful work…just to keep us busy and as torture.</span> <span id="s1396">The food was coarse.</span> <span id="s1397">In Buchenwald they did have a crematorium, a big sized crematorium and every time they (used it) the fear was a little less, otherwise we did not know who was next.</span> <span id="s1398">As long as you avoided being kicked, or being hit or being shot, you knew that you survived another day.</span> <span id="s1399">So Buchenwald does not have this (repeated use crematorium), see.</span> <span id="s1400">Much of the brutality that had appeared in the early years of Buchenwald, subsided.</span> <span id="s1401">In the last year or two at least the people who had been in Buchenwald earlier used to tell us…those who were in Buchenwald in 1939 and ’40 – told us that it was much more brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Yes, I asked you about that whether you thought that it varied with who was actually running the camp…or whatever.</span> <span id="s1403">But you have no way of knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: That could be.</span> <span id="s1405">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: That is only speculation but if they realized that they were going to lose the war, then they might have changed their attitude.</span> <span id="s1407">But by 1944, the Normandy invasion had not taken place, but I am certain that they must have known what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: There was a lot of brutality in Dura.</span> <span id="s1409">In Dura there was another phase of brutality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: You went from Buchenwald to Dura?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Yes, from Buchenwald to Dura.</span> <span id="s1412">There was another extreme situation of brutality.</span> <span id="s1413">Even though they didn’t have a crematorium, they were continuously digging huge holes…like ½ block wide and long.</span> <span id="s1414">Digging and digging deep and pile them up with people half alive and half dead.</span> <span id="s1415">Put wood with gasoline on top of the people and burn them.</span> <span id="s1416">That was a stinking and frightening situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: There is no way to comprehend it.</span> <span id="s1418">In a way now I would say that they are trying to accelerate the process which we know they were doing to the very end.</span> <span id="s1419">People like Eichman were saying -- “Keep killing them and do it as fast as you can.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: You could not explain it.</span> <span id="s1421">In Dura the beating was much more brutal.</span> <span id="s1422">The treatment was harsh.</span> <span id="s1423">You know that I was punctured with a bayonet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: What was the cause of it…the immediate cause?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Here is the scar…it was a deep cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Yes…I see the scar.</span> <span id="s1427">How did the incident develop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Every morning when we were walking around…you see here was the facility…their underground working place.</span> <span id="s1429">We were working here, and here was a railroad that leads in and out (of the underground places) where they loaded the machines that they shipped to Antwerp (the V2 launchers)…so we were working here and every morning about eight o’clock when it started to get light an S.S. man came out and he grabs whatever he had in a bag and he say in German, “Oh my God, I can’t eat breakfast until I kill someone.”</span> <span id="s1430">So, whatever, he did and one day I fell to be the victim.</span> <span id="s1431">I fell and we tried to shrink (the wound) and whatever we could to get back to work.</span> <span id="s1432">So he stabbed me a couple of times with his bayonet, or maybe three times.</span> <span id="s1433">I fell down and he thought I was dead.</span> <span id="s1434">Right after he went away, the guys put some clay on it in order to stop the blood and then they did all they could for first aid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: I meant to ask you in all this…did you ever have a serious disease or anything like that that you know of?</span> <span id="s1436">Anything you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: No…I think I had appendicitis, but apparently it went away (without complications).</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: But you never came down with typhus or dysentery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1440">Colds of course, you got many of…no coughing blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: But no contagious diseases?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1443">Well, many times I had fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Were there epidemics that you knew of in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Dysentery was quite prevalent and we all had it.</span> <span id="s1446">But when you had a fever you took the chance.</span> <span id="s1447">Once you went to the first aid barracks, you were afraid that they send you away (as they had done to the 27 in Gleiwitz).</span> <span id="s1448">You didn’t want to take the smallest chance unless you knew the doctor there…so he would give you a couple of pills or something before you went back to work.</span> <span id="s1449">In any case, you wanted to minimize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: So after Dura you went back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1451">It is already 1945.</span> <span id="s1452">Now what was the last phase like in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: In the last phase in Buchenwald they had collected all the young people and put us in one block.</span> <span id="s1454">We kids were in one block separated from anyone else and they planned to teach us a trade to be masons…you know, mixing cements and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: You say that now they were making an attempt to save the rest of you.</span> <span id="s1456">There was no brutality anymore…not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: No, but it was cut down a great deal.</span> <span id="s1458">They didn’t come into our block and shoot people and with dogs.</span> <span id="s1459">This was no longer done but still for example, when we had to line up for the assembly and someone was out from the line…he got hit and kicked.</span> <span id="s1460">They did not deliberately go around like they did in the earlier stages…killing like they did in Gleiwitz or like they did in Dura.</span> <span id="s1461">Those were the two worst situations which I had in my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Gleiwitz and Dura they were the worst!</span> <span id="s1463">I don’t think that we ever could answer the question as to whether individual people were responsible for better or worse treatment in any given camp.</span> <span id="s1464">It is almost impossible to determine that.</span> <span id="s1465">You don’t come into contact with the people who are running the camps or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: No, No!</span> <span id="s1467">You were occupied with your own survival.</span> <span id="s1468">It has been a continuous preoccupation to survive…to get by today and get something in your mouth to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: If we could only find out.</span> <span id="s1470">Let’s say, if in any particular camp somebody was powerful enough, some of the Germans running the camps were powerful enough to be more lenient in a particular situation?</span> <span id="s1471">If they didn’t want to be cruel and they didn’t want to do mass killing so on could they do it?</span> <span id="s1472">But we have no evidence of such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: I don’t know whether the specific brutality came from the top or came from the individual.</span> <span id="s1474">I don’t know…for instance, with this S.S. man (the one who bayoneted me) he was a unique animal who acted out with the others…as long as you stayed within bounds and worked they didn’t really bother you particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Is there S.S. in every camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Camps were never run by the regular military were they?</span> <span id="s1478">Or some other organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s1480">I could not distinguish (between the uniforms).</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: In other words, some could have been regular German soldiers and not necessarily specifically S.S. men?</span> <span id="s1482">You are not completely sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: They had some other uniformed people who were occasionally assistants to help but by and large the S.S. were running the camps.</span> <span id="s1484">They had the supervision and the responsibility for the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: OK, now, before the American Army came to Buchenwald, did the Germans all leave?</span> <span id="s1486">Did they abandon you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: No.</span> <span id="s1488">A couple of days before the Americans came to Buchenwald, we had already heard through the grapevine that the Russians are advancing on one side and the Americans on the other.</span> <span id="s1489">In the meantime, they tried to clear the camps.</span> <span id="s1490">Everybody had to go to an “Anstellung” in the morning (assembly lineup as they regularly had), of course, there were more people then than they could in one day.</span> <span id="s1491">When it came to the “Anstellung” in my block, they were taking it by blocks, so when it came to that I figured I was at that time already injured, unable to move -- unable to walk, unable to dress…this is the end.</span> <span id="s1492">I cannot go.</span> <span id="s1493">So I laid down in a place where there was a shallow hole -- crawled in there and laid there.</span> <span id="s1494">There was another fellow with me.</span> <span id="s1495">We lay there for a day and a half.</span> <span id="s1496">We went there in the morning and in the afternoon of the next day we started hearing different voices.</span> <span id="s1497">Different language.</span> <span id="s1498">That is when we crawled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: We knew that it wasn’t German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: it was no longer German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: And what happened to the rest of the people in the camp…you don’t know?</span> <span id="s1502">Or were there still people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A; Most of them had been evacuated and killed in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: They were killed in the woods, they were shot.</span> <span id="s1506">The youngsters whom you see and hear about they did not go to that “Anstellung” and therefore, were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: This is one of the biggest impressions which I get is that there is no way to explain any specific incident in any of this or the actions of the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No, not in a rational way.</span> <span id="s1509">It seemed to me as of most of them had been trained, inculcated, conditioned to behave in a certain way over a long period of time to do exactly what they did…and they performed as robots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Well, I imagine that if they were brought up in things like Hitlerjugend (Hitler-Youth) and brainwashed since they were children it became a way of life for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: This is true to a great extent, even though I feel that every person the S.S. as well as the (other) Nazis that every person, every individual at all times, in the most crucial circumstances, is left with a choice to set a price for his behavior.</span> <span id="s1512">If they want to avoid pain, they have to be willing to do anything to submit.</span> <span id="s1513">If they want to gain some benefits, they again have to be willing to pay a price…it is going to be without considering their conscience.</span> <span id="s1514">This is the tragedy of human…fragility...that is unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: I don’t imagine that we ever will be able to get the real answer to the questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: It is interesting to know.</span> <span id="s1517">Maybe you are familiar with the study; it was reported several years ago in “Psychology Today” where a group of Minnesota psychiatrists took the profiles of the Nazi criminals, who were convicted.</span> <span id="s1518">They took the same profiles and gave them to an independent group of psychiatrists to evaluate and tell us what kind of person (these Nazi criminals) were.</span> <span id="s1519">They stated that they were “average American business people”.</span> <span id="s1520">This is again not to dismiss it lightly or to condemn but just to recognize human frailty…that we all can be subject to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Well, some of them indicated that they were sometimes just bureaucrats really carrying out orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Yes, the Eichman syndrome…where he just obeyed orders.</span> <span id="s1523">This is a tragedy which we can see again in the people of Viet Nam, or in WWII…in Japan.</span> <span id="s1524">It is unfortunate and that is why I feel that good conscious people have to be in doubt all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: That is what they tell us all the time.</span> <span id="s1526">are there other individual incidents which you want to talk about at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Another extremely bad incident about which I am somewhat frightened to talk about because I don’t believe in it -- even though I watched it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: What don’t you believe happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: There was one time where a train came fully loaded with small children and there was a group of S.S. men standing on each side of the cars and a couple of S.S. in the middle of the train.</span> <span id="s1530">They threw the children off the train in a pile and a shovel with a buggy came and picked them up.</span> <span id="s1531">They picked them up as you do with gravel or ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: They buried them in the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: No, no, no…they had a machine to pick them up like you pick up gravel or ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Yes, an earthmover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: And picked them up and put them on small little wagons and shipped them to the (gas chambers).</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: They were still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Yes, still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Were these infants?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Infants and small children.</span> <span id="s1540">Must have been up to two or three years old.</span> <span id="s1541">Children!!!</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: You saw this…you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: That is a terrible scene.</span> <span id="s1544">As a matter of fact, when my children were small…every time I held a small child…that scene came to me and haunted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: I am sure!</span> <span id="s1546">Where did that take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: You saw it happen?</span> <span id="s1551">You just happened to see it happen…to be there when they arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1553">I happened to be there.</span> <span id="s1554">Yes, yes, I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s1555">We held on to each other, we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1556">It was, you see in Auschwitz…here was the camp and here they had a pre-camp -- camp where the transports arrived.</span> <span id="s1557">So you had rather a mess.</span> <span id="s1558">I am not talking about individuals.</span> <span id="s1559">Should an individual fall, stepping on him was the normal course of business.</span> <span id="s1560">But the mass scene…that is something else!</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: I don’t know if you made any other notes…that you wanted to refer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Well, did you want me to talk about the potatoes?</span> <span id="s1563">I think that we talked about the potatoes and that you got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Which one was that?</span> <span id="s1565">Which story was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: When we stole the potatoes and they made us stand in line because we didn’t want to tell who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: I don’t know if we ever got that down on the tape.</span> <span id="s1568">I don’t recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Do you want it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Go ahead and mention it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: This was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1572">One day we were marching to work outside and in the surrounding area they had places where they kept potatoes covered with straw.</span> <span id="s1573">While we were marching S.S. were on both sides and we were marching here.</span> <span id="s1574">So one fellow or two fell flat when we marched by.</span> <span id="s1575">The young fellow went to the potato pile and tried to fill his pockets full of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1576">So the potato patch was disturbed.</span> <span id="s1577">All the S.S. men were watching and shouting, “catch the thief’ So while the youngster stood there to get the potatoes out, he got to his feet and he was able to tear himself away from the S.S. men and came running back to our group, without a shoe and without a hat.</span> <span id="s1578">So we were able to patch up -- you know we always had rags with ourselves (from the uniforms).</span> <span id="s1579">We formed a shoe and a hat and then the S.S. man came and looked to see who was missing one shoe and a hat.</span> <span id="s1580">That was it; no one was missing anything, so he started “Austellen” everybody and they made us stand for about eight or nine hours.</span> <span id="s1581">It was cold by then.</span> <span id="s1582">We were cold, we had pieces of ice on our hands.</span> <span id="s1583">He wanted us to tell him who was the one who stole the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1584">But ultimately we did not break down.</span> <span id="s1585">We did not tell him and they got tired of waiting so they took us back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: And you could eat the potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: No, we didn’t have any potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: So you didn’t get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Of course, the youngster ran away without them…sure</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: So you didn’t have to pay for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Not that time.</span> <span id="s1592">That was another time you are thinking about.</span> <span id="s1593">So this time that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: I thought that if you had any other specific thing you wanted to talk about…we could go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: I cannot recall any other specific event that needs to be talked about now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: The one thing which I still want to get in with you…that we talked about is the “hierarchy” in the camps about which you talked yourself.</span> <span id="s1597">I wanted you to talk about it in some detail…and then I think that unless you think of anything else you want to talk about between now and the next time we meet and talk, we go on to the postwar period after 1945, but, I think that’s enough for tonight.</span> <span id="s1598">Let’s take it up again.</span> <span id="s1599">We have been over one hour and so we rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">(It appears that then Allan Spetter and Murray Weisman decided to add something to the</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">session).</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Usually you lived in groups.</span> <span id="s1603">Within the camp you formed a group as you would with a family.</span> <span id="s1604">We tried to assist each other and provide support for each other, to protect each other from the dangers of hard work or if we had an extra bit of food (we shared) so usually you did it with a fellow you bunked with, that is…he was next to you in his bunk.</span> <span id="s1605">I was with another fellow, a Polish fellow, we bunked together and we really lived like brothers.</span> <span id="s1606">We shared whatever we could…we helped each other, however, after a while something bothered him, in his mind, and he asked me, “Motek”t hat was my name in camp, “tell me you are such a nice boy, why in the world did the Jews kill gentile kids for blood at Passover?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: He really believed that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Well, that is the kind of thing you said that before the war you really believed that people were being taught these kind of things.</span> <span id="s1610">And he honestly believed it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1612">Yes.</span> <span id="s1613">And I was shocked!</span> <span id="s1614">I was shocked!</span> <span id="s1615">Such an intelligent fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Did you try to explain it to him?</span> <span id="s1617">.</span> <span id="s1618">Well, you were such a youngster at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Look…I think that I said, “Listen’, I had matured well beyond my age…I tried to explain it but you see you can’t explain away a feeling, an attitude.</span> <span id="s1620">You just cannot!!!</span> <span id="s1621">It takes a lot of reconditioning…reorientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: If you can think of anything else like that, I would like to get to it.</span> <span id="s1623">So you again might jot some of that down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Maybe as we talk it might come up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1626">Well that is enough for this evening.</span> <span id="s1627">Thank you!</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: I am here for the third session.</span> <span id="s1629">This is Allan Spetter, at the home of Dr. Murray Weisman, on Thursday, February 28, 1980 at 7:30 P.M.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Okay…let’s go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Another incident I recalled which happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1632">I suspect that it was in 1944, during the early part.</span> <span id="s1633">Probably in March because it wasn’t too cold.</span> <span id="s1634">While we stood in line to go to work, it was on a Friday, suddenly a group of S.S. men cut through the middle of our formation.</span> <span id="s1635">They took us to a truck that was there.</span> <span id="s1636">They were pushing from both sides with their guns.</span> <span id="s1637">I was on the truck already, then I looked around and jumped off the truck and ran amongst the people.</span> <span id="s1638">There were several shots fired but again I disappeared and went back to the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: So, you survived again!</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1641">People again congratulated me.</span> <span id="s1642">You know another lifespan, another couple of days or weeks.</span> <span id="s1643">That is essentially what I wanted to elaborate (on the earlier reference to escaping from the crematorium when the S.S. man said, “we will get them next time”)</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: I know that you jotted down some incidents like this.</span> <span id="s1645">You always say that you think of things in between sessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Also, another guy from our group, who was a Jew from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1647">He was a musician.</span> <span id="s1648">He was on a train and he had some written musical notes with him.</span> <span id="s1649">He had thrown it to us and he said, ‘please save this.”</span> <span id="s1650">Some people picked it up.</span> <span id="s1651">It was a song, a legacy which he gave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: It has survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yes, it has survived.</span> <span id="s1654">I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Where was that…where was that train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: It was also in Auschwitz, during the same period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: On the way to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1659">He threw that out from he truck.</span> <span id="s1660">You know all the possessions he had.</span> <span id="s1661">This was somewhere in the lining of his jacket.</span> <span id="s1662">That in a sense was a legacy which he addressed to the Jewish people of the world.</span> <span id="s1663">It was in Yiddish (and therefore, its knowledge was limited).</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1665">More and more of these things have been discovered in the years since then.</span> <span id="s1666">People have discovered these things which various individuals have left.</span> <span id="s1667">Many of them have great meaning.</span> <span id="s1668">Just a minute, before we proceed, we have spent an awful lot of time on this, but I just want to get this on record again.</span> <span id="s1669">And you tell me if you think that there is anything incorrect here.</span> <span id="s1670">But as a historian, I am preoccupied with trying to go down the chronology and I know how difficult it is for you to pin down exactly but let me state this once and for all.</span> <span id="s1671">And if there are any major corrections, you go ahead and tell me.</span> <span id="s1672">As far as I can tell you were first in Gleiwitz, which is basically between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s1673">You were there from late 1939 for about one year, to late 1940.</span> <span id="s1674">Then, you were a year in Buna, which I would figure late 1940 to late 1941.</span> <span id="s1675">Then two years in Auschwitz until about Jan. 1944 when the Russians were advancing (note that the entire Auschwitz complex was located near today’s Polish city of Krakov) then Buchenwald (note that is close to the city of Weimar which is today in east Germany) for three to four months.</span> <span id="s1676">Then to Dura until early 1945, when they sent you back to Buchenwald where you were liberated.</span> <span id="s1677">I believe that this is it generally.</span> <span id="s1678">Now, there is one major topic I would like to deal with.</span> <span id="s1679">Is there anything, anything you may want to add before we go to the postwar situation?</span> <span id="s1680">That is, is the relationships within the camps.</span> <span id="s1681">You deal with that briefly and I hope that you will just go on with it and tell us basically as much as you are aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Generally speaking, the general relationship in camp between prisoners was just like a hierarchical social stratification as it is in modern society.</span> <span id="s1683">It was a microcosm of society.</span> <span id="s1684">There were people who were very low.</span> <span id="s1685">The low people were essentially the latecomers.</span> <span id="s1686">They were usually assigned the dirtiest, heaviest jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: In a way, those who survived longest had seniority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Sure!</span> <span id="s1689">They also had survived already.</span> <span id="s1690">They were the heroes.</span> <span id="s1691">They (latecomers) often were the dirtiest because the way you kept yourself depended on the job.</span> <span id="s1692">If you worked in a coal mine you didn’t have any clothes to change into.</span> <span id="s1693">So you were dirty all the way along.</span> <span id="s1694">You took it off and you shook it out.</span> <span id="s1695">Again, we had no facility to wash.</span> <span id="s1696">They were dirty.</span> <span id="s1697">They were the lowest class.</span> <span id="s1698">They also were lowest on physical health…they were not far from death.</span> <span id="s1699">They barely survived.</span> <span id="s1700">For instance, they ran around unattended.</span> <span id="s1701">They didn’t wipe their noses.</span> <span id="s1702">Noses were dripping…just like that of a helpless person.</span> <span id="s1703">Then, there were those who had the better jobs.</span> <span id="s1704">Who worked inside like in machine shops, in woodwork.</span> <span id="s1705">Their clothes were a little better.</span> <span id="s1706">They were protected a little from the elements.</span> <span id="s1707">They looked nicer and were not as exhausted as those who worked outside.</span> <span id="s1708">Then, there was a third group who worked inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1709">While we were outside the camp, they were inside…such as attendants</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: They were not doing heavy labor the way you were, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: They were the privileged ones who had connections and ties and they were there.</span> <span id="s1712">So, that is it in terms of function, classifications.</span> <span id="s1713">The higher, more prestigious group also worked in services like the kitchens.</span> <span id="s1714">They had prisoners who worked in the kitchen peeling potatoes or washing or cooking.</span> <span id="s1715">They also had plenty to eat.</span> <span id="s1716">Then there were those who were in the distribution of the clothing, jackets, etc.</span> <span id="s1717">Ultimately, if it was torn, they had to give you another jacket, it depended if you were in a better class, you got a better jacket, and if you were in a lower class you didn’t.</span> <span id="s1718">This is the type of classification which existed within the groups.</span> <span id="s1719">Connections and ties were important and usually the newcomers had the worst deal.</span> <span id="s1720">The lower the number, the better class you were.</span> <span id="s1721">You were recognized.</span> <span id="s1722">They respected you more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Yes, you indicated that the number on your arm could actually indicate when you came to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1725">Which group you came from and so forth.</span> <span id="s1726">That was all known.</span> <span id="s1727">Then there were classifications in nationalities.</span> <span id="s1728">The Jews were at the bottom of that, of course.</span> <span id="s1729">In most camps the Jews were the majority.</span> <span id="s1730">Somebody said that they had half as many Poles in the camps.</span> <span id="s1731">That is not what I experienced.</span> <span id="s1732">Maybe 10% at the most.</span> <span id="s1733">The majority of the camps were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: And they were always the lowest group (hierarchically speaking)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Always the lowest group.</span> <span id="s1736">Without change of that anywhere.</span> <span id="s1737">Then of course, there were individual Jews of the upper class who were on the top.</span> <span id="s1738">Like the guy Chaim, whom I told you about.</span> <span id="s1739">He was from the upper class.</span> <span id="s1740">He was respected by the high command.</span> <span id="s1741">He must have been one of the first prisoners who survived from the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Do you think that he may have been a political prisoner to start rather than just Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1744">Maybe, he might have been, however, he had the same sign we had.</span> <span id="s1745">All the Jews were in one category across the board.</span> <span id="s1746">Then, there were the Poles…then there were the other minorities such as gypsies, French, whatever.</span> <span id="s1747">The third and the highest category were the “B.S.” the professional criminals.</span> <span id="s1748">They had the most supervisory positions like the “Kapos”, that were the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: The B.S. served as Kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1751">Most of them.</span> <span id="s1752">They were the commanders and the supervisors.</span> <span id="s1753">These were actual criminals from Germany…not political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1754">You could identify those who had green were the criminals, red triangles were the political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1755">The Jews were the only ones who had the Mogen David (Star of David).</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Oh, their’s was the Mogen David, all the others had triangles of different colors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1758">The colors identified them.</span> <span id="s1759">the homosexuals were black.</span> <span id="s1760">They didn’t like homosexuals either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Where were they?</span> <span id="s1762">What I really am trying to find out…did the nationalities basically affect where you worked?</span> <span id="s1763">For example, if the homosexual was a German would he be better than a Polish homosexual?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s1765">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1766">The national origin was the most important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: And the Germans always got the best treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1769">The Germans were after all blood-related.</span> <span id="s1770">They were picked for the high positions, for the easier work for respectability, for more food, etc.</span> <span id="s1771">For example, they had a bordello in the camp only the German prisoners could go into the bordello.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Now, let me ask you something else.</span> <span id="s1773">Was there any differentiation made between German Jews and Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1775">In the hierarchy, they were looked down just like everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: But may they have a better opportunity at a better job or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1778">The German Jew yes.</span> <span id="s1779">You see, the German Jews were earlier in the concentration camp than we were.</span> <span id="s1780">So most of the German Jews had the 69,000 on their arms.</span> <span id="s1781">I was an early Polish prisoner and I had 145,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Oh I see.</span> <span id="s1783">So obviously it was the German whom the Nazis had the first chance to round up.</span> <span id="s1784">As early as 1933, they were being rounded up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: When we came, they were already in privileged positions and jobs.</span> <span id="s1786">The majority I found, thank G-d, to be good persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: The Jews did stick together basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: The majority did but there were exceptions…very few exceptions.</span> <span id="s1789">Another point which I like to make is in spite of all the trials and tribulations, we lived under, we still had the same psychological hang-ups that we see todays.</span> <span id="s1790">Society has not changed all that much.</span> <span id="s1791">One says that the German Jews were better than the Polish Jews, another that the Polish Jews were better than the German Jews, another that the Polish Jews were better than the Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1792">Actually the criticism was not based on the majority from here or there…it was on those who kept themselves better…who are better able to survive.</span> <span id="s1793">The Polish Jews generally kept themselves better than both of them…at least, that was our feeling.</span> <span id="s1794">That they had greater tolerance (of hardships)…they had greater endurance and they could endure much more hardship and pain than the other Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Well, Hungarian Jews came in very late in the war, didn’t they?</span> <span id="s1796">So I guess there was some kind of animosity over that…I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: No, No!</span> <span id="s1798">Not animosity but they were not prepared for it or they couldn’t get used to it or they never had a chance to get used to it because they died like flies…virtually like flies.</span> <span id="s1799">Their group disintegrated rapidly.</span> <span id="s1800">That is what you mean when you talk about supporting each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Yes, I wanted to back into that again.</span> <span id="s1802">You said Jews…there were Jews who helped you to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yes, and by and large most of the Jewish people supported one another.</span> <span id="s1804">There were individual, isolated incidents, where someone was brutal who joined the Nazis and assumed their function.</span> <span id="s1805">Perhaps, they thought that it was for their own survival.</span> <span id="s1806">The majority, however, at least that was in my experience, helped each other.</span> <span id="s1807">I find myself more during the war and even after war like Elisha, in Brothers Karamazov.</span> <span id="s1808">The greatest tragedy that I found myself in I always found somebody who helped me out.</span> <span id="s1809">You are familiar with Elisha, I presume.</span> <span id="s1810">Elisha figures in the Brothers Karamazov.</span> <span id="s1811">He was a little monk who although he minded his own business, always got into trouble.</span> <span id="s1812">Everybody pushed him and kicked him.</span> <span id="s1813">Whenever he was down he found someone to pick him up.</span> <span id="s1814">I found myself in a similar situation all the time.</span> <span id="s1815">Whenever I was down, I always found someone particularly a Jewish fellow to pick me back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: You had started to explain that there was almost a family structure of two or four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1818">Almost a family structure of two or four people depending on the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: You said that those who worked together slept together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Yes, because they kept the same people in the same barracks to work in the same location.</span> <span id="s1821">So we did stick together.</span> <span id="s1822">We shared whatever we could steal, whatever we could organize, whatever we could find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Organize is another word for stealing, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Correct!</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: You didn’t fight over it necessarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Most groups did share but there were instances and I watched particularly where fathers and sons stole each other’s bread.</span> <span id="s1827">They were giving blows to each other when they saw it.</span> <span id="s1828">That was a tragic scene to watch.</span> <span id="s1829">You know, there was a father and a son fighting over a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1830">I saw such a scene twice with my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Well, in your case, you are saying that what probably helped sustain you was the groups you were in…where you helped each other as much as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Most of them were young people such as I was myself.</span> <span id="s1833">We developed some kind of solidarity where we stuck together, under all circumstances.</span> <span id="s1834">We shared together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You mentioned something like beyond food you shared blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1837">We shared blankets and clothes, a piece of wire, or a piece of string.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Anything to help each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1840">Particularly clothes or so on.</span> <span id="s1841">We didn’t have a means of sewing them but we did what we could to repair a tear because you are supposed to be neat all the time.</span> <span id="s1842">That is what the piece of wire or string were used for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: One other thing, in case we missed it.</span> <span id="s1844">Somewhere you said that you knew that you were actually in the same camp with Leon Blum at one time?</span> <span id="s1845">In line with the previous questions about prisoners of war, etc. you never saw him but you know that he was there and he was one of those kept in a separate location.</span> <span id="s1846">(Leon Blum was a former French Prime Minister).</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Yes, that is true…I never saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Begin Side Two, Tape Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: This affected your beliefs and practices?</span> <span id="s1850">You came from a very Orthodox background and how did this affect your beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Really here I can only talk about myself.</span> <span id="s1852">There were Jews who risked their lives daily to say the “Sh’ma Israel”.</span> <span id="s1853">The Nazis didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s1854">If they caught anybody they would shoot them on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: For praying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Yes, for praying.</span> <span id="s1857">There were people who in the morning when you “davened” (prayed) you always found people who had been shot while saying their prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: They wouldn’t even attempt to hide the fact that they were praying…because after all, they could have prayed to themselves, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: No.</span> <span id="s1860">There was no privacy, it was open on all the sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: But you could have prayed in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Yes, of course…but that is not the way the Orthodox do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: You hold your hand like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: So this fellow stood in a corner and he had some people protect him, cover him up.</span> <span id="s1867">And they did, in the morning before going to work or when coming home.</span> <span id="s1868">They found a moment and they stood and prayed.</span> <span id="s1869">Personally I was very bitter.</span> <span id="s1870">Very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1871">Being religious, I told myself that I was too young to sin.</span> <span id="s1872">Well, I have done nothing bad to anybody why should I suffer?</span> <span id="s1873">On the other hand, I felt that it is a world of madness, the whole world was mad.</span> <span id="s1874">In my judgment, my assessment of the situation was, I looked at it from inside out and I gathered that the world is divided into two groups of people -- the direct killers and those who directly acquiesce and quietly allow this to happen without interfering.</span> <span id="s1875">My belief was completely shaken and I have never been able to recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: You belong to a Reform (Congregation)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: I belong to Reform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: That is a world apart from (Orthodoxy).</span> <span id="s1879">From the origin in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Essentially I have an affinity for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1881">I want to be with the Jewish people and this is not for Jewish reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Oh, you mean that you really consider yourself almost a non-believer now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Well, I maintain tradition.</span> <span id="s1884">I feel that I have a good basis in Jewish literature, people and lore…almost by osmosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Well, you went to Cheder didn’t you?</span> <span id="s1886">You did go until the age of nine…you had a Hebrew education there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1888">A Jewish education.</span> <span id="s1889">We learned about the Talmud and the Midrash.</span> <span id="s1890">I still remember a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1891">I can read the Torah in the actual Aramaic.</span> <span id="s1892">I can read the Megilla.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: But you mentioned, for instance, almost at the very beginning that you were never Bar Mitzvahed at the time because you were in the camps.</span> <span id="s1894">That could have destroyed your faith as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: But I maintained it and I have close ties with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1896">I feel comfortable with them.</span> <span id="s1897">I feel at home with them…but in terms of religious beliefs, I don’t have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Now here in Dayton is this the first time you actually affiliated with a Temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1900">Well, I have been affiliated on and off.</span> <span id="s1901">I was not a member in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1902">I was teaching Sunday school there under Rabbi Prowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: That was the first place you came to in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: No.</span> <span id="s1905">I was in New York for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Well, we will get into that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Now again, I cannot justify in my own mind that there is a Benevolent “G-d” who allows this type of massacre of innocent people, young children, adults.</span> <span id="s1908">It is kind of sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: I am sure you at least have to question it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s1911">I have questioned it and I have asked the same question of many people I came in contact with.</span> <span id="s1912">I am still puzzled by it.</span> <span id="s1913">I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s1914">It is a procedure we have to do in order to justify whatever is going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1916">There is one other aspect I want to get to which we may have touched on but which should be clarified before we go on to the post camp period.</span> <span id="s1917">What did you know specifically about what was going on on the outside at the time of the war, specifically if anything and what was your method of obtaining that information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Of course, we had no contact with the outside world.</span> <span id="s1919">We had no newspapers, no radio, no information from any reliable source.</span> <span id="s1920">The only thing which we could hear is the Nazis talking amongst themselves, while watching us.</span> <span id="s1921">We deliberately (tried) to overhear what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s1922">So we picked up (news about) some major events such as we knew when the war broke out between the Germans and the Russians.</span> <span id="s1923">We also knew from their reactions to us if they had victories, successful military accomplishment, they were good to us; on the other hand, if they suffered a defeat they were brutally mad and took it out on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Did you think that the Russian army would someday get to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: We were hoping.</span> <span id="s1926">When we were in Auschwitz we were hoping because it was on the Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Did you have any idea how badly the Russians had been beaten in the early months of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Yes, yes, because we knew when Hitler made a speech.</span> <span id="s1929">After Stalingrad or Leningrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Stalingrad was in early 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1932">Again we heard conversation about it and again, he was saying that he was not going to spare another nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: You didn’t get to hear any direct broadcast at all.</span> <span id="s1934">They didn’t pipe it into the camp even when Hitler was speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1936">We were not privileged to receive any information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: So, you knew that the war was beginning to turn after Stalingrad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1939">After Stalingrad we knew it was turning and we started hoping.</span> <span id="s1940">And this is why we were full of hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: You knew that the United States was in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: We knew that the U.S. and England were planning an invasion.</span> <span id="s1943">We knew about this in broad terms.</span> <span id="s1944">We didn’t know the specific details.</span> <span id="s1945">So broadly speaking, we had some idea about what was going on.</span> <span id="s1946">Also, we didn’t know specifically when it went into effect, but there were a couple of people who were in the medical barracks, doctors.</span> <span id="s1947">So either they had some better contacts with the Germans or (otherwise) got more information.</span> <span id="s1948">They always fed us a lot of information.</span> <span id="s1949">Through contacts with them they actually shared information.</span> <span id="s1950">So we had a little knowledge of what was happening.</span> <span id="s1951">Although because our lack of patience, getting the information seemed to take an eternity.</span> <span id="s1952">We were impatient but we couldn’t really visualize that they would reach us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: While you were still living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: This in itself was beyond our comprehension.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: You did not know specifically about the Normandy invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: You knew that they were planning something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: No.</span> <span id="s1959">We knew about an invasion somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: OK Murray, if there is nothing right now that you can think of, why don’t we move on to the post WWII period.</span> <span id="s1961">We know that you hid at the end and that you were rescued by American troops.</span> <span id="s1962">You even said that a Jewish major freed you.</span> <span id="s1963">Was he the first man you spoke to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: Yes and he spoke a broken Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: I can’t imagine what his reaction was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Well, my reaction was that I was numb.</span> <span id="s1967">Really…I cried!</span> <span id="s1968">With the pain of hunger, I didn’t feel a thing anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: What did they do first to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: At first, they gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s1971">They opened a can of food and gave me some of its content…then, they gave me something to drink.</span> <span id="s1972">Then, I sat down and I think that I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1973">He woke me up after one hour and I was bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: You were still bleeding from the wound?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: It was full of pus…so he took me to a military place and they worked on it and I stayed for a couple of days in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: And then they arranged to take that picture and then they took us to a hospital in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: You went right to Paris within a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes, right to France where I joined a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: That is specifically the group called “The Orphans of Buchenwald”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Now was this an enterprise launched by French Jews perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Well, in conjunction with the French government on the initiative of the French Jews because the French officers, or whatever, gave us a home, a country, citizenship papers…but we were under the auspices of a French Jewish organization called OSAI…a society for orphans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: That was mainly set up to get children who survived, was that the idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Apparently yes, they picked up all the children.</span> <span id="s1986">They got us to stay for four or five days at the Hotel Lutetia (or a name very much like this.</span> <span id="s1987">Later it is called the “Lutestia” which is known as one of the biggest hotels in Paris).</span> <span id="s1988">They were fully equipped with diapers and cribs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Oh, they thought that there were really going to be children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Yes, they expected really little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: So, how did they adjust to you?</span> <span id="s1992">How did they react when they found out that they were receiving teenagers?</span> <span id="s1993">Was it a different approach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Well the government knew that we were there and the Jewish people took care of us.</span> <span id="s1995">We were in a hotel that was fitted out like a hospital with nurses.</span> <span id="s1996">They were taking care of us, so they had to change their preparations a little bit and their orientation.</span> <span id="s1997">Maybe they were disappointed.</span> <span id="s1998">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: I am sure that they were not!</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Then people came to look at us and after we recuperated in the hospital for a while (that point is not clear on the tape, whether it is a hospital or a hotel outfitted like a hospital), we went to Aigues.</span> <span id="s2001">This is a camp about 200 miles from Paris with houses like a school with numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: You were about 15 by this time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Yes, and we were housed there.</span> <span id="s2004">Everything was taken care of, just so that we could recuperate.</span> <span id="s2005">We didn’t do anything except eat, sleep and play around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Did you have any idea then what they were trying to do with you in the bargain?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Did you think that you were going to stay in France or go elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: We knew that we were with Jewish people and they tried to accommodate us the best they could.</span> <span id="s2010">They gave us all kinds of medical care and of course, most of the youngsters were very bitter and showed it in a very distinctive way.</span> <span id="s2011">They broke the furniture, they cried a lot at night, they were screaming because they wanted their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: But, they didn’t see them during the whole war, let’s say, but now they wanted them back again.</span> <span id="s2013">It’s as if they had a completely different personality while they were in the camps.</span> <span id="s2014">Now that is over they came back to reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: That’s right!</span> <span id="s2016">They came up with -- where are my parents?</span> <span id="s2017">Absolutely, that is what I came up with.</span> <span id="s2018">I asked the American doctor who operated on me…”Where are my parents?”</span> <span id="s2019">That is what I was asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Really!</span> <span id="s2021">How did he react?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: He was sitting watching me trying to give me something more to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Was that your major concern, to try to locate your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yes, Yes!!!</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: How long was it until you contacted your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: It was about one year or a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: And that was just by accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Yes, by accident.</span> <span id="s2029">But I wrote and it took a while until an answer came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Did you ever have definite confirmation as to what happened to your parents and the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2032">My sister…of course, she was in the Lodz ghetto until Jan. 1945, she knew when they took my parents away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Oh, they were there also that late?</span> <span id="s2034">Not until early 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yes, when they evacuated the ghetto, when the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s2036">She knew what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: But she never saw them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: No!</span> <span id="s2039">You see that is what happens when they took the transport.</span> <span id="s2040">Afterwards, they found out where the transport went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Right!</span> <span id="s2042">But your sister never left the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Not until ’45.</span> <span id="s2044">In ’45 she went also to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: But she survived also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: She survived also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Now, you were in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: In France…we were about three months in Aigues.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: And they were feeding you and getting you back to health, I presume…and education too, I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Not in Aigues.</span> <span id="s2051">Afterwards, they gave us different tests.</span> <span id="s2052">In Aigues, we didn’t have any education…they let us loose.</span> <span id="s2053">We didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2054">After the three months , we went to Paris then they started testing us (probably the tests in Aigues were medical).</span> <span id="s2055">First, they asked us what we wanted to pursue, I remember that.</span> <span id="s2056">They gave us different types of tests.</span> <span id="s2057">They taught us French so that we could catch up with high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Did they have any idea where you might want to go?</span> <span id="s2059">Or where they could send you…for instance, there was never any thought about going back to Poland on your part?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: No no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Because there was nothing left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: There were plans made to stay there in France.</span> <span id="s2063">The French government offered us citizenship papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Yes, they would take you in as refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: They took us in and offered us permanent residence in Paris.</span> <span id="s2066">The Jewish organizations with American dollars -- the Americans started shipping in a lot of money and supplies.</span> <span id="s2067">So they started providing everything for us.</span> <span id="s2068">We were very comfortable from the material point of view, that is.</span> <span id="s2069">The people over there were extremely nice to us.</span> <span id="s2070">Very good to us.</span> <span id="s2071">After that, of course, they sent psychologists to us.</span> <span id="s2072">I was the only one who talked to the psychologists.</span> <span id="s2073">Most of them didn’t want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s2074">They didn’t want to be thought crazy.</span> <span id="s2075">It was not in the Polish pattern to talk to a psychologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Right!</span> <span id="s2077">Especially amongst the Jews I would think, back then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: They said, “Only crazy people go to the psychologist”.</span> <span id="s2079">So, they gave this up.</span> <span id="s2080">Actually they said that they wanted to study this reaction to a psychologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Exactly!</span> <span id="s2082">But did you resent it or did they make an object of curiosity out of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: No, I personally objected.</span> <span id="s2084">I was….</span> <span id="s2085">I think I wanted to see him.</span> <span id="s2086">Not boastfully.</span> <span id="s2087">I was the only fellow who did not agree with the majority of the kids.</span> <span id="s2088">They were very destructive.</span> <span id="s2089">They gave them coats, for example, and they protested that they did not want the coats…they wanted different ones.</span> <span id="s2090">The coats were made of gray blankets.</span> <span id="s2091">The kids threw them away.</span> <span id="s2092">They didn’t want them.</span> <span id="s2093">They wanted blue coats or something like that.</span> <span id="s2094">They protested.</span> <span id="s2095">They went on strike and all that.</span> <span id="s2096">You know, real kid stuff.</span> <span id="s2097">In some sense they tried to understand it.</span> <span id="s2098">But!</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q; Well, they were all orphans too!</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: Well, they took us in and they didn’t want to blame the French people for this.</span> <span id="s2101">So it all blew over.</span> <span id="s2102">Afterwards, we went to school.</span> <span id="s2103">We were assigned to schools and to different grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: You had never been beyond what grade in school…before you were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Third grade, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: But you could read and write very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Yiddish, I could do well, a little Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: You didn’t know Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: Of course, Hebrew!</span> <span id="s2110">Hebrew and Yiddish!</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: You could write Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s2113">I wrote most of what I had to in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2114">All the different phrases</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: And now you were learning French as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Yes, we were learning French with special tutors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Now, when you picked up your education, what level would you say they put you in?</span> <span id="s2118">A level to correspond with your age; 11th grade?</span> <span id="s2119">I mean right there in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: No, we did not go to any public schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: I mean whatever school they provided?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: We didn’t go to public school.</span> <span id="s2123">The first year we went essentially in a home.</span> <span id="s2124">We were three months in Aigues, then we went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s2125">We lived where Robespierre’s palace used to be.</span> <span id="s2126">Most incredible, mirrors and marble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: They were trying to make you feel good, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2129">The group was divided into several parts.</span> <span id="s2130">One, lived in Rothschild’s facility…25-35 different rooms.</span> <span id="s2131">So, after we had been tutored for one year, we went to regular school.</span> <span id="s2132">I passed a test and went on to “ecole de dentisterie”, a dental school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Oh, really!</span> <span id="s2134">Were you going to be a dental technician or a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: A dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Oh, to be a dentist, otherwise said: they gave you equivalent credit for your education?</span> <span id="s2137">They didn’t expect you to go back and start over in grade school and high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: They were really treating you as adults, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: We were tutored for about one year or one and a half, or two years.</span> <span id="s2141">I don’t remember the exact dates…and then when we started school I went to dental school.</span> <span id="s2142">So, we started both theoretical and practical schooling.</span> <span id="s2143">In the theoretical course, we had a Russian professor.</span> <span id="s2144">The school was specially established for after the war, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: What, for Russians, immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: No, no, no…the professor was from Russia.</span> <span id="s2147">He was a Jewish professor who during the war was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2148">So he came and they formed the school.</span> <span id="s2149">I never did hear about this school earlier.</span> <span id="s2150">Maybe you recall the pictures from that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: I didn’t know that these pictures were from that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: The school was for seven years (if one is to become a dentist).</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: So, how long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: From ’45, the end of April until about late ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Four years and you said that you made an attempt to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Yes, in ’47.</span> <span id="s2157">Then I was active in a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s2158">I was tied up with a Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: Were you active before.</span> <span id="s2160">Oh, I keep forgetting that you were a youngster, but you said that your family was of Zionist orientation before WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: And active also.</span> <span id="s2162">My older brother was active in a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s2163">So I was active then.</span> <span id="s2164">And then another group of about five kids and they sent us to Italy for training.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: That is where you would embark from…an Italian port to leave for Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: No.</span> <span id="s2167">I left from Le Havre.</span> <span id="s2168">I just went for the training.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Is that common…to leave from an Italian port to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: They had training places there for the people.</span> <span id="s2171">Then, I went to Herzelia in Israel and I was pushed back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: By the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: You were not allowed in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: No…they did not let us.</span> <span id="s2176">We were about eight days on the ship and then we went back to Le Havre.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: You were back in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: In France…yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: That was the only attempt you made?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: So you stayed in France two more years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: And during that time you established contact with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: You just wrote a letter to your hometown?</span> <span id="s2186">You said a postcard…something like: does anybody know anybody in my family?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: Yes, something like “Weisman, the address where we had lived and if you know anybody tell them where I am.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: And she was living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: No.</span> <span id="s2190">She just came back.</span> <span id="s2191">No, no, she came back several months later.</span> <span id="s2192">She was traveling around to find family.</span> <span id="s2193">While I was in Paris, she went around looking for friends, for brothers, sisters, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: You mean, for your family or for others as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: For us!!!</span> <span id="s2196">For our family!!!</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Oh, for your family.</span> <span id="s2198">She had been in Israel, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: No.</span> <span id="s2200">She, after the liberation, went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2201">She was looking in different places.</span> <span id="s2202">She went to campsites looking for my brother and for another sister I had.</span> <span id="s2203">She had been traveling around for several months and finally she went back to Poland to see if she could maybe find them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: How many children were you in all, originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: And only two of you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: And you had one other brother and two other sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: No.</span> <span id="s2210">Two brothers and one other sister who did not survive.</span> <span id="s2211">So she after several months, or about one year -- you see, I didn’t hear immediately.</span> <span id="s2212">The answer to the card did not come back right away.</span> <span id="s2213">It came back about two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: But you were still there (at your Paris address)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Yes, I was still there.</span> <span id="s2218">I was living at the same address.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: And she had finally found the card and you got the answer that she was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: But you still didn’t go to meet her or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: No.</span> <span id="s2223">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2224">I did not want to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s2225">You see by that time, she wanted to get out of Poland.</span> <span id="s2226">There were pogroms in Poland and killings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: Well, it was going Communist too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2229">But they were killing Jews there at that time.</span> <span id="s2230">I didn’t want to take a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Still in 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2233">They had pogroms there and killed several.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Now they blamed the Jews for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s2236">They blamed Hitler for not killing all the Jews.</span> <span id="s2237">Since these who came back reclaimed their property, etc.</span> <span id="s2238">They had a demonstration and killed 140 Jews in one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q; This is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: After the war, sure.</span> <span id="s2241">In Paris there were demonstrations also against the Jews but they didn’t have any killings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2243">Everyone blamed their troubles on the Jews.</span> <span id="s2244">While they stood by and did nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: So, finally she (Murray’s sister) decided to get away from that and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2246">We had corresponded.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: Oh, she was able to get out of Poland then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: Eventually.</span> <span id="s2249">She was smuggled out, smuggled out!</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: She smuggled herself out.</span> <span id="s2252">She got married to another guy who survived the camps and they smuggled themselves to Israel through Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: They were both Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2255">Both.</span> <span id="s2256">So they smuggled themselves out and went to Israel.</span> <span id="s2257">I, ultimately went to the U.S. in 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: What made you finally decide to leave France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: First of all, I wanted to get away from Europe.</span> <span id="s2260">I didn’t feel safe there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: You really didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: No!</span> <span id="s2263">We were provided a comfortable life in Paris.</span> <span id="s2264">A nice social life amongst Jewish people with the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s2265">But in terms of a future, I didn’t want to settle there.</span> <span id="s2266">I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2267">Israel didn’t materialize so I went to the U.S. and then I suddenly changed my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: That is all right.</span> <span id="s2269">Let me clarify, once Israel was created you did think of going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2271">I did think of going there and then I got another idea.</span> <span id="s2272">We received packages from the U.S. and I received a package.</span> <span id="s2273">It was a doll from Susie Rothstein from Boston…and a note (which said) “I hope this will cheer you up as it did my father when he was over there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Really!</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: So I decided to come to see this Rothstein girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: So the children were just making a project of contacting the children who had survived the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2278">So I decided that I come here to the U.S. and investigate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: No, she had not given an address.</span> <span id="s2281">She just had put down a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Oh, in other words you came on your own?</span> <span id="s2283">Completely on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: No.</span> <span id="s2285">See, after we lived in Paris for several years, the money stopped flowing from the U.S.</span> <span id="s2286">The U.S. said – “Alright, we gave you enough…now you have to get your own job and support your own people.”</span> <span id="s2287">So, the school was terminated, because they didn’t have any money to support us and they told us “you better go to work now.”</span> <span id="s2288">The honeymoon was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Ha…yes, something like “we took care of you long enough.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: So the honeymoon ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: You didn’t have any trouble getting into the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Fortunately, we had some visitors from the State Department to our orphanage.</span> <span id="s2293">They offered us a visa if we wanted to come.</span> <span id="s2294">I was one of the youngsters who decided to go (to the U.S.).</span> <span id="s2295">Some of the (other) youngsters went to Argentina.</span> <span id="s2296">Some to Canada.</span> <span id="s2297">Some to different parts of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Who was settling you?</span> <span id="s2299">Who was handling the arrangements?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: You mean the U.S. State Department?</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: No Jewish organizations or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: But before I forget, what happened to the dental training…you never pursued that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Well, I came here.</span> <span id="s2307">I was six months in N.Y. and then I went to Minnesota.</span> <span id="s2308">It is interesting how I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: But first tell me about N.Y.</span> <span id="s2310">What were you doing in N.Y.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: I came to N.Y. and I had a friend who had come here several months earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: Was this 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: 1949 yes.</span> <span id="s2314">I had a friend who met me at the boat.</span> <span id="s2315">You know, he picked me up.</span> <span id="s2316">He had a job for me and within a couple of days I went to work in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: At that time no.</span> <span id="s2319">No, I didn’t know any English so I was working for several months and I went to night school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Was that high school level or college level?</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: No, high school just to learn English.</span> <span id="s2322">So, I got acquainted with a teacher, a Jewish teacher.</span> <span id="s2323">He said, “Murray, I am going across the country to California to see my sister, if you want to come (with me), it will cost you nothing and you will have a chance to see the country.”</span> <span id="s2324">I said, “when are you going?’</span> <span id="s2325">I picked up my 32 things and we were on our way to California.</span> <span id="s2326">This guy had another sister in Minneapolis and he stopped to see her.</span> <span id="s2327">In Minneapolis, we walked in at his sister’s and they started asking me questions.</span> <span id="s2328">A young lady talks to me and say, “I have a friend who looks like you and who comes from the same place you come from.”</span> <span id="s2329">And here was a fellow whom I roomed together in KZ (abbreviated for Konzentration Lager) -- I did not know that he was alive and he didn’t know that I was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: From camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yes, from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2332">Both of us were together, we bunked together.</span> <span id="s2333">Gabby Schulman…so, I did not go any further.</span> <span id="s2334">I stayed in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: And you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: I got a job for several months and then I decided to go to school.</span> <span id="s2337">I took a college entrance examination in Minnesota and went to school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: You didn’t have any problem getting into the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: You knew English by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A: By then I knew enough to converse…not a lot.</span> <span id="s2342">I had to work hard.</span> <span id="s2343">I wasn’t fluent (in English).</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: Were you living alone or with a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: I was living with a family at first and then I moved to the campus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Oh, you lived on the campus but you had no family there at all.</span> <span id="s2347">So you were in Minneapolis for all of your undergraduate work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Undergraduate.</span> <span id="s2349">I worked for the hospital and got three meals.</span> <span id="s2350">I served meals to the patients in the mornings.</span> <span id="s2351">I also got a room where I took care of the house.</span> <span id="s2352">You know cut the lawn and such I got the room free.</span> <span id="s2353">So I worked my way through school that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: So how many years were you in Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: I was in Minneapolis for ten years.</span> <span id="s2356">I got my BA there, then I worked for a couple of years, then I went for my Master’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: What was your BA in, what was your major?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: Bachelor of Business Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: OK, and then your Master’s was in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: Master’s in Social Work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: OK, you then went into social work, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Then I got a year to finish my PH.D in social work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Was that all at the University of Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Yes, all at the University of Minnesota.</span> <span id="s2365">Then I worked for year to law school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: A PH.D in Social Work, by the way, is not a very common degree is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Not many people go on toward their PH.D in social work.</span> <span id="s2369">It is unusual!</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Yes, I had a job for Juvenile Probation for the Domestic Court.</span> <span id="s2371">And I had to know the language.</span> <span id="s2372">I did marriage counseling.</span> <span id="s2373">Then my boss told me that I should know a little about attorneys.</span> <span id="s2374">I should take a course in law, so I took a course in law.</span> <span id="s2375">I liked it so I completed law school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Was that at the University of Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: No, I started one year and then I met my wife and I moved to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: She was from Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Where did you meet her…in Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: No, I met her in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: You were in N.Y. at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Yes, for a visit you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Did someone introduce you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2386">I was in a family.</span> <span id="s2387">You see, I stayed with this family when I first came.</span> <span id="s2388">I visited them again when I was in N.Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Oh, in N.Y. and they introduced you to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: And she was from Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: So you moved to Cincinnati then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: Did you have a job right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: Yes, right away.</span> <span id="s2397">Actually I secured the job before I moved and got married.</span> <span id="s2398">I finished law school at Chase.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: You started law school at the University of Minnesota, one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: And then when did you come to the Dayton area?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: I came to Dayton in 1970, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: You were in Cincinnati at the time so you just ended up right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: I think that we have gone into some other questions I may have liked to ask about your life upon arrival.</span> <span id="s2406">You didn’t feel that you had any particular problem with language even though you knew no English when you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: Oh, I still have a problem with the language.</span> <span id="s2408">I have been able to communicate.</span> <span id="s2409">I worked hard at it.</span> <span id="s2410">I read a lot.</span> <span id="s2411">It didn’t come easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Here is a good question?</span> <span id="s2413">Did you get aid in getting established?</span> <span id="s2414">It seems to me that in most places you made your own way…most of the time.</span> <span id="s2415">You had people who helped you and who were friendly to you but no more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: Yes, I did not get much help except that for graduate school I had a scholarship.</span> <span id="s2417">Then in 1956, I went to Israel to pick my sister down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: You went to Israel in ’56 and brought her to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: You see, I graduated from University to save up enough money to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: You presently work at Wright-Patterson AFB.</span> <span id="s2421">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: What is your position there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: I am an attorney with the Logistics Command.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: The principal language spoken at home is English, of course.</span> <span id="s2426">That is what it asks for down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: All right, here are some specifics.</span> <span id="s2429">We got into this before but this is for the records.</span> <span id="s2430">How often, if at all, do you attend synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: I am conducting services here once a month for the South of town community.</span> <span id="s2432">(At this time, this was a branch of Temple Israel and later became Temple Beth Or).</span> <span id="s2433">So I am active here…so I guess I attend pretty often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: But you used to attend every Friday at Temple Israel on Salem Ave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2436">Of course, when services are here.</span> <span id="s2437">Temple conducts services here (in the South) once a month we attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Would you say that your primary association is with Jews or non-Jews?</span> <span id="s2439">Or would you say that it is equally divided.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: Primarily with Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: But in working at Wright-Patterson, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: I am the only Jew in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: In the Operations Office?</span> <span id="s2444">But there are numerous Jews working at Wright-Patterson at the base.</span> <span id="s2445">I mean both military and civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: Yes, of course, but in the legal office I am the only Jew.</span> <span id="s2447">We have about fifty attorneys and I am the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: Really!</span> <span id="s2449">I knew a fellow who used to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: Yes, I know…do you mean Beaty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: No, I knew Goldfetter.</span> <span id="s2452">He was here many years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: Well, an interesting sidelight I would like to tell you.</span> <span id="s2454">You know last year, when they showed the Holocaust (the TV series) and I was on TV making a presentation of some of the reactions to the film, etc.</span> <span id="s2455">A woman made a very sophisticated and intelligent comment and she got friendly with me.</span> <span id="s2456">About one week later she came in and said, “Murray, I have great admiration for you.</span> <span id="s2457">I will show you on TV.</span> <span id="s2458">Last Sunday we prayed for two things for you.”</span> <span id="s2459">I said, ‘what did you pray?”</span> <span id="s2460">One is that you forgive the Christians for what they did to you and the other is that you make a success at your job and that you become a good Southern Baptist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s2462">Here are a few specifics -- are you active in anything that is civic…such as groups of any kind?</span> <span id="s2463">For instance, association of the arts or music outside of religious organizations?</span> <span id="s2464">Anything you can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: I am on the Board of Jewish Education.</span> <span id="s2466">I have been on the Board of Health.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: One of those community boards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2469">And Health programs.</span> <span id="s2470">I have been on the Board of Sinclair Community College but since at Wright-Patterson you are limited as to where you may participate (regulation about participating in partisan political organizations).</span> <span id="s2471">I gradually got out of it.</span> <span id="s2472">I have not been active in the bar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: I know that you have never gone back to Poland, which was one of the questions.</span> <span id="s2474">How often do you think about what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: Of course, with the normal daily activities here you are busy with your life.</span> <span id="s2476">You don’t consciously sit and think about it.</span> <span id="s2477">But, nonetheless, periodically, it pops up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Do you, for instance, ever dream about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2480">I have frequent nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: As you wake up and realize what you have been dreaming about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2483">Nightmares!!</span> <span id="s2484">I am repeatedly captured.</span> <span id="s2485">Captured in Russia.</span> <span id="s2486">Captured in a corner and shooting and scenes keep on popping up periodically.</span> <span id="s2487">Particularly when I am discussing this in anyway.</span> <span id="s2488">You know when I am talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: Have you ever thought about now, we are now getting to a specific thing I want to ask you: comparing your own children’s lives to yours.</span> <span id="s2490">The difference from your own.</span> <span id="s2491">Do you ever think about that?</span> <span id="s2492">How they are growing up as compared to the way you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Well, at the beginning, before I got married, when I was single, I had two ideas with which I was toying in my mind.</span> <span id="s2494">One was to perpetuate our family…on the other hand, I was thinking that maybe it is not kind to have children and to see them go through some of the brutality I went through.</span> <span id="s2495">Initially I was determined not to have any children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Let me tell you…I came across something the other day.</span> <span id="s2497">I don’t even remember where it was.</span> <span id="s2498">Possibly a woman survivor was with women who were talking and she said, “Each of us has got to have nine or ten children to make up for what happened to our people.”</span> <span id="s2499">But it is interesting what you are saying.</span> <span id="s2500">There could have been two contrary feelings about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: I have such contradictions.</span> <span id="s2502">You see, at the beginning, we thought that maybe we shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2503">Of course, she had different ideas.</span> <span id="s2504">When I was in a concentration camp, my thinking was once I get out if I ever get out, I go into the woods to be isolated.</span> <span id="s2505">I don’t want to have any contact with anybody.</span> <span id="s2506">I want to get away from everybody in the whole world…and live with the animals in the woods without any contact with anyone.</span> <span id="s2507">But after you get exposed to that French society with all the cultural activities and the social activities, it was quite different.</span> <span id="s2508">When the children were small and I held my children.</span> <span id="s2509">.</span> <span id="s2510">At times, I was very afraid that something should happen and that someone would come with a gun and grab them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Do you think that you are a overly protective parent?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2513">I think that is not true in my case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: As you know there has been a lot written lately about the children of the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: No.</span> <span id="s2516">that is not the case.</span> <span id="s2517">I think that the kids are relatively normal.</span> <span id="s2518">They lead a normal life.</span> <span id="s2519">In the process of raising the children, my wife is a little more permissive than I am.</span> <span id="s2520">I am somewhat stricter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: But of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: For example, my daughter is a 16 year-old girl.</span> <span id="s2523">She goes out at night.</span> <span id="s2524">We don’t tell her when she is to come (home).</span> <span id="s2525">The only thing we are unhappy is that she happens to be in a Christian environment, no Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s2526">We are concerned about it, she knows about our concern.</span> <span id="s2527">We hope that her ties are not going to be serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: Is she involved in (Jewish) youth groups, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2530">She goes with both the youth group of the Temple and with youth groups of Beth Abraham.</span> <span id="s2531">She even went to the Chebe Sheminar for a weekend with them…because we encourage it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: Well, that is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: But when parents have experienced as in my life…obviously I cannot say that my life and past don’t have an impact on my behavior.</span> <span id="s2534">(They have to try and balance it).</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: Do they ever ask you about it?</span> <span id="s2536">Are they aware of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: When they were very small and they asked, what is this number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: There on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2540">But when they got older they shy away from it.</span> <span id="s2541">For instance, Neil, he once took a course on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2542">I lectured on it.</span> <span id="s2543">He took a course several years ago and he didn’t want to hear any more about it.</span> <span id="s2544">They offered that course here and he said, no, he didn’t want to take it.</span> <span id="s2545">He knows as much as anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: We may never know what their real feelings are because they can’t explain it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Yes, for example., at the Temple last year I had a session with all the classes together.</span> <span id="s2548">I made a presentation (about the Holocaust).</span> <span id="s2549">I asked the teacher to excuse my kids, if they didn’t want to be there.</span> <span id="s2550">So, I asked them, I am going to be talking about my experiences.</span> <span id="s2551">Do you want to be there or not?</span> <span id="s2552">They both said no, but all of a sudden, while I was lecturing, I saw them out of the corner of my eye sitting in back of the auditorium, hiding.</span> <span id="s2553">I ordinarily don’t talk about it and never make any reference to it… to my experiences.</span> <span id="s2554">I don’t want to embitter their lives with my experiences.</span> <span id="s2555">But I feel personally that they have a normal, healthy life, in spite of my memories.</span> <span id="s2556">Of course, I don’t go around pitying myself all the time, either for what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Well.</span> <span id="s2558">Anybody could understand it, even if you did.</span> <span id="s2559">Okay.</span> <span id="s2560">There were two questions which should be answered before we go into a conclusion, that you had mentioned to me off the tapes.</span> <span id="s2561">They are really not questions but they pertain to the two conversations you had in 1945 shortly after you were liberated.</span> <span id="s2562">The woman first of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: The woman was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: OK, the German was right after Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: It took place in Buchenwald while I was there still.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Oh I see.</span> <span id="s2567">What did this man say.</span> <span id="s2568">He was prisoner as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: He also was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s2570">He portrayed himself as a Communist.</span> <span id="s2571">He said that he was a Communist leader.</span> <span id="s2572">He said that the “Jews paid a heavy price in all the tragedy.</span> <span id="s2573">You look German, you speak German, why don’t you come with me and forget that you are a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Otherwise sad, “forget your identity”, but you still wouldn’t be in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: Of course not.</span> <span id="s2576">Even today I don’t want to buy a German product.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">Q: There are people who cannot understand that by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: I don’t want to be fanatic about it.</span> <span id="s2579">I did not pursue much of the “Wiedergutmachung” (Financial compensation for damages done by the Nazis) because I have strong feelings.</span> <span id="s2580">I don’t want them to pay off for my parents and for the other members of my family.</span> <span id="s2581">How can I struggle for so many years and almost give up my life and settle the accounts that way.</span> <span id="s2582">I didn’t have any hate against the non-Jews, because they are the crazy people, which in their letters and their songs, copies of which I have…they express that it is not us but they who are the crazy people.</span> <span id="s2583">So we have to save them.</span> <span id="s2584">We have to educate them and they are the ones (who need the cure).</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: You would not buy the arguments some of them make that you brought this upon yourself, etc.</span> <span id="s2586">That is obviously wrong, but then I have seen results of public opinion surveys taken right after the war or even before the war when people said that the Jews brought this upon themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Tape three starts here and it appears not to follow straight away from the previous one so no attempt is being made to provide a transition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: I have been faced many times with the question why did so many Jews allow themselves to be arrested and butchered.</span> <span id="s2589">Now to answer this question we have to understand, first of all, the context of the mind of the majority of the Europeans, in general, or the Jews in particular.</span> <span id="s2590">We are conditioned against violence, guns are something strange frightful objects.</span> <span id="s2591">You are not allowed to use them.</span> <span id="s2592">The only person who could handle a knife was a mohel, you couldn’t use it except for a holy purpose.</span> <span id="s2593">This is part of our culture.</span> <span id="s2594">We couldn’t understand that someone else would use it.</span> <span id="s2595">Now the other part is, besides from our cultural conditioning, is that the Germans had taken a scientific approach.</span> <span id="s2596">They used modern psychology and technology to dehumanize.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: You are one who can completely understand that now you get a very much better perspective of the whole thing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: As I said they begin to dehumanize.</span> <span id="s2599">How did they do it…they used the plan of deprivation, first of all you deprive them of all outside influences…then you starve them.</span> <span id="s2600">Now, if I would ask anybody if he has suffered, did you fast one day -- Yom Kippur?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: Yes, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: How did you feel at 5: P.M.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q: Pretty hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: What do you think, with what is your mind occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: With food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Now suppose you go on with that day after day and day after day!</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: That is why, Murray, I can’t understand why anyone survived that hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Nothing else…even if the physical body can take it but psychologically you get messed up.</span> <span id="s2609">You cannot control your thinking.</span> <span id="s2610">Your flow of thought is completely preoccupied.</span> <span id="s2611">What to put into your mouth.</span> <span id="s2612">You don’t care about danger…you don’t care about being killed.</span> <span id="s2613">It is an irony----you risk your life in order to survive.</span> <span id="s2614">If you would say to a hungry person who has not eaten for a couple of three or four days…”You go there and we might give you bread”…you could see five thousand people in line, waiting.</span> <span id="s2615">Now what are they waiting for…for their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: You mean that it wasn’t just those showers, they could have been told that there is food there or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: That was their motto.</span> <span id="s2618">They said a piece of bread…if they give them a piece of bread they go in there.</span> <span id="s2619">Sure they lured them in.</span> <span id="s2620">Of course, and then watching while they eat the piece of bread…lo and behold somebody got a bigger piece, so they dropped to the level of an animal as far as functioning mental capacity.</span> <span id="s2621">Very few could foresee and those who could foresee didn’t have the physical strength to do something about it.</span> <span id="s2622">You couldn’t do anything about it…just let me give you a simple example about this.</span> <span id="s2623">During the war with Japan, on some of the islands there were 12 Japanese soldiers who controlled an army of 25 thousand American prisoners.</span> <span id="s2624">Why didn’t they resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Is that true?</span> <span id="s2626">I know of no such incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: Yes, a colonel told me, that is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q: Oh, they only had 12 men guarding the whole army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A: 12 men guarding 25 thousand American prisoners, because they were starved, they were degraded, they were driven for days without food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Diseased too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: And that is what they did.</span> <span id="s2632">They only wanted to save every bullet.</span> <span id="s2633">They planned to minimize the possibility of resistance.</span> <span id="s2634">Like the German who said -- when he talked in the market square in Lodz, ‘we need you, we want you, bring your dishes because we don’t have any.</span> <span id="s2635">We need you.</span> <span id="s2636">You are the best support of the Germany.</span> <span id="s2637">We don’t want you to go to the Russians.</span> <span id="s2638">Please come with us, you get a big bread.”</span> <span id="s2639">Even the doubters, the strong people who were skeptic are beginning to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: Well, the mass will go along, that is mass psychology too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: This is part of the tragedy.</span> <span id="s2642">Then they trap you in such a way that you are overwhelmed with technical equipment…with and with electricity, etc.</span> <span id="s2643">The second point is if you risked a resistance and kill a German you are not only risking your life but they arrest the entire community.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: What do they kill ten for one or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Hundreds for one.</span> <span id="s2646">Whoever was present, they kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: Yes, yes, we had this discussion last Sunday, about the bombing.</span> <span id="s2648">Would you think that you would have been better off if the camps were bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s2650">We probably would have been killed.</span> <span id="s2651">The only thing, we were hoping was, that if the area around the camp was bombed, that maybe we would be able to run away en masse.</span> <span id="s2652">Because, around Auschwitz we heard that there were partisans, so we could have run away to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: That is a question which was not even brought up.</span> <span id="s2654">Were there ever any forces which made effort to attack the camps, such as partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: They stayed away from them, the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: The people from inside would have tried to make the breaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: I mean, there weren’t, like partisan armies who tried to liberate you even?</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: No.</span> <span id="s2660">We heard that there were partisan armies.</span> <span id="s2661">Jewish partisans as well as non-Jews but not inside or trying to break in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: That would have been interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: The only thing.</span> <span id="s2664">When the Russians bombarded the place where we worked, we were hoping that they bomb the camp at night and smash the electricity.</span> <span id="s2665">Then there would have been no light and we could have run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: You never heard of any mass escape like thousands who made an attempt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: No, nothing but individuals.</span> <span id="s2668">Only some individuals who bought their way out.</span> <span id="s2669">Not many, maybe one or two.</span> <span id="s2670">The largest group were the five people which included Chaim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: They just bribed their way out?</span> <span id="s2672">They didn’t actually escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: Yes, they bought their way out.</span> <span id="s2674">They were in supplies where they had an opportunity to get things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Wasn’t it dangerous for the German guards to take bribes?</span> <span id="s2676">Didn’t they risk their lives if they were caught accepting bribes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: But if you gave them a bribe how did you get a guarantee that they would ever live up to their commitment?</span> <span id="s2679">Did you just take a chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: They could kill you.</span> <span id="s2681">They could kill you just as they did with the girls.</span> <span id="s2682">I ran into a girl prisoner in camp.</span> <span id="s2683">It was in Buna.</span> <span id="s2684">There were a group of girls who came to us.</span> <span id="s2685">And you can guess what they did to the girls.</span> <span id="s2686">They picked the nice looking girls, they raped them and then they shot them.</span> <span id="s2687">You know they promised that they would take them out, and then they just shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: We may already have covered what your message would be but I just want to get on record that other conversation.</span> <span id="s2689">The one with the woman in France.</span> <span id="s2690">Please tell us about this now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: All right.</span> <span id="s2692">When I just was in the Lutestia Hotel (there is such a hotel with 305 rooms located at 43 Blvd Raspull Paris VI).</span> <span id="s2693">When we first arrived, you know where they expected the infants and the little children.</span> <span id="s2694">A woman came and looked around, she was looking for her son who must have been about my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Was she Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: No.</span> <span id="s2697">She was a Frenchwoman.</span> <span id="s2698">She started screaming, “Why are you here.</span> <span id="s2699">My son isn’t there…he looked like you!”</span> <span id="s2700">I must have resembled her son.</span> <span id="s2701">She must have been shocked, maybe, I looked somewhat like her son and she had been hoping.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: Did they take her away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: No.</span> <span id="s2704">She calmed down.</span> <span id="s2705">You know there were nurses who were talking to her in French, which I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2706">It was a heartbreaking scene.</span> <span id="s2707">A lot of people came there inquiring about children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Do you want to give some thought to what you would say in concluding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: The things which seem to me, which I have learned through this tragedy is that man is a creation with a lot of weaknesses, a lot of frailties.</span> <span id="s2710">He is strong in his desires and often weak in his capabilities.</span> <span id="s2711">Some are capable to rise above mediocrity but the majority are capable of both.</span> <span id="s2712">To be brutal people and good people.</span> <span id="s2713">It will depend upon the condition they are in and on the occasion.</span> <span id="s2714">I think that a civilized, intelligent people should be constantly aware of this.</span> <span id="s2715">Whenever the sign of fanaticism, whether it is from the right or from the left, appears we should resist it from the beginning, in order to avoid such tragedies.</span> <span id="s2716">It is not impossible for such a tragedy to happen again…whether it is against Jews or Cambodians or anybody else.</span> <span id="s2717">As a civilized people we should constantly be aware of such fanatics, wherever they are, from the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: Do you believe that the world really learned a lesson from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s2720">You see the progress we have made.</span> <span id="s2721">This is something which you brought up in our informal conversation without tape.</span> <span id="s2722">When there was a ship of Jews --mainly children -- wandering around for two months on the high seas, no country wanted to take them in.</span> <span id="s2723">So they got destroyed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2724">Look what happened to the escapees now.</span> <span id="s2725">We send planes to pick up Cambodian children.</span> <span id="s2726">When was it about one year ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Yes, that was maybe only because the United States was directly involved in all of this tragedy.</span> <span id="s2728">I wonder how we would react elsewhere.</span> <span id="s2729">For instance, what has the world done lately for Africa, for instance.</span> <span id="s2730">People are starving there regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: Whether we are involved with it or not.</span> <span id="s2732">See the Cambodians, we try to accommodate them and bring them in.</span> <span id="s2733">We have a great sympathy for the Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s2734">They put a little pressure on to help us.</span> <span id="s2735">They probably wouldn’t get out without the American Jews.</span> <span id="s2736">I think that we have made some progress.</span> <span id="s2737">Also, I feel it and therefore, I like this country and I am grateful to be here.</span> <span id="s2738">Let me give you an example.</span> <span id="s2739">At the beginning of the time when I was here.</span> <span id="s2740">When I first came, they wanted me to go to Korea.</span> <span id="s2741">I told them that is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2742">I came here to live not to die.</span> <span id="s2743">If I have to be in Korea so I will go back to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: Were you ever in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: No, they wanted to take me and induct me.</span> <span id="s2746">I told them quite frankly, rather than go into the army, I go back where I came from and take care of things there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">Q: Were you a citizen?</span> <span id="s2748">(Prior to the change in the law after the end of WWII fighting you had to be either a U.S. citizen or have taken out your first papers to be inducted into any of the U.S. armed services).</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: They take non-citizens also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: I mean you were not a citizen of the U.S. yet at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2752">So I was reluctant to go into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: I was fed up with the military.</span> <span id="s2755">As a matter of fact I was so afraid that if I saw a military uniform on one side of the street I go to the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: Were you actually drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: I was called for induction, for examination.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2759">Did you pass the physical?</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: They gave me a 4F (classification as physically unable to serve).</span> <span id="s2761">I don’t know if I passed the physical (obviously no one explained what 4F meant).</span> <span id="s2762">I didn’t care to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: I would think that you would have some kind of exemption.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Well, maybe they gave me an exemption but I wasn’t interested in going into the Armed Forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Well there was something with your eyes too, remember?</span> <span id="s2766">You may not have passed the physical.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: But later on, for instance, in the middle 50’s, when Sen. Joseph McCarthy was messing around again, I was frightened.</span> <span id="s2768">I thought that they would first go after the Communists, and the next time it would be against the Jews!</span> <span id="s2769">But I was very proud that the American people got together enough to get him the “hell” out of there!</span> <span id="s2770">So I started gaining confidence…actually regaining my confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: Do you believe that this society is really unique?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2773">That this society is unique and that it can withstand the test.</span> <span id="s2774">But again, of course, you cannot expect courage from everybody.</span> <span id="s2775">When it comes to a showdown between others and the Jews, I know that we will be the victims.</span> <span id="s2776">But, we are a political force, in this country, and we particularly should be constantly on the guard that no fanatics take hold and try to run this country and rule over the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">Q: If you had still lived in France, as an example, as you did for a while and the incidents of anti-communism are not uncommon, would you feel particularly uncomfortable when that developed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: I was very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2779">I saw it.</span> <span id="s2780">That is why I wanted to get away from France.</span> <span id="s2781">I wanted to get away from Poland.</span> <span id="s2782">The repeated outbursts you heard, for instance, I was watching where a street peddler -- a French peddler --with some food to sell, and a policeman attempted to chase him away…you know, give him a ticket, the peddler said, “If I were a Jew, you wouldn’t bother me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: That is what he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Yes, so this type of anti-Semitic remarks bothers me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Yes, it is a tradition there, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2786">I mean there are other societies though where you might think that you would feel comfortable or maybe not?</span> <span id="s2787">The U.S. is so unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: I wouldn’t want to take any chances anyway.</span> <span id="s2789">Maybe Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: Have you thought about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: Yes, but you can’t compare it.</span> <span id="s2792">I mean that you still can’t compare it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: Oh, you have been there before, I mean that you have been there several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: We still think about it from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: Oh good!</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Well, eventually I hope that we will go.</span></p></body></html>
