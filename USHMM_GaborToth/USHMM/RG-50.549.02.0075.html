ago about where we would start this interview, and I would like to ask you if you could tell me if there is anything that you would like to go back over from your original interview, to add to it.</span> <span id="s20">Maybe there’s some new information that you’ve come across, or do you want to -- I’m talking in generalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Not specific issues, specific dates or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: But is there a-any -- any information that you’ve come across about your years before, say 1945 that you’d like to add to that original interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Before 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: More or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was going to -- to go over the last part of my interview for the first person, where I stopped with the arrival in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: And to go over that, a-as we -- I left Cyprus, and f -- January first of 1948 -- ’49, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s30">December ’47 -- January first, 1949.</span> <span id="s31">We arri -- we proceeded from Cyprus on a small fishing boat that came from Israel with permit to fish in Turkish waters, which is the northern part of Cyprus, and by prearrangement with the help of the Greeks on the island, th-the ship -- th-the fishers-man came close to the northern edge of Cyprus, with flashlights and signs and inflatable boats.</span> <span id="s32">They picked us up from the shore where the Greeks brought us and put us on that fishing boat named Karishe, and took us to Israel.</span> <span id="s33">Over there the British were still controlling the Haifa port, and we had to find a place where to land, which was in Netanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: How many people, roughly?</span> <span id="s35">I mean -- and how long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: It -- it was about 80 - 90 people, because the exits or the escapes from the Cyprus camps were arranged of -- consisted of eight to 10 people per night.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Once outside, the Greeks would pick us up and take us into an orange grove by the warehouse and lock us up there, so all day we could not come out, but at night they would come open the doors and we roamed somehow, in the orange grove.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Hold on one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Okay, the fishing boat dropped us off on Netanya.</span> <span id="s41">They have -- two buses waited for us with food, clothes, blankets, whatever we could use, and took us 12 or 15 mile eastward, right across from Netanya, a pla -- a place called Baykleet.</span> <span id="s42">That was a -- a place where -- of induction to the im -- Israeli army.</span> <span id="s43">As a former Cyprus senior officer in the Haganah, I was immediately put in charge of inducting a-all sorts of newcomers with my several languages that I spoke, Romanian, Hebrew, French and some German, I was able to make the proper arrangements for these youngsters and keep them there for a while.</span> <span id="s44">The policy was that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what their future plans are, and send them to units where they could begin into that line of work.</span> <span id="s45">I was kept there til March the 15th or eight -- 16th, and as I ex-expressed my desire to study medicine, I was assigned to a military hospital.</span> <span id="s46">Was a formerly British hospital, and the hospital was called Tel HaShomer.</span> <span id="s47">Tel Levinsky that became Tel HaShomer.</span> <span id="s48">And that’s where I spent my next 30 month in Israel.</span> <span id="s49">At this hospital I was supposed to be a -- every two month at a different, or a specialty wards, but I started at orthopedics, and s-so -- liked it so much that I stayed there all the time.</span> <span id="s50">Orthopedics and paraplegics.</span> <span id="s51">And it was enough t-to come in contact with Israeli veterans or wounded soldiers, to become so convinced that -- of our righteous battle.</span> <span id="s52">All they wanted, these amputees and paraplegics, they wanted to get well so they can go back to the front and fight again.</span> <span id="s53">Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And you would talk with them, and you would talk with them about these things, not just about their -- their injuries?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: -- of course.</span> <span id="s58">That’s what kept them alive, the hope to get better, for a purpose.</span> <span id="s59">The same time we had new immigrants from Arab countries that -- that were so deprived of medical attention that some of them were absolutely paralyzed, or -- or -- they couldn’t function.</span> <span id="s60">One particular case I remember, a young kid that would walk only on four, knees and hands and he was brought to us from Yemen [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s61">And, smart little kid, but he just couldn’t walk, and ma -- Dr. Goldman called me and had a little talk with me that if I agree and go along with him to do what he asks me to, I would -- we could make that child walk again.</span> <span id="s62">And we talked to -- the first thing he said, the first problem I have is you have to sleep with him, in the same room.</span> <span id="s63">And during the days we’ll operate and at night he is all yours.</span> <span id="s64">So within a short period of time we realized -- we obtained that we -- we realized that, and the child started walking with crutches and [indecipherable] but ultimately he walked with one cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: That’s just one example.</span> <span id="s67">Other examples were that many of the high officers in the military came to that hospital for injuries in the back and the knees.</span> <span id="s68">I remember [indecipherable] Long was one of the patients, I guess, Dayan and some other big officers as well, as Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s69">What was his name, he was involved in the Warsaw ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s70">Not [indecipherable] Levitz, but his deputy.</span> <span id="s71">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s72">So, that’s where I spent three month in Israel, during which time my family started coming ba -- over from Romania in 1949.</span> <span id="s73">My sister came, married, with her child.</span> <span id="s74">In 1950 my parents arrived and in 1951 my other sister.</span> <span id="s75">One brother stayed in Romania til 1959 and ha -- arrived later.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Were you helping all of them, were you making it possible for them to come, or did they have some connections of their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s78">They personally initiated and arrived in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And when you were working in this hospital for 30 months, that’s almost three years, did you intend to stay in Israel that whole time?</span> <span id="s80">Was it your intention to go to school there and -- and try and make a life in Israel, or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: That was your idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: In fact, 12 - 13 or 15 hours a day that I u-used to work brought me to exhaustion and the doctors would send me to Jerusalem for 10 - 15 days of R and R. And those days I would visit the university, which was then at [indecipherable] a big Catholic school that was changed -- was given to the university for beginners and just visitor -- visiting students.</span> <span id="s86">That was part of the R and R in Jerusalem, so that after two years of compulsory military in the hospital, they asked me to stay longer, and I stayed another six months, to make it into 30 months service.</span> <span id="s87">And that was the end of 1951 already, that I realized that the university in Jerusalem had no medical school or no beginning of medical school.</span> <span id="s88">They had many students that started out abroad, and only with the third year they would start them in the hospital, supervised by famous doctors and this way progress towards graduation.</span> <span id="s89">But the first two years they couldn’t have, they needed dissections.</span> <span id="s90">The Orthodox Jews wouldn’t allow Jews to be dissected.</span> <span id="s91">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And you needed those first years.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You had -- you hadn't had that yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What -- u-up until this point what -- what kind of education did you have, what -- equivalent to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: In Europe and Romania, I graduated from high school with a baccalaureate it’s called, a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s98">And realizing all this and being in correspondence with a brother I had in Detroit, who arrived there in 1946, maybe ’47, I cannot pinpoint it, but I corresponded with him and explained the condi -- situation and he brought up the idea of coming here.</span> <span id="s99">And I liked it, and I prepared for it in a sense.</span> <span id="s100">I started all the necessary arrangements for going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Even though your family was coming over from Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, they all agreed that it’s rough, tough, and I’m still young to recoup, or recover.</span> <span id="s103">So, late in 1951, I started the preparations or investigations into -- for going to America.</span> <span id="s104">Immediately I got me a English teacher, for more -- better English.</span> <span id="s105">I started the passport applications and visas for the Americans.</span> <span id="s106">First they indicated I get the visa and get to America and there si -- approach the college.</span> <span id="s107">Then they informed me that no, it’s the other way around.</span> <span id="s108">First you have to be accepted by a school in the United States, and on that basis we can grant you a visa for a student.</span> <span id="s109">In Detroit my brother had a brother-in-law who was a professor at Wayne State University, and he made all these arrangements on the basis of that high school diploma and obtained from them a letter that I am accepted for the semester beginning on September 12 or so, 1952.</span> <span id="s110">But nothing was ready in Israel for me to go.</span> <span id="s111">So I visited the American embassy, undergo -- went a test in English.</span> <span id="s112">All arrangements began to s -- to -- to shape up to the point where I received a visa and we bought a ticket at TWA and started my trip on November the second of 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Before you went, your parents had already come?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: 1950 they arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: They had already come, and your -- had brothers and sisters there.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Was it a -- difficult for you to go?</span> <span id="s118">Was it a wrenching, emotionally, to leave?</span> <span id="s119">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: It had to be, but they themselves were in bad shapes, really.</span> <span id="s121">All they could afford or find were very limiting -- limited housing conditions.</span> <span id="s122">The first sister that came in ’49 had a one room apartment.</span> <span id="s123">It’s the same room with -- 1950 my parents arrived -- had to stay with them for awhile.</span> <span id="s124">Then the parent moved out and the other sister arrived.</span> <span id="s125">When her husband realized what’s going on, he took off into the desert, to B’eyr-Sheva, and there he found all they wanted.</span> <span id="s126">A lot of work -- he was in the building area, the building business, and he build up th-the Negev, the desert, all the way to the Dead Sea, kibbutzim and so on.</span> <span id="s127">So slowly, slowly things settled in Israel, but my going was part of their settlement and after leaving the hospital and [indecipherable] to take off for America, I was unemployed -- oh, no, I worked for the [indecipherable] right in Jaffa, where my parents lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: I don’t know what that is, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The [indecipherable] is the organization of all the Yishuvim, of all the Israeli kibbutzim and moshavim and all sorts of settlements, they are the government’s arm that supplies them with administration and also money, funds for all the necessities.</span> <span id="s130">Ag -- agriculture implements, agricultural implements, modern agriculture -- tractors, plowshares, a-all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s131">And I worked there for four or five month.</span> <span id="s132">And -- while taking steps towards my leaving.</span> <span id="s133">The trip itself was problematic.</span> <span id="s134">At the time there were no straight flights --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Excuse me, before we go into the trip I want to ask you one more question about your time in Israel if you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You were there at a -- when the State of Israel was formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And you were there long enough, and -- I would think, to feel some identification with Israeli aspirations and because you m-met so many of these former soldiers and injured soldiers, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: -- and had conversations with them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: -- and you were a young man, and probably had some idealism.</span> <span id="s144">Did -- did you feel a -- Israeli a-at that point?</span> <span id="s145">Did you feel like you were giving up something, or did you think you were going to come back, or was there any issue there for you of -- of -- of identity with the Israeli cause?</span> <span id="s146">Or were you just so focused on getting your education and that, i-it was a side --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: The European experience plus the Cyprus retention of our going -- one year in Cyprus was enough to -- to store up venom, or -- or ambition to get out, do something more.</span> <span id="s148">And I did all I could during these 30 month, that’s why I stayed longer, because I saw what is needed.</span> <span id="s149">But at that point I realized that there’s very little I can do at the higher level, that I can do there, even though I travel and toured and visited all that historic places, and the military places where famous battles took place.</span> <span id="s150">Traveled the country it -- north and south, a lot to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s151">And more and more I became convinced that if I stay at that point, I can work at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s152">I spent some time in Jerusalem taken just a biolo -- biology classes, more or less unrelated to medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Mm-hm, but you weren't going to become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I did at that point -- more personally I was sure, or felt I can do a lot for these wounded people.</span> <span id="s155">And all my superiors at the hospital called me Dr. Haim and they thought I could make -- I would make a big -- a good doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s157">So, i-i-it was this very strong drive that you had to be a doctor and you -- and that wasn’t going to happen if you stayed around.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: No, it was not going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Reality came in the first week in America, that in America you don’t just go to medical school from high school as you do in Romania, as my wife went for -- at the age of 17 she went to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: In America you go into pre-med, and that takes four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, geez.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: And after that, if you push and qualify -- I kept applying for medical schools.</span> <span id="s165">So I -- I started this four year of pre-med, and I started liking it because at Wayne University -- number one, I arrived in November the fourth or fifth, into a semester that started September 15.</span> <span id="s166">And it was way up above my possibilities to catch up and do any good.</span> <span id="s167">S-So they put me into an English for foreign students, which is for no credit and it doesn’t matter how well you do.</span> <span id="s168">I was able to do very well, especially in the writing, and I had to take a class on government, which was totally strange to me.</span> <span id="s169">One -- in the -- in history, but European history, it was easy for me.</span> <span id="s170">And from November til January the 15th or 20th, when the semester ended, that was a real killer.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Frustrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s173">That’s the story of America.</span> <span id="s174">If I had the -- the money, I would have turned around and gone right back.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Back to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Back to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: In those first coup -- in those first few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: On the first half a year or one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Because it seemed like such a long --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Such a --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: -- impossibly long.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: -- difficult, difficult obstacles.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And money-wise, I did not come with money.</span> <span id="s185">My brother who came to pick me up and did all these things preparing for me, he was not well-to-do, and I felt very bad and very guilty and was ready to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s187">Let me -- let me turn this tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Haim Solomon.</span> <span id="s190">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s191">What -- you’re in Detroit now, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: -- late in the year in 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: You’re living with your brother.</span> <span id="s196">What did your brother do at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Really, clearly, I don’t know, but we had an uncle that had the business in Detroit, but he lived in New York, and so my brother, somehow, managed his businesses.</span> <span id="s198">Business was in the manufacturing of shuffleboard --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s200">Equipment?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: -- equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s204">Horrible, because some of these shuffleboards were installed in bars and in -- and I had to go with my brother and collect.</span> <span id="s205">If you know the shuffleboard, you open the box and you count the money and half goes to the bar, and half --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: They were -- so they were games?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Games.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Bar games --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: -- kind of.</span> <span id="s211">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s212">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: And people --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: And then you started full time taking classes in January --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: -- 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: That was be -- starting -- becoming a lot simpler and easier.</span> <span id="s218">In the meantime I -- I met some other Israeli students at the university.</span> <span id="s219">A lot of Jewish students came to us.</span> <span id="s220">Detroit had something called a ZOA house, the Zionist Organization of America house.</span> <span id="s221">And every weekend they would -- all the Zionists would meet there, but on weekends they would give it to us and we brought together all the Israelis and all the American Jewish students, and we sang, we danced, we ate, we fraternized.</span> <span id="s222">The whole atmosphere became warmer and more reliable, and more -- you could turn to any of these American students for orientation, for advice, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s224">So you started to feel more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Start to feel more comfortable.</span> <span id="s226">Classes were easier.</span> <span id="s227">At the university, every student is assigned to an advisor, and mine was a Dr. Theodoro.</span> <span id="s228">Dr. Theodoro was the daughter of the ambassador from Thailand and London.</span> <span id="s229">So he-her teacher was Chaim Weitzman.</span> <span id="s230">When I came to her with my name of Haim, she -- come from Israel, she caught me, you don’t want to study medicine, you want to study microbiology, because you’re going back to the Hebrew references of Chaim Weitzman and tell me more of what you did.</span> <span id="s231">He was her professor, but Chaim Weitzman worked with an organism, a bacterium that he forced into producing acetone.</span> <span id="s232">The bacterium is called Clostridium acetobutylicum Weitzmani.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Hm, named after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: The -- this organism, if you feed it whatever is good for -- it prefers, this bacterium, it produces acetone and butyl alcohol, or Vitamin B2.</span> <span id="s235">Chaim Weitzman was able to inhibit its second part production and en -- and encourage it to produce acetone, which the British needed in World War I. And for that he was rewarded with a Balfour Declaration.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Was he someone that you knew about?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: I know of his activities, and he was the first president of Israel, and very active in -- in the process of obtaining independence from Britain.</span> <span id="s240">But all this personal connection of this Dr. Theodoro with him, and now with me, indeed.</span> <span id="s241">So she guided me into microbiology.</span> <span id="s242">I took a lot of classes in it throughout the four year studies towards a Bachelor of Science.</span> <span id="s243">And just because I had such choices, I took all sorts of classes that I liked in psychology and logic.</span> <span id="s244">French.</span> <span id="s245">French was something that I knew well so I took classes in order to raise my grade average.</span> <span id="s246">Indeed, it worked.</span> <span id="s247">But she wanted me to work with that organism, but this time to do the opposite, inhibit its production of acetone and encourage its production of Vitamin B2.</span> <span id="s248">Very important in Asia and Europe, too.</span> <span id="s249">But that was for graduate school, later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Ah, in the meantime in Detroit, as I said, I began teaching Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: To various Hebrew or Jewish synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: To kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Such as Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue, and Temple Emmanuel, another Reform synagogue.</span> <span id="s256">Jews that wanted to be Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s257">That was my greatest disappointment, that Israelis, or Hebrew teachers that they had, locals, wouldn’t -- didn’t want to teach in Reform synagogues.</span> <span id="s258">And I was so mad, I went to st -- teach at the Reform.</span> <span id="s259">And I’m glad to this day that a lot of kids were so curious about their Jewishness, and whatev -- in -- in -- to the degree, or to th -- way beyond what they saw in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: They wanted to know more, and that’s what I was teaching them.</span> <span id="s262">Anyway, the second job [indecipherable] at Temple Emmanuel was part already of the United Hebrew Schools.</span> <span id="s263">In all of Detroit there were United Hebrew Schools.</span> <span id="s264">United Hebrew Schools you can be a teacher if you attend a Hebrew academy, or Midrasha to get a Hebrew teacher’s certificate.</span> <span id="s265">So you take some education classes at the university, and Hebrew classes at the Midrasha, and become a Hebrew teacher, a certified Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s266">And I did that.</span> <span id="s267">And also within the United Hebrew schools, with all the Israeli students that functioned as teachers, we had a group of -- a choir and dancers, and we would travel around all the small communities in Michigan, and perform for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: You did, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I did, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: You’re a singer?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: A singer, a dancer, everything, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Oh, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: -- to bring some Israeliskind they used to call it.</span> <span id="s274">In the summers I used to work [indecipherable] I was playing with the idea of going back.</span> <span id="s275">M-My brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Let’s take a break, just a second.</span> <span id="s277">[tape break].</span> <span id="s278">Okay.</span> <span id="s279">You were saying?</span> <span id="s280">You were starting to say something about your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s282">My brother was employed by the -- by our uncle, but it didn’t do much and his income was very limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s284">Did he have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: A wife, a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: And I was talking about leaving, because as a foreign student you’re not allowed to work, and it -- if they -- if you get -- you come up to a B average, you can get a permit for 10 - 12 hours a -- a week to work.</span> <span id="s288">So with my brother, we discussed this -- this, and the only arrangement [indecipherable] him is to go back to what he knows best, and that is to open a store, a dry goods store.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Just like in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Like in Romania, and I can work there unofficially.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Mm, cause you were living with him the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Only the first six months, maybe.</span> <span id="s293">And then I just moved to a family that rented out rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: One room, one.</span> <span id="s296">They usually would have one student.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s298">And did he do that?</span> <span id="s299">Did he open a store?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, he did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: He opened a store in 1953, late in ’53.</span> <span id="s303">And after classes I would go to the store, send him home to help in the house with the child.</span> <span id="s304">And that started opening up th-the possibility of doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Where was the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: In Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: On Third Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Was it downtown?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Close, not really.</span> <span id="s311">Close to downtown.</span> <span id="s312">And I worked very hard --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: -- and very nice, and the main business is on the weekend and so I could work for 12 hours and keep it [indecipherable] became very -- did very well, to the point where some years later it developed into a wholesale -- to a distributor -- distribution import and --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Of fabric?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Fabrics, shoes --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: -- and shoes.</span> <span id="s319">But ready-made pants, shirts, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s321">What was the name of the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, he bought it from another person called Bernstein, so everybody called us Bernstein’s.</span> <span id="s323">But Henry was a very smart fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: That’s hi -- is that your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s329">So you’re in school full time, you’ve been encouraged to study microbiology --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: -- which you did.</span> <span id="s332">You finished in four years?</span> <span id="s333">Did you finish in --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right, in fift --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: -- that’s pretty good.</span> <span id="s336">Working a lot, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: -- teaching on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Oh, yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So you didn’t have a free minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No.</span> <span id="s342">Really.</span> <span id="s343">But in 1956 I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in science.</span> <span id="s344">And in ’57, I started the graduate school, with this Dr. Theodoro, with the organism what -- that I mentioned.</span> <span id="s345">No need to mention it again.</span> <span id="s346">And we worked on it, and I took a trans -- graduate classes.</span> <span id="s347">We worked on it for six, eight months, when she received a Fulbright scholarship to go back to Oxford and study there with Dr. Krebs.</span> <span id="s348">Weitzman was no longer there.</span> <span id="s349">Famous name, Dr. Krebs.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Krebs cycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Krebs cycle, you heard of the Krebs cycle, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I have a book from that period, Dr. Krebs signature.</span> <span id="s354">So she went away and turned me over to another professor, Dr. Matman.</span> <span id="s355">This -- Dr. Theodoro was a physiologist of bacteria, and Dr. Matman was more of a clinical, so when she switched me to another thesis [indecipherable] but also with a organism that is anaerobic, lives in the absence of air.</span> <span id="s356">And what happened, the same, I worked in the store, I taught Hebrew, and attended classes.</span> <span id="s357">But in 1956, before she left, she made me into a laboratory assistant, and Dr. Rose -- Ross -- Rosen -- Gosen, he liked me, he wanted me as a laboratory assistant, but I couldn’t become an employee of the university without citizenship.</span> <span id="s358">And so within a few months he arranged my conversion into a green card American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: And throughout the graduate years, I was assistant in the laboratory, teaching the Hebrew at -- at -- evenings, working in the store, taking some summer classes, until 1961.</span> <span id="s361">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Let me ask you a question about those four -- four years or so, four or five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Detroit was a very melting pot.</span> <span id="s365">People had come there from --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: -- all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: And all over the U.S..</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Espe -- all over the south, to work in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: -- to work in the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: That’s where the store was.</span> <span id="s375">All those hillbillies --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: -- we called them, from the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: From the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: They --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: But also people from eastern Europe and --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: -- it’s a very mixed population there.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No.</span> <span id="s388">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: It was a fairly tolerant --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: -- place, did you feel, or was it because --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: -- I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: -- you were mix -- not mixing, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: -- functioned in the Jewish committee, either Israeli or local Jews.</span> <span id="s395">My brother belonged to a Hooc ivri, a Hebrew speaking group.</span> <span id="s396">They would meet once a month and have lectures in Hebrew and those were European that came, plus American scholars, rabbis, etcetera.</span> <span id="s397">I haven’t experienced any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s398">I-In school all the students and teachers were as nice and friendly and cooperative as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So you felt that th -- all the opportunities of any American were available to you as well at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And you knew other people who wa -- were survivors, I would take it, because you did exist in this community, and you knew other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: It’s amazing that -- how everybody locked up like a clam, and nobody spoke anything.</span> <span id="s403">Only now do I realize two brother from Polish origin, they studied at Wayne State University.</span> <span id="s404">They live here now.</span> <span id="s405">They went through real difficult times.</span> <span id="s406">They -- in Poland they realized all their dif -- what goes on there.</span> <span id="s407">So they ran away and lived in the woods with other partisans for months, for years.</span> <span id="s408">Right in the middle of German occupation.</span> <span id="s409">But we never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s411">There must have been a lot of people in Detroit with stories like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Like that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: People didn’t -- they just -- why didn’t they talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s415">To this day, I never talked about it, I never asked anyone to listen to -- to what happened.</span> <span id="s416">Just keep on going and advance.</span> <span id="s417">Forget the past.</span> <span id="s418">Some from Budapest that went through their difficulties, but Poland mostly was the most dangerous place that they came out alive.</span> <span id="s419">Still, we didn’t talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Like my wife said, I -- we -- we didn’t consider ourselves any survival -- survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s424">And knock on wood, due to my father’s administration, we came out, the whole family, intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Difficulties, dangerous conditions, but we came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s428">But you were also -- you were in a position to understand what other people had been through, and to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Of course, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- to know th-the dire sit-situation that they had come from, how difficult life was for them in the United States, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So it’s some un -- it’s interesting that people didn’t want to talk at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: But I guess understandable too.</span> <span id="s435">Just wanted to move ahead.</span> <span id="s436">They were young --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: -- and just looking at the future, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: -- struggling to get ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Almost embarrassed of -- of telling it, what happened, and it’s a Hebrew saying, we heard about you, we heard about you.</span> <span id="s442">When someone tries to tell of his past, th-the -- the -- the company would -- would ridicule you.</span> <span id="s443">Oh, we heard about your sufferings, we heard about your problems.</span> <span id="s444">In other words, don’t tell us any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: But you didn’t ac-actually experience that, you just sort of assumed that that’s what people were thinking, right?</span> <span id="s446">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s448">American Jews, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did -- did you have any experiences with American Jews, encounters with people that tal -- that revealed to you how little they knew about what had gone on in Europe, or how much they knew?</span> <span id="s453">Did you have a sense of how -- whether or not people were well informed about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: American Jews -- the community in Detroit for instance, shook off their responsibility.</span> <span id="s455">Whatever needed to be done was supposed to be done in New York.</span> <span id="s456">And indeed there was a strong organization in New York, the American Jewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress and -- and the -- some other organizations that were supposed to protest and they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I realize it now in the -- that the archives, what I translate, what they did, specifically for Romania --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: -- which I translate, and I realize that they were all active and influential.</span> <span id="s461">Actually they -- they traveled to Romania.</span> <span id="s462">Rabbi Weiss traveled to Romania in ’42 and ’43, when things were really bad there and confronted the leadership in Romania.</span> <span id="s463">But it didn’t help, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Hitler went on burning Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: But in Detroit you don’t think that there was much --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: -- activity along those lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I didn’t see anything, even though there were a few famous Jews that could have or should have done things.</span> <span id="s470">They had their own problems, probably in Detroit.</span> <span id="s471">You may have heard of Father Kaufman and Henry Ford and all their venom that they spewed out on Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Father Kaufman was a -- a radio --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: -- he was -- he had a radio program that was heard all over the country, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And he was giving sermons that were very --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: -- very right wing, was what we would call it today.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Very anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: For revenge we used to go to his church on Christmas night.</span> <span id="s482">If there were no places to s -- to sit, we would stand in the back and he was informed of our presence.</span> <span id="s483">Just -- but this was in 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: When you were a college student.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: So he himself tempered down already, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: ’52 or ’53 and ’54, two times we went to that church.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s489">So you’re -- we’re -- we -- you brought us all the way up to the late 50’s, you’re graduating.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Contemplating -- a-and you’re in graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: And you’re a lab assistant.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And wha -- where are we going from here?</span> <span id="s496">You’re still in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I was still in Detroit.</span> <span id="s498">I wanted to see the country here.</span> <span id="s499">So the summer of ’61, with another friend, we took -- we drove around 10 weeks.</span> <span id="s500">We drove around the United States, and stopped in all the parks in all the cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was that the first time you had traveled in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Well, during school years we would come for New Years to New York, drive -- driving a full car.</span> <span id="s503">That’s about all.</span> <span id="s504">Maybe we went to Chicago once for a wedding, one of our Israeli students [indecipherable] maybe th -- Jankela.</span> <span id="s505">But otherwise, we didn’t know the country and we had to really t-t-to integrate here, we need to travel around and see the whole place.</span> <span id="s506">Fascinating what America did.</span> <span id="s507">In 1961 or ’62, the University of Arizona at Tucson, in their catalog suggested that either they have it, or they’re going to open a faculty microbiology of arid lands.</span> <span id="s508">Very good for Israel, very good for south amer -- South America and ourselves.</span> <span id="s509">And that caught my attention.</span> <span id="s510">A friend of mine working at the U.N. suggested with my ability of languages and this kind of microbiology could really pick me up, bring me up.</span> <span id="s511">So I -- I applied there, I went there to find out that they don’t have it yet, they want to develop it, and I could help them, be part of it.</span> <span id="s512">I didn’t like it, but I was there already so I stayed for a year, and that’s where I --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And you were teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: -- accepted that position of Hebrew teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Director of -- they never had anything and there were a lot of New York Jews coming to live in Tucson, Arizona because of their children -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Haim Solomon.</span> <span id="s518">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s519">We may have lost a few seconds off the end of the last tape.</span> <span id="s520">You’re in Tucson, Arizona now.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And you’ve gone there and you’re going to help them start up this graduate program in microbiology, and you mentioned that there were many Jews there from New York, people who had come --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: -- in some cases because their children --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: -- had asthma, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: That’s why they came, that was the place where it’s so dry that the kids grew up very comfortably.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: But they needed some sort of Jewish education and I arrived there and they were very happy to bring them together.</span> <span id="s530">We had about 30 kids, and we would meet on Saturday and Sunday at a Kiwanis Club.</span> <span id="s531">There were very young kids that needed elementary Hebrew, but there were a few that needed preparation for Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: And so that -- those were my duties with this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: And I enjoyed it, I liked it, it gave me a sense of doing something in addition, cause with the schooling I didn’t see anything ready for me to proceed.</span> <span id="s536">So I took various classes in microbiology, chemistry, or whatever could be helpful for -- for the Ph.D. program.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: And at the end of the year I -- oh, I started that in September ’62 and by June I -- it -- September, but later on, for Passover, we drove back to Detroit from Tucson, two students from New York picked me up -- too -- dropped me in Detroit and they proceeded on.</span> <span id="s539">And while in Detroit for Passover vacation, or Easter vacation, I approached the University of Michi -- Michigan State University and explained to them why I don’t like it there, and what I’m willing to -- able to do, and certainly for the fall of that year, ’63, I would be accepted for -- at their university as a graduate student.</span> <span id="s540">And s -- exce -- I did exactly that.</span> <span id="s541">When the school year ended in June in Tucson, Arizona, I sold the car, packed up and came back to Detroit by train.</span> <span id="s542">Made -- started arrangements with -- at Michigan State University.</span> <span id="s543">Found a professor that thought I could help him with some of his projects, and so I started with the program towards a doctorate de-degree at Michigan State University.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: In Lansing.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: In Lansing, East Lansing.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Very interesting work.</span> <span id="s548">Now I started working with this Clostridium that I was familiar with, but this time with Clostridium botulinum.</span> <span id="s549">Famous bacterium that causes botulism --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: -- when consumed with canned foods or other foods.</span> <span id="s552">The question was -- Michigan was basically a dairy college or university and the question was whether this Clostridium botulinum would grow in milk.</span> <span id="s553">But the Clostridia have two kinds, one that spoils the milk and one that doesn’t spoil the milk, but they both produce a highly potent toxin.</span> <span id="s554">So my project was to work with the Clostridium botulinum type E, the one that does not curd the milk, and see whether it will grow at the refrigeration temperature, and -- before spoiling the milk.</span> <span id="s555">So we did a lot of work on that when suddenly s -- all around the Great Lakes, a large die off of seagulls were washed off o -- on the shore.</span> <span id="s556">And all over Michigan there were smokers that smoked fish and sold them open on the roadside in stores.</span> <span id="s557">But when the plastic -- plastics came out, they started packing these smoked fish in plastics, under vacuum, and that’s exact the conditions that promote growth of this bacterium --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: -- to the point where it produces toxin, and if it’s that type that doesn’t spoil the milk, it does not show any decomposition.</span> <span id="s560">So people would eat and become sick and die.</span> <span id="s561">There were quite a few deaths in Michigan due to these smoked fish pla -- packed in plastic bags.</span> <span id="s562">One particular case of three ladies having brunch together where they ate some such fish or tuna.</span> <span id="s563">And the next day two of them were dead.</span> <span id="s564">One was dead immediately, one died in the hospital, a third one survived.</span> <span id="s565">And the -- the FDA in Detroit was in charge of this case.</span> <span id="s566">But this was already late, in 1965, ’64, that two ladies died, one survived, and FDA in Detroit is investigating this case.</span> <span id="s567">Investigating means first thing go to their house and see what else there is there.</span> <span id="s568">They found a lot of cans and a lot of products that all had these toxin.</span> <span id="s569">Now the people in Detroit and the FDA didn’t have any idea of how or what to do.</span> <span id="s570">They went to Wayne State University, and at Wayne they told them, look, we have a -- we had a person qualified to talk to you, but he is now at Michigan State doing -- working exactly on the same general situation.</span> <span id="s571">So they came to Michigan State and there I showed them how to do, what to do, etcetera, etcetera, until my professor walks out of the laboratory and they said to me [indecipherable] person, he says Haim, you have to come and work for us.</span> <span id="s572">Forget this classes here, and come to us.</span> <span id="s573">And he kept coming every other week, every week and asking me, just don’t -- why won’t you come down to Detroit, see what we are talking about.</span> <span id="s574">So I did, after I talked to some other professors.</span> <span id="s575">And there he tells me, and I tell him what to do, he tells me what needs to be done.</span> <span id="s576">But when all is -- this is over, we need to do some other work with E. coli and salmonella and all such cases.</span> <span id="s577">And I say no, not for me.</span> <span id="s578">I’m strictly working with this Clostridium botulinum.</span> <span id="s579">So he calls up Washington and the division director asks him to talk -- to give me the phone to talk, and he talks to me about -- first he asks me are you married?</span> <span id="s580">No.</span> <span id="s581">Perfect.</span> <span id="s582">Smart [indecipherable] whatever he said.</span> <span id="s583">But he started enumerating the things that they want to do here.</span> <span id="s584">And they have -- just starting to organize one laboratory with -- and they have one person already from [indecipherable] Dietrich who worked on this and they are looking all over the country.</span> <span id="s585">So, really, they made me such offers I couldn’t refuse.</span> <span id="s586">Early in 1965, we -- I -- w-we arranged a meeting in New Jersey, a convention.</span> <span id="s587">And there I met with them and again, they emphasized all the possibilities, you know, the activities, and what we can do and what we need to do, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s588">And there I was fresh with this experience from Detroit and at Michigan.</span> <span id="s589">And -- and they thought I’m gonna open up the place for them.</span> <span id="s590">We started investigating, first of all the smoke-fish industry, which was completely closed down, FDA came out with a clear arrangement, every one of these small places that smoke fish, just by touching, and ba -- just estimating.</span> <span id="s591">Some arrangements were made with the banks, or with the department HHS, or -- for them to be compensated or bought out, and only a few large companies in Chicago and New York were allowed to take all these little places and develop a program that will assure a safe product.</span> <span id="s592">There was one incident, horrible incident.</span> <span id="s593">This smoked fish was tr -- sent out from Michigan to Kroger stores in the south, Tennessee, Arkansas.</span> <span id="s594">And the truck driver started out in Michigan, that suddenly the refrigeration broke down.</span> <span id="s595">When he realized it, it was already 10 - 12 hours, but he pulled into a garage and they started fixing it.</span> <span id="s596">Fixing it, cooled up the -- cooled off th-the truck and the products, and -- and proceeded to deliver the product cold, refrigerated, as though nothing happened.</span> <span id="s597">And the six or eight people that bought these fish, died.</span> <span id="s598">A lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s599">It was a Jewish tasting --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Smoked fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: -- product, smoked fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s603">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: They were beautifully yellow-bronze colored, and they were intact, now cooled, and you buy them, you eat them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Levys, and Cohens and five, six people died.</span> <span id="s607">And others were affected, but survived.</span> <span id="s608">And so I’m now an employee at the Food and Drug Administration.</span> <span id="s609">I came in 1965, the FDA was still located in the Department of Agriculture, the south building.</span> <span id="s610">Soon enough we moved into a new building on 200 C Street, southwest.</span> <span id="s611">It’s still in the 60’s and we are still involved with all sorts of outbreaks due to seafood products.</span> <span id="s612">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So you were able to do -- you were able to really do something important with your education, very [indecipherable] when you came to Washington, there was a great need for --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: -- for what you had studied.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So you must have felt gratified by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you have thoughts during these years that you were sorry you hadn’t studied to be an M.D.?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: It went out of your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No, because bacteriology became more meaningful, and the situation in the American food industry was such that many, many of the food establishments were functioning at a level very deleterious, or very inferior, or very business-oriented, but v-ver -- no regard to safety, and food safety.</span> <span id="s625">And all throughout the 60’s, they improved -- it’s called shelf life --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: -- of products that normally would decompose.</span> <span id="s628">Their main interest was to extend shelf life, extend profits and let -- let the consumer worry about safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: So that in the 60’s, really, we clean -- cleared out the fish industry, both the smoked fish, the prepared fish, even crawfish.</span> <span id="s631">Brought about rules and regulations that only the -- only the establishments that followed, and considered safety survived, or were allowed to continue, and all the others were restricted, and punished and forced out of their functions -- of their business.</span> <span id="s632">[interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: I’d like to ask you, it’s the mid-60’s and you are -- now have been in the United States 13 years, you came in ’52.</span> <span id="s634">And your parents and sisters and -- are in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Ar-Are you in touch with them the whole time, and -- and -- and how are their lives going and have you any regret about not being in Israel, or are you content that you’ve come to the U.S. at -- at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Content?</span> <span id="s640">While during the school years I was not so much in touch with them all, not corresponding sufficiently.</span> <span id="s641">Now that I was at work and I had evenings, so a normal life, more or less.</span> <span id="s642">I was in touch with them, I started visiting them almost every summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Starting when?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: In ’65.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: You went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: After I finished school I went to Israel and then came to FDA in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, in the meantime, they have reached better conditions and we corresponded; likewise my brother in Detroit advanced very nicely.</span> <span id="s649">So, in ’57 we brought our parents over here for five, six months.</span> <span id="s650">And in the meantime I would go there almost every summer.</span> <span id="s651">In addition to work h-here in FDA in the 60’s, I became very involved in Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s652">As I did in Detroit, I tried to teach Hebrew at the Jewish center, here in Washington, and to adults, conversational Hebrew.</span> <span id="s653">But the Jewish center was still on 16th Street, we -- we advertised it and we had six priests s-signing up for it, and three Jewish students.</span> <span id="s654">So, after one encounter of a short period, we stopped it.</span> <span id="s655">In the meantime I became active in the Jewish Community Council’s single adult group called The Coffeehouse.</span> <span id="s656">I became the chairman of The Coffeehouse and organized the well-attended meetings every Thursday night.</span> <span id="s657">We offered the -- we offered a good speaker, usually a ambassador.</span> <span id="s658">And danish and coffee and a place to meet young, Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And -- and did you feel that that was productive for those young people, did --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Because from there, as I indicated here, a lot of these Jewish youngsters, adults, singles, became more involved in Jewish affairs and later on when we organized the Washington committee for Soviet Jewry, they became active.</span> <span id="s663">United Jewish Appeal, they became active, and all sorts of other organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Was your intention when you started this Coffeehouse a political one, or a social one, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Social.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Social.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mostly social.</span> <span id="s668">We had four or five couples that got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- coming out of The Coffeehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: So it was for fellowship and -- and just for people to meet each other, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: -- and -- and -- but then, political organization grew out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: For you, and -- but had you been active politically before that?</span> <span id="s676">I know you had -- you’d been teaching Hebrew to kids, so you had social --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: -- activities, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: I joined the Zionist Organization of America.</span> <span id="s680">I was active at the Hillel, at the B’nai B’rith, delegate to the Hillel organization at the George Washington University from B’nai B’rith.</span> <span id="s681">ZOA, uni -- Jewish National Fund, anything that needed a voice, or action.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s683">And that was mostly when you came to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: After I came to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yes, in Washing --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What was it that -- why do you think you turned a corner there, and what -- what do you think -- was there something going on in the world that politicized you, or do you think it was just an outgrowth of all of your experiences, and knowledge, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, again t -- these organizations were slow in -- in developing and needed more members and more actions and more activities.</span> <span id="s689">And I had a regular job and a lot of extra time.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s691">And what about a girlfriend, did you have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Girlfriends.</span> <span id="s693">In Washington, some.</span> <span id="s694">When I left Israel my older sister gave birth to a little daughter, and those were still the days, 1952, when going to America meant being lost to the family.</span> <span id="s695">So she asked me when are we going to see you?</span> <span id="s696">And I said, I’ll come to her wedding.</span> <span id="s697">The baby.</span> <span id="s698">So even though I went there every -- almost every summer, I just went to the wedding, and there I met my wife, at the wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Oh, in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: 1971.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s702">And she was a citizen, Israeli citizen there?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: She graduated and worked in a hospital, op -- in that -- in Jaffa.</span> <span id="s706">Forget the name of that -- Jaffa Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And she was a Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: She was related to the groom at the wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: So that was my reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: For all your 20 years of --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: -- lonely hard work, yeah.</span> <span id="s716">And -- and when did she come, when did you marry?</span> <span id="s717">How long after you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: 1971.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: You met.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s721">We met at -- I was there, she came here for a visit and then I went, and we got married in October 21st, and I returned and she needed about a month to make arrangements for her coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: On the record, why don’t you say her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Mulva.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: What was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Mulva Isaac.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: It was ’71, in ’73 her parents came here, because our older son was born, and we needed help.</span> <span id="s728">We didn’t have much family here, so her mother was able to help out.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So you went from living alone to having a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Extended family.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: In just a matter of a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah, and a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: All the re -- in-laws stayed with us for six months, and then they moved out.</span> <span id="s739">What else could we discuss?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Let me ask you about the -- the situation -- larger situation in Washington, and also Detroit, they were very segregated places.</span> <span id="s741">Civil Rights movement, I’m sure that you were aware of things that were going on in this country in the south, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: -- and in places like Detroit and Chicago and New York, Boston.</span> <span id="s744">What kinds of attitudes did you have about what was happening in this country at that time and did -- do you think that your having --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, good question, because among the Jewish students in Detroit -- American Jewish students that I associated with, some of them were very involved in labor unions.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Although they studied completely different areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Excuse me, I’m going to have to turn the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Haim Solomon.</span> <span id="s751">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s752">The students were active in labor organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes, some of these Jewish students were active in labor movements, for t -- plans and other plans.</span> <span id="s754">And I liked their activities, and I used to go with them.</span> <span id="s755">But then we -- at the university we had the advisor for foreign students, and he called me in one day and explained that I cannot get involved with these organizations that are considered left wing, and I should stay away.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: This was in the 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s759">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: And I did.</span> <span id="s761">We parted company, and I avoided all of those meetings and all of those students, and they were both Zionists, and were part of our meetings at th-the Zionist house, but on the other hand, they supported and lectured to these labor unions and encouraged them to take stands on their pos --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: -- fights with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Was this a-advisor concerned for your citizenship, that -- that getting involved in these political activities could --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: -- could endanger your --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Jeopardize, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: -- your citizenship status?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: And ha -- and ha -- was that indeed happening to some foreign students in Detroit that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I didn’t know many, or -- or any that would be attracted to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: So, but then your -- you became a citizen, and you were a government employee.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And in the late 60’s, leading up to 1968 when there were riots in Washington, I imagine there was some tension here that you must have been aware of, racial tension?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s780">I lived in southwest Washington, 240 M Street, southwest during the riots and if you’re familiar with the area, right across from Arena Stage --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: -- is a church, and the pastor -- we would -- we made arrangements with that church, with the pastor, that Friday night we used to remove the cross and put a Torah, and have services Friday night and Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s783">So, by -- during these riots, the pas -- right across from where I lived were black -- Afro-American living in all these new, little houses.</span> <span id="s784">And behind us were those high-rises where mostly black people lived.</span> <span id="s785">And he asked us to [indecipherable] and join him in collecting food and taking to these citizens there, black people, because the Safeway, that was burned or broken into, and there was no way they could buy food, these black families.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: In the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: In the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s788">So we collected canned goods, and oh -- we tried to deliver them, but the youngsters were very aggressive and verbally assaulted us, until their mothers came and silenced them.</span> <span id="s789">So that’s what I experienced in the late 60’s -- ’67 - ’68.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s791">During the riots, was there any looting, or ra -- or rioting going on in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: -- where you lived, in southwest?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yes, the Safeway and the People’s Drug --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Oh, you mentioned that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: -- were broken in.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s798">Do you remember that, those nights when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I didn’t see it, but the next day this was common knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: This I remember, that we collected cans, canned goods and tried to go and deliver for the people, and we had problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s803">In the early 70’s now, you’re -- ’71 - ’72, you’re married, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: -- your wife was from Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And you had some common background there.</span> <span id="s808">She’s younger than you, I think, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Maybe 10 years or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And -- but she probably remembers quite a bit of -- from the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: The war years --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Not so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s816">She was a five year old --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- six year old child.</span> <span id="s819">Her father was taken to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s820">She grew up with her mother.</span> <span id="s821">Indeed, when he finally came back, she didn’t know him --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: -- didn’t recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s825">And as a couple did you, the two of you, know other people who were either Romanians, or Holocaust survivors, or did you socialize, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, but we s -- we had the -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: -- get together with other people who had similar backgrounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I mentioned the southwest church, and all the people who lived in these high-rises were part of that group that met Friday night --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: -- and Saturday morning at this church.</span> <span id="s833">So we became a group that would meet every other Friday, or once a month at the various member’s houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s835">For socializing?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Both.</span> <span id="s837">Services, discussion and socializing.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s839">What kind of discussions were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: One of our members, a lawyer, attended yeshiva, so she functioned like a rabbi, and we discussed the weekly portions and -- of the Torah.</span> <span id="s841">And that group stayed alive for -- for a long, long time, until recently, when it started dying out.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Only recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And did you all do that because there was no organized congregation in your neighborhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: -- and you didn’t want to travel to some other neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No.</span> <span id="s848">That -- that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Or other parts of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: But there were other congregations around Washington at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: There were, but really very few other Israel -- Reform Temple, a few known synagogues on 16th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Beth Sholom.</span> <span id="s855">And this was a nice arrangement at the church and at houses.</span> <span id="s856">We used to have a rabbi come and visit us.</span> <span id="s857">And then sometimes we organized a common services with the church people.</span> <span id="s858">That was on G Street, there’s another church that we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s860">And those people, I would think those -- that group of people were good friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: -- then, because you met for so long, so many years --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: -- every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Every other week.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: We met.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s869">Tell me about your activities with the Washington committee for Soviet Jewry.</span> <span id="s870">This was in the mid-six -- mid-70’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Early 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Early 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Very early 1968 - ’69, that friend of mine, Moshe Brodetsky and myself started talking about doing something about Soviet Jewry because the j -- Jewish community, the organized Jewish community didn’t want to touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s875">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Jewish Community Council, not the center, Jewish Community Council, and that’s where I met these young kids from New York that were equally inclined to do something, and we started the organization with a membership and newsletter, and -- and we found out that there are such organizations in other cities, and -- [interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: And you said you had a newsletter, and you had regular meetings, and wa -- and what kind of things did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yes, we a newsletter that was nationwide, because there was a similar organization in Cincinnati and one in California, in Los Angeles, one in Florida.</span> <span id="s879">And so we had the newsletter that came out once a month.</span> <span id="s880">We had meetings.</span> <span id="s881">We would go out to talk to other groups, because the Jewish Community Council felt that we are interfering with their leadership, and we didn’t, we weren’t, we just -- eventually we made arrangements with the labor union right across the -- the Soviet embassy on 16th Street, where we organized a daily vigil, which the police told us we’re not supposed to have any signs, or any speeches, or any pronunciations, but it’s okay for us to stand there.</span> <span id="s882">And every day at 12:30 to one, we would assemble there in front of the building, across from the Soviet embassy and just stand there for half an hour, maybe read some passage [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s883">In fact, w-we had the pastor from the -- the big church on 16th Street in -- in Massachusetts -- was it 14th str -- John Steinberg -- Steinbrook.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: On the Jewish holidays he would take 10 of his people, and man the vigil.</span> <span id="s886">Protest marches we could not have five hu -- we needed to observe the 500 feet rule, so we would meet on K Street, with posters -- K and 16th and march around with posters, accusing the Soviets of oppressing the Jewish community there.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: And what was going on at this time, was that the sa -- the Soviet government was not allowing Jews to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: An-And -- and was it that general situation that you were i-in opposition to, or were there specific cases that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Well, in the meantime, the arrested all the -- the activists that -- all those who applied for exit and were refused, so we had the list of refuseniks, and we produced bracelets with their names, and some sort of hanging with their names, and we went to various synagogues and asked them adopt one of these refuseniks and com -- and correspond with them, and send them help.</span> <span id="s891">In the meantime, people would travel to visit Russia and meet with these refuseniks.</span> <span id="s892">The famous [indecipherable] Sharansky, she used to come here, and we took her to the various senators, congressmen.</span> <span id="s893">The famous Jackson amendment came out of our activities and our influence with Senator Jackson, of Washington, and his assistant, Richard Perle, who wrote the Jackson amendment, Jackson-Vanik, which made commercial relations with Russia related to their -- to their treatment of Jews aspiring to emigrate, the Jewish emigration from Russia to Israel, or to here, or to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And were you specifically involved in the writing of that legislation, or consulting, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No.</span> <span id="s896">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: -- you [indecipherable] the hill?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: But it -- Moshe Brodetsky was advising --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: -- what conditions that they have in Russia that -- that Jackson --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Did -- did people from the Washington committee go to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Maybe just individuals that were just the paying members.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: I know of a few that visited there and made contact with these refuseniks.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Who were now fired from their government jobs, and under -- under observance from all the KGB, and they were helped materially with money to just sur -- survive.</span> <span id="s909">And their names were specifically submitted to the Russians to allow them to -- whoever was president here, had these names ready to negotiate further.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s911">And that worked continued for how long?</span> <span id="s912">Up until -- how long did that go on, the work, what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: All of the 70’s, the struggle went on.</span> <span id="s914">I’m not sure exactly when the Russians finally opened the gates and they -- first they asked for payment for the education that these Jews received before exiting or leaving Russia and all the advantages they had enjoyed there.</span> <span id="s915">But eventually they opened the gates, and a large -- a large number of immigrants started out from Russia to Israel, and Germany, and Romania and Poland.</span> <span id="s916">They just went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s918">In the late 70’s, I think it was 1979 specifically, there was a television program that aired in this country on ABC about the Holocaust, and a lot of people point to that nationwide viewing of that program as sort of a -- a beginning of -- of th -- of public education in this country about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s919">And a lot of people started speaking out about their experience in -- in the late 70’s and early 80’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: It -- it was a -- sort of a flowering of knowledge, and -- and dissemination and lot of young people started observing Holocaust Remembrance Day around this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: And I’m just wondering, you know, what kind of a -- how did you -- what were you doing in those years and -- and did -- and -- and did you start speaking out about the -- about your experiences, or -- or about other people’s experiences and getting involved somehow in -- in educating people about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s925">Not in the 80’s.</span> <span id="s926">But like Detroit, Washington had a Jewish Community Council, involved with Jewish affairs, and we in the committee were forcing them to pick up more topics, and more projects, and more involvement.</span> <span id="s927">So, when Yom HaShoah and the other such anniversaries occurred, of course we were there and we were approving and supporting these renewal of activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s929">You -- in the 80’s then, you had young children.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And how did you and your wife d-decide to tell them about the Holocaust, or what kind of education did they receive in those years, or when --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: -- and -- and how did you approach that question?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: -- first of all, from babyhood, we placed them in Jewish schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s936">Let’s wait a second.</span> <span id="s937">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: -- preschoolers.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: They attended kindergarten at [indecipherable] up to age of five, and at that age they started Jewish Day School, Charles C. Smith Jewish Day School, for 12 years, up to graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: And that’s where th -- they invited me to speak about -- for -- around Passover time, where every Jew is supposed to experience that -- the Exodus, so this was my story of the Exodus.</span> <span id="s943">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Was that the first time you had spoken publicly about your experience in -- in front of a group, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Oh, before that, for the Soviet Jewry activities, I worked the -- I talked to Hadassah group to s-si -- my own group that would meet Fridays.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Get them involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: And oh, wherever I was, at a coffeehouse, at a -- oh, maybe that’s an aspect that needs to be covered --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: -- because when we started the Soviet Jewry activities and the Jewish Community Council was adamantly against us, we are disturbing the -- we voted ourselves into that Jewish Community Council, and there were plenty of other members that sided with us, and we were able to bring about, by democratic voting, activities that we wanted the Council to do, and indeed they did.</span> <span id="s954">And they approached this Soviet Jewry activities and protest as a community -- experience in community involvement.</span> <span id="s955">From Orthodox to Reform, we had more help from the Reform synagogues than from the others, and financially they said anything you need, we can help you.</span> <span id="s956">We needed to -- mailings and rallies and such organizations that needed money and they supplied us very nicely.</span> <span id="s957">The Washington Hebrew congregation specifically gave us money and told us clearly, whatever you need, you tell us.</span> <span id="s958">I was already prepared and understood that th -- this Reform movement in this city, or in this country, and I knew that they are with us, just as in Detroit, I was with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: And they are looking for causes --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: -- to get involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Just as they were looking to educate their --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Just as wa -- you found in Detroit, that they were eager to educate their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: In fact, when I came to Washington, I taught at the Temple Sinai for one year.</span> <span id="s969">It was late for them to prorate me into the Hebrew curriculum, but I taught history and [indecipherable] Bible.</span> <span id="s970">Prophets, specifically.</span> <span id="s971">Presently I’m ba -- the treasurer of an Orthodox congregation on 16th Street.</span> <span id="s972">But I feel fine in any denomination.</span> <span id="s973">Anyone that wants to be Jewish, and wants to experience Jewishness, is fine with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: And are you still s-speaking publicly when you’re asked to do so, about your personal experiences?</span> <span id="s975">Do you do that very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: No.</span> <span id="s978">But you do volunteer at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: And -- and tell me about that.</span> <span id="s981">Tell me why you want to do that, and what it is that you’re doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Maybe you know mor -- Marty Goldman, he is in charge of the Holocaust Survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: It’s an organization at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: And way back when I was the chairman of The Coffeehouse, Marty met his wife there, and -- but before that he also became interested and involved -- in fact, at some point, when I could no longer do that, he took over the chairmanship of The Coffeehouse.</span> <span id="s987">And with him I would e-explain and talk about my experiences.</span> <span id="s988">So when he became the chairman of the Holocaust Survivors, he -- every time we had a meeting -- chance to meet, he would explain to me that I need to join his group as a survivor.</span> <span id="s989">Like my wife said I didn’t feel like I went through the Holocaust horrors, cause with all the difficulties, our father c -- walked us through the Holocaust in safety.</span> <span id="s990">So I kept telling him that, presently I’m with the FDA and when I retire, I’m coming to volunteer there.</span> <span id="s991">And he kept after me, and he was aware of my interviews, and of the Shoah Foundation interview.</span> <span id="s992">And before I retired, I called him and I -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Haim Solomon.</span> <span id="s994">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s995">When you finally y -- did retire --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: -- you kept in touch with Marty --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yes, I arranged to visit --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Goldman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: -- him on January the fifth, I retired on January the third.</span> <span id="s1001">During that week, I guess, I met with Marty.</span> <span id="s1002">He took me over to the library and the archives and made them an offer, he said, they can’t refuse; a Romanian speaking volunteer.</span> <span id="s1003">And sure enough, Henry Mayer, in charge of the archives explained to me that they have a large volume of Romanian documents, tapes, that need translation and they don’t have any translator.</span> <span id="s1004">So we started out with a short project of five tapes and another one, six - seven tapes and now I’m in a project of 1944 - ’45 already, 17 tapes in that series that need translation.</span> <span id="s1005">In the meantime they -- they send me 12 depositions of the Gypsies in Romania that were transported to Transnistria, and now they are about to receive German compensation.</span> <span id="s1006">So they picked th-the 12 most violent ones that I translated and they are very, very happy, or so -- satisfied with that [indecipherable] I arranged that in a way that the importance is stressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: I mean, they picked only the most egregious cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Where Gypsies lived -- they’re either traveling from place to place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: -- or they settled in one place in housings, but to get them out, th-the Romanian Nazis burned their villages.</span> <span id="s1013">And they came out and they transported them to Transnistria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1015">So you’re translating depositions from these people that were done when?</span> <span id="s1016">When were these interviews with these people taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: They were done in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: 2000.</span> <span id="s1020">Ni --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: 2000 - 2001.</span> <span id="s1025">But they picked the 12 most grave -- grav -- and I translated them in a way that they could see exactly what they did to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1027">And what does it mean to you to be doing this volunteer work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: It’s very rewarding in the sense that it will become available in English.</span> <span id="s1029">Not in detail, but only in titles, or summaries of the Jewish suffering in Romania during the war.</span> <span id="s1030">The -- th-the -- the secrets or th-the -- the way they -- they brought about the loss of 400,000 Jews in Romania during these years, every new laws that they could use to -- to obstruct and to prevent Jews from just living normal lives.</span> <span id="s1031">Professionals expelled from their professions, assets were nationalized, or -- as they called it.</span> <span id="s1032">Romanians were allowed to buy Jewish properties for very minimal prices, then rent them out to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1033">Even some that didn’t -- the la -- the -- the rules were -- th-the laws were called, for people who didn’t have any housing, to take over the Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s1034">But these were just making business out of it, even though they had wonderful houses, they took over from the Jews, and rented them out to Jews.</span> <span id="s1035">They would advertise them as such, Jews preferred, and exorbitant prices, and just made out a -- a business out of it.</span> <span id="s1036">All sorts of aspects are -- atheistic Jews -- Jews or a -- or non-Jews, they were still considered Jews for deportation.</span> <span id="s1037">And a bunch, a large number of baptized Jews, baptized to either Greek Orthodox or Catholic, and the Catholic Nuncio and the Pope insisted that they are Catholics and they are not to be treated or mistreated as Jews.</span> <span id="s1038">But the Greek Orthodox, they insisted that they -- if they claim to be Christian, they should be deported as -- to go out and a-as -- what do you call it, to proselytize other Jews in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s1039">So that was their position.</span> <span id="s1040">And certain pogroms in Kishinev and in Iasi.</span> <span id="s1041">The one in Iasi, I personally experienced, in hiding.</span> <span id="s1042">And a lot of things that even though I was youngster and lived there during these years, I did not understand it, and did not know it exactly the way it happened, until I meet it, or find it now in the Romanian text that I translate into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Now is being translated and indicated, it’s too much for me, but some other people could write papers, books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: About what happened in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: The Holocaust in Romania --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1050">Well, if they -- if somebody does do that, some of the research and -- and translation that you’ve done will no doubt be available to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: I haven’t taken advantage of these things, th-the -- for instance, this Cyprus experience, and the specific boats that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Mm-hm, were on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: -- took to -- from Romania.</span> <span id="s1058">These interviews and the first person interview would help me in making up a personal history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Mm-hm, which you are doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: I would like to do it.</span> <span id="s1061">Expanse -- expanding it, and leave it for the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1063">You have two boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1066">One’s 30, and the other one is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: 27.</span> <span id="s1069">And one of them, you mentioned to me, is very interested in your history and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: -- and understanding what happened to you, and what happened in your part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: -- in -- in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: -- in -- in general, th-the -- the Jewish causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1076">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: That’s the one in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: The younger one lives here, and was supposed to come here today, but he got involved in an accident.</span> <span id="s1080">He is not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Can you bi -- be careful with this, it makes a lot of noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: It makes a lot of noise when you handle it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1085">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: S-So di -- are you -- so one son is in-interested in what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: -- in knowing, and the other one is less so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Less interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: And -- and how do you explain that?</span> <span id="s1091">And does it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Do you think he’ll change his mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: It’s -- brothers, but they’re so different.</span> <span id="s1097">One is closed in, and the other one is all over, like his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: He talks, he communicates, he goes, he comes, he’s all over the [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And you’re going this summer to Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: He wants us to go and I agree, and maybe we’ll combine it with a stop in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1102">He wants to see exactly where and how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Have you been back to either place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1106">So it’ll be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: It will be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: -- quite a trip for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I even start charting places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1113">And are you -- are you eager?</span> <span id="s1114">If -- if it wasn’t for your son’s interest, would you go back, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1117">So you want him to see that, it’s not -- it’s more for him than for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yes, before I close the cycle and turn over to him, I’d like to go back and [indecipherable], see exactly where he come from and how far we went -- we got.</span> <span id="s1121">I’m sorry my parents are not here to -- to -- to see it, but being the youngest, they could not catch all my developments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: They saw the -- the other sister’s and the brother’s offspring, but maybe the -- no, my mother saw the older son, cause he is named after my father, and the youngster is named after him -- after Mother, in Hebrew at least.</span> <span id="s1124">Her name was Sophie and his name is Sopher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1126">What do you think -- what do you think it’s going to be like to go back, to see those places where such important events happened in your life?</span> <span id="s1127">What do you -- what do you -- how do you anticipate it?</span> <span id="s1128">Are you dreading it?</span> <span id="s1129">Are -- you think it’s going to be emotional, do you -- do you know what to expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: The -- the very original place where I come from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Bivolari?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Bivolari is now -- one Jewish family returned there, and they’re held in great esteem I understand.</span> <span id="s1135">And my older son worked here for three months, at the National Food Processors Organization.</span> <span id="s1136">He’s a food microbiologist, and this was tremendous experience for him to see -- in addition to producing f -- [indecipherable] of food, distribution and placement of food is the second part of food science.</span> <span id="s1137">So there she worked together with the wife of an em-embassy of Romania employee.</span> <span id="s1138">And sh -- her grandmother lives in Bivolari, so she told him there is electricity now, they are paving the road.</span> <span id="s1139">It was -- Bivolari is one long street, unpaved, and muddy in the spring.</span> <span id="s1140">So he should go, he should see it, and see the rest of the s -- country.</span> <span id="s1141">It’s a beautiful country, no question.</span> <span id="s1142">But I want to show him Iasi, where the pogrom took place, that house where we lived, the place where my brothers were almost killed.</span> <span id="s1143">Maybe Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1144">We went from Bivolari to Iasi to Bucharest to Cyprus to Israel to Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: It’s a long journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: That takes away years.</span> <span id="s1149">And here I am, I need to make it up and at the FDA, I really developed for all these years.</span> <span id="s1150">The 60’s, we -- we put some sense and some security, safety, into the fish industry.</span> <span id="s1151">In the 70’s we had the -- the mushroom industry, was poisoning people all over the country.</span> <span id="s1152">In the 80’s, we had the salmon industry, that we regulated.</span> <span id="s1153">You know, the salmon industry is the larg -- the only country in the world that produces that much salmon, all around the world, except that the canning it -- of it was so primitive that they used to make a -- th-the cans, flatten them without the top or the bottom, and take them to Alaska, and there press into th-the -- the bottom of the can, fill the can, put the top and [indecipherable] it.</span> <span id="s1154">Well, people died.</span> <span id="s1155">In London and Belgium and Australia, all due to American salmon.</span> <span id="s1156">So FDA was able to a-abolish that system and FDA hired additional inspectors, about 600 of them to go around and look for these cans, and these cases.</span> <span id="s1157">And finally we came about a safe product, the canning industry, the -- the salmon industry, the tuna industry, and a few, new modern means of -- of marketing foods that needed FDA intervention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: I’m wondering if -- if your experiences, and -- and the things that you went through after the war, the depravation that you experienced, and -- and the danger that you put yourself in to help save people and yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: You were determined to save -- help -- help people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: -- even at a young age --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: -- it seems like.</span> <span id="s1165">And that motivation has been part of you ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Did that motivation, do you think come from your experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: -- or was it something that was there before, that came from your parents?</span> <span id="s1170">Or is it all kind of come from the same place?</span> <span id="s1171">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: I’m trying to draw a link between the things that happened to you as a result of the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Certainly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: -- and the profession that you chose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yes, absolutely connected, the experience to what one does afterward -- the experience, after you come out alive from an experience, you try to prevent it from -- others from going through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1178">Let’s wait a second.</span> <span id="s1179">You said that -- that when you live, when you survive an experience like that, that you -- you’re motivated to help other people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: -- not have to go through something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1183">Individuals as well as communities.</span> <span id="s1184">Wherever there was a need, and no one went to fu-fulfill that need, I was ready to go, first to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Were your parents like that, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: To the extent that’s possible.</span> <span id="s1187">In Bivolari there was no time and no means, but still my father was involved with the community affairs, with the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: But that’s -- was enough for me to see that in spite of this need and activities, that he was involved in, just to keep a family of five alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: And we all tried to help during those years.</span> <span id="s1192">The place was so primitive that everything had to be done from scratch.</span> <span id="s1193">Even water wasn’t available, or electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: You’ve come such a long way in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: To this beautiful home in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: -- beautiful community here in Silver Spring, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: -- you’re a very lucky person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: And you worked hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Everything was compensated.</span> <span id="s1206">So this involvement at the museum is a plateau where I can walk through it, and just cont-continue.</span> <span id="s1207">It also helps mentally to stay a-a-aware and alive.</span> <span id="s1208">In addition to those two days that I -- I am at the museum, we have meetings on Wednesdays many times.</span> <span id="s1209">I also take some classes at a Jewish center in Rockville.</span> <span id="s1210">Subjects of interest, and of distraction, of -- like music, opera.</span> <span id="s1211">We’re very avid opera lovers.</span> <span id="s1212">During the Holocaust I studied violin, so I’m -- I like th-the classical music.</span> <span id="s1213">My wife likes opera, so we -- she comes with me to concerts, I go to the opera.</span> <span id="s1214">And many cultural activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Do you still play the violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1218">I remember i -- during your interview you talked about carrying your violin with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Violin, yes, I had a picture of that, carrying the violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: How long did you hang onto the violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Oh, two or three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: After you got to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No.</span> <span id="s1224">No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Didn’t make it that far?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I took it to Cyprus and they took it away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: They will return it to me afterwards, when I leave, but I left illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1230">Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: I didn’t go far enough with the violin, but I remained an avid appreciator of classical music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1233">I want to s -- go ahead.</span> <span id="s1234">You wanted to talk about your time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes, my a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: -- at the FDA.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: -- work at FDA was very satisfactory because I went into areas that were clear, clean, no -- no one did any of that work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Breaking of ground.</span> <span id="s1239">Breaking of ground --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: La -- breaking of grounds, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: And as a result, either as primary author or secondary author, I produced about 65 to 70 publications on Clostridium botulinum, mostly on -- in foods.</span> <span id="s1243">But basic, physiological research on the organism that is presently public -- publicized, and used by others.</span> <span id="s1244">We had, starting in ’65, an organization of -- a long name -- of the IBRCC, the botulism research organization.</span> <span id="s1245">But it met -- meets once a year.</span> <span id="s1246">I made sure that it’s not during Jewish holidays, cause we meet in the fall.</span> <span id="s1247">And I wrote a history of that organization because I participated in it from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1248">So this is what I leave as a -- these publications and leadership in that organization.</span> <span id="s1249">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: And at -- and what kind of work is yet to be done in -- in th -- your field?</span> <span id="s1251">What’s -- where is it going now, when -- since you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Now it’s become a weapon of mass destruction, and it’s all bioterrorism.</span> <span id="s1253">And on the other hand, they took this poison and made it into a medicine, Botox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Botox?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Comes out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I feel that it’s lowering, and some of our best researchers went into it to make money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1261">And what about the weapons of mass destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: That is another problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: And we need s -- rapid tests to detect it and products that might have the poison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: And that’s what FDA could do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Right now at -- most of FDA’s activities in the field are directed to rapid methods of detection, and the military is doing vaccinations.</span> <span id="s1267">Like, I’m immunized.</span> <span id="s1268">When I worked with it, I was immunized to the point that even if I make a mistake or injure myself, I would be immune to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1270">And so this work -- this new -- these new developments started before you left, before you retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: So you were somewhat involved in this rapid detection, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: But when we started in ’65, nothing, nothing was known of it, or how to handle it, how to avoid it, how to destroy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Mm-hm, well, so you did a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Quite a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1282">Really look back and like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: You made a great contribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Presently all the young researchers are trying to get me to review their publications, but I left everything at the Food and Drug Administration, all my files, and I try to turn them down, or a few I know [indecipherable] I can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">End of
