interview now.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: It is Friday, the 21st of February, in 2014.</span> <span id="s14">Can you state your name, and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I’m William Henry Hunley, and I was born the first of May, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In Matthews County, Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Grew up there and lived there until I finished high school, and – and came up to the Washington area to work, and – and then worked for the navy most of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: What was it like growing up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Oh boy, you wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s22">It’s a – Matthews County is a – is 99 square miles of delta.</span> <span id="s23">The ne-next county, Gloucester County, is full of hills.</span> <span id="s24">All the topsoil is washed out of Matthews, so in some places the topsoil is 75 feet thick.</span> <span id="s25">Man, it – it-it’s beautiful swamp country, and full of – of various – all kinds of wa-waterways and coves and bays.</span> <span id="s26">And was a marvelous place to grow up, to play on the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Wha – what – what did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well, we had – we had a small farm, that – that belonged – come down through the family.</span> <span id="s31">And my father was a steam engineer.</span> <span id="s32">He went – while he was growing up, he was, from the time he was 20 years old, for a while he worked for a lumber company, and he ran the steamboat that – that carried these lumber crews back and forth.</span> <span id="s33">And then when the lumber business dried up, he came to Washington to work.</span> <span id="s34">So when I finished high school, I came to wash – to – to Washington, and I worked up here, too.</span> <span id="s35">And then 1950 I started working for the navy, and I worked in the ship design office, through my career.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Let’s go back to your childhood though.</span> <span id="s37">What would – do – do you remember school, do you – did you like school, were you a good student?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Oh, man.</span> <span id="s39">Didn’t – didn’t want to miss any school.</span> <span id="s40">I – I walked four miles to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: – from the first grade on.</span> <span id="s43">Until I – I guess maybe I was a fourth grader, we [indecipherable] had a school bus used to take it – take us back and forth.</span> <span id="s44">So I – I really – I really liked school, and even now I probably [indecipherable] go running off, because I want to go back school again.</span> <span id="s45">There’s some things I hadn't learned yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What were you good at?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: In school?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, I – I did passably at everything, and from the time I was about nine years old, I decided I was going to be an engineer.</span> <span id="s50">So I concentrated on the things that would be the most useful to me as an engineer.</span> <span id="s51">And I got through that pretty good, you know, at the George Washington University, and the other – well, I wa – first I – the war came along, and I went into the army, and I got into the army specialized training program.</span> <span id="s52">And they sent me to loyal – Loyola University to study engineering.</span> <span id="s53">And I got in [indecipherable] was going fine, and five weeks later they closed the school, everybody went in the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: So I spent – I spent the war in – in Germany.</span> <span id="s56">And tha – tha-that’s how I got the wounds of course.</span> <span id="s57">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s59">Getting back to your – getting back to your childhood; did you play any sports, or did you hunt or fish, or do anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, I – a lot of hunting and fishing.</span> <span id="s61">I was in the river every day as soon as I – as soon as I finished my schoolwork and got home, threw my books in the house and off to – to the river.</span> <span id="s62">Down – down in Matthews, there are two rivers that come off the bay, and the East River was about 10 miles long, I lived on the East River.</span> <span id="s63">So I had the full run of the East River, with relatives on both sides watching, to make s – make sure that I was doing all right.</span> <span id="s64">And that my mother knows if I didn’t do things right.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: And every – I think it was marvelous, and there was plenty of woods to hide in, and I had a lot of fun with that.</span> <span id="s67">And in school I – I – I didn’t play ball, because when I was about – at about six years old, we had a big yard, and all the neighborhood came su – every Sunday afternoon to play ball.</span> <span id="s68">And I was batting, and my cousin, who lived next door, and was twice my size and was pitching, and he let one fly, hit me smack on the nose.</span> <span id="s69">And that ended my ball playing.</span> <span id="s70">I didn’t play ball after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: But I – yeah, I – yeah, and then [indecipherable] try the track team, which came in real handy when I got into Germany.</span> <span id="s73">I remember one time I was out in the middle of about a 600 acre beet field, they started firing at me with a machine gun, and I had to run to get off.</span> <span id="s74">Man, those boots were flying.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s76">I bet.</span> <span id="s77">Whe –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: But the good – I got – had – had a real good run through high school, and I started the archery club, and we had lot of fun with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And when did you say you came to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: In 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Okay, so relatively early.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Relatively early.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, I came up in ’38, but then I went back to the this – I finished high school in 19 for – in ’42, then I came up here to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: But I – in ’38, I came up here to work for a while in the summer, and back and – back for – for summers.</span> <span id="s89">And then after I finished high school, I go – came up and stayed here, and worked for the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Were you married before the war, or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Married?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Got married 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: And did you meet her after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay, fair enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I met her at George Washington University.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: When the war broke out, did you volunteer, or were you drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I volunteered, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: You volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: – that was – volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: What made you came to that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: I – what made me come to that decision?</span> <span id="s106">Well, I knew that everybody had to help, and I wanted to do my part.</span> <span id="s107">And I wanted to – at the time I wanted to go into the air force, so I enlisted for the air force.</span> <span id="s108">And that was great, they [indecipherable] my enlistment, and all that.</span> <span id="s109">And then it came time to report for active duty.</span> <span id="s110">So I went down to report for active duty [indecipherable] and made all the oaths and everything.</span> <span id="s111">And then they said, oh, we’re sorry, but the air force quota is filled for today.</span> <span id="s112">So, can’t get in the air force.</span> <span id="s113">I had enlisted for the air force, but the air force, it was part of the army.</span> <span id="s114">But, so they said, since you can’t get in the air force, if you go over and talk to those folks over there, they’re setting up the army specialized training program, and if you pass that exam, they’ll send you to school anyhow.</span> <span id="s115">So I took the exams and they sent me off to lo – Loyola University, which closed in five weeks, and I went off in – into the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What was the appeal of the air force?</span> <span id="s117">Did you want to be a pilot, or an engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well, I – I really wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.</span> <span id="s119">But I had been taking an air – correspondences courses while I was going to high school, in aeronautical engineering, and I wanted to learn to fly, too.</span> <span id="s120">But – so I could have a better understanding of how the airplane worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: But since I th – couldn’t get in the air force, and they sent me to Loyola University, they put me in a mechanical engineering program, which I wanted to do anyhow.</span> <span id="s123">So I learned – I got a degree in mechanical engineering, and I work – worked for the navy.</span> <span id="s124">In order to get the job I wanted in the navy, I had to have a degree in naval architecture.</span> <span id="s125">So I went back to the University of Michigan and studied naval architecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It – it – it worked.</span> <span id="s128">I got to be – got to be chief naval architect and – chief naval architect, and technical director for ship design for the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Now, when they went you to Loyola for school –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: – do you understand why they shut the program down, and sent every –</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, yes, the war was progressing, and they really needed troops in Europe [indecipherable] Pacific too.</span> <span id="s133">But it – th-the – mainly Europe.</span> <span id="s134">And the – the – the need for engineers were not overwhelming enough to – to keep the – keep the kids in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Where did you go to basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Went through ki – Camp Roberts, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: That was in 19 for – 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And what was that like, how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I – well, when I went [indecipherable] Camp Roberts for basic, I was supposed to go into the – th-the AFCP six weeks basic training.</span> <span id="s141">But on the way to California my records got separated from me, and never arrived.</span> <span id="s142">So they put me in the infantry basic, 17 weeks.</span> <span id="s143">Which is the best thing that could have happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Because wa – when I got into combat in the infantry, I needed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: The – the extra – extra training, basic training was very valuable to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: How did you find training?</span> <span id="s149">Was it difficult, physically, or mentally, or what have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: It was all difficult, but not – not impossible, I to – I mean, basic training [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">No problem with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And was there any – was there a particular military field that you wanted to go into?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, I was – I was assigned to the infantry, so that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s157">It’s my understanding though, that beyond infantry, you were specifically selected as a scout sniper.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah, ri – I – my – when I got in – well, I went through the basic training, and made the mistake of being first on the rifle range.</span> <span id="s159">And when our [indecipherable] boarding the ship going to Europe, somebody walked up and handed me, and said here, here’s your sniper rifle.</span> <span id="s160">And I became – I became a scout – scout sniper.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So there was no – was there any specialized training specifically for sniper training?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Just – just marksmanship.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Just marksmanship.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And do you feel that your childhood of hunting helped in that regard as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you were very familiar, even before basic training, you were familiar with small arms, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Oh well, tha – that time I got into a problem, because growing up on a farm, and on a river, I had guns from the time I was about six, seven years old.</span> <span id="s169">And one of my favorite sports in the fall was to go down to the cove, and shoot the heads off of water – water moccasins when they – they’d come up in the mating season, you know.</span> <span id="s170">And I got so that I could hit them pretty good.</span> <span id="s171">So when I – when I got in the army, I was too good on the rifle range, and I – I pretty well set – set the course.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: After basic training, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, I – I went to the [indecipherable] reservation in California, and we were on watch for the Japanese.</span> <span id="s174">They really were afraid the Japanese were going to attack the west coast.</span> <span id="s175">They had a submarine come in, I think on either Oregon or Washington, and fire some shells ashore, and they thought that it was maybe the oncoming of another Pearl Harbor attack on the west coast.</span> <span id="s176">So my division was scattered along the coast range California.</span> <span id="s177">We sat there for about, I don’t know, six months or so, to be there in case anything happened.</span> <span id="s178">Then they decided that my division was going to go to Europe, so they shipped me to – to South Carolina for more training at Camp Buckner, and then shipped me through New England to – to – to France and to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: When did you arrive in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Ah, let’s see.</span> <span id="s181">January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: At LaHavre.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Okay, so directly into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And what wi – did you – you were transported by – by troop ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s188">There was a – a German troop ship, she – her – her German name was the German equivalent of [indecipherable] and she was called Alexander B. Hamilton, in the US Navy.</span> <span id="s189">And she took us over.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What was the crossing like?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: That was in January, and it was cold, and it was rough.</span> <span id="s192">Two weeks.</span> <span id="s193">And I – I did fine til I went down to my – to my – to the bunkroom.</span> <span id="s194">My bunk was on G deck, the lowest one down, right against the fore big bulkhead.</span> <span id="s195">And so you’re up and down 40 feet every – every time [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s196">And when si – to go to – to eat, you had to go up [indecipherable] the ladder to the main deck and stand – get in a line, and the – the feeding was continuous.</span> <span id="s197">The line went around all day long, and you’d go wa – go up, got in the line, went over to eat, and if you felt you might be hungry again during the day, you went around twice.</span> <span id="s198">Then back down to – down to the bunkroom.</span> <span id="s199">Well, I went down to the bunkroom, that’s on my first [indecipherable] and going down that ladder, all the way up and down, that really fixed it.</span> <span id="s200">And when I got down there, the whole bunkroom was about that deep, with the re-results of the other pe – other people’s had eaten lunch.</span> <span id="s201">Man, that was awful.</span> <span id="s202">So immediately I got assigned latrine duty, of course, which was cleaning up the whole place.</span> <span id="s203">That – that made it a very miserable trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s205">Was it very crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yeah, very crowded.</span> <span id="s209">The – by the [indecipherable] before I get down the [indecipherable] them.</span> <span id="s210">There were – I think there were – think it was 5400 people on the ship.</span> <span id="s211">She wasn’t very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did the crossing go under escort, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Under escort.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: [indecipherable] right around, and dropping depth charges, and I di – I didn’t see the – the ship get hit by torpedoes, but I – I know that some were fired while were going across.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did you make any friends on the way over, or did you have any special friends before landing in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, the – the people that were my friends were the people I went to school with.</span> <span id="s218">We all got – went and got [indecipherable] over the same – in – in at the same time.</span> <span id="s219">So the people I went over with were people I had gone – gone to school with, and they – they stayed with me, long as I was in the – the division.</span> <span id="s220">And of course, when we came back, we were get – we were – came back from – from the war, we were all still in the reserves, and we all got called up on the same orders to go to – to Korea.</span> <span id="s221">And I was working for the navy then, and the navy didn’t want me to go.</span> <span id="s222">I was – I was there working on ship design.</span> <span id="s223">So they fought the – the orders all the way up the line and got – got me released from the orders, and I stayed and worked for the navy.</span> <span id="s224">The rest of my buddies went to Korea, none of them came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: None of the ones [indecipherable] the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Let’s go back to the landing in France, when you actually arrived at LaHavre.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What was your first impressions getting off the boat?</span> <span id="s230">You’re in Europe, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well, the first impres – impression was that it needed to warm up a little bit.</span> <span id="s232">It was January, so th-the – the fresh goop had melted, and when you stepped into the goop you were up to your knee, and the next time you went almost to your hip.</span> <span id="s233">And when you pulled your leg up, it weighed a ton.</span> <span id="s234">Bad.</span> <span id="s235">I had – I had read about that, and I talked to family and friends who had been in World War I, and I knew it – what it was going to be like.</span> <span id="s236">That was really a [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And now, when you arrived at LaHavre, your unit did not immediately go into combat –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: – there was some – what happened in betw – what happened with those tr –</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well, we went – we did a lot of training and maneuvers and camping and all that kind of stuff in France, and then we finally shipped up to – to Germany, up through Belgium, across Luxembourg, and into Germany at Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s242">So, you – you still had several weeks of – of pre-combat training in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s244">Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And what was that like?</span> <span id="s246">Do you – do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, same thing I had done before, had two or three training sessions in camps in the United States, we just marched around and simulating formations, and combat formations, and things like that.</span> <span id="s248">And then off to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Yeah, now you followed up the Sauer River, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: It’s what?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: You followed up the Sauer River?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I went up – well, I – from LaHavre I went up to – to – went into Belgium, and then across Luxembourg to tr – Trier and then down the – oh boy.</span> <span id="s253">Holy smokes, I can’t bring up the name of the river</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: The Moselle?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: The Moselle, right, Moselle, right, yep.</span> <span id="s256">And down the Moselle to the Rhine, and across the Rhine and down through southern Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Now, when you crossed over the Moselle, that should have been about March.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Mm, let me see.</span> <span id="s259">I think it was in March, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s260">Early March.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s262">When was the – when was your first combat engagement?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: That was at tra – Tr-Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Just – just below Trier.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Take me there.</span> <span id="s267">What was that like?</span> <span id="s268">Te-Tell me about the entire experience, wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Well, we took a train thr – across Luxembourg, and we got to Trier, we de-detrained, and from – and to our – our division formation, and we looked dow-down the Moselle, and I – I was – had been designated this – the scout sniper for my platoon, and I was leading the parade down the Moselle, and the first incident in combat, I – we were – I was following a – a fire break – in the fire [indecipherable] Moselle.</span> <span id="s270">And I come up over a hill, it’s very early in the morning, and I see two Germans setting up a machine gun to – to cover the place where we had just crossed the river.</span> <span id="s271">So that’s where I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: And that – that was the only time I got hit during the war.</span> <span id="s274">Got – got a – got a [indecipherable] fragment [indecipherable] buckle.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Who opened fire first –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: – the Germans on you, or you on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s279">Yeah, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: You on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: What – what type of sniper rifle did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I had a Springfield 384, with a Weaver scope.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: A Weaver scope.</span> <span id="s285">And what was that experience like, what – di – were you – were you shocked by it, were you addled by it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Well, I – it’s not an enjoyable experience, but I – I knew what was coming, and I was ready for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: So I – I was able to [indecipherable] and – but I lost my s – I lost my second scout.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: He got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Was he killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, he didn’t die r-right then, but he did later – later on.</span> <span id="s293">He had – he was shipped back, but he – he was pretty badly injured.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: But I can’t st – still can’t understand quite how it happened, but I – I got all the way through I never got hit except for one – one grenade fragment.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: And I, a number of times where they started out just to get me.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s299">And did you have to – did you have to take out both of the Germans, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well, by – my squad was somewhere all behind me, so as soon as I fired, they all joined in.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: And I got passed that and – and went on down the Moselle.</span> <span id="s303">Then I – when I got down to the Rhine, when we’re crossing the Rhine, I lost my best rifle.</span> <span id="s304">I [indecipherable] these little paddleboats, and I thought I was going to be on the left hand side of the boat, so I hung my [indecipherable] my rifle on my right shoulder.</span> <span id="s305">When I got to the boat something happened, and they shifted me onto the right side, and we’re paddling, trying to dodge all the shells that were coming in, the rifle slipped off, it fell in the Rhine.</span> <span id="s306">That was a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Now that should have been the Rhine river crossing, we’re probably approaching the end of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: At that time, the combat should have been picking up a good deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, yes, it was thick, and pretty rugged.</span> <span id="s311">Well, we go – we got to the Rhine, I do – I don’t quite understand the rationale, but they decided that we – we – we sat on the Rhine on one side, watching the Germans, and they were on the other side watching us for three days.</span> <span id="s312">Then they decided we could sneak across three o’clock in the morning, they wouldn’t know we were coming.</span> <span id="s313">So we got out into the boats, and as soon as the first people got in the boats, the Germans fired tracer ammunition into buildings on both sides that were prepared, lit the place up like daylight, and those were the wooden boats that they can’t [indecipherable] in a hurry.</span> <span id="s314">But we managed to get across, and get the beachhead, and went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Now, the – the main body of the 89th did not cross the Rhine in boats, they crossed on a pontoon bridge that was set up afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah, right, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So you were in very adv – you were in a very advanced unit –</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: – in a very, very for –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I was advanced unit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: One of our – one of our squads, ma – my – the – the second – I was in the third squad of our platoon.</span> <span id="s323">The second – the first squad went across the river first, about one o’clock in the morning, and set up [indecipherable] along the beach, along the riverbank, to guide the boats that were going to be paddling across, bringing us across.</span> <span id="s324">And they were under the – under the little seawall, there was a little seawall about that high.</span> <span id="s325">They were under that seawall for two o’clock in the morning until two o’clock in the afternoon before we could get to them.</span> <span id="s326">And when we got there, they had just fired their last round of ammunition; they didn’t lose a man.</span> <span id="s327">But there were Germans laying all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And during that crossing, and after the crossing, after you made it over, the whole time you were under fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: That had to have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Artillery and rifle fire –</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Had to have been frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: – and machine gun fire too.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Now, when you lost your rifle, how did you replace your weapon once you made it across?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, the only weapon I had going up east bank of the riv – of the Rhine was a – an [indecipherable] doub-double edged knife that my – my [indecipherable] knife that my father made for me, I wore it in my boot [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s336">And I didn’t get – I didn’t get a rifle for two days.</span> <span id="s337">But I we – I went up the bank on the east side, and I’ll – they’ll never know how I had got there, but I got along bank, and I was starting down the bank, looking for a place that I could get out of the way of this rifle fire, and there was laying a – a M3 Grease Gun machine – sub-machine gun, with two packages of ammunition.</span> <span id="s338">I never will know how they got there, but there it was.</span> <span id="s339">And from then I was the guy that opened the doors.</span> <span id="s340">Really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Now, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Two day – two days later, I go – I g-got a rifle that the guy didn’t – didn’t need any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s344">He had been killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: He had been killed, or injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well, he was cul – was killed or wounded at least – well, he wasn’t there any more, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s349">So, going into April –</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: – I guess you were approaching Eisenach as you were coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Well, Eisenach, we could [indecipherable] we went through – went through the town of Velmic(ph), that was – that was a little village where we crossed.</span> <span id="s353">And then we went up the – up the [indecipherable] right up to the top, and w-we started going up, and there’s a little – a little walking path that went up to the apartment, and there was a stream coming down.</span> <span id="s354">And I’m going up [indecipherable] with my little sub-machine gun, as first scout, going up the – this little path, and I got – get to the first corner and I peek around at [indecipherable] setting up another machine gun.</span> <span id="s355">And [indecipherable] with my little Grease Gun.</span> <span id="s356">And I didn’t come close to hitting him.</span> <span id="s357">I me – I mean, rocks were flying everywhere, and they – they took off.</span> <span id="s358">So we got up on top and then the – the next day we came to a big sugar beet country.</span> <span id="s359">That was the middle of a – I guess maybe a 600 acre shi – beet -- beet field.</span> <span id="s360">And the guy who [indecipherable] the beet field [indecipherable] with a – one of the MG-42 machine guns that fire 1200 rounds a minute.</span> <span id="s361">And I’m right in the middle of the field.</span> <span id="s362">Man, you talk about boots [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s363">I was [indecipherable] I in the – in the track team in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: But anyhow, I made it over, and dived into the ditch, and survived that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: By this time you’ve had ample opportunity to see the Germans in action –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: – and you in action against them.</span> <span id="s369">What opinion did you form of the Germans as soldiers and as professionals?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Oh, they were good soldiers.</span> <span id="s371">But I still – I can’t – can’t really bring my mind around to understand why, but in the time there that I was in the lead, and we were moving forward, I always saw them first.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: You saw the Germans first?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Before they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">I ca – I can’t understand how that happened, but it did.</span> <span id="s377">Cause that day in the – in the beet field, I saw them before they started shooting at me, but they wasn’t a thing I could do, I was right in the middle of this beet field, no place to go.</span> <span id="s378">But several times I was able to – I think – I think I saved – saved a good portion of my – of my outfit, by being able to alert them to the fact that they were running into something that was going to be bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So this is March, April 1945, how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s382">What – at that time, March, April 1945, what was your understanding of what it was you were fighting for?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I was fighting for America, for the United States.</span> <span id="s384">And I’m up – my people came here in about 1623, and we grew up in Virginia and helped to build what the united – what the United States is, so it meant a lot to me.</span> <span id="s385">Still does.</span> <span id="s386">That’s what I was fighting for.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: And was your understanding that wer – was it your understanding that you were fighting against the Germans, or was it against Nazism, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Well, I – I was face to face with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Nazism was a concept.</span> <span id="s391">The Germans were people trying – trying to kill me.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s393">So it’s something very personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: It got pretty personal at times.</span> <span id="s395">A couple of times where they were to – to – they were [indecipherable] of several trying to get me, and that – what made it pretty intense.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s397">Now, in very early April, specifically be-between the third and the fourth of April, you’re moving up.</span> <span id="s398">What – when did you arrive at – what was your first approach to Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Oh, Ohrdruf was quite – quite – quite a while later.</span> <span id="s400">It was probably – let’s see, I guess it was maybe three weeks or so over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Then there was skirmishes along – along the way, and then we went to Ohrdruf, and of course the – the tanks were the first ones in.</span> <span id="s403">We were following the fourth armored division, and the – the tanks were in there first and they started bringing things up, but then they – we were – we were right behind them, or right with them.</span> <span id="s404">And I was first through the – through the wall [indecipherable] went in, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you understand what Ohrdruf was beforehand?</span> <span id="s406">Did you understand that you were going to –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I had no idea it was that til we hit it.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Okay, so you had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: As you’re marching up, wh-when was – did you first make sight of it?</span> <span id="s411">And what was that like?</span> <span id="s412">What did you think it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well, the first – first tu – first day, I was – I had a – was the [indecipherable] started firing, and we were right along with the tanks.</span> <span id="s414">And then the – it became obvious that there were, you know [indecipherable] on this enclosed area, and the – it – my infantry get it – moved up to move into the area.</span> <span id="s415">And there was a – it was a – the [indecipherable] and there was a – a wire fence [indecipherable] fence.</span> <span id="s416">And I went through that.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What did you think it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well, I didn’t have any idea at first.</span> <span id="s419">But wer – after the fence, stacked in – I [indecipherable] along the fence, was dead bodies of the people that wer – that they had killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Were you receiving fire on the way in?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Not wer – not at first.</span> <span id="s422">The – the – the guards were pretty well shook up by the tanks when they came in.</span> <span id="s423">Now there’s some – some [indecipherable] firing, but not a real pitched battle.</span> <span id="s424">But there were – some of the German guards were still around [indecipherable] inside the – the compound, but they took off pretty quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: When you crossed the wire, and were inside the camp, what were the first things you started to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Well, the – first thing I’d see, of course, were these – these bodies stacked against the fence.</span> <span id="s427">And then I could see the bodies laying around on the – on the ground, just all over the place.</span> <span id="s428">Where – where – wherever the people – the people were, they shot them, where-wherever they were.</span> <span id="s429">The only ones that were still alive were the ones that were smart enough to get down and pretend that they were dead.</span> <span id="s430">And there were still quite a few that were – were alive, and as we moved in, th-they thought that we were – you know, the Americans moving in, the Germans were leaving, some of them started getting up, and go – got this – I see some of them.</span> <span id="s431">And some of them who were wounded, and some of them were not wounded, but in horrible shape, had a – they were in horrible shape.</span> <span id="s432">They were beaten and – and burning up, and sick, and – and it was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: You said the Germans were leaving.</span> <span id="s434">Were they escaping, or were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes, whatever – ever th-th-they – well, when – when they re-realized that we were moving in, they marched the prisoners out for 60 miles or so.</span> <span id="s436">And of course, a lot of them – a lot of them died along – along the way.</span> <span id="s437">But the ones that were left were the ones that were too sick to march, and they killed most of those when – whe-when – when we – when we moved into the – there – they killed most of those, and then left.</span> <span id="s438">But there were still a few alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you personally encounter any Germans inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Not individually, no, mm-mm.</span> <span id="s441">I – I was in – in the firefight, but they were distant from me, they – they were not –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: – that close up.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did you interact with any of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I – well, I didn’t have the language capability to talk to them, but I tried to convey the idea that I felt sorry for them, and that we were – we were trying to help.</span> <span id="s446">And we [indecipherable] had all kind of help, these people were lying all – all over the place, they were still alive, that couldn’t – couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s447">And dead bodies all over the place that need to be moved.</span> <span id="s448">We bu – we buried a lot of people.</span> <span id="s449">I wasn’t involved in the burials myself, because I was first line combat scout, and I had – I had move on.</span> <span id="s450">So I was ha – I moved out very shortly after we got in there.</span> <span id="s451">And they had – lot of people came up behind and took care of the administrative business.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: When did you come to an understanding of what Ohrdruf was, and what the purpose of the camp was?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Well, was pr – was pretty obvious when we got to the edge of the camp, you could see what it was, right.</span> <span id="s454">And I didn’t knew that the – the Germans had concentration camps, and war camps.</span> <span id="s455">Ohrdruf was a work camp, it wasn’t – they – they di-didn’t have the – the killer machinery, the ovens and all that, but they were working them to death.</span> <span id="s456">And when that didn’t ha – fast enough, they beat them up, killed them.</span> <span id="s457">They had – they had clubs to beat them with.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s460">They were all dead, horrible.</span> <span id="s461">And I wouldn’t want to go back through that again.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Did you understand that many of them who were there, many of the prisoners were Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Oh yes, yeah, I knew that, yep.</span> <span id="s464">Yep.</span> <span id="s465">Very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How long were you in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: About – well, actually in the camp, only about one day, I was right next to the camp for another day.</span> <span id="s468">But I was on the front line, and we were moving, so we had moved on out into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did you – wa-was there any effort to try to provision for the remaining camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Oh yes, they did that, the [indecipherable] gave the artillery.</span> <span id="s471">Our artillery – our detachment were the first ones in after us, after the infantry, and they did a lot of the cleaning up and taking care of the people.</span> <span id="s472">And then of course the – the other – other support troops moved in and they cleaned up the place, and buried the dead, and fed the survivors and took care of them.</span> <span id="s473">But – and I – I had – I had to move on.</span> <span id="s474">I was – I was in front – I was scout for the outfit, and I was – I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: You said when you entered the camp, the bodies were stacked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Were they clothed, or unclothed, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Some of them were clothed, some of them were partially clothed, some of them were naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s480">Had they obviously been starved and worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s482">They – th-they were in ha – in horrible shape.</span> <span id="s483">Some of them had just been shot, and they were so bad off they weren’t even bleeding.</span> <span id="s484">You could see the – see the bullet holes with a little blood around them, but they weren’t – weren’t actively bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: They were – they were in horrible shape, all – they were almost dead.</span> <span id="s487">They di – they were the ones that were so – so sick that they couldn’t – they couldn’t go on the forced march, th-they couldn’t – so they were – they were [indecipherable] they were treated horribly.</span> <span id="s488">Beaten up with clubs, and shot and most – practically all of them were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Is there any way of you estimating how many of – dead – how many o-of the dead people were there, that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, I – I – I – there – there were heaps of them, and I – course I didn’t – didn’t have time to stop and count them, but there were hundreds, hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: And how many – how many survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, I only say maybe 15 or 20.</span> <span id="s493">Maybe the – thi – maybe not even that many.</span> <span id="s494">They were stoo – standing up and moving.</span> <span id="s495">God, I – I – they were the only ones that I had really – well, there were – especially the ones that were standing up.</span> <span id="s496">And in – most – most of them were [indecipherable] on the ground either dead or dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: The ones who were still alive, what – did they try to interact with you, or anyone else in your platoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Well, yeah, we ha – they came running up to let us know that they were overjoyed that we were there.</span> <span id="s499">And we tried to – tried to talk, but I couldn’t talk to them, because they couldn’t – they don’t – couldn’t understand their language.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: And most of them were – were too bad off to do very much talking anyhow.</span> <span id="s502">But they – they came up to let us – let us know that they were glad that we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I don’t remember any women.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Men, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Just they all – all that I remember were men.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s508">Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I don’t know if there was women there or not, there may have been, but I didn’t – I don’t remember seeing any.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Did that experience, seeing the camp, s – and seeing some – th-the dead people who were – who were stacked up, and also some of the live people who came and tried to – to speak with you, did that change at all, your understanding of the war, and why you were fighting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, it reinforced what I already knew, yeah, I knew – I knew – I knew what we – what we were up to, and what we were fighting, but it – it sure reinforced my understanding of it, because there were – it was just absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s512">I just finished reading the book called [indecipherable] Patton.</span> <span id="s513">And one section in it they discuss the – the – the – Ohrdruf, and Eisenhower and Patton came to s – to see the place, and they said it was so bad, that it upset Patton so bad that he went off to the side and – and lost his lunch.</span> <span id="s514">[indecipherable] Patton [indecipherable] that’d be a pretty rugged – he wasn’t the type to get all excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And he came several days after you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s517">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: When you moved out of the camp, where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: We went down as fast – far down into Thuringia forest, and right into [indecipherable] and had – there was several firefights going through Thuringia forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What was the fighting like?</span> <span id="s521">Could you feel German resistance strengthening, or weakening?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Well – well, I was – it was weakening, because we were gradually wiping out the ones that were in there.</span> <span id="s523">And I got into some pretty – pretty fierce set-ons myself.</span> <span id="s524">At one time – one point, we were leaving a unit of the 76th division, and my platoon moved up to relieve one of that platoons, and I walked alongside the platoon sergeant, and he stood up.</span> <span id="s525">And of course, Patton required that we wear our insignia on our helmet right there, in gold.</span> <span id="s526">Nice and fi – nice and flashy.</span> <span id="s527">So he stood up, and when he stood up, bing, right through his insignia.</span> <span id="s528">And the next shot was for me, but somehow he missed.</span> <span id="s529">I don’t know how, because he had a fine rifle, and a fine telescope.</span> <span id="s530">But he missed.</span> <span id="s531">And I got down behind a spruce tree about that big.</span> <span id="s532">And he shot a group just where I’d be, though the – his first tree, about this wide, he had about like that.</span> <span id="s533">And he wa – he sees – he saw some part of me, I guess that – that he thought, or at least he thought he did, and he was shooting at, and he – and he had put right in there.</span> <span id="s534">He was shooting one of their – I ca – I can’t remember the designation [indecipherable] 10 shot semi-automatic – automatic rifles, that they designed and built to counter the M-1 rifle.</span> <span id="s535">And it was a very fine rifle, and he had a – a bi – a b – a beautiful telescope on it.</span> <span id="s536">I [indecipherable] telescope [indecipherable] and he’s still using it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So you – you engaged that German – you – you had to kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I – I didn’t kill him, I [indecipherable] the – I had two – I had a – a [indecipherable] on both sides of me.</span> <span id="s539">And [indecipherable] and when I got down behind a tree, and he was – he was – he had me st – stuck, I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s540">And they could hear him [indecipherable] they didn’t stop shooting at me.</span> <span id="s541">So I went up and got his – got his rifle, and took the scope off, and sent the scope home to [indecipherable] my scope.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And as you’re moving – as you’re moving on, at some point you cross the Mould(ph) River?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: The Mould(ph) River.</span> <span id="s545">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s546">I don’t recognize that name.</span> <span id="s547">Well see, we went – we went from – Woodruff(ph) is just south of Gotha right?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: We went through Gotha, down to Woodruff(ph), down through the Thuringia [indecipherable] and I wound up Czechoslovak – Czechoslovakia border, it wa – the little town of Langenbach in Germany.</span> <span id="s550">And I can’t even remember all the towns we pa – we passed through light – no, no, let’s see – no, I been – it’s been too long since the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I’m [indecipherable] I’m getting sort of – I don’t recall the names as well as I used to.</span> <span id="s553">But we went through [indecipherable] a number of times between Gotha and Langenbach and a couple of them, there was some pretty fierce fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: [indecipherable] that was a – a-actually it was before – yeah, [indecipherable] was before Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s556">Had a big fight at [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Had you ever been to Europe before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No, mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: So that was your first experience of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: What did you think of it, in terms of the terrain, the land?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Oh, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s563">Germany was just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s564">I thou – I remember when I was going across southern Germany, I couldn’t understand why people from places as beautiful as that would be [indecipherable] to take – take somebody else’s land.</span> <span id="s565">It was a [indecipherable] a hilly country, all beautiful green farms, there’s little villages on top of the hills, little white villages on top of the hills, and it was just beautiful scenery.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Now, apart from the German soldiers, who were clearly trying to kill you an-and you were trying to kill them –</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: – did you interact with any of German civilians as you were moving through?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Oh yes, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: What was – take – te-tell me about that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Well, as we went through, of course, we would come to German homes where they would – they just – I – I – al-almost every Monday – Monday was baking day, we’d come to a home [indecipherable] baking.</span> <span id="s572">And absolutely beautiful breads and cakes, and all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s573">And when we come through, the – the ladies of the household would trot out the baked goods for us to sample, and man, oh boy it was good.</span> <span id="s574">And the – the – in the – in Germany, southern Germany, most of the civilians that I ran into were not too – not too bad to – to talk to or get along with.</span> <span id="s575">When we got into Austria, man they were the most vicious ones that I ran into.</span> <span id="s576">Right in Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: In – in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, the ones in Germany would – would talk to us, and they would just talk about, you know, just the average whatever you talk about.</span> <span id="s579">In Austria, as soon as you [indecipherable] was around Salzburg that this, you know, what – what we were doing to them, taking away their radios, taking away all this and that kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s580">They didn’t have any of the stuff that they should have, because we were taking it all away.</span> <span id="s581">And what they had, was houses with six or eight rooms, some of them, with one room solid full packed with silverware that they got -- looted out of France and other countries that they’d taken over.</span> <span id="s582">I [indecipherable] they had a room full of – of plate and – and tableware, and all kinds of hou – silver [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s583">All that kind of stuff just stacked up.</span> <span id="s584">Crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: And they were very, very perturbed because we were taking away their stuff.</span> <span id="s587">Their stuff.</span> <span id="s588">Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Was there – was there ever a point in the war that came, where you – where you thought for yourself, we’re winning this, we-we’re – we’re – this is going to end soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: I thought that right from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s593">I mean I – in France, soon as we got ashore and started moving, we were pushing them back.</span> <span id="s594">This Battle of the Bulge was sort [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s595">I was off on the right hand side of that in – in France, but we were – obviously had them on the – on the [indecipherable] along.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Were you engaged in the Battle of the Bulge, or to – off on the flank?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah, I was – I – I was not in the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I was off on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: And – but I went up too far to that, after the – the actual Battle of the Bulge was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: But, very interesting experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Was there ever a – a sense – was there – di – wer – did there come a time where you could sense that the German war machine was slowing down?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: That there weren’t being – when was that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Oh, we’re actually across the – actually across the Rhine, they definitely [indecipherable] slowing – slowing down.</span> <span id="s608">And the troops there who were – who we were battling, were becoming less and less efficient.</span> <span id="s609">When we crossed the Rhine, the – the troops that we were battling were from around Salzburg, and they were the – the Home Guard type.</span> <span id="s610">And they were not – not as proficient as the soldiers we fought all up – up through the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Some of them were very poor shots.</span> <span id="s613">That’s the reason I’m still here.</span> <span id="s614">Thank heavens for that, but a lot of them were older, and they were not the – not as – not the top notch soldiers that we fought [indecipherable] across the Rhine.</span> <span id="s615">But that was [indecipherable] where we ran into SS troops, and people were very topnotch soldiers.</span> <span id="s616">And at the end, when we were – when we wound up at – at Langenbach, we were getting ready for another push on the fifth of – fifth of March, I think, we – fifth of April – fifth of May, we were having another push into sh – into Czechoslovakia, and there was a whole – I don’t know how the arrangement is of SS troops, and the other t-topnotch troops that had been digging in and getting ready.</span> <span id="s617">And we were p-p-pushing off against them.</span> <span id="s618">But that would have been – that would have been a horrible battle.</span> <span id="s619">But just the – the – we lined – we lined up th-the – the – the infantry lined up in battle formation, the trucks started their engines, the tanks started their engines.</span> <span id="s620">And just as we started following, the word came down the war was over.</span> <span id="s621">Happy day.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So what ha – what happened then?</span> <span id="s623">What happened when the word came over –</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Everybody shot everything they had into the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And what was the reaction on the opposite side, on the German side?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, I-I don’t know what – what went on over there, but there – there was no – there was no battle or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: They – they initially – they di – they didn’t just immediately dissolve and go away.</span> <span id="s629">But th-they started coming in and – and – and, I mean ha – by the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Surrendering.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Surrendering, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: What was that experience like?</span> <span id="s633">Were they – these men who you had been fighting against for some time now, all are coming towards you, presumably with their hands up surrendering.</span> <span id="s634">What wa – that must have been an odd experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Very odd.</span> <span id="s636">And ye-ye – course th – y-you didn’t – ye – we had no idea whether – whether we could trust them or not, you know?</span> <span id="s637">Th-That – they were pretty sneaky at lots of things, and it was a sort of a hard experience to stand there and watch them come out, you know, thousands of them, but just a – a few of us.</span> <span id="s638">And [indecipherable] weapons, they could have [indecipherable] us up pretty good.</span> <span id="s639">But it [indecipherable] surrender, they were – that’s all good.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: How long did that take?</span> <span id="s641">How long did it take before – for all of the – the German units to start surrendering to you?</span> <span id="s642">What was – that process take a day, a few days, a –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, it took a few days.</span> <span id="s644">There – there was – they were also – course, behind the German front lines, it di – di – took a few days before they acquiesced to – to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Even after you said, okay, that you understood the war was over, at that point when the war was over, were there every incidents of still receiving fire from the German side?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Not that I remember, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Once – once that over, and we got the word that the – the country had – had surrendered and it – there were some si – local fights, but I wa – I wasn’t – I was not in any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s650">And when the Germans came to surrender, what did you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Oh, they just pass them on back, and they – they had [indecipherable] times, and I wi – I didn’t – I didn’t see any [indecipherable] they were behind me.</span> <span id="s652">But th – the – they [indecipherable] been – been just miles for troops marching.</span> <span id="s653">Lots of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Where did you go, once the war was over, what then happened, what happened to the 89th division?</span> <span id="s655">Where did you go, where did you st –</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, we went to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: And we were in – in duty in Austria for about a year.</span> <span id="s659">And then the – the di – the division was dissolved, and we came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: What did your duty in Austria consist of?</span> <span id="s661">What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, I – there were mostly was just – just living there.</span> <span id="s663">There wasn’t anything much to do.</span> <span id="s664">Once in a while we would have an assembly with – we’d fall out in uniform.</span> <span id="s665">Sometimes we [indecipherable] and sometimes not.</span> <span id="s666">But there was not very much to do, just – just a matter of just staying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: And it was a beautiful country and a lovely place to be.</span> <span id="s669">And I was on Wolfgangsee at St. Gilgen.</span> <span id="s670">This is just out – just outside of Salzburg.</span> <span id="s671">And we stayed there for almost a year.</span> <span id="s672">It was just this gorgeous place.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: And how were you living?</span> <span id="s674">We-Were you in garrison, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah, well, there was a – a – a – an apartment building, a big, big apartment building in St. Gilgen, and my – my [indecipherable] was in that apartment building.</span> <span id="s676">And they – we all were very comfortably housed, and everythi-everything went fine, but there was nothing to do except to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And – but you were still interacting with the Austrian people, even if you did not understand the language.</span> <span id="s678">What was th –</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, by – by that time I [indecipherable] so I could talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: And that – I got so I could carry on a pretty good seventh grade level conversation.</span> <span id="s682">So I go – I got along fine with them.</span> <span id="s683">But the Austrians, most of the adults that I ran into, were really, really bitter.</span> <span id="s684">They kids, I got so that I could talk to the kids and a lot of them were pretty friendly, and some of the – some of the adults were pretty friendly.</span> <span id="s685">But a lot of them were very bitter.</span> <span id="s686">We we – we were taking away their things, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Of course, they’d – they robbed the – the whole world as far as they could reach, of everything they could get, but we were taking away their things.</span> <span id="s689">Yeah.</span> <span id="s690">Very peculiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s692">When did you get word that you were going home?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, let’s see.</span> <span

standing up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Did you get to spend a day or two in New York City, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well, as soon as I got ashore – I shouldn’t admit this maybe, but I went AWOL, went to see my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s706">Where did you go to see mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I got th – but I didn’t re

California or someplace else.</span> <span id="s713">I’d only seen them one time during that time.</span> <span id="s714">And it was very, very nice to get back to them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span

coming.</span> <span id="s720">But when I got to his -- where he was living in Washington, my mother was there.</span> <span id="s721">I was really surprised.</span> <span id="s722">I didn’t think she

class I could get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s759">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yeah, that was – let’s see, I came home in – in mar – April.</span> <span id="s761">First class I could get was a fall class, so fall of ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So – so September 1946 –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: – you’re back at George Washington University.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Did you stay on campus, or did you stay with your parents in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: [indecipherable] before .</span> <span id="s768">And I went back to working with him part time, while I went – while I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Where was he living in Washington, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah, on 15th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: 15th and M.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: 15th and M, okay, so relatively close.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: What – and what was he doing, remind me.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: He was running the power plant and machinery in a hospital steam plant.</span> <span id="s777">Still steam engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: So you were both working, as well as going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: How long did it take you to finish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Sixteen years.</span> <span id="s782">But I – I – well, I – I got – I got two degrees – three degrees, really.</span> <span id="s783">I got [indecipherable] degree from George Washington, and then I worked for a while for the navy, then I went back to Michigan to get my degrees in naval architecture and marine engineering, cause I wanted to be chief [indecipherable] I could do that once I got those degrees.</span> <span id="s784">So I went back to the navy and went back to designing ships, and I worked my career through there, 30 ye – 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: What was your first job out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Out of school I was still – I – well, I – I – I wa – I was working for the navy – I – I was go – I was going to George Washington, and soon as I got settled in to George Washington, I went to the navy.</span> <span id="s787">The navy had – had pretty much closed down the ship design office after the war, because it had – it wa – had more ships than they could use, they were trying to get rid of ships.</span> <span id="s788">But by 1950, they were – they were at a point where they were starting to assemble a ship design team again for the future.</span> <span id="s789">And I went in on ja – speculation just to see if there was anything that I could get to do.</span> <span id="s790">And they hired me as a – a part-time draftsman.</span> <span id="s791">I couldn’t get a po – a government appointment, three years before I could get a government – federal em-employee appointment, but I worked as a part-timer for – for three years as a – as a draftsman.</span> <span id="s792">And when they finally started staffing the office at the end of the three years that I was right – I was right at the – at the bottom when things start to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s793">It was perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So that would have been the early 1950s, or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah, 1950, August 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So i-it’s around this time when you meet your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Well, I met my wife at – when I was still – when I – when – started at G – at GW in 1946 – no, for – ’47.</span> <span id="s798">She ki – she was going to school at Lisberg College, and she came to George Washington for her sophomore year, so it was 1947 I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Were you in class together?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: No, oh no, she was a – she was, you know, ki – she was studying economics, I believe, and I was in engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: How did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: At this fraternity party.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: One of my buddies – she was – but they thr – my buddies, he ca – he was a – a marine type too.</span> <span id="s805">He got on a ship, went to South Africa.</span> <span id="s806">He was gone too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: When did you decide that you liked your wife?</span> <span id="s808">When did you decide –</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Oh, almost immediately.</span> <span id="s810">She was very attractive, and she was from – she was from Lovell(ph), Virginia, I was from Matthews County.</span> <span id="s811">And of course I speak the – I still speak a little bit of the Matthews County brogue, you know, in we – my family moved to Virginia in the 1620s, and they brought with them the Elizabethan English, and Matthews County is very isolated.</span> <span id="s812">Practically all the traffic in until – until I was born, practically all the traffic into Matthews County was by boat, so there wasn’t much traffic in and out.</span> <span id="s813">And the language tended to be preserved.</span> <span id="s814">The men who worked on ships, they went all over and they – gradually the men’s language changed.</span> <span id="s815">The women’s language stayed pretty much Elizabethan.</span> <span id="s816">When I was kid they still used something very close to Elizabethan English.</span> <span id="s817">I had a lot of that – a lot of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s818">And this – thi-this – so I still had a lot of that.</span> <span id="s819">So when I went to college, lot of the kids couldn’t understand what I said.</span> <span id="s820">And Carol showed up, they said hey, you speak the language.</span> <span id="s821">You gotta go talk to Bill, we can’t understand what he says.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: What was your first date together?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Well, our first date together was well, I wasn’t dating her, she was dating my buddy.</span> <span id="s824">And he and I were double dating.</span> <span id="s825">And then he took off for South Africa, and the fraternity had another party, so I invited her.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: When did you decide this was the woman for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Oh, about at least a month later.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: When did you propose, and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, it was the nec – the next summer, I guess, and we were out rowing in a rowboat, and I – we listening to the concert down at the Watergate in Washington.</span> <span id="s830">And I got a little romantic, proposed to her, give her my fraternity pin and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: So that was on – you were on a rowboat in the Potomac River, and that’s when you decided?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Well, I had decided before that, but that’s the first time I told her about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: So she got your pin rather than a ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s837">Got a ring later.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: And she agreed straightaway, or did she put you off for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Well, she put me off for a while.</span> <span id="s840">Took a little while to convince her.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: When did she finally come ‘round?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, it was – it was almost 1950.</span> <span id="s843">We were married in 1950.</span> <span id="s844">August 1950.</span> <span id="s845">Sep – September 1950.</span> <span id="s846">So it took a little while to convince her that everything was going to be all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: And did you have children straightaway?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Did you have children straightaway?</span> <span id="s850">Immediately have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, our first – our first child was born in ’55.</span> <span id="s852">So we didn’t have any right away.</span> <span id="s853">And had the daughter in ’55, and another one in ’58.</span> <span id="s854">Boy.</span> <span id="s855">Lots of memories coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And where were you living when you – where did you make your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Well, I – I was living in Washington, working for the navy when we got married, and then we rented an apartment in Washington, and then after a few months we bought a house close to the apartment.</span> <span id="s860">And then we moved back to Virginia when everybody – when we decided to have children, we moved back to Virginia, to get to – to a more congenial neighborhood, and be able to get to the schools easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Where in Virginia did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I went to Alexandria, in the Monticello Park area.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Okay, bri – I know that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah, it’s pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s866">How many years did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Fifty-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Fifty-one year, a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, the kids grew up there, they really – they loved it.</span> <span id="s872">They – they – we – we were on Argyle Drive, which is a short street with a cul-de-sac at the end.</span> <span id="s873">It’s only one blo – one block, and then a cul-de-sac.</span> <span id="s874">And the whole neighborhood was full of – full of kids when mine were coming along.</span> <span id="s875">And so ver – the kids were all up and down the street all day, everything ver-ver-very nice.</span> <span id="s876">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s877">And a good – the – the parent dig – the parents all right, very good neighbors.</span> <span id="s878">Nice place to live.</span> <span id="s879">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: And you said – how long did you – how many years did you work for the navy?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Thirty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Thirty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And as a – and your official job title when you retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: When I retired I was chief naval architect, and te-technical director for ship designs for the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: And what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: That was 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: 1980?</span> <span id="s889">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So all the way – you were designing ships from –</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: 1950 to 1980, and then after I retired, I still designed ships for another 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: What sorts?</span> <span id="s894">What kind of ships?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Oh well, I – I did quite a bit of de – the design work for the navy under contract.</span> <span id="s896">And I designed a few [indecipherable] vessels, some smaller vessels, 40 – 40 – 45 foot work boats and fishing boats, things like that.</span> <span id="s897">And I designed the – the [indecipherable] for the alexan – Alexandria Seaport Foundation.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: After I retired, I – I joined the Alexandria Seaport Foundation, and in ‘92 I became chairman of the Seaport Foundation.</span> <span id="s900">And at that time we had the old schooner, Alexandria, 125 foot [indecipherable] schooner.</span> <span id="s901">And I started a boatbuilding school to ha-have something for the kids at Alexandria and Washington – whole Washington area to do.</span> <span id="s902">And we – we – it really took off, I was amazed at that.</span> <span id="s903">You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city council, and they weren’t very interested.</span> <span id="s904">I went and talked to the school board, ah, you’re wasting your time, they said, your kids don’t want to do anything like that, they want to play in the streets and all.</span> <span id="s905">But I – I persisted and I got the school started in 1992, and I started off with a – a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 years old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them.</span> <span id="s906">And they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one adult with each group, so that they had some good supervision.</span> <span id="s907">I started them building little wooden boats.</span> <span id="s908">And I – we found that boy, when – when a lot of – most of those kids – most of them when they came, they were – boats didn’t mean anything at all to them.</span> <span id="s909">And doing anything with their hands didn’t mean to them.</span> <span id="s910">They didn’t di – they’d never done anything.</span> <span id="s911">But when they came in to us, about a week of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as long as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing.</span> <span id="s912">So that’s gone on since ’92 and it just kept on growing, it’s national now.</span> <span id="s913">A-As our system that we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185 organizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden boats.</span> <span id="s914">The little wooden boat is – is the key to it.</span> <span id="s915">They come in, and they get started with hammer and – and chisels and saws, things they had never touched before, and they learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I can do something that’s going to last and will be good for me –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: And that – it really gets them.</span> <span id="s918">Works very good.</span> <span id="s919">Then, a-after we got that going good, we started adding classroom exercises to help them with their schoolwork, and now we teach mathematics and physics and hi-history, and a couple of other courses occasionally, for the kids that are in high school and have trouble with a – with the high school.</span> <span id="s920">They don’t do well in – in math, a lot of the – a lot of the boys particularly don’t do well in math because they’re sitting there working on mathematical problems that don’t relate to anything.</span> <span id="s921">They can’t see any – any sense in it at all because it doesn’t – doesn’t relate to the things they do.</span> <span id="s922">But when they come in, we start teaching them to use mathematics to lay out the boats and [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff, and they see the use for it, it makes a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Your – after the war was over, you had a long life, very long, a good long time after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Did your experiences during the war bother you?</span> <span id="s928">Do you they come back to you later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Oh yeah, it came – it came back to me constantly.</span> <span id="s930">When I first got home, if a car – car go down the street backfire, I’d wake up under the bed.</span> <span id="s931">But I gradually got over that, and it – it – it didn’t bother me so much as it, you know, changed my outlook a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Well, one thing, I was – th-the group that I was with were practically all volunteers, enlistees – enlistees, and of course, the – the – the main – main body at the World War II army was draftees.</span> <span id="s934">And I found that the people who went voluntarily, they were – had a slightly different outlook on things, and I – I – I was glad that I had enlisted and gone voluntarily [indecipherable] what I had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Can you talk about that a little bit?</span> <span id="s936">In what way wa – in what way was it different?</span> <span id="s937">Was there a sense of professionalism, or was wa – how was it different between –</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Well, yeah, professionalism, and in the way that indu – individ-individuals reacted with each other, the ones who had enlisted tended to be more interactive and worked together better than the ones that were drafted.</span> <span id="s939">That – that wasn’t – I mean [indecipherable] not the across the board thing, wa – everybody was still different.</span> <span id="s940">But the – the – overall, the – the – the people that I knew that were enlistees tended to, I thought, be a little bit easier to – to – to work with, and get things done.</span> <span id="s941">A lot of the – a lot of the draftees, some of them that I knew personally, were just, you know, absolutely overwrought with having been drafted.</span> <span id="s942">They wanted nothing to do with it, and that – that influenced everything they did.</span> <span id="s943">The ones that – that volunteered knew what they were going – going to do, and th-they – they tended to respond a little differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s945">You said when the Korean War broke out, there was an effort to re-mobilize you?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Well, when the Korean War broke out, I – I was already demobilized [indecipherable] to the navy.</span> <span id="s947">And they – they started calling up the reserves again, and I got called up.</span> <span id="s948">The first sheet of orders that I got included me, and most of the people that had been in my immediate organization in World War II.</span> <span id="s949">And the navy [indecipherable] back to them.</span> <span id="s950">They didn’t want me to go, because I was working on a ship design business, and so they managed to the – get the orders – pre – get me off the orders.</span> <span id="s951">And that amazed me too, because th-they have to track it up unit by unit.</span> <span id="s952">They first tried the unit that I was assigned to, were turned down, and the next [indecipherable] they took it to the office of the president to get me released.</span> <span id="s953">As I [indecipherable] that really amazed me because I hadn't been at – I hadn't been at the navy very long.</span> <span id="s954">But apparently they – they had something they wanted me to do, so I stayed on and became chief naval architect.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: And – but you did not initiate that process –</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: – that was initiated by the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I – I – I went in – when – when I got th – when I got my orders [indecipherable] got my orders [indecipherable] got married, and I had already taken two weeks off.</span> <span id="s959">And when I went back in after two – two weeks after I got my orders – course, when I got my orders, I had to notify the office.</span> <span id="s960">And when I went back in two weeks later to pick up my books and thi – drawing tools [indecipherable] from the office, and I was leaving to go report to duty, and the – th-the – the assistant chief naval architect at that time, came running down the aisle, said hey, Bill, hey Bill, you don’t have to go.</span> <span id="s961">Man, was that good news.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Oh boy.</span> <span id="s964">Cause th-the – the – the group of my – on my orders that went, didn’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: None of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: I’m curious, by this time that you’ve had a few university degrees and what – were they trying to remobilize you as an enlisted man, or as an officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Well, I was – I was a PFC in the – in reserves.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I had been offered officer training school before I was demobilized, but I – I didn’t – I didn’t want to take that as a career, I wanted to be an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: So – but I was called – I was called up as a first – first class private.</span> <span id="s973">First class, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Let’s see, that – that was in 1946, I was – hm, 20 - 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: When did you decide to leave Alexandria and live where you are now?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, I – well, I always said, living in Alexandria, we became interested in this old little village of Waterford up in Loudoun County.</span> <span id="s980">You know Waterford?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: They have a very won – they had a wonderful – well, they still have a wonderful annual event where they have the old homes tour and colonial craft exhibits.</span> <span id="s983">I was very interested in – in the colonial crafts.</span> <span id="s984">I trava – I’m a gunsmith and make furniture, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s985">So I used to go to Waterford and go – go there for the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on different things.</span> <span id="s986">So I – we got – both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a – a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really.</span> <span id="s987">But we – none of the houses came up for sale that we could – could ha – could handle.</span> <span id="s988">So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back – I started making designs for houses.</span> <span id="s989">And, of course, in Waterford they had all – had all kinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor of the village.</span> <span id="s990">So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the – the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build.</span> <span id="s991">Showed it to him, he said, oh, that’s a nice little house Bill, but that – that’s – that would look beautiful in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, but that’s not for Waterford.</span> <span id="s992">So I went back, and I designed a brick house.</span> <span id="s993">Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg.</span> <span id="s994">Beautiful Williamsburg house.</span> <span id="s995">Not for Waterford.</span> <span id="s996">So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the “Washington Post,” and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log house for sale.</span> <span id="s997">They were tearing down a log house because they built – had new houses all around it, they – they couldn’t do anything except tear – tear down and move it.</span> <span id="s998">So we went over – she said, let’s go over and take a look at it.</span> <span id="s999">Well, that was the first week in May, 1970.</span> <span id="s1000">And I said, oh, I’m too busy, I can’t take – make it.</span> <span id="s1001">So next week she tried again.</span> <span id="s1002">The house was still for sale.</span> <span id="s1003">Third week, still for sale, tried again.</span> <span id="s1004">The fourth week, Sunday – Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out.</span> <span id="s1005">Said okay, let’s take the kids over, we’ll go look at it.</span> <span id="s1006">So we went over and there’s this log house.</span> <span id="s1007">By that time they’d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on everything.</span> <span id="s1008">We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone – had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board?</span> <span id="s1009">And when we opened the back door there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down.</span> <span id="s1010">But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs.</span> <span id="s1011">And it was in good shape.</span> <span id="s1012">Only two logs needed some – some moderate repairs.</span> <span id="s1013">So right there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it.</span> <span id="s1014">And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father’s got a log house three miles over there, that he hasn’t used for 10 years, he’d probably sell that to you, if you wanted it.</span> <span id="s1015">So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford.</span> <span id="s1016">And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975.</span> <span id="s1017">And we had – still had floors missing, and no doors or windows installed, things like that, but we moved in in time for the kids to go to school in the fall, and then I built it up from the inside.</span> <span id="s1018">So that’s how – that’s how we got into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: And it’s be-been nice, I really – really had a good time there.</span> <span id="s1021">I still live in – still live in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1023">Is your – is your wife still with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: No, she died in ni – in 2003.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: But she enjoyed the house as long as she was there.</span> <span id="s1027">She liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I was planning on building a boat, I had – had – had a design along the way for a 36 footer.</span> <span id="s1030">But she wasn’t really too keen on a boat.</span> <span id="s1031">So she saw this old house thing, and she says, why Bill, you’re – you’re really interested in all this colonial craftsmanship and stuff, you’d di – you’d like this log house.</span> <span id="s1032">We ought to – we ought to go look at that.</span> <span id="s1033">I put her off for a month, just – when I went to look at it, she finally got me.</span> <span id="s1034">So I never – never built my boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1036">Now, I’m sorry, but going back to the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: – there are people today, not only in the world, but in this country, who say and who claim that the Holocaust never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Oh gad.</span> <span id="s1040">Can you imagine people as stupid as that?</span> <span id="s1041">I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Now what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: A-A-And that’s not – I understand what you’re saying, but th-that’s just absolutely insane.</span> <span id="s1044">I – I – I – I – that just – I just can’t come up with any – anything to explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: What would you say to those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Well, I’ve never run across one of them, but I – I sure I would come up with some proper things to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: I was there.</span> <span id="s1049">I was in the original play.</span> <span id="s1050">I c – I can read you script line by line.</span> <span id="s1051">Man, some of the places that I saw were raps – just – just – it’s unbelievably horrible.</span> <span id="s1052">And how – how a nation could do that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Did it change the way you felt about the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Well, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1055">I – I didn’t know much about the German people pu – before.</span> <span id="s1056">I have some – I – I have a very extensive family, my people who were in Virginia by – by 1623, and so we became [indecipherable] a lot of them came from Germany.</span> <span id="s1057">But none of the German people that I – that I knew had any – a-any i-indication of anything like that.</span> <span id="s1058">I don’t know – I just can’t understand ho-how that could develop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: But on the other hand, the Germans have a history of that, that there have been battles from – from way back, all the way from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Did you ever return to Europe after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1063">I’ve been back to Germany tho – about six times.</span> <span id="s1064">I used to go to England frequently because I – and France because I was chief naval architect for the navy, and I was involved in naval design programs for the British, Canadians, and the [indecipherable] the Australians.</span> <span id="s1065">So I used to visit them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Why Germany?</span> <span id="s1067">Why did you go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Well, I – I went back – I-I wanted to go back and trace th – follow my trace – the – my wartime trace from Germany.</span> <span id="s1069">I went back four times to try that and never got to do it.</span> <span id="s1070">I took my family with me, and we’d always run across something that they liked so much they didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s1071">So I never got to go back and trace that trail again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And what di – do – so you – were you traveling by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And when – when was that?</span> <span id="s1077">When – what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Well, let’s see, yeah, we went in – boy, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1079">In – in the 60s and 70s, it was – our da-daughters went with us.</span> <span id="s1080">And before that I was too busy with – with the navy.</span> <span id="s1081">But in 60s and 70s, and we went back once in the 80s.</span> <span id="s1082">We went to France – in the 80s we went to France, but instead of going to – to Trier, then going down to Moselle, or down across the Rhine, and follow my tracks, when we got to fr – to France, we rented a car in Paris, and we drove up to where we go into Germany, and man it was gorgeous there.</span> <span id="s1083">And the weather was beautiful, and so we [indecipherable] to Germany.</span> <span id="s1084">I – I still would like to go back, but I don’t think I can do it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Going back to Germany then, how, if at all, did both the country as well as the German people change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Well, of course the – when the war was over, the – the people changed pretty rapidly.</span> <span id="s1087">And I – I became a – a pretty good [indecipherable] with a lot of them aster – after the war.</span> <span id="s1088">Used to correspond with some of them, and course you never can tell what they’re actually thinking, but what they said was quite different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: But they – they were – at th – I can’t understand how – how it could develop to what – where I was, but they were – that was a vicious nation.</span> <span id="s1093">Horrible.</span> <span id="s1094">I’m glad that’s over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: We’re making this recording, this recording will go into our archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: It’ll be used by historians and scholars, and people who study not only the war, but the Holocaust in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1099">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Do you have anything in closing that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, no, can’t think of anything we haven’t already covered.</span> <span id="s1102">And I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve done a lot of things, so I could talk on and on for the rest of my life, probably, and never stop, but it probably wouldn’t be of too much interest for your researchers.</span> <span id="s1103">So I hope that what I have been able to cover today will be of some use to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: It is very useful, and it was very, very interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: – and very, very nice speaking to you personally, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1108">Nice talking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: I wish you good success with the program.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: We hope so as well.</span> <span id="s1112">It’s an ongoing program, and hopefully it will be going on for – for a few years more, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yeah, mm-hm, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: So many thanks for your time, and many thanks for your service to the nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Oh, you’re certainly welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: And the service for the nation was for myself, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Very good.</span> <span id="s1119">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
