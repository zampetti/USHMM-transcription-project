from 1939 till December, 1941, when I went back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s164">I had a chance to run away further deep into Russia, but I didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EM: Who was in Warsaw at that time that you went back to?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MF: Well, my father, my mother, my oldest brother and his wife were at home, and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">MF: My sister and Isaac was there too.</span> <span id="s169">Isaac was with his wife and little boy.</span> <span id="s170">So my oldest brother Joe, Isaac with his wife and little boy, and my parents, and my sister Helen.</span> <span id="s171">Yaacov was already in Tel Aviv and...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">EM: O.K., now, could you tell me if you went directly, in 1941, there was a ghetto already.</span> <span id="s173">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">MF: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">EM: In Warsaw.</span> <span id="s176">But I thought also...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">MF: In Warsaw, yeah, not in Lemberg yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">EM: Yeah, but, but you went back in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">EM: Did you go...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">MF: My parents sent a guide for me, who looked more Jewish than I do.</span> <span id="s182">And nobody bugged him, but somebody bugged me, but I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">EM: You came back by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s185">I was all night train and I was, so I’ll tell you this.</span> <span id="s186">I was sitting on a train.</span> <span id="s187">And there was a Polish railroad man who was off duty, and this slob, the railroad man which they used to have, and he looked at me.</span> <span id="s188">The way he looked at me, it didn’t look good to me.</span> <span id="s189">So I went out in the hallway, smoked a cigarette.</span> <span id="s190">A minute later he was standing right next to me and his nose next to my nose.</span> <span id="s191">“It looks like I got you, you Jew.”</span> <span id="s192">But I speak Polish better than he did.</span> <span id="s193">He didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s194">So I opened my mouth and I started to talk fast.</span> <span id="s195">And in fifteen minute his wrinkles just smoothin’ out, and a half he told me how he cheats on his wife.</span> <span id="s196">Yeah, but he told me that he smells a Jew a mile away.</span> <span id="s197">And I said, “You smell them a mile away?</span> <span id="s198">I smell them even two miles away!”</span> <span id="s199">I was a worse antisemite than he was.</span> <span id="s200">When we arrived in Warsaw about 6:30 in the morning, we said good-bye to each other and he said to me—well, I cannot speak Polish so I’ll say it in English—he said, “You know, if I wouldn’t have been talking to you all night, I would have been sure you’re a Jew.”</span> <span id="s201">I said, “Slow down, Mister, you’re insulting your friend so I might not like it.”</span> <span id="s202">And we shook hands and when he left I said, “I hope he breaks a leg.”</span></p> <p><span id="s203">EM: You didn’t say it too loud?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">MF: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">EM: No?</span> <span id="s206">All right.</span> <span id="s207">Now, were your parents in the ghetto at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">EM: Which one, the big ghetto or the little ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MF: Well, the little ghetto, on Sienna 72.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">EM: They stayed on Sienna.</span> <span id="s212">You lived on Sienna and they stayed on Sienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">MF: Yeah, right, Sienna, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EM: Will you tell me a little bit of what you did in the Warsaw Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">MF: First let me tell you, when I got home, when I got through that hole in the wall, well there was a Polish policeman there and I told him, I gave him twenty zlotys and I said, “I’m going to buy furs from the Jews because the German Army just gave out an order the Jews must give their fur coats away because the Germans were freezing in Russia.”</span> <span id="s216">So I said, “I’m gonna,” I pretended I’m a Polack and I said, “Here it is, twenty zlotys.</span> <span id="s217">When I come back with a fur I’ll give you more.”</span> <span id="s218">When I got through the hole and a Jewish policeman says to me, “Schmaltz.”</span> <span id="s219">He wanted money.</span> <span id="s220">I said, “I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s221">Get lost.”</span> <span id="s222">And I bought a Magen David, put on my arm, went home.</span> <span id="s223">And it was seven [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s224">EM: All right, you found your family on Sienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s226">Well, I knocked on the door and my father said, “Who is it?”</span> <span id="s227">I said, “Me.</span> <span id="s228">Open the door.”</span> <span id="s229">So he couldn’t open the door because they had an iron bar on it, and it froze.</span> <span id="s230">That’s how cold it was.</span> <span id="s231">So I hear how he says to my mother, “Where’s the hammer?”</span> <span id="s232">Mother said, “In the bathroom.”</span> <span id="s233">So he went and got a hammer and knocked it off.</span> <span id="s234">And I’m telling you, [unclear] it was a reunion.</span> <span id="s235">It was quite a reunion.</span> <span id="s236">And it was about twelve noon and my sister Helen is still in bed.</span> <span id="s237">I said, “Why don’t you get up?</span> <span id="s238">Are you, do you have a cold or something?”</span> <span id="s239">She said, “No, I’ll get up a little later.”</span> <span id="s240">And my parents looked away.</span> <span id="s241">I see there is some trouble.</span> <span id="s242">I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s243">I found out.</span> <span id="s244">She was paralyzed from the waist down.</span> <span id="s245">What happened was, she didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s246">She was a blonde, blue-eyed girl, very pretty.</span> <span id="s247">And there was a time—it was, must have been in ‘42, whatever, I was, no, it was before, it must have been in 1940 or so, when I was in Lemberg, that the Gestapo was looking for Polish officers.</span> <span id="s248">So they found out about it, and they were hiding in the ghetto with their wives.</span> <span id="s249">So the Gestapo got wind of it and they got into the ghetto and stopped everybody that didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s250">So they stopped my sister.</span> <span id="s251">They said, “You Polack, where’s your husband?</span> <span id="s252">Is he an officer?</span> <span id="s253">What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s254">She says, “No, I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s255">They slapped her, took her to Gestapo headquarters on Aleja Schucha in Warsaw, beat the hell out of her, scared her like the devil... threatened her with death, whatever.</span> <span id="s256">And she, from that she got paralyzed.</span> <span id="s257">And the way she was walking through the room, she was holding onto chairs.</span> <span id="s258">That’s how she went to her death.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">EM: And that was in what year?</span> <span id="s260">What year did you come back to Warsaw, in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">MF: ‘41, December.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">EM: In December.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">EM: So that’s why it was cold when your father couldn’t open the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EM: Right?</span> <span id="s267">O.K., how did your father make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">MF: Well, who made a living?</span> <span id="s269">Whatever money he had left.</span> <span id="s270">Well, he sold his business as fast as he could.</span> <span id="s271">I remember, I walked into the bathroom and there were fish swimming around in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s272">Whatever somebody could get, you know, just to keep himself, whatever.</span> <span id="s273">Well, he had some money hidden, I guess, because he was selling out.</span> <span id="s274">The war was coming closer.</span> <span id="s275">He was selling as fast as he could.</span> <span id="s276">It wasn’t so hard, it wasn’t so easy, you know?</span> <span id="s277">Not, it was because they, the first business the Nazis cleaned out was my father’s business, by the way.</span> <span id="s278">Yeah.</span> <span id="s279">And so he was hiding the money which he was selling, he was hiding in a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s280">And one day...the Germans were already there, and the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s281">And one of the employees had the keys with him and the Nazis caught him and said, “Where is it?”</span> <span id="s282">So they had him open up.</span> <span id="s283">They went in there, they chased everybody out and they took the keys.</span> <span id="s284">And the next day they came with trucks.</span> <span id="s285">And they were catching Jews to take the stuff out.</span> <span id="s286">Only one person knew where the money was.</span> <span id="s287">My father knew.</span> <span id="s288">So he put a raincoat on top of him, and got himself in between the people who were carrying his materials out, took this piece under his raincoat and ran.</span> <span id="s289">He was 65 years old.</span> <span id="s290">And the Germans were shooting after him.</span> <span id="s291">He was running, zigzagging.</span> <span id="s292">He was a pretty sporty man.</span> <span id="s293">They didn’t catch him.</span> <span id="s294">He ran away.</span> <span id="s295">Otherwise they would have nothing to eat the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">EM: That was in 1939, right after they came in or was it...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">MF: No, it was 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">EM: In ‘39, that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s299">1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">MF: Well you said ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">EM: No, no, well, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">EM: O.K., now, how long did you stay in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s304">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">MF: Well, I was in the ghetto till the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">EM: Now, on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">MF: No, first they closed up the small ghetto and we moved, we got, I got a job on, it’s called Placówka, out of Warsaw West, working, going outside and working there for the German railroad.</span> <span id="s308">And we had to get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s309">They liquidated it, the small ghetto, and so everybody moved to the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s310">And then that time, the German railroad requisitioned, I mean they took over a house, an empty house, on Mila 7.</span> <span id="s311">Mila is a famous street.</span> <span id="s312">Mila 18 was famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">EM: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MF: Because the big guys, the tough guys were there.</span> <span id="s315">I was in Mila 7, almost across the street from them.</span> <span id="s316">And that’s where we were.</span> <span id="s317">All the people who worked for the railroad lived in that house.</span> <span id="s318">So my brother was with me.</span> <span id="s319">He also worked there, Joe my oldest brother, and I. And when we went there for the first, started to work there, they beat the hell out of us.</span> <span id="s320">They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">EM: Where was the Placówka?</span> <span id="s322">Where did you [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">MF: Warsaw West.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">EM: Oh, Warsaw West.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">MF: Warszawa Zachodnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MF: We had to carry rails, and do all kinds of physical work.</span> <span id="s328">And they, I guess they wanted money from us.</span> <span id="s329">We didn’t have anything anyway.</span> <span id="s330">And I remember there were open heads, they were beating to kill, always just beating somebody.</span> <span id="s331">And all of a sudden, here comes my first help.</span> <span id="s332">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s333">A German, a Polish railroad man comes over, goes up to a German and he says, “I need one man for work.”</span> <span id="s334">And he points at me.</span> <span id="s335">He says, “He’ll be a good one.</span> <span id="s336">Can I take him?”</span> <span id="s337">He says, “Take him.”</span> <span id="s338">We walk away.</span> <span id="s339">He said, “Don’t worry about a thing.</span> <span id="s340">You’re a colleague of my son,” who was a singer, a colleague at the conservatory.</span> <span id="s341">His father was working for the railroad, and he had a little house in the middle of the tot [track] I mean in English, in other words, he was switching rails when a train went one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">MF: He had a little house there.</span> <span id="s344">So we went over to that house and there was his son!</span> <span id="s345">And I spent the rest of the day.</span> <span id="s346">We had a drink.</span> <span id="s347">He sang and I played.</span> <span id="s348">He saved me because he told me his son went went by, he saw the Nazis are killing us.</span> <span id="s349">And he recognized me.</span> <span id="s350">So, he sent his father out to save me.</span> <span id="s351">So, I went over there and then he took me back when the time, when, about six, seven o’clock to go back.</span> <span id="s352">He said, “This Jew works very good.</span> <span id="s353">I’ll take him next day too.”</span> <span id="s354">He says, “O.K. Come back.”</span> <span id="s355">Finally we found out what he wanted, and we gave him whatever we had—peanuts—and they stopped beating us.</span> <span id="s356">But I was saved because the, I think one was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">EM: Were these S.S. men that were beating you?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">MF: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">EM: Or were they just Wehrmacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">MF: Yes, S.S. men.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">EM: They were S.S. men.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">MF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">EM: How many people would go out on your Placówka?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">MF: How many we were?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">EM: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">MF: A group of about 100, 120 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">EM: And you were going out every day to the same place to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">MF: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s369">We went out through the gate.</span> <span id="s370">I remember, and so and we were taking things with us.</span> <span id="s371">You know, like you could wear on your five, six shirts.</span> <span id="s372">Or you could wear a sheet around you, or two sheets.</span> <span id="s373">And they were pulling it out, while we walk on the street.</span> <span id="s374">We bribed the railroad men who were escorting us, and the Polish fellows were running along on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s375">They said, “What do you have?</span> <span id="s376">We’ll do business with you.”</span> <span id="s377">So we gave them the stuff in the morning.</span> <span id="s378">It looked funny.</span> <span id="s379">Well, you’re pulling out something out of your, you know, giving them all the, taking shirts off on the street while you walk.</span> <span id="s380">They said, “What do you want for you go back?”</span> <span id="s381">I said, “Well, I want butter, I want this, I want bread.”</span> <span id="s382">And I remember, and I was wearing a raincoat on top of my winter coat, because I got a pound of butter.</span> <span id="s383">O.K., so what it was, we made a hole in a raincoat pocket so the butter fell all the way down to the bottom.</span> <span id="s384">There was a lining so it won’t fall out.</span> <span id="s385">Because the S.S. usually, when they checked us they put their arms around you here.</span> <span id="s386">They never went that low.</span> <span id="s387">But this time I was out of luck.</span> <span id="s388">This German went down, and he found it.</span> <span id="s389">And he said, “Butter willst du fressen?”</span> <span id="s390">[You want to eat butter?]</span> <span id="s391">And he hit me in the face so I had five fingers on my cheek for about a week.</span> <span id="s392">“Put that in the guard house and get the hell out!”</span> <span id="s393">So that was already behind the guards.</span> <span id="s394">There were five, six of them.</span> <span id="s395">So I put in the guard house.</span> <span id="s396">I put this packet down and took a bigger one and got home, it was two pounds of butter!</span></p> <p><span id="s397">EM: Where did you get the bigger one?</span> <span id="s398">It was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">MF: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s400">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s401">MF: Well, everybody had one and when they’re caught they had to put it in this little guard house.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">EM: Oh, and you...</span></p> <p><span id="s403">MF: And that was already, they were behind us already.</span> <span id="s404">So I put this down.</span> <span id="s405">I said, “He told me to put it down.”</span> <span id="s406">I saw a bigger package.</span> <span id="s407">He didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s408">I put it under, and walked out.</span> <span id="s409">When I got home [unclear] my mother laughed [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">EM: [laughing] O.K., how long did you work on the Placówka?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">MF: How?</span> <span id="s412">Till the uprising.</span> <span id="s413">And the uprising brought out, what was it, the 18th of...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">EM: The first one, in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">MF: No, the third...</span></p> <p><span id="s416">EM: On the tenth of...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">MF: No, the 18th of January...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">EM: That was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">MF: That was not the uprising yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">EM: Well, it was the first resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">MF: The uprising was in April, Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EM: Could you tell me about resistance in the ghetto before the uprising?</span> <span id="s423">Was there any?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">MF: Yeah, let me tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s425">First of all, we never believed that that nice nation like, of Germans, who created so much in literature and music and so on could be such horrible murderers, the worst in the history of mankind.</span> <span id="s426">So, we one day started, when they put out the first announcements that the Jewish population of Warsaw is gonna be resettled further east where they’ll get work, and they’ll have place where to live and all that.</span> <span id="s427">And who comes freiwillig, on his own free will, to the train will get a what is it, a, two pounds of...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">EM: A…</span></p> <p><span id="s429">MF: Two pounds of bread or a pound of bread, two pounds of marmalade, or the other way around.</span> <span id="s430">So a lot of people, beggars who were dying on the street, literally dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s431">I once stepped on a dead body at night.</span> <span id="s432">I was going from my brother’s, who was on Sienna 30, to Sienna 72.</span> <span id="s433">There were no lights, nothing.</span> <span id="s434">It was dark already.</span> <span id="s435">It must have been ten in the evening.</span> <span id="s436">Then I walked, and all of a sudden I feel I’m step-, I stepped on something soft.</span> <span id="s437">And I looked, I’m standing on a belly of a dead man.</span> <span id="s438">It was just horrible.</span> <span id="s439">So they were going first.</span> <span id="s440">They didn’t care what will happen next.</span> <span id="s441">But how did we found out that they’re killing?</span> <span id="s442">The first time we found out, I found out, I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s443">Her name was Krysia Totenberg.</span> <span id="s444">Her cousin was a very famous violinist.</span> <span id="s445">She was a student of violin at the conservatory.</span> <span id="s446">When I went to, she lived not far from us, and I went to see her about something, and there was a cousin who came from Lublin.</span> <span id="s447">He was a tall, blonde, blue-eyed fellow, looked like a 100% Pole.</span> <span id="s448">He never looked like, not a trace of Jew in him.</span> <span id="s449">And he was sitting there, trembling, telling a..</span> <span id="s450">.</span> <span id="s451">horrible story that they’re killing people, that all the mass murder was started in Lublin, around there.</span> <span id="s452">So he said that they’re killing people, they’re gassing them.</span> <span id="s453">I said, “Are you crazy or something?</span> <span id="s454">What is this?”</span> <span id="s455">He said he just ran away, he came here to warn.</span> <span id="s456">So the word started to spread around.</span> <span id="s457">But the way we found out...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">EM: Do you remember when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">MF: It must have been maybe March, February or March ’43, somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">EM: No, no, or ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">MF: In ‘42 I lost my father.</span> <span id="s462">My father went to the Jewish Gemeinde, the Jewish community house, for something, and on the way the Nazis came in with trucks from both sides, cut off a block.</span> <span id="s463">The Jewish policemen stopped my father.</span> <span id="s464">A Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s465">They put him on a truck; we never saw him again.</span> <span id="s466">And I was at the Placówka.</span> <span id="s467">I came home.</span> <span id="s468">My mother said, “Father is gone.”</span> <span id="s469">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">EM: That was in 1942…?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">MF: ‘42, in the summer, when it started.</span> <span id="s472">Anyway...it must have been, it could have been ‘42 also, or yeah.</span> <span id="s473">So we started to, you know see, smell some horrible things.</span> <span id="s474">Because now, the Germans were fooling us very beautiful.</span> <span id="s475">One day, we had a group, as I mentioned, about 100, 120 people.</span> <span id="s476">Two or three guys, two guys didn’t go to work, because they had to buy, there was a black market there.</span> <span id="s477">They had to buy some stuff to have, you know, to take it out the next day.</span> <span id="s478">So they stayed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s479">And that day then, when we went out to work, a lot of people went out to work, the Germans came in and grabbed the Jews who were there and sent them away to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s480">They grabbed them, too.</span> <span id="s481">And the next day we are working on the railroad station and these two guys are walking toward us.</span> <span id="s482">We said, “Hey!</span> <span id="s483">Where’d you come from?”</span> <span id="s484">They said, “From hell.</span> <span id="s485">Let’s go on the side and talk.</span> <span id="s486">You won’t believe it.”</span> <span id="s487">They went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s488">They were unloading, they saw the whole, the devil, they saw the whole thing, the Commandant in the white uniform, the…</span></p> <p><span id="s489">EM: A white uni-...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">MF: He was in a white uniform, near the dig outs, where they, the mass graves, were full of dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">EM: The mass gr-...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">MF: They were burning.</span> <span id="s493">There was a light there.</span> <span id="s494">It was just like Dante’s Inferno.</span> <span id="s495">That it looked like.</span> <span id="s496">And they were unloading the people so they, and they had to undress right there, and they were shot.</span> <span id="s497">So they hid.</span> <span id="s498">They were smart two kids.</span> <span id="s499">And they hid in the clothes.</span> <span id="s500">And they put the, the Germans put the clothes back on the train.</span> <span id="s501">So they smuggled themselves in somehow on the train, and that train was going back with the stuff to Berlin.</span> <span id="s502">So they were passing through Warsaw, and it was only one guard in the front and on the back.</span> <span id="s503">So when they saw through the little window where they are, they saw us working, and they jumped out of the train.</span> <span id="s504">So they told us what happened, what’s going on.</span> <span id="s505">“They’re killing everybody!”</span> <span id="s506">This is no baloney what he’s saying.</span> <span id="s507">So we said, “That’s it.</span> <span id="s508">Now we better start organizing.</span> <span id="s509">We’re not gonna go like sheep to the slaughter.”</span> <span id="s510">So we started to build the bunker, and we started to buy guns, whoever could.</span> <span id="s511">When we bought our guns, and the next day, yeah, how did we get a gun into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s512">If you knew some Polish fellows, how many bullets you think you could get.</span> <span id="s513">So we were allowed to take in a two-pound bread and some, a pound of...two pounds of potatoes, something like that.</span> <span id="s514">So they baked the gun into the bread, with the bullets.</span> <span id="s515">That’s how I did.</span> <span id="s516">So we smuggled it like this.</span> <span id="s517">This was allowed, so they didn’t check that.</span> <span id="s518">The next day, General Stroop I think it was, that man who liquidated the ghetto, pulls on the gate and says, “Cut the bread.</span> <span id="s519">The Jews have guns in there.”</span> <span id="s520">He knew it the very next day.</span> <span id="s521">We didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s522">If they would have caught us the day before, we would have been all shot on the gate.</span> <span id="s523">And then we started to build the bunker on Stawki Street, right there next to the, you know, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s524">The first was a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s525">Then, when they moved everybody out then, I mean it was a, that big.</span> <span id="s526">When they moved out there was a smaller ghetto, a little ghetto here, and the big one here.</span> <span id="s527">So they moved everybody here and that was Niemandsland.</span> <span id="s528">It means nobody lived there, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">EM: The wild ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">MF: So, yeah, so we are all in the wild ghetto.</span> <span id="s531">So we built our bunker on Stawki Street, which was right to the street which was Niemandsland.</span> <span id="s532">And we built that tunnel into the house, under the street, under the house, into a kitchen somewhere, in case our bunker is burning or something, we will be able to escape.</span> <span id="s533">We’ll be on the wild ghetto side and nobody, we had nothing to do with the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">EM: So Stawki was still in the big ghetto?</span> <span id="s535">It wasn’t in the wild ghetto?</span> <span id="s536">[unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s537">MF: It was the border of it.</span> <span id="s538">Half of it was in the ghetto and half of it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">EM: So it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">MF: So that’s on [unclear].</span> <span id="s541">So we were building it for, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s542">EM: Oh, excuse me, the half that wasn’t in the ghetto, you mean it wasn’t in the ghetto or was the wild ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">MF: No, that was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">EM: It was in the ghetto, was in the wild ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">MF: In the ghetto, with a tunnel under the, into the wild ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">MF: So, and the women were making suchary, you know, all kinds of, what do you call suchary?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">EM: Biscuits?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">MF: Biscuits, those things which could last long.</span> <span id="s550">And they were buying flour.</span> <span id="s551">You know, we were a group of about, you know, twenty people, maybe more.</span> <span id="s552">And some little cots, you know, so you, so maybe we could...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">EM: Tell me, was your mother with you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s555">My mother was...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">EM: Who was with you?</span> <span id="s557">Who of your family was with you...</span></p> <p><span id="s558">MF: My mother and my sister, and my brother and his wife—Joe, and his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">EM: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s560">MF: Isaac was already gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">EM: You were all, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">MF: We were all then in one, we all lived in this same house, on Mila 7.</span> <span id="s563">We had one little apartment there.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">EM: And the bunker?</span> <span id="s565">Who was building the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">MF: We were, the guys from the Placówka.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">EM: And that was prepared for the guys and their families from the Placówka?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">MF: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">EM: Or just, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">MF: That’s right.</span> <span id="s571">No, no...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">MF: From, for everybody and their family.</span> <span id="s574">So we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s575">EM: How...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">MF: A small group of about twenty, twenty-five people.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">EM: How large was the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">MF: Now how large could it be?</span> <span id="s579">It had about two or three rooms.</span> <span id="s580">What could we put there?</span> <span id="s581">We had to keep sacks of flour and the suchary and things like this.</span> <span id="s582">Whatever we could, we built it.</span> <span id="s583">But how do you build a wall?</span> <span id="s584">How do you get out?</span> <span id="s585">How do you get in?</span> <span id="s586">So we, some genius, he had a great idea.</span> <span id="s587">There was a wall in the basement, down in the basement.</span> <span id="s588">So we took that cegly, the...now how do you call cegly?</span> <span id="s589">Bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">EM: Oh, oh, the bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">MF: We tore the bricks out.</span> <span id="s592">And the bricks which he took out from the wall you, we built here a little rail and a little platform.</span> <span id="s593">And we put the bricks on the platform, exactly.</span> <span id="s594">So when it goes, it went in, in other words it was inside.</span> <span id="s595">[moving away]</span></p> <p><span id="s596">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s597">Talk here.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">MF: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s599">So where you put the bricks on there, the bricks were exactly fitting the wall, the hole in the wall.</span> <span id="s600">So we put it back in and when you looked from the outside, then it was closed.</span> <span id="s601">Didn’t see anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">EM: That was on the rails?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">EM: On the rails.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">MF: Yeah, but not here.</span> <span id="s606">On the inside it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">EM: Yeah, uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">MF: We went through the wall and closed, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EM: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">MF: So that’s how we could go in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">EM: So you could just push the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s613">It was on two little rails.</span> <span id="s614">It was an ingenious guy to figure that out.</span> <span id="s615">Because we were afraid to tell everybody else.</span> <span id="s616">Because the idea was, if they’re gonna discover one bunker and they’ll say, “You wanna live?</span> <span id="s617">Tell where the others are.”</span></p> <p><span id="s618">EM: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">MF: Right?</span> <span id="s620">So it was always secret.</span> <span id="s621">So when somebody said it was the leader of the uprising, it’s not so much of a leader [unclear].</span> <span id="s622">There were groups, several groups.</span> <span id="s623">Because one was afraid that the other will say, when they catch him.</span> <span id="s624">So I don’t know how you can call it a leader.</span> <span id="s625">It was just self-defense more than an uprising.</span> <span id="s626">And of course we were all waiting for them when they came in, then people were lying on roofs and they started to shoot.</span> <span id="s627">And they found out that a bullet kills a Nazi just as well as it kills a Jew, that a Superman gets also killed.</span> <span id="s628">And he was dead.</span> <span id="s629">And they were running back pretty fast.</span> <span id="s630">And then they came with artillery, with tanks, with air force.</span> <span id="s631">So how long could you last?</span> <span id="s632">Well then we got out.</span> <span id="s633">The bunker started to burn, and we got out into the Niemandsland there.</span> <span id="s634">We were hiding for a while, and then they finally caught us, and we went together with the people who were inside to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">EM: So who was caught of your family?</span> <span id="s636">Who was in your, in the bunker?</span> <span id="s637">It was your mother and your sister or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">MF: No, my mother was already, my mother was gone already.</span> <span id="s639">What am I saying?</span> <span id="s640">My mother was gone on Jan-, my mother and my sister, on January 18th.</span> <span id="s641">It was a Monday afternoon.</span> <span id="s642">They came in, and we were all hiding in our apartment, together with my brother that they [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s643">EM: That was in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">MF: The 18th</span></p> <p><span id="s645">EM: In, the 18th of...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">MF: In 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">EM: And that was not on Stawki?</span> <span id="s648">That was, where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">MF: No, that was on Mila 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">EM: On Mila 7.</span> <span id="s651">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">MF: Mila 7, before Stawki.</span> <span id="s653">Because we built this later, after January.</span> <span id="s654">And there we were hid in that room, were about 30 people.</span> <span id="s655">And we put a lot of dirt around and we just put a night stand in front of that hole there.</span> <span id="s656">And the Germans were so smart that one was going on the street, the other one’s going from window to window.</span> <span id="s657">So he said, “Two windows.</span> <span id="s658">You went in there.”</span> <span id="s659">That’s what we figured out later.</span> <span id="s660">And they discovered us.</span> <span id="s661">And they took us to Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">EM: You mean from the outside they saw that there were no windows?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">MF: Yeah, and then there were birds also on the sills of the window, because it was warm there, from the people.</span> <span id="s664">It was in January.</span> <span id="s665">And also there were some [unclear], I don’t know, on the windows some.</span> <span id="s666">So they saw that and they destroyed it.</span> <span id="s667">And they took us to Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s668">So my sister was holding on to my mother.</span> <span id="s669">She was limping, holding on to me.</span> <span id="s670">And that’s how we went to Radom.</span> <span id="s671">I was there now.</span> <span id="s672">I looked at, in that school.</span> <span id="s673">There was a school, they built a public school before the war.</span> <span id="s674">It was junior school, and that’s where they kept us.</span> <span id="s675">And they built a railroad tracks to that school.</span> <span id="s676">Then when the railroad people saw that we didn’t come to work, and so from the others, too, from, the Air Force had some people working there.</span> <span id="s677">So they ran and they said, “We must have these people work, back to work.</span> <span id="s678">Otherwise the railroad cannot function.”</span> <span id="s679">We were in a basement.</span> <span id="s680">I remember there was a policeman there—I could see his legs walking along, a Polish policeman—so I called him in Polish.</span> <span id="s681">I said, “I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s682">He says, “Oh zyd sedziesz namydlo?”</span> <span id="s683">[They’re gonna make soap out of you.]</span> <span id="s684">He didn’t want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s685">Because my teacher made me a false document as a Pole.</span> <span id="s686">And I was waiting for one for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">EM: So where were you at that—I’m not quite clear—where were you at that time when you saw his legs walking back and forth?</span> <span id="s688">You were in, on Mila Street?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">MF: On Mila 7.</span> <span id="s690">Yeah, I was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">EM: O.K., on Mila 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">MF: Ostbahn.</span> <span id="s693">That was, the house was called the Ostbahn.</span> <span id="s694">That’s where we lived.</span> <span id="s695">Anyway, so I was...I could have gone out.</span> <span id="s696">I had a place.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s698">EM: Side two, tape one, interview with Professor Filar, Edith Millman interviewing.</span> <span id="s699">Professor Filar, I want to go back a little bit in time.</span> <span id="s700">And you had mentioned before that you played the concert in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s701">Could you tell me a little bit about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">MF: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s703">And I think it should be brought out, because hardly anybody mentions that, or maybe people don’t know it.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s705">There was a movie house built in Warsaw just before the war; they finished it, and they were not allowed to open it up because it was one foot I think too close to a church.</span> <span id="s706">And it was on Leszno Street...the movie house was in Leszno Róg Solna.</span> <span id="s707">And the church was on Leszno Róg Karmelicka, I think it was.</span> <span id="s708">And it was just one foot or two feet too close and they never opened it up.</span> <span id="s709">In the ghetto nobody came to the church, I guess.</span> <span id="s710">So they opened it up and, not as a movie, but as a concert hall.</span> <span id="s711">And we, a lot of musicians, some were members of the Warsaw Philharmonic played, and we had a wonderful conductor.</span> <span id="s712">His name was Marian Neuteich who was a fine, very fine viol-, eh, cellist.</span> <span id="s713">And he was a cellist for the radio symphony.</span> <span id="s714">So they created a symphony orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">EM: Where, did you know the conductor before the war?</span> <span id="s716">Or did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s717">MF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">EM: You did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">MF: No, I didn’t know him as a conductor.</span> <span id="s720">I heard of him that he was a great cellist.</span> <span id="s721">But he was also a conductor.</span> <span id="s722">So he conducted the orchestra, and they engaged me, and I played with him the Tchaikovsky Concerto.</span> <span id="s723">But we announced that we’re playing the Mendelsohn.</span> <span id="s724">Because the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EM: But did you tell me...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">MF: Wouldn’t let you play anybody but Jewish composers.</span> <span id="s727">And by the way, Mendelsohn was, I think his father already became a Christian or something, and so he was already born non-Jew, but he had a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s728">So, we announced that playing the Mendelsohn Concerto, and we played the Tchaikovsky.</span> <span id="s729">But we didn’t have the music.</span> <span id="s730">So we smuggled the music from the Polish side, over the wall I think they told me, because the orchestra did that.</span> <span id="s731">They had colleagues in the orchestra in the Philharmonic, from the Warsaw Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s732">So they got the music and we played the Concerto.</span> <span id="s733">I remember my parents and my sister Helen were in the audience.</span> <span id="s734">So, there were also chamber music concerts on Orla Street.</span> <span id="s735">That was, I remember now, I forgot that name completely, it just came to me.</span> <span id="s736">And there was a great young—he was maybe two years younger than I—violinist by the name of David Zaider, blessed memory, a wonderful talent.</span> <span id="s737">And we played chamber music together, piano violin sonatas.</span> <span id="s738">He was murdered.</span> <span id="s739">And there was a great singer, a fantastic talented girl, Marysia Eizenstadt, whose father was a conductor of the Great Synagogue Choir.</span> <span id="s740">And I sang in that choir when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s741">And my father was a member of that synagogue.</span> <span id="s742">So, of course, and Marysia was also murdered, you know.</span> <span id="s743">And so all this disappeared.</span> <span id="s744">But I think it should be mentioned that in all hell, in this kind of a hell, the Jews still had a symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s745">And it’s first, hardly mentioned anywhere.</span> <span id="s746">And I think that’s why I want to emphasize it, emphasize it, and emphasize it, because it’s unfair not to mention this kind of a great organization, in this kind of a hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">EM: Could you tell me a little more about who organized it?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">MF: This I don’t know, because I came to Warsaw in ‘41.</span> <span id="s749">I was away.</span> <span id="s750">So when I came back, they were already in existence.</span> <span id="s751">So I had no idea who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">EM: How often did the concerts take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">MF: Well I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s754">There weren’t many, because I came in ‘41, in December.</span> <span id="s755">And in ’42 in August, August 17th, I think it was, I already lost my father.</span> <span id="s756">So it was just a few months, you know.</span> <span id="s757">So they had a few concerts...it was not, you know, there wasn’t, the freedom wasn’t there to move around.</span> <span id="s758">It wasn’t that easy to [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s759">EM: Could you tell me, how did people know about the concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">MF: You got me.</span> <span id="s761">I, well they advertised.</span> <span id="s762">They advertised.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">EM: Tell me how, O.K., well how did they have...</span></p> <p><span id="s764">MF: They had a poster in front of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">EM: They had a poster.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">MF: And the poster lied.</span> <span id="s767">The poster said we’re playing the Mendelsohn Concerto.</span> <span id="s768">And we played the Tchaikovsky, because we’re not allowed to play any other but Jewish composers.</span> <span id="s769">Funny that I recorded that concerto in Munich, in 1970 or ‘71 I was there.</span> <span id="s770">First I..</span> <span id="s771">.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">EM: And we’re going to talk about this a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">EM: Let’s stick to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">MF: But I mean that’s the same concerto so...</span></p> <p><span id="s776">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s777">MF: Funny, I later, here you were not allowed to play it.</span> <span id="s778">Now I played it in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s780">Was Mendelsohn played at all?</span> <span id="s781">Or was it because...I know that Beethoven and Mozart was played.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">MF: Sure.</span> <span id="s783">But they announced somebody else.</span> <span id="s784">They announced Meyerbeer or whatever it was, you know.</span> <span id="s785">But it was, you went in there and you know what was being played, because the Germans didn’t permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">EM: O.K.</span> <span id="s787">Did the Judenrat pay for the musicians?</span> <span id="s788">Or don’t you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">MF: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s790">Money doesn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s791">EM: You don’t remember if you got paid for playing?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">MF: No, no, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">EM: I just, I wanted to know if that was under the auspices of the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">MF: I guess they paid them something.</span> <span id="s795">They probably paid them something for it.</span> <span id="s796">Who had money then?</span> <span id="s797">You know, everybody was impoverished.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s799">I know that there were many musicians even in the streets, street musicians...</span></p> <p><span id="s800">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">EM: In 1942.</span> <span id="s802">All right, so you lost your father in August of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">MF: August 17th, 1942.</span> <span id="s804">He went to the Jewish Gemeinde, I mean to some, for something.</span> <span id="s805">I don’t know what, and then he never came back.</span> <span id="s806">And we heard that the Nazis came with trucks on both sides of the block, cut the block off, and that was it.</span> <span id="s807">Whoever was on the street they grabbed them, put them on a truck and sent them away and killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">EM: Now I..</span> <span id="s809">.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">MF: Just like that, like you never had a father.</span> <span id="s811">And you couldn’t react.</span> <span id="s812">You could...I don’t know, blow up, that he can’t, the impotence!</span> <span id="s813">You can not do anything!</span></p> <p><span id="s814">EM: And your mother was taken later?</span> <span id="s815">You know...</span></p> <p><span id="s816">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s817">My mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s818">EM: You told me...</span></p> <p><span id="s819">MF: And my sister Helen.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">EM: You were at the Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">EM: You mentioned you were at the Umschlagplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">MF: That was January 18th, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EM: And you got out from the Umschlag-, away from the Umschlagplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">MF: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s826">But I didn’t want to get out.</span> <span id="s827">And it was quite a very tragic story for me, because we went there, we stayed over night.</span> <span id="s828">And in the morning—I worked for the railroad station, so the Germans from the railroad station came in—and they said, “We need the workers.</span> <span id="s829">Otherwise the railroad won’t work.”</span> <span id="s830">You know, and they raised hell.</span> <span id="s831">So they said, “Today we let out the men.</span> <span id="s832">Tomorrow we’re letting out the women.”</span> <span id="s833">So I said—my oldest brother was there, too, and my mother and my sister, and my oldest brother’s wife, the three women and two of us—so he said, “Come on!</span> <span id="s834">Let’s go.</span> <span id="s835">They’ll come.”</span> <span id="s836">I said, “No, I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s837">I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s838">And I was crying, and holding onto my mother.</span> <span id="s839">And he grabbed me, and my mother pushed me and says, “Go!</span> <span id="s840">You’ll be a great pianist.</span> <span id="s841">We’ll be very proud of you.</span> <span id="s842">And we’ll come tomorrow.</span> <span id="s843">Don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s844">Somehow, my brother pulled me away.</span> <span id="s845">And I cried.</span> <span id="s846">I didn’t want to, I really didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s847">And it’s eating me all those years.</span> <span id="s848">And sometimes I don’t even want to say it, because it’s my private tragedy.</span> <span id="s849">And my mother said, “I bless you.”</span> <span id="s850">[pause; tape off then on] “Come on!</span> <span id="s851">They’ll let them out tomorrow!”</span> <span id="s852">So we went to work.</span> <span id="s853">Came tomorrow, we went to work, we came back, and there was still a lock on my, on the apartment where I was with my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s854">They never came back.</span> <span id="s855">[pause; weeping]</span></p> <p><span id="s856">EM: So they went on a transport probably the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">MF: And we stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s858">I remember in the basement of that, see, I was there now.</span> <span id="s859">Just a couple of months ago I went there with my nephew.</span> <span id="s860">And I said, “That’s where I saw my mother for the last time, down there in that basement.”</span> <span id="s861">The school is still there.</span> <span id="s862">It was a public school.</span> <span id="s863">They just built it before the war.</span> <span id="s864">And the Germans built the railroad tracks...[sighs]</span></p> <p><span id="s865">EM: Professor Filar is overcome by emotion, so we will interrupt the interview for a while.</span> <span id="s866">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s867">MF: Yeah, [unclear].</span> <span id="s868">And you saw a picture how beautiful she was.</span> <span id="s869">I call her beautiful.</span> <span id="s870">[weeping] I never called her mother.</span> <span id="s871">I always called her beautiful.</span> <span id="s872">My sister would say, “Are you calling me?”</span> <span id="s873">I’d say, “Shut up, you know better.”</span> <span id="s874">[laughs] And my mother laughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">EM: Well, your mother was a beautiful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">MF: Yeah, she was beautiful inside and outside.</span> <span id="s877">[weeping; tape off then on] ...to be such murderers!</span> <span id="s878">Who would believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">EM: Where did you, so you went back to work, to your Placówka from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s881">And then what happened was, I got in touch with my teacher.</span> <span id="s882">And he said, “We have a place for you.</span> <span id="s883">You’re gonna be hidden.”</span> <span id="s884">Do you have it on?</span> <span id="s885">[pause] He, they sent a colonel, a Polish colonel, who was an uncle of a colleague of mine, Levitsky was his name.</span> <span id="s886">He came to the railroad station to Warsaw West.</span> <span id="s887">And I gave him a picture.</span> <span id="s888">And he got me a Kennkarte, [identity card] a false Kennkarte.</span> <span id="s889">And he said, he came in and he said, “It’ll be ready in a day.”</span> <span id="s890">I said, “I would like, I cannot go out till I have one, for my brother” that was my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s891">He’s alive.</span> <span id="s892">He lives near Washington now.</span> <span id="s893">He’s alive.</span> <span id="s894">He’s 93 years old.</span> <span id="s895">We were seven kids and, I was the one that was born, I don’t know how many years later.</span> <span id="s896">By the way.</span> <span id="s897">I was an accident.</span> <span id="s898">And so, and I was supposed to be hidden in a hrabia potocki, [count] I mean dobra, [estate] you know, in some estate near Lublin somewhere.</span> <span id="s899">And there was also hidden somebody else I heard after the war, Prokurator Sawicky, [public prosecutor] who hanged all the Nazis in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s900">Have you ever heard that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">MF: Sawicky.</span> <span id="s903">His name was Jerzyk Reisler.</span> <span id="s904">His father-in-law was a very famous lawyer in Lemberg by the name of Leib Landau, who defended, that was Proces Steigera.</span> <span id="s905">[law suit] It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s906">EM: But I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">MF: That was a, you remember something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">MF: He was a very famous lawyer.</span> <span id="s910">So he changed his name, married a Polish Catholic woman, and he was there.</span> <span id="s911">Then I heard that they raided the place and they found him or he escaped, something.</span> <span id="s912">Well, anyway, so I didn’t go because I waited for the documents for my brother.</span> <span id="s913">Meantime the uprising broke out.</span> <span id="s914">Now, but we were already building, we had our bunker already.</span> <span id="s915">I think I showed you how we got in...</span></p> <p><span id="s916">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">MF: And how we got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">MF: With that little thing on the rails.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">EM: Yeah, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s921">MF: Yeah, and then we were outside in the wild ghetto, and that’s how they caught us.</span> <span id="s922">So we said, “We had nothing to do with the uprising.”</span> <span id="s923">You know, we were, and they took us together with everybody else to Majdanek, to Block 16.</span> <span id="s924">Now that was a Feld drei, mean field number three, and the Block was 16.</span> <span id="s925">And I was there, in ‘92 I was there.</span> <span id="s926">And I went to see it.</span> <span id="s927">I had a student of mine with me and I played with the Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s928">After it was done we hired a car, and we went to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s930">My, that was in 1992.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">EM: Could we go back to your arrival in Majdanek?</span> <span id="s933">What was your impression?</span> <span id="s934">What did you know about Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">MF: Oh, we got a special treat, because we were the uprisers from the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s936">They put us in the Block 16.</span> <span id="s937">And there were about, I don’t know, there were plenty of Blocks on each side.</span> <span id="s938">There was a Block here and a Block there.</span> <span id="s939">And they put a fence around that Block.</span> <span id="s940">So, everyone knew who the uprisers are there.</span> <span id="s941">And we got special treatment.</span> <span id="s942">That means they woke you up in the morning with a baseball bat.</span> <span id="s943">And if you’re not out of bed after the whistle, a second later they were in the barrack and they were killing people.</span> <span id="s944">Just killing.</span> <span id="s945">So, we were there, I was there nine weeks.</span> <span id="s946">And I was already, I was just about ready for the garbage can.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">EM: Did you work at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s949">When you say work...</span></p> <p><span id="s950">EM: What...</span></p> <p><span id="s951">MF: We were beaten to death.</span> <span id="s952">They were just trying to kill us, that’s all.</span> <span id="s953">Anyway, so what happened was, I became friendly with a Polish fellow, by the name of Antek.</span> <span id="s954">He was a foreman or something.</span> <span id="s955">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s956">He was in the barracks there.</span> <span id="s957">Of course there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s958">EM: Now was he also a prisoner?</span> <span id="s959">An inmate?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">EM: He was an inmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">MF: Sure.</span> <span id="s963">He was an inmate.</span> <span id="s964">But he knew something was going on, so he saw me how I was, I couldn’t get in that barrack.</span> <span id="s965">I had to pull myself by the door handle.</span> <span id="s966">I was down already, I don’t know how many pounds.</span> <span id="s967">I was barely alive.</span> <span id="s968">And I was a young kid.</span> <span id="s969">So he said to me, “You’re not gonna live much longer.”</span> <span id="s970">He said, “I heard that they’re coming from labor camps, so you better get out of here.</span> <span id="s971">You just report, and they’ll take you to a labor camp and there you could survive.</span> <span id="s972">But here it’s just the end.”</span> <span id="s973">So, a couple of days later they came, Brown Shirts came, we didn’t know from where.</span> <span id="s974">I think that they were from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s975">Later on we found out.</span> <span id="s976">So I ran to the kitchen where my brother worked.</span> <span id="s977">He got himself a job, Julek got himself a job, my oldest brother, who is alive, got himself a job in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s978">He was peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s979">He was eating raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s980">And I found out that you can eat them and it won’t harm you.</span> <span id="s981">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s982">So I ran to him.</span> <span id="s983">I said, I knew, I told him what this fellow said.</span> <span id="s984">I said, “I’ll let you know.”</span> <span id="s985">So I ran and said, “Let’s go.”</span> <span id="s986">He says, “I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s987">I says, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s988">“I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s989">I says, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s990">“It doesn’t rain on me here.</span> <span id="s991">I’m eating raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s992">Nobody beats me.</span> <span id="s993">How long I’ll live, I’ll live.</span> <span id="s994">I’ll die anyway, so what’s, I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s995">So I didn’t go either.</span> <span id="s996">The next day Antek sees me.</span> <span id="s997">He says, “What the hell?</span> <span id="s998">Why didn’t you go?”</span> <span id="s999">So I told him what happened.</span> <span id="s1000">He says, “He doesn’t want to go?</span> <span id="s1001">So he stays, and you go.</span> <span id="s1002">Because you’re gonna die here.</span> <span id="s1003">Get out of here!</span> <span id="s1004">I’ll kill you if you don’t go with the next one, because they’re coming again.”</span> <span id="s1005">So I told him this.</span> <span id="s1006">The next day, it might be a day or two later, they came.</span> <span id="s1007">This one was, later on I found out it was from Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1008">It was a labor camp there.</span> <span id="s1009">So I ran to him again, and before he said something I said, “If you’re not going, I’m going by myself.</span> <span id="s1010">Because I’m gonna die.</span> <span id="s1011">And you’re gonna die, too.”</span> <span id="s1012">So he...I finally yelled at him so he threw the apron and said, “Oh what the hell, I’m going.”</span> <span id="s1013">So we went into a group.</span> <span id="s1014">We were about maybe four or five or, three, four hundred people.</span> <span id="s1015">I didn’t count them, I don’t know, a big, big group of people.</span> <span id="s1016">We stood in a row of five.</span> <span id="s1017">And I had swollen legs, and the ankles were swollen from hunger.</span> <span id="s1018">So they were Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s1019">So, first they said that you had to run about twenty, thirty meters.</span> <span id="s1020">Because who fell was too weak.</span> <span id="s1021">They don’t want to take weak people to work.</span> <span id="s1022">It was supposed to be a labor camp, work on ammunition or something.</span> <span id="s1023">I didn’t fall.</span> <span id="s1024">I made it.</span> <span id="s1025">I was, so I figure, I made it.</span> <span id="s1026">Not so fast.</span> <span id="s1027">So, they threw these, they didn’t kill them, they just threw, they killed them all later.</span> <span id="s1028">So they threw them out.</span> <span id="s1029">Then they, these Brown Shirts went again to the front of the group, and I was like in the middle.</span> <span id="s1030">There were five in a row and I was right in the middle of those five.</span> <span id="s1031">Two on my left, two on my right.</span> <span id="s1032">He goes up in the front and said, “Hosenhoch!”</span> <span id="s1033">Pull up your pants.</span> <span id="s1034">So whoever had swollen legs, “Raus,” threw them out.</span> <span id="s1035">So I said, “That’s the end of me.”</span> <span id="s1036">I had swollen ankles.</span> <span id="s1037">How did I get out?</span> <span id="s1038">And that was a God’s miracle.</span> <span id="s1039">You won’t believe this.</span> <span id="s1040">I don’t believe it myself.</span> <span id="s1041">He comes to my row just about ready, he had a row, the five in front of me, went forward.</span> <span id="s1042">They had, nobody had swollen legs, so they made it.</span> <span id="s1043">He just about opened his mouth and an S.S. man knocks on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s1044">He wants to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1045">So he turns around, and they started to talk.</span> <span id="s1046">So I said to the fellow in front of me, “You don’t have swollen legs.</span> <span id="s1047">Change with me.</span> <span id="s1048">You’ll make it again, and they’ll throw me out.”</span> <span id="s1049">So he says, “I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1050">I’m afraid.”</span> <span id="s1051">So, guys heard it around, so they said, “Change!</span> <span id="s1052">There’s a life to be saved!</span> <span id="s1053">If you don’t change, we’ll kill you!”</span> <span id="s1054">So they scared the hell out of him and we changed in a second.</span> <span id="s1055">And the moment we changed he, this...Brown Shirt changed around and said, “Hosenhoch!”</span> <span id="s1056">He pulled these pants up again and he got out and I got out.</span> <span id="s1057">That’s how I got out.</span> <span id="s1058">Wasn’t that a miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">EM: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">MF: I’m trembling when I hear it.</span> <span id="s1061">When I think about it that a few weeks later they machine gunned everybody there.</span> <span id="s1062">So we got to Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s1063">There’s another chapter.</span> <span id="s1064">We came in there and well, I was pretty weak.</span> <span id="s1065">My brother was all right, because he was in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1066">And we, there were three-, Werker, that means three branches of Werk, A Werk, B Werk… A, B, and C. I don’t know what Werk means in English, factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">EM: Factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">MF: Factories A, factory B and C. C was a killer, because they made some yellow stuff, the trotti, and they would all turn yellow.</span> <span id="s1069">Their clothes were yellow, their faces were yellow, and they died.</span> <span id="s1070">Somehow we got into Werk A. And we stand there and wait, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1071">A group comes from work, and I see a colleague of mine from when I was at Conservatory, Irene, who lives now in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">EM: A what?</span> <span id="s1073">A colleague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">MF: A colleague, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1075">She was a foreman.</span> <span id="s1076">She spoke German.</span> <span id="s1077">She got German, she had German in high school.</span> <span id="s1078">I had French.</span> <span id="s1079">She looked at me and said, “Boy, how do you look like?</span> <span id="s1080">It’s horrible!”</span> <span id="s1081">So she said, “I know somebody who gives, who is giving out a soup.</span> <span id="s1082">So I’ll talk to him and you’ll get an extra portion.”</span> <span id="s1083">So I got an extra portion and my brother, he got.</span> <span id="s1084">Then we, so he said, “Report here.</span> <span id="s1085">Otherwise you’ll be on Werk C; they’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s1086">So she told me I have Werk A, I mean that factory A.</span> <span id="s1087">So we were put in there and we made it.</span> <span id="s1088">So we got to Werk A.</span> <span id="s1089">Then came, and we got a job.</span> <span id="s1090">I sat in a hall, in a Halle, it means in a big...</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">EM: A big hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">MF: In a big hall.</span> <span id="s1093">And I was sitting there and cutting, it’s called Stützringe.</span> <span id="s1094">I don’t know how it is in English.</span> <span id="s1095">They were, a double things like this, like if you, those two glasses, and you cut it in the middle, they became two parts, from one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">EM: What was it, metal?</span> <span id="s1097">Was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">MF: It, yeah, metal.</span> <span id="s1099">It looked like maybe a part for a machine gun or something.</span> <span id="s1100">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1101">But I was, remember when I had to go to the men’s room, it must have been like from here almost to the road here, maybe a little closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">MF: It took me forever to make it.</span> <span id="s1104">And I saw it, where the guys were walking fast.</span> <span id="s1105">I said, “Did I used to walk that fast?”</span> <span id="s1106">I said, “I was walking like them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">MF: And they said, “The younger Filar is gonna kick the bucket.</span> <span id="s1109">It won’t take too long.”</span> <span id="s1110">In the meantime another miracle happened.</span> <span id="s1111">I once got a, an extra portion of marmalade.</span> <span id="s1112">I don’t know, remember how, but I got it.</span> <span id="s1113">I knew that marmalade doesn’t have much nourishment.</span> <span id="s1114">I wanted to have bread for it.</span> <span id="s1115">So I wanted to sell it.</span> <span id="s1116">Werk A wasn’t, where we worked it were not so, it was called Automaten, automatic.</span> <span id="s1117">We were working on automat-, and the Polacks were also working there because that was a Polish munitions factory before the war.</span> <span id="s1118">So they still worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">EM: This was in Skarzysko-Kamienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">So the Poles went home, and we went to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1122">So we had contact with the outside world through them.</span> <span id="s1123">But I didn’t think that anybody will do, you know, they were eating their soup.</span> <span id="s1124">But it was a next barrack, they were Narzedziownia used to be called, and the Polacks were a little richer there.</span> <span id="s1125">And I heard that they brought their soup from home and they were selling their soup.</span> <span id="s1126">So I sold my marmalade.</span> <span id="s1127">I got a whole zloty for it.</span> <span id="s1128">And there was a break, a lunch break.</span> <span id="s1129">So I went over to Narzedziownia and I asked one of the fellows working by, so I said, “Which of the Poles here sells his soup?”</span> <span id="s1130">So he shows me a, on a corner there’s a man there.</span> <span id="s1131">And he is not eating.</span> <span id="s1132">He is selling it.</span> <span id="s1133">So I went up to him and I asked him in Polish, “Pan te zupe sprzedal?”</span> <span id="s1134">So he looks at me and says, “How come you speak so perfect Polish?”</span> <span id="s1135">That was the first impression.</span> <span id="s1136">So I said, “Well, how come you do?</span> <span id="s1137">Did you go to school?</span> <span id="s1138">So did I. What’s the big deal?”</span> <span id="s1139">“Eat that soup.</span> <span id="s1140">I don’t want your money.</span> <span id="s1141">Come every day.”</span> <span id="s1142">So, he kind of got to like me.</span> <span id="s1143">He used to even give me a little piece of black bread once in a while.</span> <span id="s1144">So he asked me what I was doing, so I told him.</span> <span id="s1145">But he, we worked one week a day shift, one week night shift.</span> <span id="s1146">He worked only day shift.</span> <span id="s1147">So I only saw him one week, and then the second week I didn’t till we came back on day shift.</span> <span id="s1148">So one day he tells me that he is going to Warsaw because he broke his glasses, and they cannot fit his, fill his prescription in Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s1149">It’s a small town.</span> <span id="s1150">So he got a permit to ride a train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1151">He said, “Give me the address of your teacher, and I’ll go over there and tell him where you are.</span> <span id="s1152">Maybe he could help.”</span> <span id="s1153">So I, you know, tore off a piece of brown paper from the machine and I said, in Polish I said, “Uczciwy człowiek sam wszystko opowie,” and I signed my name with a nickname.</span> <span id="s1154">I had a nickname.</span> <span id="s1155">They used to call me by a nickname.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">EM: And what was your nickname?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">MF: No, it’s not important.</span> <span id="s1158">Maybe I will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">EM: [laughs] O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">MF: But that was a good sign, you know.</span> <span id="s1161">And so I signed it.</span> <span id="s1162">And he went, and then there was a night shift again for me.</span> <span id="s1163">So I had to wait another week.</span> <span id="s1164">Finally comes Monday at noontime and I..</span> <span id="s1165">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">EM: Wait, what was the name of the teacher that he went to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">MF: Zir-, Professor Drzewiecki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">EM: Drzewiecki.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">MF: He was the top musician in Poland.</span> <span id="s1170">He was the President of the Conservatory, President of the Chopin Society, Presi- [tape off then on].</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">MF: Yeah, and he was also the President of the Jury of the International Competition.</span> <span id="s1173">Now his student would be the President.</span> <span id="s1174">And I am invited to be there next year as a guest of honor.</span> <span id="s1175">Things change a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">EM: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1177">We’re going to talk about it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">MF: Yeah, O.K. So, anyway, finally came the Monday so I ran over to him.</span> <span id="s1179">And he came back, this Meister.</span> <span id="s1180">I don’t know his name.</span> <span id="s1181">I don’t think he ever told me his name.</span> <span id="s1182">But I found out later he was a Police Commissioner of Skarzysko-Kamienna before the war.</span> <span id="s1183">And I said, “Well?</span> <span id="s1184">Did you see my teacher?”</span> <span id="s1185">So he said, “Why are you in a hurry?</span> <span id="s1186">Eat the soup!”</span> <span id="s1187">I said, “Never mind the soup!</span> <span id="s1188">Did you see him?”</span> <span id="s1189">So he takes out a piece of white bread.</span> <span id="s1190">I said, “Hey, you couldn’t afford that.”</span> <span id="s1191">Yeah, once in a while a piece of black bread, O.K., but.</span> <span id="s1192">So he takes out a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s1193">And I said, “Ay, that’s not from you!”</span> <span id="s1194">I says, “You saw my teacher?”</span> <span id="s1195">He said, “Yes, I did.”</span> <span id="s1196">“So what happened?”</span> <span id="s1197">“Well, I went up there...” Now Marszalkowska 17, it’s still there.</span> <span id="s1198">I saw it when I was there a couple of months ago.</span> <span id="s1199">We were inside the house.</span> <span id="s1200">It stays.</span> <span id="s1201">“And I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1202">He opened the door himself on the chain.”</span> <span id="s1203">He said, “I have regards for you from your .</span> <span id="s1204">student, Marian Filar.”</span> <span id="s1205">He said, “I never heard of him.”</span> <span id="s1206">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s1207">He didn’t know who the guy was.</span> <span id="s1208">Maybe he is a Gestapo agent or something.</span> <span id="s1209">So he shoved in the little brown paper through the crack in the door.</span> <span id="s1210">So he looked, “Heh!</span> <span id="s1211">Is he alive?</span> <span id="s1212">Come on in!”</span> <span id="s1213">So he opened the door, he says, “Well, we thought he is already dead.”</span> <span id="s1214">“No, no.</span> <span id="s1215">He is in Skarzysko-Kamienna working there, you know, as a slave.”</span> <span id="s1216">So he gave him his suit.</span> <span id="s1217">He gave him a couple of shirts.</span> <span id="s1218">He gave him his shoes.</span> <span id="s1219">And I wore, I was wearing those wooden, Dutch shoes, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">MF: They weigh a ton a shoe.</span> <span id="s1222">And with the little swollen legs, it was a killer.</span> <span id="s1223">You had to drag like this to walk.</span> <span id="s1224">And he gave him, what else he gave him?</span> <span id="s1225">I know, a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1226">And he came back.</span> <span id="s1227">So he said, “I’ll bring you the shoes, but I can’t bring two at the same time because I’m also searched.</span> <span id="s1228">So I’ll bring you one tomorrow and one the day after.”</span> <span id="s1229">And he gave him some money, too, I think.</span> <span id="s1230">I said, “Don’t bring me the suit.</span> <span id="s1231">What, I’m gonna dress in a suit?</span> <span id="s1232">They’ll hang me.</span> <span id="s1233">Sell it, and we’ll get some food for it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">MF: So he did that.</span> <span id="s1236">Then I got a contact, yeah, and some of the Jewish fellows were warning me.</span> <span id="s1237">They said, “You’re dealing with that guy?</span> <span id="s1238">He’s a thief!</span> <span id="s1239">He is stealing!</span> <span id="s1240">They sent him to, they got some gold or something and he said he never found it, whatever.”</span> <span id="s1241">I said, “I don’t have any problem whatsoever, nothing.”</span> <span id="s1242">Then he contacted some other people, and once I got, through this fellow, he sent 500 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1243">That was a fortune!</span> <span id="s1244">We count it in bread.</span> <span id="s1245">And a beautiful letter from a mother of a student of mine, Marisha Sobel was her name.</span> <span id="s1246">She lives in California now, and her mother is dead.</span> <span id="s1247">They were Catholics, Polacks.</span> <span id="s1248">And she sent me 500 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1249">So, and a beautiful letter.</span> <span id="s1250">So I went to the men’s room.</span> <span id="s1251">My brother was standing in front of the door of that men’s room.</span> <span id="s1252">And I sat down, you know, pretending that I’m sitting.</span> <span id="s1253">And I read it and I cried and I put it down and pulled the chain.</span> <span id="s1254">And then we could, so we started to eat better.</span> <span id="s1255">And all of a sudden the guy that was selling food says, “That younger Filar is looking better.</span> <span id="s1256">We thought he’s gonna kick the bucket.</span> <span id="s1257">Look!</span> <span id="s1258">He looks better!</span> <span id="s1259">He must have some contact from the outside.”</span> <span id="s1260">You know?</span> <span id="s1261">And I got back on my feet, but it took a while.</span> <span id="s1262">Anyway, then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">EM: How long were you in Skarzysko-Kamienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">MF: Oh, that was maybe fourteen months.</span> <span id="s1265">Wait a minute, well, I was nine weeks in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1266">They took us there in ‘43, in May, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1267">So May, June, May, let’s say June, July, it’s in July or August.</span> <span id="s1268">They took us from Skarzysko to Buchenwald, because the front was getting closer.</span> <span id="s1269">That was ‘44 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s1271">So you were how many months you said?</span> <span id="s1272">Several months in Skarzysko-Kamienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">MF: Oh, about fourteen months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">EM: Fourteen months, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">MF: It was twelve, fourteen, something like that.</span> <span id="s1276">And we arrived in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1277">First we arrived at the station called Weimar, like the house, the city of Göthe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">MF: And there was a sign.</span> <span id="s1280">Now we were now about fifty in a car.</span> <span id="s1281">We didn’t have any luggage.</span> <span id="s1282">We just had our uniform, you know [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">EM: And were the Poles also moved or only the Jews?</span> <span id="s1284">Did they take only the Jews to Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1285">Because the front was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">MF: I know, I was only in company of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1287">So those who were in the uniform.</span> <span id="s1288">We used to call that Hitler’s tails.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1290">What, with the striped uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">MF: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1292">So, when we arrived in Buchenwald, and I see a sign saying, “Elf kilometers now to Buchenwald, eleven kilometers now to Buchenwald.”</span> <span id="s1293">I said, “Fellas, let’s have a feast.</span> <span id="s1294">Where is something to eat?</span> <span id="s1295">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1296">Tomorrow you’re gonna be all dead.”</span> <span id="s1297">In the meantime the German, the S.S. comes out to the windows, through that little windows.</span> <span id="s1298">They knock on the door and said, “Do you have any Polish zlotys?</span> <span id="s1299">We’ll buy them from you.</span> <span id="s1300">We’ll give you food.</span> <span id="s1301">Where you’re going...”</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">EM: Well, where were you, in some barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">MF: No, we were still on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">EM: Oh, in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">MF: At the station in Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">EM: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">MF: And he said, “We’re going back for, to bring other transports, so we’ll take your zlotys which you have, if you have any with you, and we’ll give you bread for it.”</span> <span id="s1308">They were dealing, doing business with us, the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">EM: They were S.S. men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1311">So, what do you have to do?</span> <span id="s1312">We gave it, whoever had some got some extra bread.</span> <span id="s1313">And then we got to Buchenwald, and we saw Buchenwald says, “Arbeit Macht Frei.”</span> <span id="s1314">That’s a very famous line, “Work Makes You Free.”</span> <span id="s1315">Free to go to hell.</span> <span id="s1316">Free to get killed.</span> <span id="s1317">And so we came in there, but they didn’t take us into the regular camp.</span> <span id="s1318">They took us in the so-called Zeltlager.</span> <span id="s1319">That was a, we were in transit.</span> <span id="s1320">So we were there about ten days.</span> <span id="s1321">Zeltlager means a, a Zelt is a, well you know what a..</span> <span id="s1322">.</span> <span id="s1323">[tape off then on] [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">EM: [unclear], yeah, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">MF: Yeah, that was that little, little place...</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">EM: The Zeltlager was tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">MF: With tents, yeah, tents.</span> <span id="s1328">Because we were already factory workers, ammunition.</span> <span id="s1329">We were professionals.</span> <span id="s1330">So we just came there to be entlaust, that means take the lice out if we have any, and steal everything what we accumulated maybe.</span> <span id="s1331">And by the way when I put my teacher’s shoes on, they were ideal.</span> <span id="s1332">We had the same size shoe.</span> <span id="s1333">I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1334">And all of a sudden, getting out of those Dutch wooden shoes, which weighed a ton each, with my legs, you know, and getting into the regular shoes, and all of a sudden I felt like I’m walking on a cloud.</span> <span id="s1335">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1336">It was just like heaven.</span> <span id="s1337">By God, I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s1338">So, and then we didn’t see any S.S. in that Zeltlager.</span> <span id="s1339">Who came in?</span> <span id="s1340">Well, you know, there were people, members of government.</span> <span id="s1341">Leon Blum was there.</span> <span id="s1342">Daladier was there.</span> <span id="s1343">There were some clergy there from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s1344">And that Zeltlager was run by high political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1345">You know, people of, from different governments.</span> <span id="s1346">And they came to us and they said, “You are not gonna stay here.</span> <span id="s1347">They gonna send you to another camp where you’re gonna produce some ammunition, whatever, because you’re already considered professional factory workers, munition workers.</span> <span id="s1348">So if you have any collaborators among you, we’ll set up here a democratic court, and they’ll be convicted, and you’ll go without them because they’ll be drinking your blood all over again if you take them along wherever you go.”</span> <span id="s1349">So somebody got up and pointed out to a police chief and another guy—there were two guys—and I was at, I witnessed the court and I knew one, the Magazinier, who was the Magazinier.</span> <span id="s1350">[store keeper, warehouseman]</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">EM: Was it a Jew?</span> <span id="s1352">Was it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">MF: Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">EM: Jews?</span> <span id="s1355">Well, because you mean a police chief.</span> <span id="s1356">Who...</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">MF: He was a camp, in the camp where the police, Jewish police…</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">EM: Oh you mean, and was he a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">MF: So there was a tr-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">EM: Was it a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">MF: Yeah, something like this.</span> <span id="s1362">But then the Magazinier I remember the winter came and he’s still in Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s1363">And Irene introduced me to him.</span> <span id="s1364">She knew him.</span> <span id="s1365">So that started to get very cold.</span> <span id="s1366">So I went in there, and he had, they had coats and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1367">So I said, “Give me a coat for the winter.”</span> <span id="s1368">So he gave me a three-quarter coat.</span> <span id="s1369">I said, “How about my brother?”</span> <span id="s1370">He said, “I don’t have anything for your brother.</span> <span id="s1371">The brother!</span> <span id="s1372">Every time I send somebody over they say ‘Your brother’.”</span> <span id="s1373">I said, “Yeah, he is my brother.”</span> <span id="s1374">So he said, “I don’t have any for your brother.”</span> <span id="s1375">I took off the coat, I says, “Keep this one too.</span> <span id="s1376">The hell with you.</span> <span id="s1377">I’m gonna walk out with this and he’ll freeze to death?”</span> <span id="s1378">He says, “Come back!</span> <span id="s1379">Come back!”</span> <span id="s1380">He gave me a coat for my brother.</span> <span id="s1381">But he also had shoes and things and they were digging into those clothes because there were, all kinds of, people were hiding their gold and diamonds, whatever.</span> <span id="s1382">So when we arrived in Buchenwald, I want to tell you this, and we’re sitting there waiting to get into the shower, we didn’t know if it’s gonna be a shower or it’s gonna be gas.</span> <span id="s1383">So, people who were already in camp in the uniforms, in the striped uni-, we were also in striped uniforms but, so they were showing us, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1384">You’re gonna have water.</span> <span id="s1385">We know.</span> <span id="s1386">Because you’re gonna work.</span> <span id="s1387">You know, so you don’t have to worry about it.”</span> <span id="s1388">So we went into this barrack.</span> <span id="s1389">We had to undress, completely naked, and there were barbers there.</span> <span id="s1390">And then it was thousands of people there, lights, you know, and tables.</span> <span id="s1391">And the S.S. was there.</span> <span id="s1392">You have to put, so I had my teacher’s shoes.</span> <span id="s1393">I took everything off.</span> <span id="s1394">I still had the shoes on.</span> <span id="s1395">Yeah, so before I went to this fellow and I said, “Listen, you must have a lot of stuff on you, because you’re the Magazinier.”</span> <span id="s1396">I said, “Give me something.</span> <span id="s1397">I’ll risk.</span> <span id="s1398">I’ll, if you have a gold, maybe a gold coin or something and I’ll take it through.</span> <span id="s1399">If I take it through and they kill me, they’ll kill me anyway.</span> <span id="s1400">So what’s the difference?</span> <span id="s1401">And you’ll give me something for it, O.K.?”</span> <span id="s1402">So he gave me a piece of bread with a [unclear] and said, “Inside there is a ten dollar gold, an American eagle, ten dollars.”</span> <span id="s1403">So I go back and we sit down and wait and my brother says to me, “You’re crazy!</span> <span id="s1404">They’re gonna kill you!</span> <span id="s1405">What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1406">I said, “What are you going?</span> <span id="s1407">You think you’re going to a spa?</span> <span id="s1408">They’ll kill me anyway.</span> <span id="s1409">This way maybe if I get through we’ll get something.”</span> <span id="s1410">We go in there, so they took our, we took our clothes off.</span> <span id="s1411">And I still had the shoes on, and there was a big table between us, not this wide, but you know, like this.</span> <span id="s1412">And the S.S. was behind, so I took everything off and he says, “Hast schon alles abgegeben?”</span> <span id="s1413">[Have you turned in everything?]</span> <span id="s1414">And I had the piece under my mouth, under my tongue.</span> <span id="s1415">And I’m gonna get one now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">EM: Continuing with the interview with Professor Filar.</span> <span id="s1418">This is tape two, side one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">MF: So the Germans said to me, “Hast du schon alles abgegeben?”</span> <span id="s1420">I still had my shoes on.</span> <span id="s1421">Or no, oh yeah, so I..</span> <span id="s1422">.</span> <span id="s1423">no, I already, yeah, I did have my shoes on.</span> <span id="s1424">So he said, “Hast du schon alles abgegeben?”</span> <span id="s1425">So I “nicked” my head.</span> <span id="s1426">[He seems to mean “nod”] So he asked me again.</span> <span id="s1427">So I bent down and took my shoe off and spit this ten dollar gold piece on my hand, and kept on the knees so I put the shoe on, “hab schon alles,” “I already gave everything.”</span> <span id="s1428">So he went away.</span> <span id="s1429">I bent down again, put it back into my mouth, took the second shoe off and put it up and went there to the doorway.</span> <span id="s1430">We went to the shower.</span> <span id="s1431">And the S.S. man points his finger at my mouth.</span> <span id="s1432">And I thought he is saying something, and I was scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1433">But it was so much lights, the fluorescent lights, that he couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s1434">And I realized in a second that he’s pointing to my little mustache.</span> <span id="s1435">I had a little mustache where the barber forgot to take off.</span> <span id="s1436">So I stood at attention and I turned around and I went to the, to one of the barbers.</span> <span id="s1437">There were many of them.</span> <span id="s1438">There were thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1439">It was a tremendous hall.</span> <span id="s1440">And I pointed.</span> <span id="s1441">I “nicked” him.</span> <span id="s1442">I didn’t know what language he spoke.</span> <span id="s1443">And I pointed at my mustache.</span> <span id="s1444">So he took it off.</span> <span id="s1445">I went back to the same S.S. man, stood at attention real good.</span> <span id="s1446">He said, “Right!”</span> <span id="s1447">And I passed.</span> <span id="s1448">I went in and I had the ten-dollar gold piece.</span> <span id="s1449">The others, they, if they woulda asked me to open my mouth so I would have been shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1450">And they did it.</span> <span id="s1451">They were doing it with every so many.</span> <span id="s1452">They asked them to open their mouths.</span> <span id="s1453">It’s called a Stichprobe.</span> <span id="s1454">[spot check] So I got in there and we passed into a shower.</span> <span id="s1455">It wasn’t any gas.</span> <span id="s1456">And then we, when we came into a Zeltlager, that was a part of the camp which, where only, what’s the word?</span> <span id="s1457">[tape off then on] There were no barracks there.</span> <span id="s1458">There were only tents.</span> <span id="s1459">That was a temporary thing because we were already professional ammunition workers, so we just came there to be entlaust.</span> <span id="s1460">[deloused] I mean, if you have any lice or something, which we, I don’t think, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1461">And then to change uniforms and take everything away from us which maybe we accumulated, and send us to a different labor camp.</span> <span id="s1462">So the tent camp was run, they said all the camp was run by the inmates.</span> <span id="s1463">There were people who were members of French government, of Belgian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">EM: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">MF: Of others, there were, Léon Blum was there.</span> <span id="s1466">Prime Minister Daladier was there.</span> <span id="s1467">Clergy were there.</span> <span id="s1468">There were all kinds of great people in that camp.</span> <span id="s1469">So they were running the camp.</span> <span id="s1470">They were just, the S.S. just came in the morning for the roll call and that was it.</span> <span id="s1471">We never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">EM: But this camp, this tent camp, it was connected to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">MF: It was Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">EM: But it was part of Buch-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">MF: It was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1476">It was just tent camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">EM: Part...</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">MF: And we were never in a barrack, just those.</span> <span id="s1479">And thank God it didn’t rain.</span> <span id="s1480">We were there about ten days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">EM: How about all these famous people, Blum and so on, were they also in the tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">MF: Well, I never met them.</span> <span id="s1483">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">EM: You did… but, oh, you said they were running that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">MF: The, all...yeah, the political...</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">EM: Oh O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">MF: Prisoners were running it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">MF: There were two types.</span> <span id="s1490">There were political prisoners had a triangle, a red triangle.</span> <span id="s1491">The criminals had a green triangle.</span> <span id="s1492">And they were trying always to run the camp through the green ones because they could be bribed.</span> <span id="s1493">The political, high people, they couldn’t, but the people with the red ones organized so that they were running the camp.</span> <span id="s1494">So they said, “If you have any traitors here or collaborators with the S.S., tell us.</span> <span id="s1495">We’ll make here a democratic court.</span> <span id="s1496">We’ll keep them here.</span> <span id="s1497">They won’t go with you because they’ll drink your blood all over again.”</span> <span id="s1498">So somebody got up and said this, the chief of the police in camp was one.</span> <span id="s1499">His name was Krzepicki, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">EM: Oh, that’s not the Jewish man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">MF: A Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s1502">No, he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">EM: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">MF: And the other was Tepperman.</span> <span id="s1505">He was the guy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">EM: Tepperman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">MF: Tepperman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">EM: Tepperman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">MF: Tepper-, T-E.</span> <span id="s1510">Tepperman.</span> <span id="s1511">And he was the, he was running the Magazin...</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">EM: The storage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">MF: With clothes and all, yeah.</span> <span id="s1514">Irene introduced me to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">EM: Yeah, you mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">MF: Then when the winter came, I wanted to have a coat.</span> <span id="s1517">That was cold.</span> <span id="s1518">You know what we had, those little things like pajamas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">MF: So, because I knew Irene and she was a pretty decent girl, it had nothing to do with it, so he gave me a three-quarter coat, a heavy coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">MF: And I said, “How about my brother?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">EM: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s1524">You mentioned...</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">MF: You have it already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">EM: Yeah, you mentioned that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">MF: So I got it for him, too, and we were there about 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">EM: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1529">That was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">MF: And then all of a sudden they loaded us on trains.</span> <span id="s1531">But I went back!</span> <span id="s1532">I’m already in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">EM: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s1534">You were already, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">MF: I’m all messed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">EM: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">MF: So they took us from Buchenwald, they took us to Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">EM: Schlieben?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">MF: On a train, Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">EM: How...</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">MF: Near Leipzig, between Leipzig and Halle.</span> <span id="s1542">That’s a little east Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">EM: And that was Schlieben.</span> <span id="s1544">S-C-H-L-I-E-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">MF: S-C-H-L-I-E-B-E-N, Schlieben.</span> <span id="s1546">And there was a factory of bazookas.</span> <span id="s1547">And there, when we arrived there, the Germans, yeah, well there were some Germans among us who were prisoners, in camp.</span> <span id="s1548">They were Democrats, or Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s1549">They were also in concentration.</span> <span id="s1550">I remember one was a Blockältester.</span> <span id="s1551">In other words he was the leader of the Block over there.</span> <span id="s1552">But a Block could have had a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s1553">And he would go to the kitchen and order how many people he has on a Block and he’ll get so much food, so much bread, whatever rations and so on.</span> <span id="s1554">So he came to us, said the S.S. came to him, because Germans talked to Germans.</span> <span id="s1555">And he said, “We don’t have to be afraid.</span> <span id="s1556">They are businessmen.</span> <span id="s1557">They are looking for dollars and gold.</span> <span id="s1558">And they are going to give us food for it.</span> <span id="s1559">They’re not gonna kill anybody, not to be afraid.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">EM: That was in Schlieben?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">MF: In Schlieben.</span> <span id="s1562">And that was in 1944.</span> <span id="s1563">The Germans already knew they’re losing the war.</span> <span id="s1564">So I had my ten dollar gold piece.</span> <span id="s1565">So I told the Blockältester—he was a decent fellow, I knew him, he was in his 70’s then, he was in camp about ten years already—so I said, “I have a ten-dollar gold piece.</span> <span id="s1566">What can I get?”</span> <span id="s1567">He said, “Well, I’ll try the best for you.”</span> <span id="s1568">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">EM: Excuse me, do you by any chance remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">MF: No, I never knew his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">MF: He was just Blockältester, period.</span> <span id="s1573">I know he was from East Germany.</span> <span id="s1574">Later we, so I’ll tell you this later.</span> <span id="s1575">So I gave him this ten-dollar gold piece and he brought me, we got for three months over there an extra piece of bread, a little bit of marmalade and every other day a little tiny slice of salami, and twenty dollars paper back, change!</span> <span id="s1576">Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1577">They were businessmen!</span> <span id="s1578">I couldn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s1579">I saw twenty!</span> <span id="s1580">And my brother kept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">EM: They wanted the gold, so they wanted the gold...</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">MF: Get all the gold, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">EM: So they gave you the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">MF: Yeah, and we, for about three months we had some extra food.</span> <span id="s1585">Then, the Lagerkommandant, a big tall S.S. man, he came out once.</span> <span id="s1586">We, and he called, he was looking for dentists.</span> <span id="s1587">“Not to worry.</span> <span id="s1588">I need dentists because I want to set up a dental office here.”</span> <span id="s1589">And so, we saw that they mean business, whatever it was, so two or three people stood forward.</span> <span id="s1590">They did it, they opened up a dental...</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">EM: Clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">MF: Room somewhere and they brought a chair and all this.</span> <span id="s1593">And the Jewish dentists were getting into the Hitler mouths, fixing their teeths for free.</span> <span id="s1594">Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1595">So I sneaked in once in a while and they looked at my teeth.</span> <span id="s1596">Otherwise I would have had nothing today.</span> <span id="s1597">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s1598">Then the Lagerkommandant came out and said, “I need a musician.”</span> <span id="s1599">So I started to tremble.</span> <span id="s1600">The men knew it, so they pointed at me.</span> <span id="s1601">So I had to step forward.</span> <span id="s1602">So he says, “I want the group to go to work with singing, and I’ll give you the music.</span> <span id="s1603">You teach them, you pick those who can sing.”</span> <span id="s1604">And I remember some of the songs.</span> <span id="s1605">We had to go with singing in the morning to the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">EM: Were they all German songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">MF: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1608">I remember, some of it I remember.</span> <span id="s1609">Anyway, and there was one “Voll Mädchen” and there was one “Von Schlieben, Auf Schlieben Fluten Fand ich den Tod”, [phonetic] something, something.</span> <span id="s1610">What the hell, there’re so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">MF: It was forty some years.</span> <span id="s1613">But when I think about it I can remember it.</span> <span id="s1614">So that’s all it was.</span> <span id="s1615">Then I got a job as a Holzhacker [wood chopper] across from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1616">I had a ball then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">EM: But Schlieben you said was a factory where they made bazookas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">MF: Bazookas, yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">EM: But you weren’t working with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">MF: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">MF: I got a job, I sometimes figured out how, I don’t know, and I got a job on a hall across from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1623">And we were sawing wood, cutting juice up, I mean wood for the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1624">And there were maids there.</span> <span id="s1625">We didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s1626">They were pushing out those big canisters and said, “Wash it out.”</span> <span id="s1627">We were giving them wood.</span> <span id="s1628">And then I heard some of them speak Polish.</span> <span id="s1629">I said, “Hey!</span> <span id="s1630">Where you from?”</span> <span id="s1631">One was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1632">Well, I know how to talk to a Warsaw girl.</span> <span id="s1633">Before you knew it she became friends with me.</span> <span id="s1634">So she said, “Bring me your menaszka, I mean that little container where you get your soup.</span> <span id="s1635">Put it into an S.S. container, a big one, and give it to me.</span> <span id="s1636">I’ll bring it.</span> <span id="s1637">I’ll, you give it to me after you’ve washed it out, and I’ll steal S.S. food, bring it in that thing, shove it out, tell you to wash it out.</span> <span id="s1638">You take it in there and you take you some and you have good food.”</span> <span id="s1639">So I had a ball that way.</span> <span id="s1640">But then they took us away from there and we got a job, oh no, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1641">They took us away because we created a sabotage.</span> <span id="s1642">So we created a sabotage.</span> <span id="s1643">It was the night shift.</span> <span id="s1644">I was that time on the day shift.</span> <span id="s1645">I was sleeping on my bunk bed.</span> <span id="s1646">And about two o’clock in the morning the wall from our barrack just flew out, the whole wall.</span> <span id="s1647">You know, there could have been about twenty, thirty beds there.</span> <span id="s1648">The whole thing just flew.</span> <span id="s1649">It was a tremendous explosion.</span> <span id="s1650">There were hundreds of thousands of tons of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1651">They created a sabotage and the Germans couldn’t produce a bazooka for about three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">EM: Who took part in that sabotage?</span> <span id="s1653">Do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">MF: The night shift.</span> <span id="s1655">I don’t know who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">EM: The night shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">MF: Nobody talked.</span> <span id="s1658">Nobody would say it, in case somebody gets caught and beaten to death to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">MF: Nobody knew it.</span> <span id="s1661">It happened, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">EM: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1663">So there were not only Jews working there.</span> <span id="s1664">There were Poles and other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">MF: No, no, we were Jews.</span> <span id="s1666">In that camp we were Jews.</span> <span id="s1667">Just Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">EM: Because you said you met this one Polish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">MF: And that was in Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">EM: Oh, that was in Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">MF: In Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1672">There was a Pole in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1673">Thanks to him I got out.</span> <span id="s1674">He gave me the idea to, you know, that I said...</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">EM: No, no, I mean, here the woman that gave you the S.S. food.</span> <span id="s1676">That was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">MF: That was in Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">EM: Yeah, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">EM: That was a Jewish girl or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">MF: No, they were Poles.</span> <span id="s1682">They were in separate barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">EM: Oh, they were in separate barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">MF: In separate, we never saw them.</span> <span id="s1685">But we just had contact during, in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1686">Like...</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">EM: Do you know if the sabotage was done by Jews or by Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">MF: There were no Poles there.</span> <span id="s1689">It had to be by Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">EM: Because you said, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">MF: There were only Polish women there who worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1692">They went to a different part.</span> <span id="s1693">We never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">MF: In the camp where we were were only Jews and a few Germans.</span> <span id="s1696">Our Lagerältester, that means the leader of our Lager, was a German Democrat.</span> <span id="s1697">He was a German, who was in camp as a prisoner, like we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">EM: Now, so that means that the sabotage was done by the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">MF: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">EM: O.K. Because that’s important that we have...</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">MF: Right.</span> <span id="s1702">Anyway, so they sent in young S.S., 18-, 19-year-old boys, grew up under Hitler, and they were killers.</span> <span id="s1703">Every time somebody came from work, you saw white bandaged heads.</span> <span id="s1704">They were beating you like hell, you know, to rebuild everything fast.</span> <span id="s1705">Then they took me away from that work and they put me to a Kommando of eight people, called Zundhütchen [percussion] Abbau.</span> <span id="s1706">[demolition]</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">EM: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">MF: It’s in German, Zundhütchen Abbau.</span> <span id="s1709">I’ll tell you what it is.</span> <span id="s1710">A bullet, the Hülse, [shell or cartridge case] how is a Hülse in German?</span> <span id="s1711">I don’t know the names in English.</span> <span id="s1712">The bullet has the explosive part...</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">EM: Right, the container.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">MF: And that, the container.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">MF: The container has a red dot there, where the gun when it hits, so it hits that red thing and explodes there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">MF: So that’s called a Zundhütchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">EM: Zundhütchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">MF: Zundhütchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">MF: So we were supposed to take the machinery from that Zundhütchen factory.</span> <span id="s1723">They didn’t want it there, for what reason we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1724">We had to push that to a forest, to a..</span> <span id="s1725">.</span> <span id="s1726">railroad tracks and put them on the flatbeds there.</span> <span id="s1727">So we were eight people with Brechstangen.</span> <span id="s1728">[crowbars] I don’t know the names in English, you know?</span> <span id="s1729">With some iron bars...</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">EM: Bars, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">MF: To push it like this on wheels.</span> <span id="s1732">And that’s how we got it.</span> <span id="s1733">So I’m working there one day and comes, it was Christmas, ‘44.</span> <span id="s1734">One of our foremen, Lupeg was his name, comes to me.</span> <span id="s1735">And he says, “Where the hell are you?</span> <span id="s1736">We were looking for, we thought you ran away!</span> <span id="s1737">I’m looking for you half a day already!”</span> <span id="s1738">I said, “What’s the big deal?”</span> <span id="s1739">“They brought a piano from a farmer and our boys...” They emptied one of the holes where the last operation of the bazookas was on table, because they put four bazookas in a container.</span> <span id="s1740">And the German girls put incendiaries, make sure there’s no sabotage, and they closed it.</span> <span id="s1741">So that that was on tables.</span> <span id="s1742">So they took the tables out and our men are building a little stage.</span> <span id="s1743">And they brought a piano from a, Bauer, from a farmer.</span> <span id="s1744">“And I told the chief of the camp that we have a concert pianist here.”</span> <span id="s1745">I said, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1746">They’re gonna kill me!</span> <span id="s1747">They don’t want people with education!</span> <span id="s1748">What’d you do?”</span> <span id="s1749">I yelled at him.</span> <span id="s1750">He said, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1751">I know the guy.</span> <span id="s1752">He can only help you.</span> <span id="s1753">Come on, he’s waiting.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">EM: And that was a German...</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">MF: Yeah, sure!</span> <span id="s1756">He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">MF: The leader of the camp but he was in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1759">So I come in, he had a Hakenkreuz [swastika] here on the lapel.</span> <span id="s1760">So I come in and stand on attention...and he looks at me and says, “Spielst du Klavier?”</span> <span id="s1761">[Do you play piano?]</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">MF: I already spoke some German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">MF: I picked it up because... “Do you play the piano?”</span> <span id="s1766">So I said, “I used to play.</span> <span id="s1767">But look at my hands, look at the calluses.”</span> <span id="s1768">“Yah, yah, sure.”</span> <span id="s1769">He said, “O.K., where did you study?”</span> <span id="s1770">Oh, I don’t know what Lopeg told him and I’m afraid to lie.</span> <span id="s1771">So they’re gonna kill me anyway, the hell with you.</span> <span id="s1772">I said, “Yeah, I graduated at Conservatory summa cum laude.</span> <span id="s1773">I started my career and the war broke out.”</span> <span id="s1774">“Do you play The Moonlight Sonata of Beethoven?”</span> <span id="s1775">So I said, “Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1776">I used to play it, you know.”</span> <span id="s1777">“Would you like to play it?”</span> <span id="s1778">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s1779">What we gonna do?</span> <span id="s1780">It can only help, I figured.</span> <span id="s1781">I went up to the stage, I looked at the piano and almost fainted.</span> <span id="s1782">A beaten up jalopy from a, you know, just [unclear], I mean from a..</span> <span id="s1783">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">EM: Farmer?</span> <span id="s1785">From...</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">MF: Yeah, from a farmer, with one pedal.</span> <span id="s1787">You can’t imagine what it was.</span> <span id="s1788">But the slow mov-, and then I, the slow movement, the first movement is slow.</span> <span id="s1789">So I played it and he saw that I knew it.</span> <span id="s1790">So he stopped me after I finished the first movement and he says, “Spielst Du die Zweite Rhapsodie from Liszt?”</span> <span id="s1791">[Will you play The Second Rhapsody from Liszt?)</span> <span id="s1792">So I said, “Now I have a sadist in front of me.”</span> <span id="s1793">With what technique could anybody play The Second?</span> <span id="s1794">But the beginning of it is slow.</span> <span id="s1795">If you know the beginning of it.</span> <span id="s1796">It goes, [hums the music].</span> <span id="s1797">And so on.</span> <span id="s1798">It takes a short while, but while I was playing there was another German came up to this guy, and they walked away.</span> <span id="s1799">So I didn’t have to play the fast part.</span> <span id="s1800">I was safe.</span> <span id="s1801">I went back to my work.</span> <span id="s1802">But there were rumors going around that those guys, those eight, we looked a little better than the others.</span> <span id="s1803">Why?</span> <span id="s1804">Because some of the machinery was not in the factory grounds yet.</span> <span id="s1805">They were dispersed among different farmers in the stodotach.</span> <span id="s1806">How do you, stodota in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">EM: Barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">MF: No, it’s not a barrack.</span> <span id="s1809">A, on a, you know, where they keep their hay and all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">EM: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s1811">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">MF: Stodota.</span> <span id="s1813">O.K. [tape off then on] Piano, coming from a barn or something.</span> <span id="s1814">It was a little piece of, a real piece of junk.</span> <span id="s1815">Anyway, but we used to get, some of the machinery was still in barns.</span> <span id="s1816">They didn’t bring them yet into the camp so we had to go there and get them.</span> <span id="s1817">So we made a 50-50 with the Magazinier.</span> <span id="s1818">[warehouseman] We wore two or three shirts, and the farmers were buying them from us, was giving us, they were giving us extra food.</span> <span id="s1819">So we looked a little better because we had some extra food to eat.</span> <span id="s1820">So the guys in the camp said, “Oh, these two, they’re gonna put them to trote.”</span> <span id="s1821">They were big containers, because a bazooka has a head.</span> <span id="s1822">And a head, you know, a head which penetrates the tank when it’s being shot, [unclear].</span> <span id="s1823">So in the head is tretil.</span> <span id="s1824">That’s a chemical, a yellow chemical.</span> <span id="s1825">And they were boiling it in tremendously big containers like two, three thousand liters or maybe more.</span> <span id="s1826">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1827">You had to go up on a ladder, walk around it and it was, and the fumes were coming out of it.</span> <span id="s1828">Germans worked there with gas masks.</span> <span id="s1829">They worked a day, had two days off or something, special food.</span> <span id="s1830">Us they put there where we were.</span> <span id="s1831">If you survived two, three weeks, you drop dead, they took other guys.</span> <span id="s1832">So we were afraid they’re gonna take us to that work because you know, we looked a little better.</span> <span id="s1833">And so, and this was gonna finish.</span> <span id="s1834">We’ll take all the machinery out, and then what?</span> <span id="s1835">So one lunch, after a lunch break one of our guys comes out in a whirr, he says, “Hey!</span> <span id="s1836">I got a new job!”</span> <span id="s1837">Because he was worried.</span> <span id="s1838">He was smart, and he went to the fire department and says, “I became a fireman.</span> <span id="s1839">After I’m finished here I’ll be a fireman.”</span> <span id="s1840">So I said, “He got something.</span> <span id="s1841">I’m gonna try, too, because that’s the end.”</span> <span id="s1842">So one lunch break I’m walking through the grounds of the factory, tremendous grounds, and I see my, the chief, who I played the piano for.</span> <span id="s1843">He’s going this way and I’m going, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">EM: Yeah, in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">MF: In the, toward his direction.</span> <span id="s1846">And I said, “Now or never.”</span> <span id="s1847">And I got up to him and I stood at attention.</span> <span id="s1848">I, my luck was that I spoke German already.</span> <span id="s1849">And I said, “Herr Chef, erinnern Sie sich, ich habe Ihnen Klavier vorgespielt vor zwei Wochen?”</span> <span id="s1850">You know, “I played it for you, the piano, two weeks ago?”</span> <span id="s1851">“Ja, ja, was willst Du denn?”</span> <span id="s1852">“Yeah, what do you want?”</span> <span id="s1853">I said, “Should I survive the war, I would like to play the piano.</span> <span id="s1854">I have no other reason to live.</span> <span id="s1855">My family is already murdered.</span> <span id="s1856">Could you find me a job where I can save my hands?”</span> <span id="s1857">And I looked him straight in the eye.</span> <span id="s1858">So he thought for a moment and he says, “Wer ist Dein Meister?”</span> <span id="s1859">“Who is your chief?”</span> <span id="s1860">So I told him it was a guy from Leipzig, he was a chemist.</span> <span id="s1861">“Tell him to come in my office.”</span> <span id="s1862">So I ran to the barrack and I told him.</span> <span id="s1863">So he went over.</span> <span id="s1864">He was there for a while.</span> <span id="s1865">He came back and said, “Now you go to the office.”</span> <span id="s1866">Oh yeah, later I found out he asked him, you know, if I speak German or how I work.</span> <span id="s1867">He couldn’t say anything bad.</span> <span id="s1868">He tried me out once, because we organized the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1869">So the eight of us would take, everybody would take a puff and it’ll go around.</span> <span id="s1870">So one day I had to go with him to pick...</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">EM: Who was that that was the Commander that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">MF: That Leip-, that, no, that guy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">EM: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">MF: Who, my direct boss, the chemist from Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">MF: So he saw us smoking this one cigarette.</span> <span id="s1877">So we’re going, it was to do some work, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1878">He takes out a pack of cigarettes, lights one up, took one puff and throw it, threw it right in my trajectory.</span> <span id="s1879">He figured I’ll pick it up.</span> <span id="s1880">So I walk, comes the time when the cigarette there and I stepped on it and I just put it out with my foot.</span> <span id="s1881">So he looks at me and says, “Rauchst Du nicht?”</span> <span id="s1882">[You don’t smoke?]</span> <span id="s1883">I said, “The crap which you’re throwing away, I don’t.”</span> <span id="s1884">I says, “You can force me to work.</span> <span id="s1885">I’m working.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">MF: “But this is, I’m not gonna do it.</span> <span id="s1888">I have my Stolz.”</span> <span id="s1889">I, you know, I have my pride.”</span> <span id="s1890">Next day he offered me a cigarette from the pack.</span> <span id="s1891">Believe that?</span> <span id="s1892">So I went back to this chief, and he said, “You go to the proving grounds, Strzelnica, [shooting range] to the,” you know, they were shooting all kinds of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1893">They’re trying out the bazookas, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1894">“You report to the chief.</span> <span id="s1895">His name is Mr. Steller.</span> <span id="s1896">He has a job for you.”</span> <span id="s1897">So I go over there and I shake.</span> <span id="s1898">I don’t know who the guy is.</span> <span id="s1899">Is he a Nazi?</span> <span id="s1900">He can kill.</span> <span id="s1901">He could do anything he wants with me.</span> <span id="s1902">I go into the barrack and he shakes hands with me!</span> <span id="s1903">He says he is an anti-Nazi!</span> <span id="s1904">I just won my life.</span> <span id="s1905">And there’s a girl, a young, pretty girl, German girl sitting at the typewriter.</span> <span id="s1906">So I look at him, I look at her, and says, “Is he crazy?”</span> <span id="s1907">You know, they’re denouncing each other all the time.</span> <span id="s1908">He said, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1909">She thinks the way I do.</span> <span id="s1910">What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s1911">I said, “God!</span> <span id="s1912">I don’t believe it!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">EM: And he was the chief of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">MF: Of the proving grounds!</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">EM: Of the proving grounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">MF: Strzelnica.</span> <span id="s1917">He was in civilian clothes, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">EM: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">MF: He was not in, he was just a, later on it turned out he was a garage mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">EM: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">MF: I found him after the war.</span> <span id="s1922">A good looking fellow.</span> <span id="s1923">So he said, first he asked me to sit down, on the chair.</span> <span id="s1924">So I sat on the chair, after two years I sat on the floor.</span> <span id="s1925">So I almost cried.</span> <span id="s1926">And he said, “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s1927">So I thought fast.</span> <span id="s1928">I said, “I was working at the kitchen and I knew some girls there.</span> <span id="s1929">Well if I could get to that, I’ll get some extra food, and food means life.</span> <span id="s1930">Could I..</span> <span id="s1931">.</span> <span id="s1932">maybe, ‘cause there is another group on the east side of that proving grounds and they have ten people there.</span> <span id="s1933">So, and we get to the gate and there’s this S.S. man, a sergeant, a Raportführer.</span> <span id="s1934">So he’ll attach me to the tenth.</span> <span id="s1935">I’ll be the eleventh.</span> <span id="s1936">And the foreman will give me a little bit of soup and that’ll be the end of it.</span> <span id="s1937">Could I go myself to pick it up?”</span> <span id="s1938">And he said, “Let’s go.</span> <span id="s1939">Let’s find out.</span> <span id="s1940">We’ll go to the gate.”</span> <span id="s1941">When the gate, you know, where the barracks, and there was a gate, and there was a factory.</span> <span id="s1942">And he says, “So I’m going to insult you on the way.</span> <span id="s1943">Laugh it off.</span> <span id="s1944">I have to for the other Nazis around here.</span> <span id="s1945">I’m gonna call you names.</span> <span id="s1946">Don’t worry about it.”</span> <span id="s1947">He says, “Verfluchter Jude, [cursed Jew]” blah, blah, and all this.</span> <span id="s1948">And I said, “Kiss my foot.”</span> <span id="s1949">And we got to the gate, and there was one of ours, Schreiber, who was helping the S.S. man to keep track of all the movements of hundreds of people going in and out.</span> <span id="s1950">He had a arm band here saying “Schreiber”.</span> <span id="s1951">I knew him.</span> <span id="s1952">And so he came in and Steller says to him, “Yeah, they sent me this guy here.</span> <span id="s1953">He is gonna work for us.</span> <span id="s1954">“Wie ist das mit der Fresserei?</span> <span id="s1955">How is it with the food.”</span> <span id="s1956">“Oh,” he said, “there are ten people there.</span> <span id="s1957">He’ll be eleven, all set.”</span> <span id="s1958">So Steller says, “It can’t be.”</span> <span id="s1959">And Steller is a civilian.</span> <span id="s1960">So he, the sergeant looks at him.</span> <span id="s1961">He said, “Who the hell are you to tell me what can be and can not be?”</span> <span id="s1962">He says, “Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1963">Not so fast.</span> <span id="s1964">He’s gonna work us, for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1965">He is gonna sit in the bunker and do some work which we are doing for us.</span> <span id="s1966">And we are making lunch once at twelve, once at three, once at eleven, once we don’t make lunch at all if we have a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1967">Now you want a Jewish prisoner to force us to have lunch when he is eating?</span> <span id="s1968">Are you crazy?”</span> <span id="s1969">Like this.</span> <span id="s1970">And I winked at our guy, the Schreiber.</span> <span id="s1971">I said, “Come on, say something.”</span> <span id="s1972">So he says, “So, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1973">What do you want me to do?</span> <span id="s1974">Make a Kommando of one person?”</span> <span id="s1975">He says, “I don’t give a damn.”</span> <span id="s1976">So I said to Schreiber [mumbling].</span> <span id="s1977">So he says, [German].</span> <span id="s1978">He says, [German].</span> <span id="s1979">He says, “Kommando von einer Person, gibt es so was.”</span> <span id="s1980">[Well a Kommando of one person?</span> <span id="s1981">Is there such a thing?]</span> <span id="s1982">O.K., so he made me a Kommando of one.</span> <span id="s1983">And I was going alone to work.</span> <span id="s1984">There were 400 people in a group.</span> <span id="s1985">Well when I got, in the morning I got up later.</span> <span id="s1986">I didn’t have to stand for a half hour and wait till they counted 400 people.</span> <span id="s1987">And I got right to the window where the two S.S. men were standing, and they were making fun of me.</span> <span id="s1988">They said, “Bei dem stimmt immer die Vorderrichtung und die Seitenrichtung.”</span> <span id="s1989">In other words, “Nobody is missing.</span> <span id="s1990">The row is always even this way and that way!”</span> <span id="s1991">He says, “Get the hell out of here!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">EM: So what were you, what kind of work were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">MF: So I was sitting in a bunker.</span> <span id="s1994">There was a German, young 18-year-old Gestapo agent sitting there.</span> <span id="s1995">He didn’t want to sit in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1996">So I had to go underground.</span> <span id="s1997">That was the edge of the proving grounds there.</span> <span id="s1998">And I had to go out about maybe thirty meters, forty, I don’t know, twenty, something like this.</span> <span id="s1999">There was a little bunker and I had to push out a target.</span> <span id="s2000">The target was a square like this, or a rectangle, with little wires in here.</span> <span id="s2001">And there were some screws in here.</span> <span id="s2002">And I have to push it up above ground.</span> <span id="s2003">But those thirty meters behind me in a little barrack was sitting Walter, who was shooting single, two centimeter bullets I think, from a machine gun.</span> <span id="s2004">And he had to sit at this, I mean, hit this target.</span> <span id="s2005">Now, when he, he was supposed to, I’m supposed to direct him.</span> <span id="s2006">When I brought it back down, I saw where he broke it.</span> <span id="s2007">So if he broke it too much to the right—I had a phone—the phone was only to this barrack, to the shooter, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2008">And I had a heater, electric heater.</span> <span id="s2009">So I was set in the palace!</span> <span id="s2010">Well, no S.S. man could see me.</span> <span id="s2011">Nobody could beat me.</span> <span id="s2012">I just won my life.</span> <span id="s2013">So I called up.</span> <span id="s2014">I said, “Walter, schiessen Sie mehr nach rechts.”</span> <span id="s2015">[Walter, shoot more to the right.]</span> <span id="s2016">because he said there was too much here.</span> <span id="s2017">Walter was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">EM: And Walter was a German, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">MF: Yeah, a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">MF: Now he w-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">EM: Now how come they were in a proving ground and they were using civilians to do the shooting and the testing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">MF: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2024">He was in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s2025">He had a Hakenkreuz [swastika] here, but he was, so we don’t, well the chief of the factory was also in civilian clothes, maybe he was an S.S. man, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">MF: Anyway, so when Walter wasn’t shooting I could take a nap.</span> <span id="s2028">And nobody can catch me.</span> <span id="s2029">Now, Steller would come in.</span> <span id="s2030">He asked me what I was doing, so I told him.</span> <span id="s2031">So he said, “Diese Schweine,” [these pigs].</span> <span id="s2032">“What did they do to you?”</span> <span id="s2033">He says, “What is the world gonna say when we lose the war?”</span> <span id="s2034">I said, “I hope so.</span> <span id="s2035">I hope you lose it.”</span> <span id="s2036">They already probably knew they’re losing it.</span> <span id="s2037">Anyway, so Steller would come in.</span> <span id="s2038">I heard his steps.</span> <span id="s2039">See, the only one who could come in there, and he had a beautiful leather coat, opens up his coat, and takes out a three-pound military bread, takes out a pocket knife, cuts it in half.</span> <span id="s2040">He says, “Half for you, half for me.”</span> <span id="s2041">He was like a brother.</span> <span id="s2042">He was an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s2043">And it was just like a dream.</span> <span id="s2044">So, that’s the way, then he brought me coupons for cigarettes, for good work.</span> <span id="s2045">See, you can get a pack of cigarettes for I don’t know how many coupons.</span> <span id="s2046">So, I didn’t smoke.</span> <span id="s2047">So, I kept the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2048">And I had cigarettes when there were no cigarettes in camp.</span> <span id="s2049">And the S.S. were buying it from us!</span> <span id="s2050">They were giving us extra bread!</span> <span id="s2051">And I could keep the bread in that little bunker.</span> <span id="s2052">Where my brother worked in other bunkers, were thousands of tons of ammunition.</span> <span id="s2053">If the German wants a good math-, my brother was.</span> <span id="s2054">So he was running the show there.</span> <span id="s2055">So he also got sometimes something, some extra piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">EM: But he was what?</span> <span id="s2057">I didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2058">There was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">MF: There were ammunition storages, big storages of ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">EM: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">MF: Somebody had to keep track of it, mathematically.</span> <span id="s2062">So my brother was doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">MF: And he came down, also we were stealing Zuckerrüben, that means the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">EM: The sugar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">MF: The sugar, no, sugar...how do you say buraki?</span> <span id="s2067">[sugar beets]</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">EM: What?</span> <span id="s2069">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">MF: There was, all the guys were stealing sugar beets on the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2071">So we exchanged with them for cigarettes and we could, or some other stuff.</span> <span id="s2072">And it had to be cooked.</span> <span id="s2073">And you’re not allowed to cook on a stove in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2074">But Walter had a stove, and so he cooked for, he was my cook.</span> <span id="s2075">He was cooking for me!</span> <span id="s2076">And so my brother came down and had lunch together.</span> <span id="s2077">Anyway, it was just fantastic.</span> <span id="s2078">I didn’t know what I was doing because I knew when he broke that little wire, some kind of a thing fell down in the office.</span> <span id="s2079">And I think they figured out the speed of the bullet or something.</span> <span id="s2080">They wouldn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s2081">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2082">They were two centimeter anti-aircraft...bullets.</span> <span id="s2083">I think that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s2084">So, I kept all whatever I had, some extra bread or cigarettes I kept that in...my place of work.</span> <span id="s2085">Because if I kept it on my pillow in my barrack, they’ll steal it.</span> <span id="s2086">That’s obvious.</span> <span id="s2087">People were hungry.</span> <span id="s2088">And that was going on till, must have been, oh yeah, one day, before they took us away from Schlieben.</span> <span id="s2089">The guard...knew me because that was the end of the proving grounds, so the S.S. guard was walking back and forth there.</span> <span id="s2090">So one day he calls me and says, “Du komm mal her, hab keine Angst.”</span> <span id="s2091">“Don’t worry,” he says.</span> <span id="s2092">“Come, I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s2093">I said, “To me?”</span> <span id="s2094">“Yeah, yeah, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s2095">Come on.</span> <span id="s2096">The war is over,” he says.</span> <span id="s2097">“Germany lost the war.”</span> <span id="s2098">Listen!</span> <span id="s2099">An S.S. man talks to me.</span> <span id="s2100">And now he says, “Yeah, I see you’re a smart fellow.”</span> <span id="s2101">He says, “Get another ten guys.</span> <span id="s2102">We’ll walk out of here.</span> <span id="s2103">We’re at the end of it anyway here.</span> <span id="s2104">I’ll escort you to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2105">I’ll save your life.</span> <span id="s2106">And then you’ll tell the Americans that I saved your life and you’ll save mine.</span> <span id="s2107">It’s a deal?”</span> <span id="s2108">I said, “Of course!”</span> <span id="s2109">What am I supposed to say, no?</span> <span id="s2110">He’d shoot me.</span> <span id="s2111">I avoided him like the pest, never saw him again.</span> <span id="s2112">And when I saw him he says, “Come here.”</span> <span id="s2113">I went the other way around and [unclear].</span> <span id="s2114">And then one day they made a roll call and right straight to the trains.</span> <span id="s2115">Then I had some extra bread there.</span> <span id="s2116">I had cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2117">It was all, [unclear].</span> <span id="s2118">I left them.</span> <span id="s2119">And they took us away, because the front was getting near, I guess.</span> <span id="s2120">So they took us to Bautzen.</span> <span id="s2121">We were there maybe a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">EM: Baltsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">MF: Bautzen.</span> <span id="s2124">B-A-U-T-Z-E-N.</span> <span id="s2125">That was a factory of...railroad cars or something, or street cars or railroad cars.</span> <span id="s2126">We were there maybe a day and they took us now on the Todesmarsch, that march, that death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">EM: Death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">MF: For about twenty hours walking, two hours resting there, sitting somewhere, whatever.</span> <span id="s2129">And we were walking.</span> <span id="s2130">And a colleague of mine, he was with me, yeah, and they had a horse and a buggy behind the group.</span> <span id="s2131">We were maybe 200 people.</span> <span id="s2132">I’m dry, I need something to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">EM: Some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">MF: Yeah, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">EM: [unclear], would you like [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">MF: So wait a minute, where am I now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">EM: You’re...</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">MF: Oh yeah, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">EM: You were on Todesmarsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">MF: Yeah, so from Bautzen we had to walk.</span> <span id="s2141">So they had a horse and buggy behind and who had trouble with his feet or something he said, “Now just sit on the horse...”</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">EM: On the buggy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">MF: “On the buggy there, and they’ll take you.”</span> <span id="s2144">That was a nice little thing.</span> <span id="s2145">So a fellow, and so they, when the buggy was full, the horse and buggy was full, they took it up, up a little hill.</span> <span id="s2146">There were hills there.</span> <span id="s2147">And we heard shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">EM: And they shot everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">MF: They were killing those people!</span> <span id="s2150">And all of a sudden, we are walking and a, one fellow comes, way out of breath, stands next to me, in my row.</span> <span id="s2151">“I just escaped out!”</span> <span id="s2152">I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s2153">He said, “They were shooting us!</span> <span id="s2154">But I saw they were repeating the guns, so I started to run down the hill, zigzagging.</span> <span id="s2155">They were shooting after me, but they didn’t get me.”</span> <span id="s2156">So he’s coming back and he’s standing next to me.</span> <span id="s2157">And the Captain, the leader of our group, the S.S. man, is standing and waiting and looking who escaped.</span> <span id="s2158">So I said, “Oh God, now he’ll mistake me for you and I’ll get out, and I’ll be shot.”</span> <span id="s2159">And he noticed him.</span> <span id="s2160">He says, “Kannst du laufen?”</span> <span id="s2161">[Can you walk?]</span> <span id="s2162">He had something in his shoe was rubbing against his leg or something.</span> <span id="s2163">So he figured, “Why should I walk?</span> <span id="s2164">I can ride a,” but he was O.K.</span> <span id="s2165">So he looks at him [unclear] and says, “Kannst du laufen?”</span> <span id="s2166">He says, “Ya, everything O.K. I can walk.</span> <span id="s2167">Nothing happened.”</span> <span id="s2168">He let him go.</span> <span id="s2169">And we came to...Nicksdorf, in Czech-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">EM: Nicksdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">MF: Nicksdorf.</span> <span id="s2172">It’s in Sudetenland, called Mikulasovice, in Czech.</span> <span id="s2173">[pause] I’m pooped, tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s2175">[tape off then on] Today is November 16, 1994.</span> <span id="s2176">This is Edith Millman, continuing with the interview with Professor Filar.</span> <span id="s2177">Professor Filar last, when we talked, you were mentioning Nicksdorf, when you got to Nicksdorf.</span> <span id="s2178">Could you please continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">MF: Yes, that was toward the end of 1944.</span> <span id="s2180">It could have been November maybe or October or something like this.</span> <span id="s2181">We got there after a horrible march, where they were killing people who couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s2182">We arrived there.</span> <span id="s2183">That was not a, that place was empty.</span> <span id="s2184">There were barracks there.</span> <span id="s2185">There was no any, no ogrodzenia.</span> <span id="s2186">There was no...</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">EM: No fence?</span> <span id="s2188">No fencing protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">MF: No, no fence.</span> <span id="s2190">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s2191">It was a private, for private people who they brought from France.</span> <span id="s2192">You know- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">EM: ...two, interview with Professor Filar.</span> <span id="s2194">We are continuing.</span> <span id="s2195">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">MF: So when we got to Nicksdorf, we were a group maybe of 150 people, 200, just about this.</span> <span id="s2197">And then these were private barracks where they kept French civilians which they brought from France to work there.</span> <span id="s2198">And they were gone already.</span> <span id="s2199">So there was no fence, nothing.</span> <span id="s2200">It was just a civilian camp.</span> <span id="s2201">So the camp was guarded by the S.S.</span> <span id="s2202">There were plenty of them, you know, standing almost every, next to every door, every window.</span> <span id="s2203">They kept good eyes on us.</span> <span id="s2204">And they took us to work and they, we were outside there somewhere.</span> <span id="s2205">And we had to dig ditches.</span> <span id="s2206">And they said we’re digging ditches against the American tanks.</span> <span id="s2207">It turned out it wasn’t against the American tanks, but the Polish Army came from Russia, from the east.</span> <span id="s2208">And the mayor of that little town whoever it was, gave us “in appreciation”, in parentheses, gave us a little Mehlsuppe it was called, some Suppe Mehl or flour, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2209">But the soup was so horrible that everybody was running to the latrine all night.</span> <span id="s2210">And I’m still running ever since.</span> <span id="s2211">That’s those years.</span> <span id="s2212">I don’t know what the devil it was.</span> <span id="s2213">Anyway, when we first started to run at night, and everybody wanted to go across to the latrine, the S.S. put the guns on us.</span> <span id="s2214">They said we’re creating a revolution.</span> <span id="s2215">So we said, “If you won’t let us go to the latrine, the barracks will swim away.”</span> <span id="s2216">They finally realized what we wanted and they let us go.</span> <span id="s2217">So we were digging there, and over there, the last day of the war already.</span> <span id="s2218">And then all of a sudden one day we see a little ten-year-old, about ten-year-old German boy walks around there.</span> <span id="s2219">And there was only one may-, one guard, I think it was there.</span> <span id="s2220">We were now 200 in a group of us where there could have been twenty or something.</span> <span id="s2221">So one guard was there, another place there was another guard and so on.</span> <span id="s2222">So this German little boy walked around, and he had a coat.</span> <span id="s2223">And inside the coat he was showing me, I saw it...he just came up to me and showed me a paper, a newspaper.</span> <span id="s2224">He wants to give me a newspaper.</span> <span id="s2225">So I figured it’s some provocation or some...I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2226">And there were cut woods there, you know, big trees were lying on the ground.</span> <span id="s2227">So I said, “When the guard goes away, put it between the trees and get lost.”</span> <span id="s2228">So he did and then when the guard didn’t see I took it out, put it under my coat, and we got back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s2229">Guess what it was?</span> <span id="s2230">It was May 1st, 1945, big headline, “Berlin Gefallen.”</span> <span id="s2231">Berlin was taken.</span> <span id="s2232">Oh God!</span> <span id="s2233">So we don’t understand why would a boy show us this.</span> <span id="s2234">Well, we found him after liberation and we asked him.</span> <span id="s2235">He said his father was killed by the Nazis in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2236">He was German.</span> <span id="s2237">So he wanted to give us some hope, that little boy, so he brought us that paper.</span> <span id="s2238">He was, so he became our mascot.</span> <span id="s2239">Anyway, so, but how we were liberated, and so that was going on every day.</span> <span id="s2240">And it was just a few days.</span> <span id="s2241">Then one night, it must have been about four in the morning, day break started just coming.</span> <span id="s2242">And I go over to the latrine and I think, I see different faces.</span> <span id="s2243">I, you couldn’t stand up and look in his face, but I saw they were old men, with guns.</span> <span id="s2244">So I come back and I was sleeping on a floor with my brother, under a table, so there was protection from the table or something.</span> <span id="s2245">And I said, “You look here.</span> <span id="s2246">I think the S.S. is gone.</span> <span id="s2247">Looks like old guys are there.”</span> <span id="s2248">He says, “Shh, let me go take a look.</span> <span id="s2249">Well, let’s be careful about it, because some guys, they’ll find out that this, they might start jumping for joy or something, could be the Volkssturm [military reserve units] and they might get scared and kill us.”</span> <span id="s2250">So he went in there and he...came back.</span> <span id="s2251">He said, “That’s Volkssturm.</span> <span id="s2252">That’s it.”</span> <span id="s2253">So it was quiet.</span> <span id="s2254">We just “shushed,” like this, and then, you know, about seven or so, they opened the windows.</span> <span id="s2255">And they’re there and they smile, they were old guys.</span> <span id="s2256">They said, “Oh, you’re gonna be free!</span> <span id="s2257">You’re gonna live!”</span> <span id="s2258">Oh, then wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2259">I forgot.</span> <span id="s2260">Before this happened, the chief of S.S., or the Gestapo, came to our camp just a few days before and they said, he promised us solemnly we will all be killed.</span> <span id="s2261">He said in German, “Ihr wird alle erschossen.”</span> <span id="s2262">[You will all be shot.]</span> <span id="s2263">Quite a story about this guy later on.</span> <span id="s2264">So then they got lost.</span> <span id="s2265">Only the Volksstürmer came in and so on as I told you.</span> <span id="s2266">Then maybe an hour later the Volksstürmer evaporated and there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s2267">So, among us were a couple of Germans who were prisoners—Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s2268">So our Lagerältester, the leader of our camp, was a German, Mr. Zeider.</span> <span id="s2269">I have his signature.</span> <span id="s2270">So he’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">EM: What was his name?</span> <span id="s2272">Could you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">MF: Zei-, I think, [tape off then on] Yeah, so among us were a few Germans who were Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s2274">And our Lagerältester, that means the leader of our group, was a German Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s2275">His name was Zeidler.</span> <span id="s2276">So he says, “Let’s do a roll call to see if anybody is missing.”</span> <span id="s2277">So we did a roll call, and one was missing.</span> <span id="s2278">I look around, my brother is missing!</span> <span id="s2279">Then we looked, it was a little hilly up there in the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s2280">And I see my brother coming toward us on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2281">He was already in town and he just kicked a German, something, and took a bike from him.</span> <span id="s2282">He came down and said, “What are you doing here doing the roll call?</span> <span id="s2283">We are free!</span> <span id="s2284">The Polish Army is on Main Street!”</span> <span id="s2285">So we yelled, “Hurrah;” and we came out there and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s2286">So I became friendly with the lieutenant who was from Lemberg, about my size, my age at that time.</span> <span id="s2287">And we went out.</span> <span id="s2288">They put Germans in that camp and we knocked on doors and asked for a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">EM: That was the Polish Army that was fighting with the Russians, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2291">No, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">MF: They were a separate unit.</span> <span id="s2294">There were not Russians between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">EM: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s2296">But they...</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">MF: They were just Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">EM: Poles, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">MF: Yeah, they came from Russia.</span> <span id="s2300">Anyway, so we knocked on doors and the Germans first were afraid.</span> <span id="s2301">Then they begged us to come in.</span> <span id="s2302">Why?</span> <span id="s2303">Because we put a sign on the door saying in Polish, “Former Prisoners of War Here.</span> <span id="s2304">Please Don’t Disturb.”</span> <span id="s2305">Because someplace else they didn’t see the sign, they’d go in, kick the door in and let the Germans have it.</span> <span id="s2306">They paid them back a little bit.</span> <span id="s2307">As a matter of fact, I was together with my brother.</span> <span id="s2308">There was a widow in that little house.</span> <span id="s2309">So the Germans came from across the street and they said, “You’re uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2310">Why don’t one of you come stay with us?”</span> <span id="s2311">So we said, “Get the hell out of here.”</span> <span id="s2312">You know what they wanted?</span> <span id="s2313">They wanted a little sign on the door.</span> <span id="s2314">So one day I’m sitting there, we’re eating.</span> <span id="s2315">She cooked for us.</span> <span id="s2316">She was a very fine old woman.</span> <span id="s2317">And she told us that they were afraid because she, they talked with the S.S. Says, “Looks like that’s the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2318">They’ll be liberated.</span> <span id="s2319">They’ll kill us.”</span> <span id="s2320">Well, they understood.</span> <span id="s2321">Normally they, we should have killed them for what they did to us.</span> <span id="s2322">So the S.S. told her, “Don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s2323">They’ll be finished tonight.”</span> <span id="s2324">They had set up the machine guns.</span> <span id="s2325">About two in the morning we were supposed to be all shot.</span> <span id="s2326">But there was a breakthrough in the front.</span> <span id="s2327">And that’s how they had to run about, ten, eleven o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s2328">And that’s why they ran away.</span> <span id="s2329">So, this Tadek was his name, he was from Lemberg.</span> <span id="s2330">And he didn’t know any German and I did.</span> <span id="s2331">So he was the leader of that camp and the guardhouse.</span> <span id="s2332">So he said, “You will be my interpreter.”</span> <span id="s2333">And so, fine.</span> <span id="s2334">And so one day we’re eating the soup, about one o’clock or so.</span> <span id="s2335">And a sergeant comes on a bike and he says, he was all out of breath and says, “Come on!</span> <span id="s2336">Come on!</span> <span id="s2337">Tadek is waiting for you!”</span> <span id="s2338">I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s2339">He says, “We caught the Chief of the Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s2340">I said, “What?</span> <span id="s2341">How’d you get him?”</span> <span id="s2342">He said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2343">Talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2344">So I almost choked on my soup, pushed myself away from the table, and around we go to the guardhouse.</span> <span id="s2345">Here he is!</span> <span id="s2346">Now he ain’t so splendid, doesn’t look so tough, and not so big anymore.</span> <span id="s2347">He’s in civilian clothes, scared stiff, sitting on a chair.</span> <span id="s2348">He must have been ten feet tall or something.</span> <span id="s2349">When he was sitting on the chair, and that lieutenant was sitting on the table with a whip in his hand, he was taller than the lieutenant.</span> <span id="s2350">That’s how big he was.</span> <span id="s2351">I said, “How did you get him?”</span> <span id="s2352">“Oh,” he says, “Germans came in here, and they said, they’re great denunciators, and they said, “You’re picking a little fish?</span> <span id="s2353">Why don’t you pick on a big one?”</span> <span id="s2354">He says, “Yeah?</span> <span id="s2355">Like who?”</span> <span id="s2356">They said, “Like the Chief of Gestapo of Sudetenland.”</span> <span id="s2357">“Well do you know his address?</span> <span id="s2358">Do you know where he lives?”</span> <span id="s2359">“Sure!”</span> <span id="s2360">They gave him the address, so he sent out a couple of jeeps, whatever, with soldiers.</span> <span id="s2361">They got him and they brought him, and here he’s sitting, shaking scared stiff.</span> <span id="s2362">So Tadek says to me, “O.K., go ahead ask him all the names of Gestapo and S.S., I want, and the addresses.”</span> <span id="s2363">So I did.</span> <span id="s2364">But he couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2365">He was cringing, he was sitting scared.</span> <span id="s2366">So I said to him, “Don’t you see?</span> <span id="s2367">He’s cold.</span> <span id="s2368">We gotta warm him up.</span> <span id="s2369">So we went to work on him.”</span> <span id="s2370">And we started to beat the hell out of him.</span> <span id="s2371">And I said to him, “How do you like your own medicine?</span> <span id="s2372">That’s the way you were beating us and now you’re getting a little back of it.</span> <span id="s2373">Do you like it?</span> <span id="s2374">Do you find it...” A sergeant came with a..</span> <span id="s2375">.</span> <span id="s2376">no, a Kübel...</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">EM: A bucket?</span> <span id="s2378">A bucket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">MF: Yeah, a bucket of water, threw water on him, brought him back to, beat more of him.</span> <span id="s2380">Finally when he started to talk, he was such a coward.</span> <span id="s2381">And I couldn’t write so fast the way he talked.</span> <span id="s2382">So I said, “Shut up!”</span> <span id="s2383">I said, “You talk too fast!</span> <span id="s2384">I can’t write that fast!”</span> <span id="s2385">Finally we pumped everything out of him, we took him outside, and he was only falling on his knees, holding his hands to a prayer that, “Lassen sie mich doch bitte leben.</span> <span id="s2386">Please let me live.”</span> <span id="s2387">I said, “You pig!</span> <span id="s2388">You want to live?</span> <span id="s2389">Why were you born?</span> <span id="s2390">How many people did you murder?</span> <span id="s2391">You want to live?</span> <span id="s2392">You are kidding!”</span> <span id="s2393">So Tadek gives me his machine gun, or gun, whatever it was, no I think it was a little machine gun, something.</span> <span id="s2394">He said, “Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s2395">I said, “I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2396">I’m not a murderer.”</span> <span id="s2397">He said, “You’re a coward?”</span> <span id="s2398">I said, “No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2399">Slow down.</span> <span id="s2400">I’m not a coward.</span> <span id="s2401">But I cannot kill anybody in cold blood.</span> <span id="s2402">Let him jump at me.</span> <span id="s2403">In self defense I will, but otherwise I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2404">I’m not a Nazi.”</span> <span id="s2405">And he stood there yelling.</span> <span id="s2406">I said, “Shut up you pig!”</span> <span id="s2407">And so the, a soldier was, the sergeant with us, and he killed him.</span> <span id="s2408">And that was the end of one Nazi, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">EM: So that was a Polish sergeant that killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">MF: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">MF: Then I was looking for a piano.</span> <span id="s2413">I wanted to start playing the piano.</span> <span id="s2414">So we went to the Mayor or somebody.</span> <span id="s2415">They gave me a key to a palace what was, a big Nazi lived there, and he, of course, he ran away.</span> <span id="s2416">And there was a concert grand, a beautiful piano in there.</span> <span id="s2417">Oh yeah, before I went there, I gotta tell you.</span> <span id="s2418">I forgot.</span> <span id="s2419">I took a friend of mine and I said, “I had a cut finger.”</span> <span id="s2420">This finger, it was cut in camp.</span> <span id="s2421">I was sitting on a [unclear] the finger right in the knife.</span> <span id="s2422">And it healed up, thank God.</span> <span id="s2423">So, I said, “I want to find out if I’ll be able to play.”</span> <span id="s2424">I knew it I will on a table it didn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s2425">But I wanted to try a piano.</span> <span id="s2426">So I said, “Let’s go to a nice neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2427">Maybe somebody has a piano there and I’ll try.”</span> <span id="s2428">So we went, we knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s2429">The Germans opened up, scared stiff.</span> <span id="s2430">We said, “Don’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s2431">We’re not murderers.</span> <span id="s2432">We’re not Nazis.</span> <span id="s2433">You were Nazis.</span> <span id="s2434">We’re not.</span> <span id="s2435">I see you have a piano there.”</span> <span id="s2436">There was a long hallway.</span> <span id="s2437">I saw an upright piano.</span> <span id="s2438">I said, “I’m a concert pianist.</span> <span id="s2439">I’m no murderer.”</span> <span id="s2440">I was not a murderer.</span> <span id="s2441">I said, “I had an injured finger.</span> <span id="s2442">I want to see if I’ll be able to play.”</span> <span id="s2443">“Well, come on in.</span> <span id="s2444">Come on in.”</span> <span id="s2445">So I went in, opened that piano and I tried.</span> <span id="s2446">I said, “Oh yeah, thank God.</span> <span id="s2447">Thank God, I’ll play.”</span> <span id="s2448">So he says, “Bleiben Sie doch hier, spielen Sie was.”</span> <span id="s2449">He says, “Stay here, play something.”</span> <span id="s2450">I said, “Get lost.”</span> <span id="s2451">And we walked out.</span> <span id="s2452">Then I got this key to this palace.</span> <span id="s2453">And there was a concert Bösendorfer, a beautiful piano.</span> <span id="s2454">And I started to play.</span> <span id="s2455">And I played five minutes and I couldn’t move my arms.</span> <span id="s2456">It hurt.</span> <span id="s2457">It was murder.</span> <span id="s2458">I was doing physical work and this...finger, it was the fine muscles.</span> <span id="s2459">But I, thank God, I knew what to do.</span> <span id="s2460">So I played the first eight, ten minutes and I went home, home so to speak, [unclear].</span> <span id="s2461">The next day I tried for twenty minutes, thirty minutes, for...</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">EM: Now where was all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">MF: In Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">EM: In Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">MF: In that place where we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2466">We were there for a few weeks maybe.</span> <span id="s2467">Another thing, then came an order...the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">EM: Did you say Schlieben.</span> <span id="s2469">I think the last...</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">MF: Not Schlieben, Nicksdorf.</span> <span id="s2471">I keep mixing it up.</span> <span id="s2472">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">EM: Nicksdorf, O.K. O.K.</span> <span id="s2474">When were you in Schlieben?</span> <span id="s2475">You were in Schlieben...</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">MF: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">EM: Before, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">MF: Before, from Buchenwald we went to Schlieben.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">EM: Yeah, from, to Schlieben, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s2481">Because we were longer in Schlieben.</span> <span id="s2482">That was just a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2484">So that was all in Nicksdorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">MF: Yeah, Nicksdorf, Nicksdorf.</span> <span id="s2486">It’s Mikulasovice now in Czech.</span> <span id="s2487">So, across, on the same street, across another house, a colleague of mine lived there and we used to see each other and talk.</span> <span id="s2488">And there were two German women from Bautzen.</span> <span id="s2489">And they said they loved music, could they come, they heard that I’m playing, so where could they... I said, “You want to?</span> <span id="s2490">O.K.” So they came, and they listened a couple of times.</span> <span id="s2491">Then one day there came an announcement from the army that all the Germans, the war is over, the Germans have to go back home.</span> <span id="s2492">No refugees anymore.</span> <span id="s2493">It turned out that they had a..</span> <span id="s2494">.</span> <span id="s2495">jewelry store in Bautzen, a big one.</span> <span id="s2496">I didn’t know that but this woman, she some kind, felt that I’m a decent human being, so she came up to me and said, “We have to go back.</span> <span id="s2497">We are afraid, because we have two suitcases full of, you know, jewelry, from our jewelry store.</span> <span id="s2498">And there are Poles all over and [unclear] Germans.</span> <span id="s2499">Could you go with us?</span> <span id="s2500">We’ll give you something for this.”</span> <span id="s2501">That was about twenty kilometers or thirty kilometers, somewhere...</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">EM: So they were originally from Belsen and they found themselves in Nicksdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">MF: No, they were from Bautzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">EM: Yeah, that’s what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">EM: From Belsen.</span> <span id="s2507">And they found themselves...</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">MF: Bautzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">EM: Bautzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">EM: B-A-U-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">MF: U-T-Z-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">EM: O.K. B-A-U-T-Z-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">MF: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">EM: And they found themself in Nicksdorf as refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">MF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">MF: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">EM: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">MF: And so, I asked my bro-, they say they’ll give me something, you know, a coat or this or that, whatever, a watch.</span> <span id="s2521">Oh, they’ll give me a watch for me and for my brother.</span> <span id="s2522">Who had a watch?</span> <span id="s2523">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s2524">So I asked my brother, “What do you think?</span> <span id="s2525">What should I do?”</span> <span id="s2526">Oh yeah, they’ll give me a bicycle, so I won’t have to walk.</span> <span id="s2527">All right.</span> <span id="s2528">And they’ll walk with that little pushcart, and they’ll put their stuff on it.</span> <span id="s2529">I said, “What should I do?</span> <span id="s2530">Do you think I should go?”</span> <span id="s2531">He said, “Go ahead.</span> <span id="s2532">You want to go?</span> <span id="s2533">Go.</span> <span id="s2534">Nothing’s gonna happen.”</span> <span id="s2535">So I went, and we just came out of Nick-, and they put their stuff on that little pushcart and they were going in front and I was riding slowly in the back.</span> <span id="s2536">We came out about a couple of kilometers outside of that little town.</span> <span id="s2537">And there comes, out of the forest comes the Polish guard out with a gun and says, “What the hell?</span> <span id="s2538">What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s2539">So I said in Polish to him, you know I just talked him out of it, and he let us go.</span> <span id="s2540">So we went on, and they got scared.</span> <span id="s2541">And they saw that, what I talked to him it worked.</span> <span id="s2542">So they stopped.</span> <span id="s2543">And they say they want to take those two little suitcases, put it on my bicycle, on the back they had the little, you know, space for luggage with the little spring and all that.</span> <span id="s2544">So they did it.</span> <span id="s2545">I could hardly ride when I got over.</span> <span id="s2546">That must have been maybe forty, fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s2547">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2548">And we were going up and down on hills there.</span> <span id="s2549">And I thought about, they robbed us clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">EM: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">MF: The Germans.</span> <span id="s2552">The stuff which, in these two suitcases which I have on my bike now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">EM: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">MF: Could be all robbed stuff.</span> <span id="s2555">All I have to do is turn around, go down the hill and, “Nice knowing you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">MF: I said, “But I’m not a thief.</span> <span id="s2558">I can’t do it.”</span> <span id="s2559">I fought with myself.</span> <span id="s2560">I said, well I didn’t have a penny, nothing!</span> <span id="s2561">And we were robbed!</span> <span id="s2562">I said, “Here I can get something back.”</span> <span id="s2563">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2564">And I brought them back to Bautzen.</span> <span id="s2565">We came at night.</span> <span id="s2566">We came there at night.</span> <span id="s2567">I saw the house.</span> <span id="s2568">I remember the street, Seminar Strasse dreizehn, [Seminar Street Number thirteen] thirteen, the entrance was on the corner and there was a big window here and a big window here.</span> <span id="s2569">It must have been a big place!</span> <span id="s2570">Well, the neighbors came out, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s2571">It must have been night, or it was night already.</span> <span id="s2572">So they said, “You can not go back at night.</span> <span id="s2573">You stay over.</span> <span id="s2574">We’ll give you a motorcycle in the morning.</span> <span id="s2575">My husband had a motorcycle.”</span> <span id="s2576">I didn’t know how to ride a motorcycle, and on top there was no gas.</span> <span id="s2577">But I came out there and I saw pictures of the police, German police there.</span> <span id="s2578">I said, “There must have been some real Nazis.”</span> <span id="s2579">So was I a dope, I didn’t make a U-turn and go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">MF: I should have done it.</span> <span id="s2582">And my colleagues later laughed and said, “She knew who to pick!</span> <span id="s2583">She picked you!</span> <span id="s2584">She should have picked me!</span> <span id="s2585">You should have said, ‘50-50,’ what the hell?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2587">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">MF: Anyway, so she gave me a raincoat, and what else did she give me, a pin?</span> <span id="s2589">She said, “That’s a pin which, with a little pearl on it.”</span> <span id="s2590">It wasn’t pearl.</span> <span id="s2591">It was baloney.</span> <span id="s2592">And she gave me two cheap watches and a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s2593">I think that was it.</span> <span id="s2594">And I got back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">EM: And you went back...</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">MF: I went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">EM: To Nicksdorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2599">Then we took off after a while and we decided to go to Prague.</span> <span id="s2600">Well, the trains were free, everything.</span> <span id="s2601">We could go on a train.</span> <span id="s2602">So we came to Prague and the Czech government was wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s2603">They were liberated themselves, so they gave us a hotel where to stay in center city.</span> <span id="s2604">It was an empty hotel.</span> <span id="s2605">They cleared it up.</span> <span id="s2606">I don’t know who was there before.</span> <span id="s2607">I found out later.</span> <span id="s2608">That was pretty funny, too.</span> <span id="s2609">It was a whore house there in the war for German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">MF: And they cleaned it up.</span> <span id="s2612">I’ll tell you how I found out.</span> <span id="s2613">You’ll laugh.</span> <span id="s2614">Anyway, so, and they gave us listki, those little stamps so we could ride the streetcars for free and go in a restaurant and pay with those stamps.</span> <span id="s2615">And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">EM: When you say, “we,” is it you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">MF: No, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">EM: Or was there a whole group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">MF: All of us who came there, you know, refugees.</span> <span id="s2620">And one day I went for a walk with a friend of mine from camp.</span> <span id="s2621">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s2622">And we walked down the street and we see a beautiful building.</span> <span id="s2623">And it says the Czeska Philharmonia, Czech Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s2624">I said, “Hey!</span> <span id="s2625">A concert hall!</span> <span id="s2626">Let’s go take a look!”</span> <span id="s2627">I didn’t see one for so many years.</span> <span id="s2628">So there’s a doorman in there in a uniform, a big tall guy.</span> <span id="s2629">So I said, “Could we go in?</span> <span id="s2630">We were just liberated.”</span> <span id="s2631">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s2632">“Could we, I’m a pianist,” I said.</span> <span id="s2633">“I didn’t see a concert hall for five years.</span> <span id="s2634">Could we go in and take a look how it looks?”</span> <span id="s2635">“Oh, you’re lucky because the orchestra is having a rehearsal.”</span> <span id="s2636">“Oh yeah?”</span> <span id="s2637">I said, “Who’s conducting?”</span> <span id="s2638">So he says, “Kubelik.”</span> <span id="s2639">“Kubelik?”</span> <span id="s2640">I said, “Kubelik is dead.</span> <span id="s2641">He was a great violinist.”</span> <span id="s2642">[Jan Kubelik, 1880-1940] “That’s right, but that’s his son Rafael.</span> <span id="s2643">He is a conductor.”</span> <span id="s2644">And he was a pianist, too.</span> <span id="s2645">So we walked in there, and sure enough they were rehearsing, they were playing.</span> <span id="s2646">And we sat down quietly.</span> <span id="s2647">They were playing that Dvorak Symphony from the New World.</span> <span id="s2648">And my pal after a while says to me, “O.K., let’s go.”</span> <span id="s2649">I said, “You go.</span> <span id="s2650">I’ll stay.”</span> <span id="s2651">So he left.</span> <span id="s2652">And after it was over I went back stage, introduced myself to the conductor, to Kubelik and I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s2653">“I was just liberated.”</span> <span id="s2654">Now I repeated a symphony in E Minor piano concerto.</span> <span id="s2655">I said, “Maybe I’ll try and play for him.”</span> <span id="s2656">I just got a wild idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">MF: So he says, “Oh yeah, it’d be,” I told him, he knew my teacher.</span> <span id="s2659">Drzewiecki was known all over Europe.</span> <span id="s2660">So he said, “I’ll tell you what, we, the pianos are now, you know, they are on the side, with...they are without legs.</span> <span id="s2661">We, they, you know, we were just liberated ourselves.</span> <span id="s2662">I’m just organizing the orchestra.</span> <span id="s2663">We didn’t have a Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s2664">Why don’t you come Saturday in my home to play for me there?”</span> <span id="s2665">He gave me his address.</span> <span id="s2666">“Five o’clock.”</span> <span id="s2667">I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s2668">So I went there Saturday, and I found a place where to practice.</span> <span id="s2669">I went to the Conservatory I think.</span> <span id="s2670">I came in there.</span> <span id="s2671">He wasn’t home yet, his wife was there.</span> <span id="s2672">She was very nice, and she said, “My husband is having auditions for new members for the orchestra.</span> <span id="s2673">Well, he called here, he said he’ll be back soon.</span> <span id="s2674">You can warm up now a little bit if you want to.”</span> <span id="s2675">And there was a student of his, his name was Ilya Hurnick, who was studying with him composition.</span> <span id="s2676">And then she also showed me the study of Variosof, Kubelik’s father, and this music room.</span> <span id="s2677">And there was hanging like this from a, you know, on a chair, you know, a glass enclosure.</span> <span id="s2678">That was a Stradivarius.</span> <span id="s2679">It was a beautiful instrument.</span> <span id="s2680">So I practiced.</span> <span id="s2681">He finally came and he was tall and he was, oh, he was a golden human being.</span> <span id="s2682">I’m telling you, pure gold, that man.</span> <span id="s2683">I love him.</span> <span id="s2684">He took his coat off, he said, “Well, I’m sorry.”</span> <span id="s2685">I said, “You know, we were just liberated ourselves,” blah blah blah, all this.</span> <span id="s2686">So I sat down and played.</span> <span id="s2687">So I played an E Minor Concerto from memory.</span> <span id="s2688">So he looks at me, he can’t believe.</span> <span id="s2689">He says, “Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2690">When did you see the music?</span> <span id="s2691">Where’s your music?”</span> <span id="s2692">“Music?</span> <span id="s2693">It burned in Warsaw, together with my piano.”</span> <span id="s2694">“You mean you didn’t see this music for five years?”</span> <span id="s2695">“That’s right.”</span> <span id="s2696">“You didn’t make one mistake!”</span> <span id="s2697">“Sorry,” I don’t need to apologize, I apologized.</span> <span id="s2698">So he says, “That’s unbelievable.”</span> <span id="s2699">I said, “You’ll play with me.”</span> <span id="s2700">“Where do you live?</span> <span id="s2701">Wait a minute!</span> <span id="s2702">Where do you eat?</span> <span id="s2703">What is it?</span> <span id="s2704">I mean, what do you do with yourself?</span> <span id="s2705">How do you exist?”</span> <span id="s2706">So I told him, “The city was so nice to us, gave us a hotel where we stay there.”</span> <span id="s2707">He said, “What’s the name of the hotel?”</span> <span id="s2708">I told him, and he started to laugh.</span> <span id="s2709">I said, “Mr. Kubelik, what is so funny?”</span> <span id="s2710">He said, “What’s so funny?</span> <span id="s2711">During the war that was a whorehouse for the German soldiers!”</span> <span id="s2712">So I said, “When I get back there I’ll look under my bed and one was left!”</span> <span id="s2713">[both laugh] So, and then, one day, and we ate, there was a Jewish Committee there.</span> <span id="s2714">And so we ate lunch there.</span> <span id="s2715">So I think I went to practice some.</span> <span id="s2716">When I came back around twelve or one, whatever it was, my brother wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s2717">So I talked with some friends, and you know, we just talked a little bit.</span> <span id="s2718">And then a man comes up and kind of interrupts a little bit our conversation, about my age.</span> <span id="s2719">You know, he just cut, butts in there, you know.</span> <span id="s2720">And so I step back and I looked at him and I said, “I know that guy.”</span> <span id="s2721">And I scratch my head.</span> <span id="s2722">I said, “I know him.</span> <span id="s2723">Who is he?”</span> <span id="s2724">I [unclear] it’s my cousin, from Wyszków.</span> <span id="s2725">They had a factory.</span> <span id="s2726">I was there last time when I was ten years old, a good fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s2727">So I said, “Wait a minute, is your name Yoskowicz?”</span> <span id="s2728">He said, “Right.”</span> <span id="s2729">“From Wyszków?”</span> <span id="s2730">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s2731">“Bicycle factory?”</span> <span id="s2732">“Right.”</span> <span id="s2733">“You don’t recognize me?”</span> <span id="s2734">So he looked, looked, looked and I fell inside his arms.</span> <span id="s2735">We didn’t see each other so many years.</span> <span id="s2736">So he says, “Well, I saw your brother yesterday.”</span> <span id="s2737">I said, “I know.</span> <span id="s2738">Julek will be here any minute.”</span> <span id="s2739">“Julek is alive?”</span> <span id="s2740">“Who the hell are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s2741">“I was two days ago in Lodz.</span> <span id="s2742">I saw Michael.</span> <span id="s2743">He came back from Siberia.”</span> <span id="s2744">I said, “Michael is alive!</span> <span id="s2745">God!”</span> <span id="s2746">So when Julek came in I told him this.</span> <span id="s2747">The same night we were on a train, a freight train, no ticket, nothing.</span> <span id="s2748">We rode all night.</span> <span id="s2749">About six o’clock we came into Lodz and we, all we had was a little rucksack.</span> <span id="s2750">You know, we don’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2751">So my brother he said, six, six thirty, he says, “You stay here.</span> <span id="s2752">I’ll go look for him.”</span> <span id="s2753">I said, “I want to go look for him.”</span> <span id="s2754">He says, “You’re the youngest.</span> <span id="s2755">I’m the oldest.</span> <span id="s2756">So you sit and I go.”</span> <span id="s2757">“O.K.” So he went and left me here.</span> <span id="s2758">So I sat there half asleep.</span> <span id="s2759">And all of a sudden a, I see that one of my rucksacks is moving away!</span> <span id="s2760">It moves away on its own power!</span> <span id="s2761">I see a Soviet soldier, that thief!</span> <span id="s2762">Stuck his foot into those...yeah, you know the rzemie, those belts.</span> <span id="s2763">[leather straps]</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">MF: And he was dragging it away like this!</span> <span id="s2766">I said, “Hey, you bum!</span> <span id="s2767">That’s mine!”</span> <span id="s2768">“Oh,” he said, “it just got into my foot.”</span> <span id="s2769">I said, “Yeah, sure!”</span> <span id="s2770">O.K., and so my brother went to the city and found out where the Committee is.</span> <span id="s2771">It was about seven in the morning.</span> <span id="s2772">Everything was closed.</span> <span id="s2773">And so I went in to the bramy, [gate] you know, to the hallway there, and it was all white, and so people wrote names where they are.</span> <span id="s2774">And so we looked, he looked, and he found Michael Filar is at Zalatska 27 with Dr. Melamed.</span> <span id="s2775">So here in fifteen to twenty minutes later he was there, knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s2776">And they were in the partisans, so the old grandmother survived too.</span> <span id="s2777">And she...</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">EM: Your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">MF: Not ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">MF: Their...Dr. Melamed’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">EM: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2784">We didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s2785">And so, but all the people get up early.</span> <span id="s2786">So she opened the door on the chain.</span> <span id="s2787">So he says, my brother says, “Does Mr. Filar live here?”</span> <span id="s2788">“That’s right, but he’s still asleep.</span> <span id="s2789">Why don’t you come a little later?”</span> <span id="s2790">I said, “If you don’t mind, that’s my brother, I didn’t see him five years.”</span> <span id="s2791">So she said, “Oh!”</span> <span id="s2792">And she opened the door and he went in there in the living room.</span> <span id="s2793">He was sleeping on a sofa, and his foot was sticking out from under the cover.</span> <span id="s2794">So he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">EM: Did he tickle it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">MF: Tickling his foot a little bit and Michael opened his eyes, saw his brother.</span> <span id="s2797">And I sat there half asleep at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2798">All of a sudden I see two of them coming at me.</span> <span id="s2799">[weeping; tape off then on] I am rebuilding my piano, in spite of [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">EM: But let’s continue now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">MF: Well, so we stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s2802">I found a colleague from a… in Lodz, I found a, we stayed there together, squeezed in, you know.</span> <span id="s2803">So I found a colleague from… I went to the concerts and all that.</span> <span id="s2804">And I found a colleague, a Polish colleague of mine, a very dear friend.</span> <span id="s2805">And I met the conductor of the symphony is Zdzisław Gurzynski was the director of the Philharmonic there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">EM: Gurzynski?</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">MF: Gurzynski.</span> <span id="s2808">Maybe you know the name.</span> <span id="s2809">He was pretty famous.</span> <span id="s2810">And I auditioned for him and he gave me a concert.</span> <span id="s2811">And I played a E Minor Concerto with Gurzynski.</span> <span id="s2812">And guess who was at that concert?</span> <span id="s2813">The director of the Warsaw Conservatory was in Lodz.</span> <span id="s2814">And he came for a concert, came backstage and invited me for lunch—a great, great man.</span> <span id="s2815">I have a picture of him.</span> <span id="s2816">[tape off then on] The name was Professor Eugeniusz Morawski.</span> <span id="s2817">Well, he was a famous man.</span> <span id="s2818">He was the director of the Conservatory when I was a student there.</span> <span id="s2819">So he invited me for lunch.</span> <span id="s2820">He said to me, “Remember, when you were a young fellow at the Conservatory, I called you into my office?</span> <span id="s2821">I always liked you, do you remember that?”</span> <span id="s2822">“I sure do.”</span> <span id="s2823">“What did I tell you then?”</span> <span id="s2824">“You told me to get out of Poland and go West, and you believed in me that I’ll make a great career.”</span> <span id="s2825">“I’m telling you again the same thing right now.</span> <span id="s2826">Get out!</span> <span id="s2827">I believe in you.</span> <span id="s2828">You have nothing to do here.</span> <span id="s2829">You beat it, get outside, and you’ll make a great career.</span> <span id="s2830">And I’m encouraging you to go.”</span> <span id="s2831">I said, “Director, I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s2832">We’re already packed.</span> <span id="s2833">We’re leaving tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s2834">And we went to Berlin, on the way to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s2835">And we stopped in Berlin and my brothers went to a committee, Jewish Committee for something.</span> <span id="s2836">And I wanted to see the Reichstag, which was burned out by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2837">They said the Reds burned it down.</span> <span id="s2838">There was a whole, so a very famous building.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">EM: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">MF: So we decided to meet about one o’clock for lunch at a… it must have been about eleven in the morning, whatever.</span> <span id="s2841">And I went in there.</span> <span id="s2842">And I heard it was, a good part of it was destroyed and there were some stairs left and there were some ugly things which the Russian put there.</span> <span id="s2843">There was one head of one president or something, and they did something on top of his head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">MF: It was right, it was really funny to see it.</span> <span id="s2846">I went up the stairs and there was an old German who worked there.</span> <span id="s2847">And there was some officers.</span> <span id="s2848">I think they were French, Russians, English or Americans probably.</span> <span id="s2849">But I didn’t know any English.</span> <span id="s2850">But I knew French and I knew some Russian.</span> <span id="s2851">And I saw the, what the old gentlemen were telling me.</span> <span id="s2852">That was a very historic building.</span> <span id="s2853">They didn’t understand a word.</span> <span id="s2854">I could see it.</span> <span id="s2855">So I said to the French, to the Russians, “I can translate from German into French and Russian.”</span> <span id="s2856">“Oh!</span> <span id="s2857">A godsend you’re here.”</span> <span id="s2858">We, the French said it, not the Russians.</span> <span id="s2859">The Russians didn’t believe in God.</span> <span id="s2860">So, I was translating for a while and then the Russian, the old German must have been in his eighties, he said, “There’s nothing much left here.</span> <span id="s2861">It’s all destroyed.</span> <span id="s2862">Why don’t we go over to the, Reichskanzlei, the Reichs Chancellery of Hitler?</span> <span id="s2863">That stands.</span> <span id="s2864">It’s not gone, you know.</span> <span id="s2865">Everything’s intact.”</span> <span id="s2866">So they said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s2867">But they pointed at me and said, “You must go with us.”</span> <span id="s2868">I said, “I’d be delighted.”</span> <span id="s2869">With a chance that I had a little D.K.W. D.K.W. today is called an Audi, you know with those four little zeroes in front.</span> <span id="s2870">And they had a four seater so then we must have been about twenty people.</span> <span id="s2871">So, the driver...so they went back and forth.</span> <span id="s2872">It was about a three-minute ride one way.</span> <span id="s2873">He came back, and the two of us, the German and I, were sitting in the back, and two officers in the front.</span> <span id="s2874">So that short ride the German says to me, “Sind Sie ein Russe?”</span> <span id="s2875">[Are you Russian?]</span> <span id="s2876">I said, “Sure, straight from Moscow.”</span> <span id="s2877">I didn’t want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s2878">We arrived there, they’re waiting, and there was no entrance for civilians.</span> <span id="s2879">But it was generals, colonels, I don’t know who the American, what rank the Americans and English were, but I knew the French, and the Russian some.</span> <span id="s2880">So they didn’t bother us, the four...guards were there, the Americans, the English, the French, and the Russians.</span> <span id="s2881">So we walked in and we saw, we walked in and I saw it on TV several times.</span> <span id="s2882">You walk in there and there was first the Nazi Party room, was, I don’t know, maybe forty, fifty meters long, maybe 100 feet, something like this, with a long, long table with chairs on all the side.</span> <span id="s2883">At the end of it was Hitler’s room.</span> <span id="s2884">And I walked in, and I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s2885">I was shaking to see this.</span> <span id="s2886">On the left was his desk.</span> <span id="s2887">On the right was a stand with his Globus where he was, looked on, Chaplin played with that Globus in a movie [unclear] or so.</span> <span id="s2888">And that chandelier...a beautiful chandelier hanging, a long one, hanging down to almost, you almost could touch with your head.</span> <span id="s2889">And one of the Russians looked to me like he would be Jewish.</span> <span id="s2890">I wanted to tell him that I was Jewish, too, and didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s2891">Finally I got an idea.</span> <span id="s2892">And there was a moment and I said to him, “Colonel, what’d you think, what, don’t you think it’s a beautiful Hanukkah lamp?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">EM: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">MF: So he said, “Dada konechno,” he says, “Konechno!”</span> <span id="s2895">[Yeah, yeah, sure!]</span> <span id="s2896">And he smiled.</span> <span id="s2897">So I knew he was, you know.</span> <span id="s2898">And then so, and then there was a little room there on the side.</span> <span id="s2899">And there was a sink, you know, just a little washroom.</span> <span id="s2900">And also a military bed, I guess, a prycza.</span> <span id="s2901">How do you say prycza in English?</span> <span id="s2902">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">EM: A cot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">MF: A cot, which it was hanging out from the wall.</span> <span id="s2905">You open it up.</span> <span id="s2906">They say he stayed overnight sometimes.</span> <span id="s2907">And then a German came out from a garden and he said, “Why don’t you go to the bunker?</span> <span id="s2908">Down there, where he committed suicide.”</span> <span id="s2909">So we went out, and went down about two flights in concrete.</span> <span id="s2910">And there was no electricity, you know, everything was bombed out.</span> <span id="s2911">So who smoked had a lighter or matches.</span> <span id="s2912">I smoked by that time so I had matches and the German pointed to the door.</span> <span id="s2913">He said, “This is the room where he committed suicide.”</span> <span id="s2914">So we went over.</span> <span id="s2915">That was a white door.</span> <span id="s2916">And we could… it was locked.</span> <span id="s2917">And so the officers, big guys, you know, about six, seven foot or so, and they tried to open up and it was closed.</span> <span id="s2918">They said, “What do you mean it’s closed?</span> <span id="s2919">Let’s open it up.”</span> <span id="s2920">So I squeezed in between them.</span> <span id="s2921">And the Russian said, “Davay otkryvay!</span> <span id="s2922">Roz dwa tri.”</span> <span id="s2923">We say one, two, three, and the French, you know, un, deux, trois, and the English, well, one, two, three, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2924">I couldn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s2925">And I say, “Vu!”</span> <span id="s2926">And I was pushing, and I said to one of the officers, “You know, when I was in Buchenwald I didn’t dream I will break down that door.”</span> <span id="s2927">It was just a, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2928">And we finally broke it down.</span> <span id="s2929">We walked in there.</span> <span id="s2930">There was a mess.</span> <span id="s2931">There were a lot of people saying, “Strenggeheim,” [top secret].</span> <span id="s2932">Everybody was taking souvenirs.</span> <span id="s2933">But I knew I have to go to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s2934">That means a couple of hundred kilometers or more over the Russian Zone.</span> <span id="s2935">And if they catch me with something like this, they’ll call me a spy, and instead of Frankfurt, the American Zone, I go to Siberia!</span> <span id="s2936">So I didn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s2937">But we got through and we, I could have taken...and it’s still eating my heart when I think about it.</span> <span id="s2938">And we made it to Frankfurt...</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">EM: Well what was in this bunker that you could have taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">MF: It said “Strenggeheim.”</span> <span id="s2941">I don’t know what he wrote.</span> <span id="s2942">Who would remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">EM: Oh, geheim, oh, it was geheim.</span> <span id="s2944">It said…</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">MF: “Strenggeheim,” yeah, top secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">EM: Top secret.</span> <span id="s2947">Top secret things...</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">MF: It was laying all over the floor.</span> <span id="s2949">With matches and lighters, you know, we couldn’t see much.</span> <span id="s2950">They took it.</span> <span id="s2951">I didn’t want to look at it.</span> <span id="s2952">I said, “I know it’s poison to me if I take it.”</span> <span id="s2953">So, then we got to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s2954">There was a DP Camp outside of Frankfurt called Zeilsheim.</span> <span id="s2955">We went in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">EM: What was it called, Salzheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">MF: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">EM: What was it called?</span> <span id="s2959">I need to make...</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">MF: Zeilsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">EM: Zeils-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">MF: Z-E-I-L-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">EM: S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">MF: S-H-E-I-M.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">EM: O.K., Zeilsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">MF: Zeilsheim.</span> <span id="s2967">And they kicked...the Americans kicked the Germans out of a few streets and they gave us the houses to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">EM: Today is June 16, 1995.</span> <span id="s2970">We are continuing the interview with Professor Filar.</span> <span id="s2971">Edith Millman interviewing.</span> <span id="s2972">This is tape three, side one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">MF: So we are now in the DP camp in Zeilsheim, near Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">EM: Speak slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2976">Well, they gave me a little upright piano.</span> <span id="s2977">We had a nice little apartment, and because I was a pianist they gave us two rooms.</span> <span id="s2978">In the kitchen there was a terrace, and underneath was a garage.</span> <span id="s2979">I never expected I’ll one day have my car in there, that I will have a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">EM: Was this in a camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s2982">It was in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">EM: Oh, it was in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">MF: It was the Germans who were kicked out of there, and the American Army gave us.</span> <span id="s2985">They took a few streets and they put us in there.</span> <span id="s2986">So, since they found out I was a pianist, somebody gave me an upright piano.</span> <span id="s2987">And the stove with a pipe going into the… I have pictures from that.</span> <span id="s2988">And I started to practice.</span> <span id="s2989">And we started, we found out that there were concerts on the radio station in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s2990">So my brothers and I, Michael and Joe, used to go to the concerts.</span> <span id="s2991">And I remember I repeated the Chopin E minor Concerto.</span> <span id="s2992">I had it in my fingers already.</span> <span id="s2993">So, I went once to a rehearsal of the orchestra.</span> <span id="s2994">I could get in there.</span> <span id="s2995">And when they finished I went up to the conductor.</span> <span id="s2996">His name was Hans Blümer, B-L-Ü-M-E-R.</span> <span id="s2997">And I told him, “I’m a pianist.</span> <span id="s2998">I live just a few miles from here in this DP camp.</span> <span id="s2999">And I was a graduate of a conservatory in Poland.</span> <span id="s3000">And I would like to audition for you.</span> <span id="s3001">Maybe you’ll like me.</span> <span id="s3002">Maybe we’ll play a concert together.”</span> <span id="s3003">So he said, “Wait till the musicians leave, when it was over, and then I’ll listen to you.”</span> <span id="s3004">So that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s3005">I played about ten minutes.</span> <span id="s3006">He stopped me and said, “O.K., you’re gonna play.”</span> <span id="s3007">And I got my first concert.</span> <span id="s3008">Now, he was supposed to be not a Nazi, because at that time, anybody who got a job had to be approven by the American authorities.</span> <span id="s3009">So they checked him out, the CIA or somebody did.</span> <span id="s3010">Somehow later they discovered that he lied on this paper which he filled out.</span> <span id="s3011">He said he was not a Nazi, but he was.</span> <span id="s3012">So they fired him.</span> <span id="s3013">But after the concert came down the director of the Kammermusik Abteilung, which is the chamber music department, and he asked me if I would play some solo work for them.</span> <span id="s3014">They liked my playing.</span> <span id="s3015">I got a very beautiful write-up.</span> <span id="s3016">So I did.</span> <span id="s3017">We became pretty good friends.</span> <span id="s3018">He told me he was drafted into the army, into the German Army three weeks before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s3019">He wasn’t physically very fit.</span> <span id="s3020">He looked it.</span> <span id="s3021">So I believed him.</span> <span id="s3022">He was lying.</span> <span id="s3023">I found out thirty years later.</span> <span id="s3024">He was here in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3025">And he told me that he didn’t play the piano, he was five years in the army.</span> <span id="s3026">He forgot what he told me twenty years ago, but I remembered.</span> <span id="s3027">But he was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s3028">I don’t think he was a bad man.</span> <span id="s3029">I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s3030">So I played and he liked it.</span> <span id="s3031">And I said to him, “Listen, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s3032">I am at crossroads.</span> <span id="s3033">I don’t know what to do with myself because I didn’t see the piano during the war; now I’m back, so to speak, not completely, but I feel I’m getting back in form.</span> <span id="s3034">Should I go on playing the piano or should I quit because I’m also interested in medicine?”</span> <span id="s3035">Because we had some medical people in our family.</span> <span id="s3036">And I said, you know, I was in my twenties then, I said, “It’s a big hole in a young man’s life, five years, at this age.</span> <span id="s3037">And then to compete with the whole world, it’s not such an easy thing.”</span> <span id="s3038">I said, “Who are the great pianists around here?</span> <span id="s3039">I’d like to audition for somebody, because the review doesn’t mean much.</span> <span id="s3040">I don’t know who the critic is, you know.”</span> <span id="s3041">So he said, “Gieseking is in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s3042">Forty minutes on the train and you’re there.”</span> <span id="s3043">I said, “Gieseking?”</span> <span id="s3044">I knew who he was.</span> <span id="s3045">He was god!</span> <span id="s3046">You know, I heard him when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s3047">I heard him in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3048">He was one of the greatest pianists in the world.</span> <span id="s3049">He played plenty in America.</span> <span id="s3050">Everybody knew that.</span> <span id="s3051">He died in ‘56.</span> <span id="s3052">Actually he didn’t die, he was killed, in a way, by doctors who made a mistake...</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">EM: Yeah, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">MF: Operating on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">EM: Now you heard about Gieseking before, and you wanted to play for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3057">I didn’t hear much.</span> <span id="s3058">I was a kid at that time, but I knew that he was...around.</span> <span id="s3059">First of all, I couldn’t travel every, anywhere I wanted.</span> <span id="s3060">I also knew that Wilhelm Backhaus was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s3061">But I knew that Backhaus was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s3062">So I wouldn’t go anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">EM: Backhaus, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3065">Very important sounding name, Backhaus.</span> <span id="s3066">It actually means a bakery in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">MF: Backhaus.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">EM: Haus, right.</span> <span id="s3070">So how did you get...</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">MF: Anyway, so he gave me the address.</span> <span id="s3072">I said, “Do you know him?</span> <span id="s3073">Could you write me a letter of recommendation?”</span> <span id="s3074">He said, “No.</span> <span id="s3075">I know him.</span> <span id="s3076">He doesn’t know me from Adam.</span> <span id="s3077">I’m not gonna do anything for you.</span> <span id="s3078">We’ll get you the address.</span> <span id="s3079">And [unclear] you will go on the train.</span> <span id="s3080">What are you gonna lose?”</span> <span id="s3081">“You mean just like that?”</span> <span id="s3082">He says, “So what?</span> <span id="s3083">If he doesn’t take you, so you’ll be where you are right now.”</span> <span id="s3084">I didn’t want to go, because first of all I worried if he wasn’t a Nazi during the war, and if he was, I wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s3085">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3086">I didn’t read papers in the concentration camp!</span> <span id="s3087">They didn’t deliver, you know.</span> <span id="s3088">So, but there was a half-Jewish young lady by the name of Louisa Kahn, Lulu Kahn, we...and she married this lawyer, this Jewish lawyer, who survived in [unclear].</span> <span id="s3089">Her father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s3090">He was murdered.</span> <span id="s3091">Her mother was not.</span> <span id="s3092">Somehow she survived.</span> <span id="s3093">So I asked her, “Lulu, did you hear anything about Gieseking?</span> <span id="s3094">What was he doing during the war?”</span> <span id="s3095">So she said, “All I know, he played concerts.</span> <span id="s3096">As a matter of fact,” she says, “I heard him play Mendelssohn’s Songs Without Words in a concert.”</span> <span id="s3097">I said, “Mendelssohn’s Songs Without Words?</span> <span id="s3098">I’m going.</span> <span id="s3099">If he played this, then that tells me something.</span> <span id="s3100">Whatever.</span> <span id="s3101">So it’s worth giving it a try.”</span> <span id="s3102">So they gave me the address.</span> <span id="s3103">It was Wilhelmina Strasse 24.</span> <span id="s3104">I went to Wiesbaden, came out of the train station—ruins, left and right.</span> <span id="s3105">So I ask her, “Where is Wilhelmina Strasse?”</span> <span id="s3106">They showed me, “Up the hill there, this way.”</span> <span id="s3107">I go up there, pass some houses, and there was a field.</span> <span id="s3108">Then I see Wilhelmina Strasse 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and a field.</span> <span id="s3109">And I have 24.</span> <span id="s3110">So an old lady walks there with a shopping bag, so I stopped her.</span> <span id="s3111">I spoke pretty good German.</span> <span id="s3112">And I said, “I have an address here, Wilhelmina Strasse 24, and this is 10 and there’s a field.</span> <span id="s3113">There’s got to be a mistake.</span> <span id="s3114">There’s no...” “No, no!”</span> <span id="s3115">She says, “Da unten am Kriegerdenkmal...” where the monument for the war, you know, people, is there.</span> <span id="s3116">“There is a Wilhelmina Strasse.</span> <span id="s3117">It’s beautiful, sort of villas.</span> <span id="s3118">Go down there.</span> <span id="s3119">You’ll find it.”</span> <span id="s3120">I went.</span> <span id="s3121">Here it was.</span> <span id="s3122">I saw a beautiful villa, maybe five, six acres of land, a swimming pool, beautiful gate.</span> <span id="s3123">I walked in, it’s a three-story house, a garden, flowers, trees, just a dream of a place.</span> <span id="s3124">And there were many doors.</span> <span id="s3125">I didn’t know, I just saw a button so I pressed it.</span> <span id="s3126">Guess who opened the door?</span> <span id="s3127">Mr. Gieseking himself.</span> <span id="s3128">He was six foot five.</span> <span id="s3129">I looked all the way up.</span> <span id="s3130">And I didn’t have any introduction so I talked fast.</span> <span id="s3131">But I said, “Herr Professor,” I said, “I’m a pianist.</span> <span id="s3132">I’m a graduate of a conservatory in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3133">Maybe you heard...about my teacher, Professor Zbignew Drzewiecki, the head of the Chopin Society, the Director of the Cons-...” “Oh yeah, yeah, very, very, sure, a very good man.</span> <span id="s3134">I heard of him.”</span> <span id="s3135">“Could I, could you give, offer me ten minutes of your precious time?</span> <span id="s3136">Could I talk to you?”</span> <span id="s3137">I didn’t go out there to study.</span> <span id="s3138">I just wanted to know what to do with myself after so many years.</span> <span id="s3139">I was at the crossroads.</span> <span id="s3140">So he looked me up, you know, up and down.</span> <span id="s3141">And I passed.</span> <span id="s3142">So he says, “Kommen Sie herein.”</span> <span id="s3143">So I went in.</span> <span id="s3144">We went into the music room.</span> <span id="s3145">A beautiful house.</span> <span id="s3146">Two pianos, a big, big room.</span> <span id="s3147">He sat at his desk.</span> <span id="s3148">He said, “Na, was wollen Sie?”</span> <span id="s3149">[What do you want?]</span> <span id="s3150">I said, “Professor, I am Jewish.”</span> <span id="s3151">First thing I said.</span> <span id="s3152">I said, he doesn’t like it, good-bye and I’ll walk out.</span> <span id="s3153">He didn’t react.</span> <span id="s3154">I said, “I was in seven concentration camps.</span> <span id="s3155">I lost my entire family except with a brother, and one who survived in Russia, and a sister who survived in Russia.</span> <span id="s3156">But I lost over a hundred people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3157">There’s nobody left.</span> <span id="s3158">My parents, my sister Helen, my first piano teacher, my brother Isaac, his wife and a little boy who was about three years old when he was murdered, uncles and aunts and cousins.</span> <span id="s3159">And we were over a hundred people in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s3160">There’s nobody left.</span> <span id="s3161">One cousin in Paris, and one in Chicago, and that’s it.”</span> <span id="s3162">So I said, “Look, I played now with the orchestra, and I don’t know, the review is very good.</span> <span id="s3163">It doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s3164">Could...you offer me ten minutes of your precious time?</span> <span id="s3165">Could I play for you?</span> <span id="s3166">And you will tell me what should I do.</span> <span id="s3167">If you’ll tell me it’s too late, I’m not good enough, whatever, and I’ll quit, and I’ll go into medicine.</span> <span id="s3168">I’m interested in medicine.</span> <span id="s3169">Because your...word will mean everything to me, because that review means nothing.</span> <span id="s3170">I don’t know who wrote it.</span> <span id="s3171">I have no idea.”</span> <span id="s3172">“Oh!”</span> <span id="s3173">he said, “I understand.</span> <span id="s3174">But you’re not the only one who wants to play for me.</span> <span id="s3175">Why didn’t you write?</span> <span id="s3176">Just knocking on a door like coming in there and say, ‘Here I am.</span> <span id="s3177">I want to play for you.’</span> <span id="s3178">You see, you think you’re the only one?”</span> <span id="s3179">And he opens the drawer out of his desk, pulls out, I don’t know, maybe twenty, thirty letters.</span> <span id="s3180">“People write to me from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s3181">Why didn’t you write?”</span> <span id="s3182">So well, I looked at him and I said, “Professor, did you answer all these letters?”</span> <span id="s3183">So I got a smile out of him.</span> <span id="s3184">He said, “No, it’s too much to write.”</span> <span id="s3185">“So I took a chance.</span> <span id="s3186">You want me to go?</span> <span id="s3187">I’ll leave.</span> <span id="s3188">I don’t demand anything,” I said.</span> <span id="s3189">“I’m just asking you for a chance.”</span> <span id="s3190">“No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s3191">I can’t.</span> <span id="s3192">You should have written.</span> <span id="s3193">They put me on a black list.</span> <span id="s3194">They said I was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s3195">It’s a damn lie.</span> <span id="s3196">I had nothing to do with it.”</span> <span id="s3197">I was amazed he talks so!</span> <span id="s3198">He doesn’t know me from Adam and here a few minutes he talks.</span> <span id="s3199">“No, no, you should have written.</span> <span id="s3200">You should have written.”</span> <span id="s3201">So I got up, and, of course, I was miserable.</span> <span id="s3202">And he could see that I was miserable, because there was nobody else.</span> <span id="s3203">And I didn’t know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s3204">Money I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s3205">I was poor as a church mouse.</span> <span id="s3206">A passport I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s3207">I was a stateless person.</span> <span id="s3208">I was a nobody.</span> <span id="s3209">So I said to him, “Well, I never had any, I didn’t have any luck in the last five years.</span> <span id="s3210">I’ll probably never have it again in my life.”</span> <span id="s3211">And I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s3212">Somehow he saw it and he was honest and it touched him.</span> <span id="s3213">So he said, “Well, Sie sind schon hier.</span> <span id="s3214">Setzen Sie sich hin und spielen Sie was vor.”</span> <span id="s3215">[You’re already here; sit down and play something.]</span> <span id="s3216">Boy, I made it to first base!</span> <span id="s3217">So he opened the piano.</span> <span id="s3218">I played some Bach, or Mozart, or Beethoven.</span> <span id="s3219">I don’t remember exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s3220">But then he says to me, “You’re Polish.</span> <span id="s3221">Why don’t you play some Chopin?”</span> <span id="s3222">So I played a G minor ballad and he flipped.</span> <span id="s3223">He changed.</span> <span id="s3224">He was not the same man.</span> <span id="s3225">He started to smile and he put his arm around me.</span> <span id="s3226">He said, “Sie wollen das Klavierspielen aufgeben?</span> <span id="s3227">Sind Sie wahnsinnig?</span> <span id="s3228">Sie sind doch ein fertiger Pianist.</span> <span id="s3229">Wollen Sie bei mir studieren, glauben Sie dass Sie bei mir was lernen können?”</span> <span id="s3230">I’m quoting him verbatim.</span> <span id="s3231">I’ll never forget it, and so many years.</span> <span id="s3232">He said, “You want to give up playing the piano?</span> <span id="s3233">Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s3234">You’re already a concert pianist!</span> <span id="s3235">Do you want to study with me?</span> <span id="s3236">Do you believe I can teach you something?”</span> <span id="s3237">I said, “God!</span> <span id="s3238">Would you?”</span> <span id="s3239">I didn’t dare to think that far.</span> <span id="s3240">“How much will you charge me for a lesson?”</span> <span id="s3241">And he said, “Sie haben schon genug bezahlt.”</span> <span id="s3242">[You already paid enough.]</span> <span id="s3243">He taught me five years and didn’t take a cent.</span> <span id="s3244">Why?</span> <span id="s3245">I can come for a lesson every Thursday at 10:30.</span> <span id="s3246">The phone doesn’t ring.</span> <span id="s3247">Everything is in ruins.</span> <span id="s3248">“Just come, that’s all.”</span> <span id="s3249">So, yeah, and I stayed for lunch.</span> <span id="s3250">He invited me for lunch and I met his wife, his two little daughters at that time.</span> <span id="s3251">And the older one had a boyfriend she married later, a Hungarian pianist, who lived there and Gieseking didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s3252">It’s quite a story.</span> <span id="s3253">So what we ate for lunch was potatoes.</span> <span id="s3254">So now the Germans didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s3255">So I figured, we have in our DP camp we have, the provisions came from the American Army.</span> <span id="s3256">We had it up to here.</span> <span id="s3257">So I figured, he teaches me for nothing, I’ll bring some stuff with me next week.</span> <span id="s3258">So I did.</span> <span id="s3259">And I came in and I started to unpack and he got angry at me.</span> <span id="s3260">He said, “Why did you do this?</span> <span id="s3261">You had nothing to eat for five years.</span> <span id="s3262">You must eat to get strength to be able to play the piano.</span> <span id="s3263">If you bring it again, you won’t get a lesson.”</span> <span id="s3264">I said, “Professor, I apologize.</span> <span id="s3265">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3266">But you know that I meant well.”</span> <span id="s3267">“Yeah, I understand, but don’t do it again!”</span> <span id="s3268">I said, “O.K.” I figured, I’ll outsmart you!</span> <span id="s3269">And I came back the next week fifteen minutes earlier, and I brought the stuff with me all over again.</span> <span id="s3270">But before he came down from upstairs, I planted all those cans all over the music room, under the piano, between the music, on the window sills, wherever I could find a, you know, I’d think this doesn’t show, I stuck it in there.</span> <span id="s3271">And I had my lesson and I went back home.</span> <span id="s3272">The next week I come in and he looks at me.</span> <span id="s3273">He looks at me.</span> <span id="s3274">He liked that.</span> <span id="s3275">You know, and it was kind of a funny thing for them.</span> <span id="s3276">And he liked that sense of humor and he said to me, “You know, this became a funny room.”</span> <span id="s3277">I said, “What do you mean, Professor?”</span> <span id="s3278">“Well, I go to take some music out of, you know, my bookcase there, and I take out a can of butter.</span> <span id="s3279">Then I go to the window and see if it’s raining, and I see a can of meat.</span> <span id="s3280">Then I pull the chair up under the piano, a can of something else!</span> <span id="s3281">What did I tell you!”</span> <span id="s3282">And he’s, you know, he’s moving his finger at me.</span> <span id="s3283">But he smiled.</span> <span id="s3284">He loved it.</span> <span id="s3285">It was so, it kind of broke the ice, you know?</span> <span id="s3286">And then developed later on into a very wonderful, close friendship, I could say.</span> <span id="s3287">He loved me.</span> <span id="s3288">He really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">EM: So how long did you study with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">MF: Five years.</span> <span id="s3291">One day I came in w-...</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">EM: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">MF: In ‘45, April of ’45, till I went to America in 1950.</span> <span id="s3294">And then when he was here, he had a piano in his hotel room and I always played for him.</span> <span id="s3295">I had some other ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">EM: Now, tell me, so you lived in Zeilsheim all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">MF: No, no, I lived in Zeilsheim about two-and-a-half or three years, or two years.</span> <span id="s3298">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s3299">We were kicked out of there by the American Army, General Hubner, who later became a friend.</span> <span id="s3300">He said, “Enough already.</span> <span id="s3301">We have to go back to a normal life.”</span> <span id="s3302">So we found an apartment in the city of Frankfurt, and I remember we rented a couple of rooms.</span> <span id="s3303">And it was an apartment, yeah.</span> <span id="s3304">I only paid some rent.</span> <span id="s3305">It wasn’t much, right next to the radio station.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">EM: You say “we,” that was you and your two...</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">MF: And my two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">EM: Brothers, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3310">That was summer, so that was in Born Wiesenweg 67, right next to the radio station Eschenheimer Land Strasse, was the radio station that time.</span> <span id="s3311">Today they’re on Dornbusch or someplace else.</span> <span id="s3312">Anyway, so I got my piano in.</span> <span id="s3313">Oh, yeah, Mr. Gembiki, the Jewish lawyer who came back from Canada, and became Assistant Provost Marshall of the city, he got me a piano, a grand, five foot seven.</span> <span id="s3314">So, I had the pi-, so I got rid of the upright, and finally got a grand.</span> <span id="s3315">And then when we moved into Frankfurt, [unclear] then Mr. Offie, Carmel Offie was the right hand of Ambassador William C. Bullitt.</span> <span id="s3316">Offie was...how would you call it, he was working for the American government in Germany.</span> <span id="s3317">And he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">EM: Well how do you spell his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">MF: O-F-F- like in Frank, I-E.</span> <span id="s3320">He was with the State Department, and he was a big shot.</span> <span id="s3321">He loved music.</span> <span id="s3322">I met him through Judge Leventhal, Louis Leventhal, who was the political advisor to the American government in Germany for Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s3323">And I played a lot of concerts, and he came, and we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">EM: Well, where did you play the concerts in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">MF: I played in the radio station.</span> <span id="s3326">I played at recitals.</span> <span id="s3327">I played a lot over the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">EM: Did you make any money?</span> <span id="s3329">Did you get paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">EM: You made money for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">MF: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">EM: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">MF: Not much, but it was all in old marks, you know, it was peanuts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">EM: And so you played, and so you did have recitals, and you played all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">MF: Yes, yeah, I did, with the orchestra and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">EM: And you were taking the lessons...</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">MF: I became quite well-known in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">EM: And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">MF: And I played outside.</span> <span id="s3341">I played in Wiesbaden, I played in Kassel, I played in Munich, I played in Hamburg, wherever.</span> <span id="s3342">And Bad Homburg.</span> <span id="s3343">I played in a lot of places.</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">EM: What happened later?</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3346">Well, so Mr. Offie told me he’s going, but that must have been 1948.</span> <span id="s3347">He’s, yeah, the new marks came out then.</span> <span id="s3348">And everybody could exchange forty new marks for forty old ones, that’s it.</span> <span id="s3349">But all of a sudden, everything which they robbed in Europe was for sale.</span> <span id="s3350">Before this, before the new marks came out, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s3351">All of a sudden everything’s for sale.</span> <span id="s3352">They pulled everything out.</span> <span id="s3353">They were holding it for the new money.</span> <span id="s3354">So I decided, so Offie wanted me to buy a piano for him, a grand.</span> <span id="s3355">So I put an ad—he was too busy, he was a very busy man with the government—so I put an ad in the paper, “I’m looking for a beautiful Steinway or a Bechstein.”</span> <span id="s3356">I didn’t know anything about a Bechstein yet, because Mrs. Bechstein was one of the great friends of Hitler, which I found out when I was here already.</span> <span id="s3357">Maybe a couple years, I bought a book, Who Financed Hitler?</span> <span id="s3358">And there it is.</span> <span id="s3359">Didn’t I ever show that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">EM: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">MF: You won’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3362">So, well, Offie left, and I couldn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s3363">When they answered the ad, it was a junk piano.</span> <span id="s3364">I said, “I asked for a good instrument.</span> <span id="s3365">What are you showing me?</span> <span id="s3366">I’m not interested.”</span> <span id="s3367">Then I got the idea, I said, “He wanted a piano.</span> <span id="s3368">That means that the pianos must be very expensive in the States.</span> <span id="s3369">I won’t be able to afford it.</span> <span id="s3370">Why don’t I buy a piano myself and take it to the States?”</span> <span id="s3371">So I put in again an ad, and it, one, there were junk pianos and all that, but there was one interesting one, a doctor answered.</span> <span id="s3372">“I have a beautiful, what is it, seven-foot-five Steinway, you know.</span> <span id="s3373">And if you’re a concert pianist, something, you’ll love that instrument.”</span> <span id="s3374">So I went there, right near the railroad station, Bahnhof, right there.</span> <span id="s3375">And I came in and the maid opened the door and showed me the piano.</span> <span id="s3376">I walked in there.</span> <span id="s3377">It was a beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s3378">A gorgeous instrument!</span> <span id="s3379">Eighty years old, but hardly used!</span> <span id="s3380">Like a new one!</span> <span id="s3381">Beautiful!</span> <span id="s3382">The doctor comes in and he says, “Oh, Herr Filar, Sie bezahlen jeden Pfennig.”</span> <span id="s3383">I said, “How do you know my name?”</span> <span id="s3384">“Oh, I heard you play.</span> <span id="s3385">I love music.</span> <span id="s3386">I go to concerts.</span> <span id="s3387">So I heard you many times.</span> <span id="s3388">You need that piano.</span> <span id="s3389">You’ll pay every cent for it!”</span> <span id="s3390">I said, “How much is it?”</span> <span id="s3391">He says, “Six thousand marks.”</span> <span id="s3392">The dollar was fifteen marks.</span> <span id="s3393">That was $400.</span> <span id="s3394">I said, “Where am I gonna get you six thousand marks?</span> <span id="s3395">I got forty marks in the bank.”</span> <span id="s3396">He said, “If you want to buy that piano, you’ll get the money.”</span> <span id="s3397">If you have dollars, you could do it.</span> <span id="s3398">And I had, I played in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s3399">And I made some money there.</span> <span id="s3400">And Gieseking got me some concerts, so I made some money, and I had a couple of thousand dollars or so.</span> <span id="s3401">So I knew a black marketeer.</span> <span id="s3402">Where you gonna get marks?</span> <span id="s3403">So you have to talk with a guy.</span> <span id="s3404">I saw him once on the street walking with a fiddle case.</span> <span id="s3405">I said, “You’re a violinist?</span> <span id="s3406">Since when?”</span> <span id="s3407">“Since no.</span> <span id="s3408">I don’t play the violin.</span> <span id="s3409">I have a lot of marks in there.</span> <span id="s3410">That’s the only way to carry it!”</span> <span id="s3411">It was funny.</span> <span id="s3412">So I told him I found a piano I wanted to buy.</span> <span id="s3413">He said, “On you I won’t make a cent.</span> <span id="s3414">How much do you need?”</span> <span id="s3415">I said, “Six thousand marks.”</span> <span id="s3416">“Give me $400.</span> <span id="s3417">I’ll get you 6000 marks.”</span> <span id="s3418">In ten and twenty mark denominations.</span> <span id="s3419">That’s what it was, the whole suitcase, full of marks.</span> <span id="s3420">And I bought the piano.</span> <span id="s3421">It was a beautiful instrument.</span> <span id="s3422">And I remember, I still lived in Zeilsheim at that time, just before we moved out, so I didn’t have room where to put that piano.</span> <span id="s3423">So I knew some people on a few streets away.</span> <span id="s3424">So I asked the lady if she will rent me some room.</span> <span id="s3425">I’ll pay her for it monthly, whatever it is, and we’ll put the piano there.</span> <span id="s3426">She said, oh, she loves music.</span> <span id="s3427">Fine.</span> <span id="s3428">So I put it in there, and I called the piano tuner.</span> <span id="s3429">He was a Bechstein man.</span> <span id="s3430">And that was a Steinway.</span> <span id="s3431">So, he came in and looked at it and says, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s3432">I said, “Let’s open it up and let’s take a vacuum cleaner and clean out the dust from there.”</span> <span id="s3433">He just told me he couldn’t take the keyboard out.</span> <span id="s3434">So I said, “Let me try.”</span> <span id="s3435">I pulled it out.</span> <span id="s3436">He couldn’t and I did.</span> <span id="s3437">So he said, “I’m a Bechstein man, not a Steinway.”</span> <span id="s3438">So the old lady who owned the house there, she jumped at him and said, “Shame on you!</span> <span id="s3439">You are a mechanic, and he pulled it out and you couldn’t do it?</span> <span id="s3440">You’re an idiot!”</span> <span id="s3441">She really let him have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">MF: Anyway, then I took the piano to Frankfurt, and when we moved in it was summer and the windows were open.</span> <span id="s3444">I wanted to go to the piano and play, so I closed the windows and I started to play.</span> <span id="s3445">The phone rings.</span> <span id="s3446">A neighbor from across the street.</span> <span id="s3447">“Herr Filar, we know who you are.</span> <span id="s3448">Why did you close the window?</span> <span id="s3449">We love classic music!”</span> <span id="s3450">That’s the difference.</span> <span id="s3451">“Keep them open!</span> <span id="s3452">We heard your concerts!</span> <span id="s3453">We know who you are.</span> <span id="s3454">Please unclose the windows.”</span> <span id="s3455">So, well, I lived there, and I played a lot.</span> <span id="s3456">And then, of course, the black market was a problem.</span> <span id="s3457">And I needed a car.</span> <span id="s3458">Well, who could afford a car?</span> <span id="s3459">Forget it.</span> <span id="s3460">But the city of Frankfurt had used cars, some who were left from the war, private cars.</span> <span id="s3461">And some who were taken away by the police from black marketeers, after it was a trial and whatever and they, because they were smuggling.</span> <span id="s3462">So you had to have some protection to be able to buy a car like this, because they would sell it for the Reichsmarks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">EM: You mean protection, you mean pull, you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">MF: Pull, yeah.</span> <span id="s3465">It’s called Vitamin...P.</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3468">So, I found out where it is.</span> <span id="s3469">It belongs to the city.</span> <span id="s3470">I went to the city hall.</span> <span id="s3471">I came in there and he looked at me; he knew I am not German.</span> <span id="s3472">And he said, “Not, no, not, nicht, not today!</span> <span id="s3473">Come next week.”</span> <span id="s3474">And I heard, “Come next week,” I don’t know, twenty, thirty times.</span> <span id="s3475">Mr. Gembiki, who came back from Canada, bought a ruined house, rebuilt it, and created a center of beautiful music.</span> <span id="s3476">Great people used to come there, the primadonnas from the opera house, American generals, General Hubner was there.</span> <span id="s3477">He was the head of the First Army.</span> <span id="s3478">And there were some other officers from the American government.</span> <span id="s3479">And I was there, I played.</span> <span id="s3480">And then I told Mr. Gieseking about it, because it was fantastic food and drinks and wine.</span> <span id="s3481">You name it, it was...like an oasis, you know.</span> <span id="s3482">So one day they told me, so yeah, so I..</span> <span id="s3483">.</span> <span id="s3484">when I went there I was told that I should...get a letter.</span> <span id="s3485">If Mr. Gieseking would write me a letter that I’m a concert pianist and I play, and I am not a black marketeer, and I need a car because the trains were overloaded with black marketeers.</span> <span id="s3486">A ticket cost fifty cents to go, I don’t know, six, seven, eight hours.</span> <span id="s3487">So everybody was on that train.</span> <span id="s3488">And I played once at the University of Marburg, and I stood on one leg for two hours, to get there.</span> <span id="s3489">So I told Gieseking.</span> <span id="s3490">He said, “Well, I can do.</span> <span id="s3491">I can write you a letter to the Minister of Culture,” which was in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s3492">I took it.</span> <span id="s3493">I went there.</span> <span id="s3494">The doors opened up in a minute.</span> <span id="s3495">That was a, you know, a magic letter.</span> <span id="s3496">That name was...magic.</span> <span id="s3497">So the Minister said to me, “I have nothing to do with it, but I can, I’ll write you a letter to the Transport Minister.</span> <span id="s3498">He has something to do with cars.”</span> <span id="s3499">So I went to him and I got a letter, that I deserved to get one for official price and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s3500">When I went there, it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s3501">Nothing worked.</span> <span id="s3502">One day, one evening, on a Friday evening or a Saturday, weekend it was, there was a concert in Mr. Gembiki’s home.</span> <span id="s3503">And there was a Mr. Weber who was also in Buchenwald, a German.</span> <span id="s3504">And he was an Assistant Provost Marshall or something in the city.</span> <span id="s3505">He was a big shot in the City Hall.</span> <span id="s3506">So I said to him, you know, and I played.</span> <span id="s3507">And he liked that.</span> <span id="s3508">So we became kind of friendly.</span> <span id="s3509">So I said to him, “Look, Herr Weber,” I said, “I have this kind of a recommendation, from the Minister.</span> <span id="s3510">And I can’t get a car.</span> <span id="s3511">I go there, he tells me nothing.</span> <span id="s3512">‘Come next week.</span> <span id="s3513">Come next week.</span> <span id="s3514">’” So Mr. Weber started a laugh.</span> <span id="s3515">And I said, “Herr Weber, what is so funny?”</span> <span id="s3516">He said, “What’s so funny?</span> <span id="s3517">I’m the boss of that guy who sends you away!</span> <span id="s3518">So you go there Monday.”</span> <span id="s3519">He says, “What is this, Saturday?</span> <span id="s3520">I’ll go Sunday to a parking lot.</span> <span id="s3521">I’ll pick out the best car for you.</span> <span id="s3522">You go to him Monday and he’ll say, ‘No,’ and you tell him to call me.</span> <span id="s3523">You’ll see he knows my telephone number by memory.</span> <span id="s3524">He’ll dial it right away.”</span> <span id="s3525">That’s exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s3526">I went there.</span> <span id="s3527">The guy says, “Nothing.</span> <span id="s3528">Come next week.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3529">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">MF: I said, “This time Herr Weber sent me.”</span> <span id="s3531">He said, “Who?”</span> <span id="s3532">“So you heard me.</span> <span id="s3533">Herr Weber.”</span> <span id="s3534">“Oh yeah?”</span> <span id="s3535">“He said if something’s unclear you can call him.”</span> <span id="s3536">Before I said, “Call him,” he was already dialing, without looking at the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">EM: So you got the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s3538">MF: So it was “Jawohl Herr Weber, schon gut, ja, ja, stimmt.”</span> <span id="s3539">[Yes sir, Mr. Weber, very good, yes, yes, agreed.]</span> <span id="s3540">“Blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s3541">Come Thursday to get the key.”</span> <span id="s3542">So Mr. Weber picked a car out for you.”</span> <span id="s3543">It was an old Opel, built in 1938, and that was in 1947.</span> <span id="s3544">Nine years old, or maybe ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">EM: So then...</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">MF: I got it for three dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s3547">EM: For three dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3549">And I had to buy the battery on the black market!</span> <span id="s3550">That was more than the whole car.</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">EM: O.K. So...</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">MF: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s3553">And so, and I rode it till 1950 and I sold it for $500 before I went to the States.</span> <span id="s3554">It was the best deal I ever made.</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">EM: So how did you get to the United States?</span> <span id="s3556">How did you get papers and come?</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">MF: Well, there was a registration.</span> <span id="s3558">Well, there was the Truman Act, about people, DP, displaced persons, who went through camps, were allowed to come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">EM: Tell me, you said something that you went to France for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">MF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">EM: Could you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">MF: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s3563">I had cousins in France, one cousin, Jeanette, and her brother, both married, had children already born in France.</span> <span id="s3564">Her, their mother and my mother were sisters.</span> <span id="s3565">They also survived the Holocaust, but they landed in France, and they stayed there.</span> <span id="s3566">And the children were born, now they’re French.</span> <span id="s3567">They’re French people.</span> <span id="s3568">I wanted to find them.</span> <span id="s3569">I wanted to see Paris.</span> <span id="s3570">So I had all of twenty dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s3571">And I got on a night train.</span> <span id="s3572">And I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s3573">I arrived there about six, seven in the morning.</span> <span id="s3574">And they told me there—I didn’t have the address; I didn’t know where they were; I was just going to look—so they told me, “There are little hotels around Gare de l’Est, the east station, there in Paris.</span> <span id="s3575">But you better look at a room before you take it, because they might rent rooms there for a short while or something.”</span> <span id="s3576">So I went up to one room.</span> <span id="s3577">They showed me.</span> <span id="s3578">I said, “Forget it.”</span> <span id="s3579">And I walked out.</span> <span id="s3580">And I went to a little café there.</span> <span id="s3581">I left my luggage at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s3582">I had a bowl of some breakfast, and I bought a paper and I started to read French.</span> <span id="s3583">I had six years of it in high school.</span> <span id="s3584">I said, “Hey!</span> <span id="s3585">I know that!</span> <span id="s3586">I know this and I know...” And then I walked there and look around.</span> <span id="s3587">Then somebody calls me from behind.</span> <span id="s3588">“Marian!”</span> <span id="s3589">I said, “Who’s that?”</span> <span id="s3590">“What are you doing in Paris?”</span> <span id="s3591">He was a former boyfriend of my older sister.</span> <span id="s3592">He also survived and he was there.</span> <span id="s3593">I said, “Well, I came to look for my cousins, you know, the Mais.”</span> <span id="s3594">He said, “You’re looking for your cousins?</span> <span id="s3595">Well I know them.</span> <span id="s3596">I know where they live.</span> <span id="s3597">Let’s go to a phone!”</span> <span id="s3598">Just like that, and five minutes later I was talking to my cousin.</span> <span id="s3599">He says, “Come on over!”</span> <span id="s3600">And they lived on Boulevard St. Michel.</span> <span id="s3601">I speak French, too.</span> <span id="s3602">So I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s3603">We saw Paris.</span> <span id="s3604">We went sight-seeing.</span> <span id="s3605">It was a fan-, fascinating, you know, experience after a horrible war.</span> <span id="s3606">And then I was there again.</span> <span id="s3607">I think it was in ‘48, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">EM: But you played there, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">MF: Not yet.</span> <span id="s3610">In ‘4-...</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">EM: Oh, tell me about when you played.</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">MF: No, when I first came I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3613">I..</span> <span id="s3614">.</span> <span id="s3615">well I was just a tourist.</span> <span id="s3616">I wanted to see Chopin’s grave and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">MF: You know, I saw the landmarks in Paris and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">EM: Yeah, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">MF: And I revived my French.</span> <span id="s3621">And I met some very interesting people.</span> <span id="s3622">And I went back.</span> <span id="s3623">Then I went again in 1948, and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s3624">And my cousin Jeanette said to me, “There’s a big manager coming from New York, we heard.”</span> <span id="s3625">They knew some people already.</span> <span id="s3626">They were already domesticated in Paris.</span> <span id="s3627">“And he’ll be in the Jewish Agency...” and what’s the name of that [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">EM: The Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">MF: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s3630">EM: The Joint Distribution?</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">MF: Yeah, American Joint, that’s right.</span> <span id="s3632">American Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s3633">“So we got you a meeting here Friday morning at ten o’clock you gotta be there.</span> <span id="s3634">His name is Sol Hurok.”</span> <span id="s3635">I had no idea who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">EM: Sol Hurok?</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">MF: Yeah, the biggest manager in the United States, who came to America from Russia without a cent in his pocket, by the way.</span> <span id="s3638">I read a little book about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3639">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">MF: So, I came, so I went there.</span> <span id="s3641">And the man who introduced me said that I am studying with one of the greatest pianists in the world, with Walter Gieseking.</span> <span id="s3642">And he jumped at me, Hurok.</span> <span id="s3643">He said, “You’re studying with that Nazi?”</span> <span id="s3644">“Boy,” I said.</span> <span id="s3645">“I had no idea that he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s3646">I inquired before I went to...play for him.</span> <span id="s3647">And I didn’t read any papers in Buchenwald.”</span> <span id="s3648">I said, “They didn’t deliver papers there.</span> <span id="s3649">So, I heard from a half-Jewish lady that he was a decent man, and played Mendelssohn in a recital.</span> <span id="s3650">And he helped me a great deal.</span> <span id="s3651">I learned a lot, and he likes me a lot.</span> <span id="s3652">He doesn’t charge me a cent.</span> <span id="s3653">As a matter of fact,” I said, “he is gonna play in January of ‘49 in Carnegie Hall a recital.”</span> <span id="s3654">And Hurok looks at me and says, “He is not gonna play.</span> <span id="s3655">I’m telling you this.”</span> <span id="s3656">I see that’s...a war between the two.</span> <span id="s3657">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s3658">And I’m right in the middle of it.</span> <span id="s3659">“I want to hear you play.”</span> <span id="s3660">I said, “Well, I have a key to a small hall in Salle Playel.”</span> <span id="s3661">That’s like Carnegie Hall, but in the basement are three smaller halls, for about three, four hundred people.</span> <span id="s3662">And I had, through my cousin I got a key there and I could practice.</span> <span id="s3663">And it was a good piano.</span> <span id="s3664">“O.K.,” he says, “Monday morning at ten o’clock we’ll be there.”</span> <span id="s3665">So I got there a little earlier, like nine maybe, get the key and go in there.</span> <span id="s3666">It’s not the same piano.</span> <span id="s3667">A problem.</span> <span id="s3668">And so it’s a very average instrument.</span> <span id="s3669">So I went back to the office and said, “What happened?</span> <span id="s3670">Why this change?”</span> <span id="s3671">“Oh, we had a concert last night in the big hall.</span> <span id="s3672">We needed two pianos for the Mozart Concerto for two pianos.</span> <span id="s3673">So we took the good one out.</span> <span id="s3674">And it will be back there tonight.”</span> <span id="s3675">I said, “Tonight is too late.”</span> <span id="s3676">Anyway, Hurok came in with a photographer and press people, whatever.</span> <span id="s3677">He came in with ten, fifteen people and some others he wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s3678">I played for him and he liked it.</span> <span id="s3679">As a matter of fact, I was the only one he took a picture with.</span> <span id="s3680">So I have this picture.</span> <span id="s3681">I showed it to you.</span> <span id="s3682">And he said to me, “I am ready to take you to America.</span> <span id="s3683">I’ll be glad to take you to America.</span> <span id="s3684">Are you ready to be hungry for the first five years?”</span> <span id="s3685">I felt like somebody hit me in the face.</span> <span id="s3686">What I went through, I came out of...maybe I weighed about, I don’t know, eighty pounds, something like that.</span> <span id="s3687">I was half dead.</span> <span id="s3688">I looked like a living skeleton.</span> <span id="s3689">And here comes a rich uncle from America, offers me to be hungry again for the next five years.</span> <span id="s3690">I wish he would try.</span> <span id="s3691">He’ll find out what it is, because I know very well.</span> <span id="s3692">But I didn’t answer.</span> <span id="s3693">I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s3694">But I said to him, “Well, Mr. Hurok, if you liked me on this piano, I just bought a beautiful old instrument, a Steinway, hardly played, in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s3695">Maybe you’ll be in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s3696">So, if you will be, I’ll...if you liked me on this piano, I’m sure you’ll like me a lot better on a beautiful instrument.”</span> <span id="s3697">“Oh,” he said, “as a matter of fact, yes, I’ll be in Frankfurt next week.</span> <span id="s3698">Give me your phone number.</span> <span id="s3699">I’ll call you.”</span> <span id="s3700">And I was supposed to go back.</span> <span id="s3701">In the meantime, Gieseking, before I met Hurok, Gieseking was in Paris.</span> <span id="s3702">He was in the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s3703">He got a visa for the States, for January.</span> <span id="s3704">He introduced me to some very important musicians in Paris, the top people there.</span> <span id="s3705">And I met… Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">EM: This is an interview with Professor Marian Filar, Edith Millman interviewing, tape three, side two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">MF: Yeah, so Mr. Gieseking introduced me to those people.</span> <span id="s3708">So I told him when he left already, went back, I don’t know where he went, but he was not in Paris any more.</span> <span id="s3709">But I saw those French people.</span> <span id="s3710">I told them what happened, who I met, and so on.</span> <span id="s3711">They got really incensed.</span> <span id="s3712">They said, “The nerve to offer you, after the hell you went through, to be hungry?”</span> <span id="s3713">I..</span> <span id="s3714">.</span> <span id="s3715">well, today I realize maybe it was just a matter of speech.</span> <span id="s3716">Maybe he said, “It won’t be so great in the beginning.”</span> <span id="s3717">But what, I took it literally.</span> <span id="s3718">I couldn’t understand it any different.</span> <span id="s3719">So they said, “No, well you’re not going back to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s3720">We have an audition for you here with the Symphony Orchestra called Orchestre Cologne,” a very famous orchestra in France.</span> <span id="s3721">“And you will play with the Symphony in Paris.</span> <span id="s3722">You’ll get to America without him.</span> <span id="s3723">You live in the American Zone.</span> <span id="s3724">There is some law passed by the...President in Congress that you people will be able to go to the States anyway.</span> <span id="s3725">You need him like a hole in the head.”</span> <span id="s3726">Well, I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s3727">I had no idea that he was such a big manager.</span> <span id="s3728">So, and I was young, unexperienced, and these were very important people.</span> <span id="s3729">So I listened to them, and I stayed, and I had the audition, played for the conductor of the orchestra.</span> <span id="s3730">And I got a concert.</span> <span id="s3731">I played, for the last concert in Europe before coming here.</span> <span id="s3732">And I came here on March 3, 1950, just two weeks before.</span> <span id="s3733">So I played in Paris with the Symphony.</span> <span id="s3734">I got a great success.</span> <span id="s3735">So I got back a little later, and my brother Michael said to me, “A man called here.</span> <span id="s3736">He said his name was Sol Hurok.</span> <span id="s3737">He asked for you.</span> <span id="s3738">And I told him you were still in Paris, so he hung up.”</span> <span id="s3739">And I met another man.</span> <span id="s3740">When I came here, you know, a few months later, I found out who Hurok was.</span> <span id="s3741">I said, “Boy, did I make a mistake.</span> <span id="s3742">I had no idea,” I said.</span> <span id="s3743">“What kind of an enticing proposition is to go to the States to be hungry?”</span> <span id="s3744">I wasn’t hungry in Europe.</span> <span id="s3745">I was doing great.</span> <span id="s3746">I had a car, I had a beautiful piano, I had a beautiful apartment and a maid.</span> <span id="s3747">I want to go to America and be hungry?</span> <span id="s3748">Who needs it?</span> <span id="s3749">Well, anyway, so I tried to reach him.</span> <span id="s3750">I tried to call him up and explain what happened.</span> <span id="s3751">Maybe he’ll understand.</span> <span id="s3752">Uh oh, “Mr. Hurok is in Europe.</span> <span id="s3753">Oh, what’s your name?”</span> <span id="s3754">I told him.</span> <span id="s3755">“Mr. Hurok is on the moon.</span> <span id="s3756">Mr. Hurok is in hell.</span> <span id="s3757">Mr. Hurok is here and there.”</span> <span id="s3758">He don’t want to see me.</span> <span id="s3759">It was quite obvious.</span> <span id="s3760">Not only he didn’t want to see me, but years later I found out that he actually stopped my career, in a way, if you want to say that.</span> <span id="s3761">And it was a pretty dirty thing to do.</span> <span id="s3762">Because I did play.</span> <span id="s3763">I did play with Ormandy fourteen times and I was with the Philadelphia Orchestra.</span> <span id="s3764">I had my debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Carnegie Hall with Ormandy conducting, played a Chopin F minor Concerto.</span> <span id="s3765">And I played in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3766">I played in Washington with the Symphony.</span> <span id="s3767">I played all over.</span> <span id="s3768">But how long can you go on playing by yourself, trying to get your connections, some from Europe, so on?</span> <span id="s3769">You need a manager.</span> <span id="s3770">You can’t do everything by yourself because you have to practice.</span> <span id="s3771">You don’t even have time to sleep.</span> <span id="s3772">You can’t do it.</span> <span id="s3773">So I started, so somebody wrote a letter, right even at the beginning, when I didn’t know English yet.</span> <span id="s3774">Somebody from Europe wrote a letter of recommendation to the Vice President of Columbia Concerts the biggest management.</span> <span id="s3775">He was called André Mertens.</span> <span id="s3776">It was a Jewish fellow from Berlin.</span> <span id="s3777">I got an appointment, came in there.</span> <span id="s3778">He kept me waiting in the waiting room for about an hour.</span> <span id="s3779">That’s the way they were doing it, to soften you up.</span> <span id="s3780">So you come in and you’re already beat before you even open your mouth.</span> <span id="s3781">So I come in there and I told him in German, and I said, “Mr. Mertens, I came here...”</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">EM: Mertens?</span> <span id="s3783">How was...</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">MF: M-E-R-T-E-N-S.</span> <span id="s3785">I said, “Mr. Mertens, I understand you come from Berlin and you speak German.</span> <span id="s3786">I am just here a few weeks.</span> <span id="s3787">I already go to school learning English, but I don’t know it yet.</span> <span id="s3788">Could we speak in German?”</span> <span id="s3789">So he said something to me in English.</span> <span id="s3790">And I said, “I told you, I don’t know what you’re saying.”</span> <span id="s3791">And he said, “You understand.</span> <span id="s3792">You understand.”</span> <span id="s3793">And I said, “But I don’t.”</span> <span id="s3794">And again, he played ping pong with me, going back and forth.</span> <span id="s3795">He was making an idiot out of me.</span> <span id="s3796">I got up and I left.</span> <span id="s3797">And I remember I had tears in my eyes in the elevator.</span> <span id="s3798">I said, “What a bum!</span> <span id="s3799">What a crude guy!</span> <span id="s3800">Why would he do it to me, for what reason?”</span> <span id="s3801">Then I went to Marx Levine, he was the President of NCAC.</span> <span id="s3802">That was the second biggest organization in the States.</span> <span id="s3803">And he greeted me when I walked in.</span> <span id="s3804">He knew my name, whether it was by pictures in the paper and all that.</span> <span id="s3805">That was later on.</span> <span id="s3806">And he says, “Yeah!</span> <span id="s3807">Well I know all about you!</span> <span id="s3808">You have all the concerts.</span> <span id="s3809">You get better concerts what I can get for my artists!</span> <span id="s3810">You don’t need a manager.</span> <span id="s3811">You’re saving money.”</span> <span id="s3812">I said, “Mr. Mar-, Mr. Mer-, Morris, yeah,” I said, “I am not saving money.</span> <span id="s3813">I just know some people from Europe.</span> <span id="s3814">I had a few auditions.</span> <span id="s3815">They liked me and I’m playing.</span> <span id="s3816">But I need management.</span> <span id="s3817">Why don’t you take me?</span> <span id="s3818">Whatever your fee is, I’ll be glad to pay it.</span> <span id="s3819">Just give me a break.”</span> <span id="s3820">“No, no, no!</span> <span id="s3821">You don’t need a manager!”</span> <span id="s3822">And wherever I went, “You don’t need a manager.”</span> <span id="s3823">It was Hurok’s job.</span> <span id="s3824">That’s how he paid me back.</span> <span id="s3825">I found out years later.</span> <span id="s3826">Well, how long can you go on, you know, like this?</span> <span id="s3827">And at the beginning, when you’re not known, you’re being paid peanuts.</span> <span id="s3828">What do you think they pay you?</span> <span id="s3829">So I started to look since I played a lot in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Orchestra.</span> <span id="s3830">So I looked around and they offered me a job as the head of the piano department at the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3831">It was in 1953, and the pay was good for a refugee from camp.</span> <span id="s3832">And I started to make good money.</span> <span id="s3833">And I started to teach there in the piano department.</span> <span id="s3834">And I was very successful.</span> <span id="s3835">I had ten kids who won eighteen performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra.</span> <span id="s3836">Two of them best students from Curtis Institute.</span> <span id="s3837">One was Charles Birnbaum, the other was Beth Levine.</span> <span id="s3838">Beth played a Beethoven Third Piano Concerto.</span> <span id="s3839">Charlie played a Chopin concerto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">EM: A what concerto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">MF: A Chopin, a Chopin E minor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">EM: Oh, Chopin, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">MF: And then Temple University opened up in ‘57.</span> <span id="s3844">Dr. Stone who was the Dean—I mean the College of Music opened up—invited me to join the faculty.</span> <span id="s3845">And I remember I, so I talked to him on the phone and I said, “Well, why don’t we meet?”</span> <span id="s3846">I said, “Wonderful.</span> <span id="s3847">Where can we meet?”</span> <span id="s3848">He says, “In front of the Academy of Music.”</span> <span id="s3849">And I said, “Dr. Stone, how do you look like?”</span> <span id="s3850">He says, “You don’t have to know how I look like.</span> <span id="s3851">I know how you look like.</span> <span id="s3852">I saw you at the Academy.</span> <span id="s3853">I heard your concerts.”</span> <span id="s3854">So we met.</span> <span id="s3855">He turned out to be a wonderful friend.</span> <span id="s3856">He just had his golden wedding anniversary last Sunday and I was there.</span> <span id="s3857">And there were a lot of people and we love him.</span> <span id="s3858">He is a wonderful, honest, dedicated human being.</span> <span id="s3859">And I adore him.</span> <span id="s3860">I really do.</span> <span id="s3861">One of the few people I really love so much.</span> <span id="s3862">And so...that’s how it started.</span> <span id="s3863">And then I saw that my life setttles, and I used to commute.</span> <span id="s3864">I lived in New York the first ten years.</span> <span id="s3865">So from ‘53 to ‘59 I used to go from New York to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3866">I drove there.</span> <span id="s3867">We had a car.</span> <span id="s3868">And I drove once a week.</span> <span id="s3869">I came here Wednesday around noon time, and went back Friday night.</span> <span id="s3870">Oh yeah, that was an interesting story.</span> <span id="s3871">The director of the school called me once, it was Friday, and he says, “When are you going back to New York?”</span> <span id="s3872">I said, “Tonight.”</span> <span id="s3873">“Well, I got news for you.</span> <span id="s3874">But I think you’ll stay till tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s3875">I said, “It better be good, because I’m going home.”</span> <span id="s3876">He says, “No, you’re not.”</span> <span id="s3877">I said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s3878">“Guess who is coming to meet you?”</span> <span id="s3879">I said, “Who?”</span> <span id="s3880">Danny Kaye.</span> <span id="s3881">I said, “Danny Kaye?</span> <span id="s3882">That great actor?</span> <span id="s3883">Why does he want to meet me?”</span> <span id="s3884">“Oh, he was at a dinner with some member from the Philadelphia Orchestra.”</span> <span id="s3885">And they talked about me, about the hell I went through, so he wanted to meet me.</span> <span id="s3886">“He’ll be here tomorrow, at school tomorrow morning at ten o’clock.”</span> <span id="s3887">“O.K., I’m staying.”</span> <span id="s3888">He came in, there was a write-up in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s3889">The kids found out...you know, he was a great kid lover, and had movies for kids and all.</span> <span id="s3890">So it was a riot there when he came in.</span> <span id="s3891">And I played for him and this and that, and then it was pretty nice and I said, “Mr. Kaye, I have to admit, I apologize, I know who you are, of course.</span> <span id="s3892">You’re a very famous actor.</span> <span id="s3893">But I never saw you in person on the stage or in the movies.</span> <span id="s3894">I never had the privilege.”</span> <span id="s3895">He said, “When are you coming back to Philadelphia?”</span> <span id="s3896">I said, “I’ll be back coming Wednesday.”</span> <span id="s3897">“There’ll be a ticket for you in the box office, for you, and come back stage.”</span> <span id="s3898">So I did.</span> <span id="s3899">And I was handing him out his paraphernalia.</span> <span id="s3900">You know, a hard hat, a cane, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s3901">And then he did a trick, I’ll never—for the public—I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s3902">He sat, it was after intermission, I think—he sat down on the stage dangling his feet from the stage—and he invited the public in three groups.</span> <span id="s3903">He said, “From this row to this row.</span> <span id="s3904">When I give you a sign you all yell out.”</span> <span id="s3905">It was packed, in the Schubert Theater.</span> <span id="s3906">Two thousand people were there.</span> <span id="s3907">He said, “You yell out loud, ‘Hi!</span> <span id="s3908">’” So they said, “O.K.” He gave them a sign, “Hi!”</span> <span id="s3909">He said, “Fine, shut up.</span> <span id="s3910">Now the next group.”</span> <span id="s3911">That’s how he was talking.</span> <span id="s3912">“When I give you a sign, you yell out loud, Fi!”</span> <span id="s3913">They didn’t know what it was going on.</span> <span id="s3914">I didn’t know either, till he finally said the last thing.</span> <span id="s3915">“So yell out loud, Fi!</span> <span id="s3916">Say, Fi!</span> <span id="s3917">O.K., quiet.</span> <span id="s3918">The next one.</span> <span id="s3919">When I give you the sign, yell out loud, ‘Lar!</span> <span id="s3920">’” Then he said, he saw them with three lines.</span> <span id="s3921">They said, “Hi Fi-lar!”</span> <span id="s3922">Hi, two thousand people are yelling out my name loud!</span> <span id="s3923">And he turned around and gave me the eye.</span> <span id="s3924">I was behind the curtain.</span> <span id="s3925">He said, “Did you ever have two thousand people yelling out your name loud?”</span> <span id="s3926">They never knew what they were doing!</span> <span id="s3927">And he says, “That was easy!</span> <span id="s3928">You should have seen the trouble I had with Piatigorsky in California!”</span> <span id="s3929">You know, it was a lot more difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s3930">EM: Tell me, did you ever get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">EM: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">MF: I was married in 1972, I think it was, in 1972 in Brazil, in Sao Paulo.</span> <span id="s3934">I played there in ‘53.</span> <span id="s3935">I was on a concert tour and there were some friends of my older brother, a very, very influential people there, very successful people.</span> <span id="s3936">And the lady told me she was married then, and she fell in love with me when she heard me play.</span> <span id="s3937">I played a Tchaikovsky Concerto.</span> <span id="s3938">They gave a big party for me there, and that was it.</span> <span id="s3939">Then, it was in the ‘50s.</span> <span id="s3940">In the ‘70s I got a letter from my sister telling me that Simon died.</span> <span id="s3941">Her husband died.</span> <span id="s3942">And he was a best friend of my older brother.</span> <span id="s3943">He was, they were from Warsaw also.</span> <span id="s3944">So I went to a, I mean a card store, and sent her a sympathy card.</span> <span id="s3945">I got a call from Paris.</span> <span id="s3946">“Why don’t we meet?</span> <span id="s3947">Are you married?”</span> <span id="s3948">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s3949">And so she came to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3950">And I [unclear] married.</span> <span id="s3951">And I was, she said she would live in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3952">And we had a lot of vacation at Temple, as you know.</span> <span id="s3953">And first of all I took a leave of absence for one semester, and so I spent oh, about, more than half a year.</span> <span id="s3954">And I played there before.</span> <span id="s3955">All right?</span> <span id="s3956">And I love her children.</span> <span id="s3957">The children loved me, and we became very great friends and it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">EM: She had children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">MF: She had, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3961">So you married her.</span> <span id="s3962">How long were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">MF: We were married about three years.</span> <span id="s3964">And she didn’t want to, she said she would live in Philadelphia, but then she started to cry.</span> <span id="s3965">See, I told her she won’t be able to switch that easy.</span> <span id="s3966">So she said she wanted me to move to Brazil.</span> <span id="s3967">I said, “No, you said you’re gonna live here.</span> <span id="s3968">I have my life here, and I don’t want to be kept by anybody else.</span> <span id="s3969">I don’t need that.”</span> <span id="s3970">So, we parted as friends.</span> <span id="s3971">And I visited her many times after the divorce, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3972">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3973">Now, you also traveled a lot in Europe and other places, too, and you played, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3974">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3975">EM: And so, could you tell me a little bit about where you played?</span></p> <p><span id="s3976">MF: Well, I played all over.</span> <span id="s3977">First of all in, I played in France, all over Germany.</span> <span id="s3978">I played in England, in Holland, and Denmark, and Norway, and Sweden.</span> <span id="s3979">I played in Portugal.</span> <span id="s3980">I played in Israel with the Israeli Philharmonic twenty concerts in thirty days.</span> <span id="s3981">When the war broke out in 1956, the Sinai Campaign, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">EM: In, during the Sinai Campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3984">And they, I had two more concerts to play and they released me from the contract.</span> <span id="s3985">But I didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s3986">I said, “I wasn’t running from Hitler; I’m not going to run from Nasser.”</span> <span id="s3987">And I finished my concert tour.</span> <span id="s3988">And I was later invited to be a judge in the Rubinstein Competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">EM: And tell me, you did win many awards.</span> <span id="s3990">Could you mention a few?</span></p> <p><span id="s3991">MF: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s3992">EM: You won some awards and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3993">MF: Oh well yeah, I got a silver medal from the Rubinstein Competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3994">EM: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s3995">MF: I was supposed to play, in 1942 in the Chopin competition in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s3996">EM: ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">MF: ‘42, but there was no competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">EM: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">MF: The Germans were there.</span> <span id="s4000">Chopin was forbidden, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4001">EM: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s4002">MF: So I missed my opportunity.</span> <span id="s4003">Because I was ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s4004">EM: Could you tell me a little bit of your life now?</span> <span id="s4005">You, I understand you...</span></p> <p><span id="s4006">MF: I’m retired.</span> <span id="s4007">I’m a retired professor enjoying my life, going to competitions here and there, judging.</span></p> <p><span id="s4008">EM: But, you’re judging.</span></p> <p><span id="s4009">MF: Yeah, I’m judging some competitions, some very fine ones.</span> <span id="s4010">I was just a couple of months ago in Miami.</span> <span id="s4011">That was the national Chopin contest, and the winners are gonna go to Warsaw in October.</span> <span id="s4012">There’s an international Chopin contest there and I’m invited by the jury as the guest of honor.</span> <span id="s4013">So I’ll be there in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s4014">EM: O.K. Now, as you...</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">MF: I teach privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s4016">EM: You teach privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s4017">MF: Yeah, and some very interesting people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4018">EM: Could you tell me a little bit about your friendship with this General?</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">MF: Oh, General Twining?</span></p> <p><span id="s4020">EM: General Twining?</span></p> <p><span id="s4021">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4022">Well, that was a fascinating part of my life.</span> <span id="s4023">I was still living in Europe at that time when I was playing the piano when the phone rang.</span> <span id="s4024">It was about noontime.</span> <span id="s4025">Ambassador Bullitt was on the phone.</span> <span id="s4026">He said, “Mr. Filar, I’m having lunch at Fort Myers, at General Twining’s quarters.</span> <span id="s4027">His son has just graduated, he’s gonna graduate college this summer in Oberlin, Ohio.</span> <span id="s4028">He’s a pianist, and the General asked me who he should study with after he graduated Oberlin.</span> <span id="s4029">And I told him I only know two people; one is Rubinstein and the other one, you.</span> <span id="s4030">Well, Rubinstein is too busy, so here it is.</span> <span id="s4031">Nathan wants to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s4032">So he came up to the phone, the son, Nathan, Jr. “Hi, how are...”</span></p> <p><span id="s4033">EM: Nathan was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s4034">MF: Nathan.</span> <span id="s4035">And the General was also Nathan.</span> <span id="s4036">So he was Nate.</span> <span id="s4037">They, the General they called Nate.</span> <span id="s4038">And he was Nathan.</span> <span id="s4039">But actually he was Nathan, Jr.</span></p> <p><span id="s4040">EM: Nate Bullitt?</span> <span id="s4041">Nate...</span></p> <p><span id="s4042">MF: No, Nate Twining!</span></p> <p><span id="s4043">EM: Nate Twining, Twining, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4044">MF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4045">“Hi, hi, how are you?</span> <span id="s4046">I heard you play.”</span> <span id="s4047">I played at the National Symphony several times in Washington, and he was there.</span> <span id="s4048">So we made an appointment.</span> <span id="s4049">He said he’ll come to New York and we’ll meet.</span> <span id="s4050">I said, “O.K., you’ll fly to LaGuardia,” I said, “I will pick you up at the airport and I’ll be holding the Schuman Piano Concerto in my hand high, so you’ll see me, like that.”</span> <span id="s4051">And he said, “I know what you look like.”</span> <span id="s4052">I said, “Never mind.</span> <span id="s4053">I’ll have the music in my hand.”</span> <span id="s4054">So he came.</span> <span id="s4055">I liked him and so on.</span> <span id="s4056">Then I started to commute there, and I met a very great man, became very great friends.</span> <span id="s4057">I was in his office in the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s4058">I swam at the Pentagon swimming pool.</span> <span id="s4059">I was working harder; well, and the guards there knew when I was coming in sometimes by a cab.</span> <span id="s4060">They already knew me.</span> <span id="s4061">They saluted.</span> <span id="s4062">They said, “It’s some kind of a General coming in here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4063">EM: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s4064">MF: It was great fun...</span></p> <p><span id="s4065">EM: I’m...</span></p> <p><span id="s4066">MF: He was a great, he was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s4067">I have an interview with him on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s4068">EM: Mmm hmm, oh, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">MF: With the General.</span> <span id="s4070">I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4071">EM: Could you tell me a little bit more about your life in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s4072">I wanted to go back into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">MF: Oh God.</span> <span id="s4074">That was hell on earth.</span> <span id="s4075">I was away in Lemberg during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4076">EM: Yeah, we have that on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s4077">MF: Yeah, then I came back in December of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s4078">EM: I am especially interested in your playing in the ghetto, when you were playing [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s4079">MF: Yeah, O.K. Now, there was a Symphony Orchestra in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s4080">And very few people mention this.</span> <span id="s4081">It’s really a shame.</span> <span id="s4082">It was a wonderful orchestra.</span> <span id="s4083">Many of the members of that orchestra were members of the Warsaw Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s4084">And the conductor was a very wonderful cellist by the name of Marian Neutajch.</span></p> <p><span id="s4085">EM: Neutajch?</span></p> <p><span id="s4086">MF: Neutajch.</span> <span id="s4087">N-E-U-T-A-J-C-H.</span> <span id="s4088">And he was a fine conductor, and I played with him in the ghetto the Tchaikovsky Concerto.</span> <span id="s4089">Well, in the ghetto, my parents were at that concert, and my sister Helen.</span> <span id="s4090">They all perished.</span> <span id="s4091">And how did we do it?</span> <span id="s4092">We announced that the German wouldn’t permit us to play anything but Jewish composers.</span> <span id="s4093">So in front of the hall, actually it was a movie house, which was built just before the war, and the government and the city of Warsaw didn’t permit it to be opened because it was one or three feet too close to a church.</span> <span id="s4094">There was a law then.</span> <span id="s4095">Now the church was also in the ghetto, so they made a concert hall out of it, Anatiera.</span> <span id="s4096">[phonetic] So we announced in front of the hall this, an announcement we’re playing Mendelssohn Concerto.</span> <span id="s4097">And we brought the music from the Polish side, from Polish friends, you know?</span> <span id="s4098">This music was smuggled in and we played a Tchaikovsky.</span> <span id="s4099">I also played chamber music with a young violinist—I was young myself at that time—by the name of David Zajdel, Z-A-J-D-E-L, a wonderful, wonderful talent.</span> <span id="s4100">Unfortunately he was murdered.</span> <span id="s4101">We played chamber music, publicly, on Orla Street I think it was, in Warsaw, by the side street of Leszno, if I remember correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s4102">EM: Do you remember if people had to pay to get to the concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s4103">MF: Yeah, some, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s4104">EM: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s4105">MF: Whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s4106">EM: Did you get paid for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s4107">MF: Pssh, pssh...</span></p> <p><span id="s4108">EM: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s4109">MF: I really don’t remember, no.</span> <span id="s4110">But I remember once when...the atrocities started and then the money was scarce.</span> <span id="s4111">I mean we were bombed out, you know.</span> <span id="s4112">They cleaned my father’s business out.</span> <span id="s4113">It was...people were just poor like church mice.</span> <span id="s4114">So, Marian Neutajch said to me, “You need to make some money?”</span> <span id="s4115">I said, “Of course!”</span> <span id="s4116">“I got a job.</span> <span id="s4117">I’m creating a trio.</span> <span id="s4118">We’ll play in a café, popular music.</span> <span id="s4119">I have a professional violinist who is a café musician.</span> <span id="s4120">And it’s in a nice, new café opened up.</span> <span id="s4121">So we’re gonna have a rehearsal, the three of us.</span> <span id="s4122">And they will pay us enough to buy a bread, for the whole evening.”</span> <span id="s4123">That was, bread was life.</span> <span id="s4124">So we went in to rehearse and this professional violinist was giving us hell!</span></p> <p><span id="s4125">EM: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s4126">MF: It was something!</span> <span id="s4127">We had a rehearsal, he said, “You’re a great musician and you can’t play 1-2-3 in time!”</span> <span id="s4128">Like a waltz or something.</span> <span id="s4129">I said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s4130">And I had a piano there, an upright piano.</span> <span id="s4131">I said, “I want to play it so that I’ll face the wall.</span> <span id="s4132">I don’t want anybody to see me.”</span> <span id="s4133">And we played one evening, and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s4134">The next day started the atrocities.</span> <span id="s4135">But I came home with a bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s4136">EM: And so, but, and so you only could play in the evening.</span> <span id="s4137">During the day you worked at that [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s4138">MF: No, they, only that one night.</span> <span id="s4139">Then it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s4140">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4141">MF: They started to...</span></p> <p><span id="s4142">EM: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4143">MF: Send people to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s4144">It was just one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s4145">EM: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4146">MF: Just one night, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s4147">EM: All right.</span> <span id="s4148">Anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">MF: Yeah, how I lost my father.</span> <span id="s4150">I came, I don’t know why I was in town somewhere and I get through and I came home.</span> <span id="s4151">My mother said, “Father is gone.”</span> <span id="s4152">I said, “What do you mean?”</span></p> <p><span id="s4153">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4154">MF: He was going to the Yiddischer Gemeinde, to the Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s4155">EM: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s4156">MF: Did I tell you that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">EM: Yeah, we have that already.</span> <span id="s4158">Yeah, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s4159">MF: And they caught him on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s4160">EM: Yeah, we have that...</span></p> <p><span id="s4161">MF: They closed the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s4162">EM: On the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s4163">MF: Yeah, and then the uprising and the rest you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4164">EM: Yeah, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s4165">MF: And here I am, so many years later.</span> <span id="s4166">But you know, we had a little villa outside of the city in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s4167">And there...someone, a Gypsy woman used to walk around yelling that they lay cards, tell you the future and all of that.</span> <span id="s4168">And I was a little boy at that time.</span> <span id="s4169">And she said, “Come on, give me your hands.”</span> <span id="s4170">And she, so put some cards on the table.</span> <span id="s4171">She says, “You’re gonna go beyond the big, big water.”</span> <span id="s4172">She kind of predicted I’ll be going to the States.</span> <span id="s4173">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s4174">I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s4175">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4176">EM: All right, Professor Filar, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s4177">MF: You’re quite welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s4178">EM: If there is anything else you want to add, you know, I’ll, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s4179">MF: Well, what I want to add, I would like to see in this country a Ministry of Culture.</span> <span id="s4180">I would like our government to be a little more for culture.</span> <span id="s4181">They leave it all to private people.</span> <span id="s4182">And all those civilized societies, France, England, Germany, Italy, all have Ministries of Culture.</span> <span id="s4183">And they contribute to culture a lot more.</span> <span id="s4184">Too bad I don’t have the cut-out from The New York Times.</span> <span id="s4185">I just saw a couple of weeks ago, I think, how much our government spends on culture, how much France spends, how much England spends, and Germany.</span> <span id="s4186">I was ashamed to read it.</span> <span id="s4187">That’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4188">EM: O.K. Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s4189">MF: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
