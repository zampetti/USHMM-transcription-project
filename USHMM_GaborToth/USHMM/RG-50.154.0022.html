Hans Prins in Englewood, Florida.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Prins is a survivor of the Holocaust and he has kindly consented to be interviewed and tape recorded by us.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: Mr. Prins, we appreciate your willingness to do this, and as I explained to your earlier, we want to know a bit more about you than just what happened during the war years.</span> <span id="s6">Would you start by telling us something about your family, how many brothers and sisters you have, where you were born, what your parents did for a living – that sort of thing – your education.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: My father was a musician; he was a trumpet player.</span> <span id="s8">My mother was a ballerina.</span> <span id="s9">I guess you could say.</span> <span id="s10">I was born in Hilversum, Holland.</span> <span id="s11">Education – till the war broke out – I didn't have any education because I was only five going on six, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I have one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: He is two years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: So, you really were very young.</span> <span id="s19">How much do you remember about the invasion of Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I would say just about all of it.</span> <span id="s21">I don't know if you are familiar with the invasion itself, ah, that part got nothing to do with the Holocaust, but, ah, it happened that, ah, when the Germans invaded the Netherlands they gave an ultimatum that if the Dutch Army would not surrender they would flatten the city of Rotterdam, and it just so happened that we lived at the time in the city of Rotterdam when they flattened it, and, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: They bombed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: They bombed it.</span> <span id="s24">They just, they just destroyed it – the whole city was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: How did your people protect yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Ah, the part that I remember from that is I used to have nightmares about it.</span> <span id="s27">The, ah, streets were just glass.</span> <span id="s28">You couldn't see the streets, they were in glass, and I remember my father carrying me.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: You mean from the broken windows?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yeah, yeah, broken windows and, and debris, and I remember my father carrying me over the glass and, ah, my mother and my brother following, and somehow we survived it, and we went, we moved to…</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: About what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: This was in 1940 – in fact, it was May.</span> <span id="s33">I think Rotterdam got bombed May 12th.</span> <span id="s34">I'm not sure of the exact date, but that was in May, 1940.</span> <span id="s35">And then we moved to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s36">I went to grade school there till we had to go into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: As you said, you were very young at this point, but in subsequent conversations with your parents and other people, were they subjected to anti-Semitism before this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Ah, I couldn't answer that for myself because I would be too young to remember that, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: No – but did they tell stories of having anti-Semitic experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s41">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Can you remember any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Are we talking before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">At any time…</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I, myself, don't remember any of …</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: But them – did they tell you stories of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah, oh yes, they did.</span> <span id="s49">There were, there were stores that were bashed in with, ah, swastikas already – that's before the war broke out, and, ah, we knew that…</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Was your father's employment in any way jeopardized because he was Jewish?</span> <span id="s51">You said he was a trumpet player.</span> <span id="s52">Did that affect his employability?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, it did.</span> <span id="s54">Ah, again are we before or after, or during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: At any time – before, during…</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Ah, yeah, in 1940 he couldn’t work anymore – after the Germans occupied Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: But before that…</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, before that he, he played.</span> <span id="s59">As a matter of fact, ah, Hilversum, where I was born is the, ah, it still is -- it's where all the radio stations are and I would say that 90% of the musicians at that time were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Were your parent's religious people?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Ah, no.</span> <span id="s62">We were – what we are now, is Jewish by tradition more than by religion -- like you get together with Grandma every Friday night and have the chicken soup and that…</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Were your grandparent's living at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And what happened to them?</span> <span id="s66">Did they, I mean, were they living in Rotterdam when you were there or were they living somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: They were living in Amsterdam, and, ah, they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: They had already died?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No.</span> <span id="s70">They were picked up by the Germans and…</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Oh, in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No. '</span> <span id="s73">42.</span> <span id="s74">Till '42, you could, ah, well, you could walk the streets till they – they did not start rounding up in, in great deal.</span> <span id="s75">By '42, when everybody was required to get the Jewish star is when they really – the Germans – then they started really in earnest.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You said you started to go to school in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And was this a public school or a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: That was a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: What was it like for you to go to school?</span> <span id="s81">Were you subjected to anti-Semitism in school from your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, not at that time.</span> <span id="s83">And when the Germans invaded Holland they took that particular school over as one of their headquarters, and then we had no school to go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What's the first thing that you can remember about this besides being carried by your father through the streets in Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Okay, the first thing that I can remember is that, ah, we were required to wear Jewish stars, and ah, my brother and I used to play a game to, ah, we used to go on the trolleys without the Jewish stars and we would, we would, ah, see who would get picked up first.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What would happen to you if you got picked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Ah, we both got picked up once.</span> <span id="s88">What they would do is they would take – that's what they would, that's what they did with all the Jews they rounded up, they put them in a, what do you call that here?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Holding.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No.</span> <span id="s91">It's a – it's the a…</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Detention?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s94">It's a, the building, it's, it's like a cultural building – Staat's Harbor…</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No.</span> <span id="s97">Staat's Harbor is where they give all the plays.</span> <span id="s98">It's a cultural center –really what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: How long would they keep them there?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Till they were shipped off.</span> <span id="s101">But we knew a way out on the side door, and, ah, we escaped twice –and then we were …</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Sounds like a dangerous game you were playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: It was.</span> <span id="s104">We quit then, we quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Only little kids would even think of doing such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: My brother, he got picked up more than I 'cause he really looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s107">He's got a big nose and he didn't get by.</span> <span id="s108">Anyway, then we started wearing a Jewish star and quit…</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Was there any concerted effort by the Germans to make all the Jewish people to move into a certain area, like a ghetto, or were you allowed to live wherever you had been living?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: At that particular time there was a ghetto, but the ones that were not living in the ghetto, ah, we were still living at whatever it was we were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What can you remember about the roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: The roundups, ah, I was in one around…well –they would round up in the ghetto –that's is where they started really, which is, it was the market, it was an open market where all –it was an all-Jewish neighborhood and the Germans would come in and they would open –see four bridges –they opened those four bridges and nobody can go anywhere.</span> <span id="s113">And, ah, what you try to do is to try to make it to the last bridge and get over.</span> <span id="s114">That is, this is where they started the roundup.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: This was back in '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A This is back in '42.</span> <span id="s117">Ah, they just about cleaned it out.</span> <span id="s118">They go all the Jews out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Where did they take them?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: They took them, ah, they would take – depending on how much room there was – they would take them to the cultural center, then they would take them to a little town in Holland called Westerborg.</span> <span id="s121">That was a holding camp and from the holding camp they would be transferred east in cattle cars, either to Poland or Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: To extermination camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: To extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did they know that?</span> <span id="s125">Did the people in Holland know about these camps and what was becoming of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: They knew it.</span> <span id="s127">They knew it.</span> <span id="s128">Ah, what they would do –they – you would get in the mail, like you get here, what would be – when they had the draft from Uncle Sam – you would get in the mail an order.</span> <span id="s129">It was called an Ochfru order, what is calling order.</span> <span id="s130">They would give you instructions – what you were allowed to take.</span> <span id="s131">Ah, you were allowed to take, ah, what do they call it a…</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Backpack?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yeah, backpack with soap and so many pairs of pants, then a, this and that.</span> <span id="s134">Ah, it's always, it's, it's always been amazed, amazing to me, ah, a lot of them just went and reported and…</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Even though they knew what the end result was…</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I think a lot of them might have known.</span> <span id="s137">I don't see how they could not have known, ah, I remember talking to my uncles before they left and they would say nah, they are just going to go to work and they're going to come back and, ah, figure that, ah, at a certain point we better get into hiding because after that, after they cleaned out the ghetto, ah, we would get word on which particular street that, that would have what they call a, they called it a "rasia" –which is a, a…</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: A gathering, roundup?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: A roundup –right.</span> <span id="s140">And, ah, they would come –somebody would come and say they are now on such and such a street.</span> <span id="s141">So, finally, we, ah, the four of us went into hiding.</span> <span id="s142">We, ah, a – a good friend of ours, my father played with her husband – she took me out on a bicycle and got me out – out of Amsterdam and got me into Utrecht and, ah, at some point…</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I must have been seven or eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: In 1942, you would be seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, seven.</span> <span id="s147">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did – you went separately, you went with this lady…</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And your brother went with somebody else…</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And your parents…</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And all this happened in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Within a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Ah, well it happened one day.</span> <span id="s157">We just, we just did what, ah, the Franks did.</span> <span id="s158">We up and…</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Was there like an underground system you could contact people and or they would contact you?</span> <span id="s160">How did this work?</span> <span id="s161">Can you describe it in more detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s163">Ah, this particular lady was not with the underground.</span> <span id="s164">She got in touch with the underground.</span> <span id="s165">Ah, they picked me up, she got me out on a bicycle, and picked – somebody picked me up in a, in a car who was with Utrecht.</span> <span id="s166">Ah, there –I don't know how this happened – ah, I was reunited with a, with a, a farmer, Mr. Pott.</span> <span id="s167">I'll never forget, never forget him.</span> <span id="s168">Ah, and we lived there with another, I could say at least –there were about ten or twelve of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: In the main part of the house or in a secret place, or the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: We were in the main part of the…no, we were in the back part of the house, but it was the main house and there was –the man had a barn and if we knew – we saw Germans coming, you could see them coming.</span> <span id="s171">We had a place in the barn that was covered with hay and, ah, at one time we – they were coming – and we went up to the hiding place.</span> <span id="s172">We went under the hay and the Germans went up there and struck hay forks…</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Pitch forks?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Pitch forks, ah, which came – they came about this close from the people – and I remember there was a couple that had a little baby and they had to keep the baby quiet.</span> <span id="s175">Ah, we were afraid that baby was going to be smothered to death, but it didn't.</span> <span id="s176">Ah, they left – the Germans left – and after that we knew we had to, we had to leave that place, and the underground came and this is the last time I saw my parents… (Pause, while Mr. Prins recovered his composure.)</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You were saying that was the last time you saw your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Ah, right.</span> <span id="s179">I was taken, well, I was taken to about five or six places – safe houses – that the underground had arranged for us, and I was going to the province of Overijssell.</span> <span id="s180">My brother went to the opposite – no, we both went there – I'm sorry, we both went there, ah, and stayed at one address for about two months.</span> <span id="s181">Ah, then…</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you just live with the families, or were you hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Right.</span> <span id="s184">Ah, over there we were hidden.</span> <span id="s185">We were in a, ah, underground, ah, cellar, it's, it’s like a fallout shelter I would, you know, it's what you call it, and they let us out once in a while.</span> <span id="s186">And then what happened was – I had a big mouth, ah, I'll never forget it, we'd walk on a bridge, and Holland, like any other country, had its collaborators, and there was a, ah, a Dutch – not a policemen, it's what we call the Landwacht, they, ah, collaborated with the Germans to find Jews.</span> <span id="s187">This guy started talking to me and I talked back.</span> <span id="s188">I didn't give him the whole story but it was enough for the underground to, ah, get us out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: The people you were staying with would have been in danger then too, wouldn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Right.</span> <span id="s191">Oh, they would be shot on sight for hiding Jews, that's, ah… So then – that was the last time I saw my brother.</span> <span id="s192">He went to Freesland, which is actually not too far from the German border.</span> <span id="s193">And also, he had about – I think he counted them up – sixteen safe houses till he got someplace where he could stay for awhile, and I had about five or six till I ended up with the people that I just saw now, forty years later.</span> <span id="s194">I was there for, I think about a year and a half, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What were the conditions during those days, like how much food did people have?</span> <span id="s196">How much could you – like we talked about this first place, the farm, where there were fifteen or twenty people hiding – how discreet were the neighbors?</span> <span id="s197">I mean, it takes a lot of food to be brought in to feed fifteen or twenty people.</span> <span id="s198">How did you know they could be trusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Okay, in cases where people were hiding Jews that –and the people did not have food enough –the underground provided extra coupons.</span> <span id="s200">They were living on, you know, they had coupons in those days, they…ration coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Ration coupons.</span> <span id="s202">Just like we had here, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s204">They had them right then during the second World War.</span> <span id="s205">And, they, they printed them, they printed false coupons.</span> <span id="s206">And, ah, we didn’t always eat very good.</span> <span id="s207">We, ah, I was hiding in one house and every other day I would get two pieces of bread and then I was asked – did I want a little butter on the two pieces of bread?</span> <span id="s208">You know, we didn’t get it, we didn't get enough to eat, you know, a lot of places.</span> <span id="s209">In a lot of places we did, ah, depending if the underground could get it, could get to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s212">I've always been skinny.</span> <span id="s213">You wouldn't say it now because I just came back from vacation.</span> <span id="s214">But, ah – yeah, I was very skinny actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: How about other things, like keeping clean?</span> <span id="s216">How about when you were in hiding, what did you do about toilet facilities?</span> <span id="s217">Just very basic things like that.</span> <span id="s218">How did you manage?</span> <span id="s219">Can you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Ah, when we were – well, there was only a couple months that we were in a, in a, in a shelter, in a fallout shelter, and, ah, they would check on us if we had to go, and they would check if the coast was clear, and we went.</span> <span id="s221">Ah, we would sneak a shower at night – well, not a shower, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: A sponge…</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: A sponge bath is what…</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What did you do to pass the time?</span> <span id="s225">It must have been awfully boring to remain in a cellar as you were telling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: It was.</span> <span id="s227">It was.</span> <span id="s228">We didn’t do much of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Did you have light down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s231">There was an electric light.</span> <span id="s232">No, there was not an electric light – we had a bicycle light – that's what they used to do in Holland because a bicycle…</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: To generate power?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: To generate power – and we used to take turns if we wanted some light.</span> <span id="s235">And we'd, ah, we just pedaled.</span> <span id="s236">We had a little light, and they would give you something to color, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: How old was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: He's two years older so he was, ah, let's see, around nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Can you remember how you felt then?</span> <span id="s240">Were you afraid?</span> <span id="s241">Were you apathetic…</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: What was your feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I was not afraid the first – till we split up, then I was afraid – then I knew, which was in Utrecht.</span> <span id="s245">Up till then I, ah, I thought it was a big adventure.</span> <span id="s246">Like the lady getting me out of Amsterdam – I thought that was a big adventure, and by the time we split up, then I knew there was, you know, it wasn't a game.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How much time was this from the first time you went into hiding till you split up completely?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Ah, I believe that it wouldn’t have been no, no more than – I would say between two and three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: I see, okay.</span> <span id="s250">And then this last place that you were at, you were there for two years – or three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: A year and a half, two years.</span> <span id="s252">What happened over there, there were only three people in that town that knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s253">There were, there were two Jew –there was a Jewish girl and I were hiding there, not in the same place.</span> <span id="s254">Ah, the story was, and I was –they drilled that story into me.</span> <span id="s255">I almost started to believe it –that I came from Rotterdam, ah, when Rotterdam was bombed out, lost my parents, had no place to go, and these people took me in.</span> <span id="s256">This was, this was the story –and, the only, the only ones that knew were the people, of course, that were hiding me and the school principal because if the Germans, ah, were in that particular area trying to round up Jews, I couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s257">And then they – she – to make it look good, the lady would write a sick letter, whatever you call it that I couldn’t go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s259">But at that time, though, you were able to leave the hiding place and go to school and lead a fairly normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">Yes.</span> <span id="s262">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did you use your own name?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">I used my own name.</span> <span id="s266">Ah, that was, yeah, I think it was, that was for about a year and a half – that I didn't have to – we didn't have to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What else can you remember about the conditions in those days that I maybe haven't thought to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Ah, the last year and a half?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I would say they were fairly as normal as you can make it.</span> <span id="s271">I knew what the score was.</span> <span id="s272">I knew to keep my mouth shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Was there enough food then?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: There was… Yes, ah, the underground would come by one every two weeks – a lady from the underground – and she would ask me if I needed anything, if I had enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: It sounds like a pretty well organized system.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: They had a very good – they had a very well – a very good underground in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did they know what had become of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Ah, they did not know.</span> <span id="s279">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s280">When the war was over, I was still there.</span> <span id="s281">Ah – no, I did before the war was over – as a matter of fact, an underground lady came by and said, "I'm sorry, your parents are dead."</span> <span id="s282">Ah, that was shortly before the war ended.</span> <span id="s283">And then when the war ended, ah, somebody from the Red Cross came by and said the same thing, "I'm sorry, your parents were gassed."</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Were they gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: ……….</span> <span id="s287">Ah, my mother was gassed in Auschwitz and my father was in Auschwitz, but what happened was –a mistake was made because I was playing outside the house – we're after the war now – and this guy come walking over to me, over to me, he says, "I'm your father."</span> <span id="s288">I said, "What!"</span> <span id="s289">Well, he had survived Auschwitz and he had some, ah, he had found me through the Red Cross – I would presume it was the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: And you were still staying with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: And I was still with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And this really was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: That was my father.</span> <span id="s294">What happened was, when we heard this, I was going to be adopted by these people.</span> <span id="s295">They could have no children of their own anyway, and it was all set.</span> <span id="s296">I was going to stay there.</span> <span id="s297">Ah, now let me think back – okay, so he came and he went to the people that were hiding – had been hiding me – and he told them, you know, "I'm back."</span> <span id="s298">Well, he, he had T.B., he, you know, was a very, very sick man – he also had found my brother, by the way – he arranged for us to go to an orphanage in Laren, that's where the orphanage was.</span> <span id="s299">Ah, he had no means of to, you know, to support us or anything.</span> <span id="s300">As a matter of fact, he then went to a hospital for a half year and then they sent him to Switzerland because he had T.B. and in those days, they – the only way to cure, that was the cure for T.B. And, ah, my brother and I were both in the orphanage for, I would say five, six years.</span> <span id="s301">And, and then we, ah, -- I have very good memories, by the way, of the orphanage, they – that was not an orphanage that you'd really think was an orphanage.</span> <span id="s302">They tried to do the best they could for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Were there mostly Jewish children in this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: All.</span> <span id="s305">All, all Jewish children and I – we were the only ones, except my cousin came later, that had a parent left.</span> <span id="s306">Everybody else really was – they were – they had lost both of their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Was this run by a Jewish agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Do you remember the agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Phew… Ah, no, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Okay, it's not urgent.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I really don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: ….</span> <span id="s314">.</span> <span id="s315">Hebrew International Aid Society?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No, I don't remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s317">I know where their office was located, but I can’t remember…</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Where was it located, in Amst…?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: In Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: In Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: When the end of the war came, you remember the specific day, you know, like with people celebrating?</span> <span id="s323">How did they act…?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The two nights before, all we heard was, ah, cannons and shooting, and, and, ah, we stayed in a – they had a, they had a shelter for – a bomb shelter.</span> <span id="s325">And we stayed there a lot of times because of the bombings and that went on, I think, two – three nights – mostly nights.</span> <span id="s326">Then, one morning, the town was freed and I will never…</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: How did you know it was freed?</span> <span id="s328">I mean, the Americans came in, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Canadians.</span> <span id="s330">The Canadians came in and they set up their field kitchen.</span> <span id="s331">In fact, I showed my wife where I had set it up – and we knew, ah, of course, that we knew we were free.</span> <span id="s332">And then, the other Jewish kid that was there, the girl, ah, I will never forget it – they put us on a tank because we were the only two to survive…the only two Jews in the whole town, and they paraded us around in the town – it was really – it was something!</span> <span id="s333">It was really fantastic.</span> <span id="s334">And then there were a lot of celebrations, of course, that went on for…</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You were about ten years old at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah, ten or eleven.</span> <span id="s337">And the celebrations went on for three, four (years – yeah, right) days.</span> <span id="s338">And, ah, as far as I knew it, this was where I was going to stay then, till – these things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: It must have been hard to leave these people who had been so good to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: It was.</span> <span id="s341">It was.</span> <span id="s342">And I tell you, I – this is something I forgot – I stayed in touch with them, even in the orphanage, because I met her two weeks ago, I guess it was – after forty years – and she had a stack of letters that I had written, that I had forgotten about.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: And she saved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: And she had saved them, she had saved them – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: How old is this lady now?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Seventy-five, and he died of cancer six years before, which, of course, I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You said that after your father found you, you were in this orphanage for about six years.</span> <span id="s348">And then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: We went to Israel.</span> <span id="s350">This is…</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: We?</span> <span id="s352">Is this your father…?</span> <span id="s353">He went with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No.</span> <span id="s355">There was a group in the orphanage, ah, this is when Zionism was really alive, and there was a group in the orphanage that, ah – see, the orphanage had, had a, four different buildings, a couple of small ones, then you had the head building, and the building where we were at – and we were, ah, how would you call it, the stepmother and the stepfather, whatever you call it…</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Houseparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s358">And, ah, they were really Zionistic people, and they started feeling us out – who would want to go – would we have any desire to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s359">And most of us said yes.</span> <span id="s360">So there was a group of – maybe twenty-five of us, decided that we, we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s361">And they sent a representative from a kibbutz in Israel to, ah, try to get us in that particular kibbutz – and we ended up in that kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What do you remember about the trip to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s364">There were headlines made.</span> <span id="s365">We left from the Grand Central Station in Amsterdam, which was jammed with Jewish dignitaries, the press – it was, it was…I'll never forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: How many children went?</span> <span id="s367">Just children?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah, all.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How many children were involved in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: There were about twenty-five of us – and such a thing had never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: This is now in 1945, right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, we are in about 1950-51.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Then you were in the orphanage for six years?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s375">And, ah, such a thing never happened – that a whole group like that decided to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Did they give you any preparation for it.</span> <span id="s377">Did they teach you Hebrew or…</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did they do anything else that would have helped you prepare for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: We had been, ah, learning Hebrew all along – that went with the thing, they observed religion there, so we had been learning Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: You really got a religious education while you were in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s383">Yeah, I would say so, and, ah, some of us were – in fact, I did the same thing, ah – went to – what do you call it – these schools, ah – like I went to a school for agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Trade school.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s386">This was for agriculture, which I found out I hated when I got to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Well, this wasn't Israel…</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: No, no…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: This was getting you ready for the kibbutz…</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And, ah, to get practical experience at that, the farmer tried to get all the work out of you, you know he doesn’t teach you anything.</span> <span id="s391">But anyway, they were trying to give us some kind of preparation, but what we ran into, we weren't really – we weren't ready for – because in – you know, Israel had just become a state and the conditions were, were very harsh.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What kibbutz did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Glarome, which is – I don't know if you ever heard of Yad Mordechai?</span> <span id="s394">This was a big…</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: You were at Yad Mordechai?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s399">We were not too far from there.</span> <span id="s400">That's where the big, big battle was fought, at Yad Mordechai.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: How long were you in the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well, I'm sorry to say, my brother and I were the first ones to leave because we didn’t care much for it.</span> <span id="s403">We, ah, went in the – we stayed there two years, went in the army, and never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Ah, I worked in Haifa.</span> <span id="s406">I lived in Haifa, but I took a job – see there is – you could – you can be a member of a kibbutz or you could be working and I took a job driving a – plowing – driving a tractor at night, which nobody else wanted to do because it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s407">And what you do is you have a – hire somebody – because they pay you good – to sit in back of you to watch for Arabs.</span> <span id="s408">And I did that, ah – my father, in the meantime, had gone to America and wanted to know if we wanted to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So, he survived his tuberculosis?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: He survived everything, ah, remarried…</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: About this time you are about eighteen years old when you took the job on the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s413">That would be, that would be about right.</span> <span id="s414">Yeah, I was – must have been about eighteen because I went in the army when I was sixteen and stayed about two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Well, you said you were sixteen when you left the orphanage and you were in the kibbutz for two years and then you were in the army for two years, that would have made you closer to twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s417">That would be…Well, wait a minute now – I was bar mitzvahed in the orphanage and I would say…</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Do you know what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: ….</span> <span id="s420">.</span> <span id="s421">'48 right? '</span> <span id="s422">48-50?</span> <span id="s423">Okay, '51 we went to Israel, I remember that, in '51.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: That was when you were sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You were in the kibbutz, you said, for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And then you went in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Right.</span> <span id="s430">That brought us up to … Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: That's eighteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s433">That's – that would be right.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: That makes you about twenty, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Because I was about twenty-one or twenty two when I came to…</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: This country.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: To this country.</span> <span id="s440">My brother came – he went before I did – because I – I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go or not, and, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You father was living where?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Irvington, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And that's where you went when you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: That's where I went, to Irvington, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: What did you do to earn a living after you got out of the army?</span> <span id="s446">The tractor?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, up till I had enough money saved up.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: You were able to keep the money, it didn't have to go to the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No – see, because you can work, like I said – you can work – and be a member of the kibbutz and then there are people who work for the kibbutz, but they're not a member and they're getting a regular paycheck.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I forgot the name of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s452">It was close to Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So, what was it like compared to what you though it would be like when you came to the United States?</span> <span id="s454">What was it like – did it live up to your expectations, or was it easier or harder to live here then you had expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Easier.</span> <span id="s456">Easier.</span> <span id="s457">Israel for, ah, it was very hard and I think I was not idealistic enough to have stayed.</span> <span id="s458">Most of the people from the orphanage did stay.</span> <span id="s459">I would say maybe 60% stayed and 40% left for Australia, America.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: You mentioned earlier you had gone back to Holland.</span> <span id="s461">Will you tell about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: My recent trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">That was the only trip you made back?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No.</span> <span id="s466">I went back ten years ago and, ah, I didn't do much of anything ten years ago – and I don't know what made me to see the lady.</span> <span id="s467">We had a sort of reunion.</span> <span id="s468">My cousin – we were over at my cousin's mother's house – and another guy from the orphanage and me were there with Carol and, and the other people's wives – and it so happened that my cousin, two months ago, had done the same thing.</span> <span id="s469">He had gone to see – he was hiding out in France.</span> <span id="s470">He had gone to see the people that hid him and the other guy – after all these years – he had to go – he went to see the people that hid him – and I brought it up, I said – what – why, why did we do this after forty years?</span> <span id="s471">And one guy says, "Guilt."</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: A psychologist said it?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: No, it wasn't.</span> <span id="s474">It was Mickey.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Anyway, it, it was guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: That made you go see them again?</span> <span id="s477">Or had it kept you from going all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I think that made me go to see them again, and I think it made sense.</span> <span id="s479">Ah, guilt, because these people had saved, had saved your life and what, and what in the hell did I ever do for them?</span> <span id="s480">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Not only saved your life, but risked theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: They would have been shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s483">And, I – if it wouldn't have been for these people – I would not have been sitting here.</span> <span id="s484">Why it took forty years, I don't know.</span> <span id="s485">Maybe it is guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So, what was it like to go back and meet them?</span> <span id="s487">Were you nervous about it?</span> <span id="s488">Were they nervous about it?</span> <span id="s489">Was it like rejoining your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, we took a shot – we took a shot in the dark.</span> <span id="s491">We went there.</span> <span id="s492">I didn't know if these people were still alive, if they were living there, or what happened.</span> <span id="s493">And so, I told my wife, "If we can't find them, I'm going to go to the city hall."</span> <span id="s494">I went in.</span> <span id="s495">It's a very small town and there is no – I didn't see any phone so I went into the cheese farmer's store there and, ah, I asked him if I could look at a phone book.</span> <span id="s496">And their name was Kolbman, the people that hid me – there was only one—there were five Kolbmans, but there was one with an "M" – and that's the one I called.</span> <span id="s497">And she said, "This is Mrs. Kolbman."</span> <span id="s498">I says, "Is this Mrs. Reik Kolbman?"</span> <span id="s499">(that was her name – that is her name) And she says, "Yes".</span> <span id="s500">I says, "Do you remember in the war you hid a little Jewish boy by the name of Hans?"</span> <span id="s501">She says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s502">I says, "Well, I am here in Halendorn."</span> <span id="s503">And she was stunned – for a minute – for a second – she says, "You're where?</span> <span id="s504">I can't believe it!"</span> <span id="s505">And then she said she had moved but she's going to be right there to pick us up because they were living, when I was hiding out, in another part of the country.</span> <span id="s506">And, ah, it was a, a very emotional thing when she came down at the – it's hard to describe – you sort of went back into your past.</span> <span id="s507">Everybody says you can’t go back to the past, but you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">(Remark made by Mrs. Prins) You said to me at that time, that day, that you felt like it was forty years ago again.</span> <span id="s509">That's how we felt, sitting with that lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s511">Another thing was that the lady had a brother, has a brother.</span> <span id="s512">He did not know all – he didn’t know that I was Jewish either while I was hiding there – and they came over when we were at her house.</span> <span id="s513">Him and his wife came over and he said, "I saw you standing there and I told my wife, 'That's Hans.'"</span> <span id="s514">Now we're talking forty years later and I've got a beard, I wear glasses, I'm forty years older…He took a look and he said, "This is Hans."</span> <span id="s515">He was right!!</span> <span id="s516">He found out because he came over to the house, but it was a, it was, it's hard to describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Now was this the meeting that he had ten years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, this was two weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: But you said they had a bunch of letters that you were given.</span> <span id="s520">Are these the letters while you were in the orphanage?</span> <span id="s521">So you had contact with these people until you went to Israel and then you lost contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Right.</span> <span id="s523">Yeah.</span> <span id="s524">I even wrote a couple letters from Israel and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s525">And I think that they stopped it because it was very hard for them, very hard for them, because they already – as far as they were concerned they had, they had a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Yeah, they were going to adopt you and then all of the sudden you were whisked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: It's almost a shame.</span> <span id="s529">You could have lived with them for five or six years instead of the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Ahh, I have nothing – I tell you, I have nothing but good – I've always told my wife that – nothing but good recollections of the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Well, I can understand what they – once they knew that they couldn’t adopt – go to your father and leave us out of it.</span> <span id="s532">Five more years would have been too…</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No.</span> <span id="s534">They cut, they cut it right there and I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s535">I found out, in fact I found that out three weeks ago, ah, from a guy that had also – he was in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s536">He went to Israel with us.</span> <span id="s537">He went back to Holland – a psychiatrist – and I remember that once a month, or once every three weeks, we get, we talk into a – Am I talking too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: No.</span> <span id="s539">You're doing fine, I just don't want the tape to run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Ah, and then we talked to this psychiatrist every three weeks.</span> <span id="s541">We call his office and he talks.</span> <span id="s542">And now I found out that he has done a study on a lot of the people in the orphanage that we, nobody knew about, to see the progress over the years – what has happened to, to these kids that went through this and, ah, did they come out normal, did they become…They, ah, the guy showed me the book – he knew the psychiatrist, as a matter of fact, and so he had found out that we had been under some kind of study – what, what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s543">And I didn't believe it, but he showed me the book and there's, there's a couple of pictures of me even in it that I never even, even know that they had been, that they had been taken.</span> <span id="s544">Ah, I presume – most of us came out, ah, pretty normal.</span> <span id="s545">We all have our, ah, I had up till three, four years ago – I got medicine now – nightmares.</span> <span id="s546">But that's pretty normal.</span> <span id="s547">But as far as turning out, everybody turned out pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Do you have a copy of the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, ah, I don't think I'll be able to get… I asked Arthur if we could get one.</span> <span id="s550">I don't know.</span> <span id="s551">He's going to try.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What language was the book written…</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Dutch.</span> <span id="s554">It was published in Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: It sounds like it would have been a very worthwhile study.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Ah, it must have been.</span> <span id="s557">He, ah – when I heard about it three weeks ago I thought it was a sort of a, a invasion of your privacy of being studied and you don't even know it.</span> <span id="s558">But then, maybe – I don't know – it does some good.</span> <span id="s559">It might.</span> <span id="s560">It might do some good for these people that are in jail now for killing and it's being on a bad childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Well, they must have been interested then – because they must have lost contact with you – to find out what had become of you after all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Well, not only me, ah, just about everybody.</span> <span id="s563">Not everybody from the orphanage, but most of the people went to Israel.</span> <span id="s564">Ah, they took a, they were still being studied.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Followed.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Followed – studied, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Will you keep in touch with this lady now?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s569">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s570">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s571">In fact, we were going to go next year to Israel and were just saying this afternoon that, ah, maybe I – instead I go to Holland.</span> <span id="s572">I guess now, now it probably is, it might be a question of guilt now too because you want to do something but there isn't ah – for example, we told her that we would like to give her, give her some money so that she could put flowers on her husbands grave.</span> <span id="s573">And she said, no, he wouldn't, he wouldn't want that.</span> <span id="s574">I says, "Well, how about instead of for flowers, give it to charity, something."</span> <span id="s575">She said, no, he, he wouldn't want that.</span> <span id="s576">She said he would be very happy to know that you did finally – that you, after forty years, showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Knowing that you care is a big gift in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, I keep apologizing that it took me forty hears and she was pretty good about it.</span> <span id="s579">It really – she, she said, "I always hoped that I would see you one more time."</span> <span id="s580">And, ah, finally, it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Do you have a family of your own here?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Ah, they're living in, ah, Mobile, Alabama.</span> <span id="s583">They’re both working.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: I've asked you a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s585">Are there things that I haven't asked you that you'd like to include?</span> <span id="s586">I may not have asked you the right questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, out of, ah, -- we counted it up once – 94 – this is just statistics that I happen to know – 94, ah, our family was 94 people and, ah, four of us came back.</span> <span id="s588">In, ah, Holland – I just found that out not too long ago – ah, three out of four Jews never came back.</span> <span id="s589">So, I feel, you know, I always feel pretty lucky to be around.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: You are indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s592">Because that's pretty big odds.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">(Remark made by Mrs. Prins) His father is still alive, I don't know if you made that clear…</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: No.</span> <span id="s595">Where is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s597">Yes, he went to, he went to America.</span> <span id="s598">He got, he got married again in Holland after he got back from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s599">Ah, got married and went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: You said he lived in Irvington, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: He lived in Irvington, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s602">He had, ah, he opened up, ah, music schools like – he had about four or five – till he retired and he lives now in North Miami Beach with his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And what trade did you follow when you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: What trade did…?</span> <span id="s605">Ah, most of my life here was in the restaurant business.</span> <span id="s606">I ran country clubs, I was maitre d'.</span> <span id="s607">The last ten years before we came to, ah, Florida, I tended bar in Manhattan and…</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: You said earlier you're semi-retired.</span> <span id="s609">Are you still doing this part time?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Ah, what I'm doing part time is I do moving – move people.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Oh, that's hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Keeps you in shape, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: I'll bet.</span> <span id="s614">Do you have your own truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah – well, I – for big moves I rent one and I, I've got a small one.</span> <span id="s616">And, ah, I don't know – I can't think of anything…</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Well, I certainly appreciate your sharing with us your memories and the information.</span> <span id="s618">I know it dredges up a lot of feelings that may be a little uncomfortable, but as I explained to you, this is for the purpose, hopefully, of keeping this fresh in people's minds so that it will never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Well, let's put it this way – I think that's the most I've talked about it since the war is over, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: We have another question.</span> <span id="s621">Where is your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: He lives in Poughkeepsie, New York.</span> <span id="s623">He works for IBM.</span> <span id="s624">He went back to Israel for a couple of years and decided to come back to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Is he married?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: He's married.</span> <span id="s627">He's got three kids.</span> <span id="s628">Ah, he was, he went to Israel to stay but I guess he decided there's a better, better life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: I have one last question.</span> <span id="s630">Would you say that your experiences of being in hiding shaped your life – that if you hadn’t had the experience, hadn’t lived through those four years, your life would have been different – in the long run?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s632">I think in the long run I would have – well, then it would be a question, ah – if I wouldn’t have been in hiding, I wouldn’t have been a Jew – that would have shaped my life quite different, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Ah, after, even after it's, you know, you're a Jew, you're always, ah, you're looking for – you're not looking for it – you're going to find it.</span> <span id="s635">You're – there is anti-Semitism, and there always will be.</span> <span id="s636">So, you say, "Did it shape your life?"</span> <span id="s637">Of course it did.</span> <span id="s638">Ah, I was, I was running a country club in, for example, in ah, Illinois and I was offered a job to run a bigger country club – and that country club had, ah, ah, they don't – they don't allow Jews.</span> <span id="s639">I mean it's, it's – I'm just giving you an example – and I said, "You mean to tell me I'm good enough to run this thing and work for you, but Jews aren't allowed?"</span> <span id="s640">They said, "Well that's the policy."</span> <span id="s641">So, sure, anybody – anybody that's not a Jew – their life is shaped different than anybody that is a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: The only place where you're a majority is in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: That's why there is an Israel.</span> <span id="s644">And I, I don't know when it's going to happen – sooner or later I will go back and live there, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: There's quite a bit of anti-Semitism still in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Oh, it's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: I'm going to be there this August.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A In Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s650">Well, I want to thank you very much for participating in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: You're very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
