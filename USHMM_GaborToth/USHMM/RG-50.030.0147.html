so it's moved again.</span> <span id="s45">But he was raised there; and his travels took him to many places, but maybe you'll want to come back to that.</span> <span id="s46">My mother is from another part of the Austro-Hungary empire, that part of Hungary which was really Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s47">She's from a city in southern Hungary which today is Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s48">And just to indicate the confusion, it had three names - one in Serb, one in Hungarian, and one in German.</span> <span id="s49">And people wouldn't know how to refer to these communities--whether you called them Újvidék in Hungarian, or Neusatz in German, or Novi Sad in Serb.</span> <span id="s50">She was raised there, in a family of uh six children, three boys and three girls, and my father met her in that city and again we may want to come to his story, at least parts of it, as you want to pursue that.</span> <span id="s51">But .</span> <span id="s52">.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q:Why don't you tell it to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A:I'd be glad to.</span> <span id="s55">Well, uh, my father was educated in Vienna and other places and eventually took a position in the city of Novi Sad where my mother lived, met her and they married and from there they moved to Riga to another position my father had, and that's why I was born in Riga.</span> <span id="s56">From there he went to Hungary which was something he wanted to do all his life, but the pattern of migration at that time was by choice, well, semi-choice.</span> <span id="s57">He wanted to do this because he was trying to get to a certain particular position in his life, but he also was constrained from getting to Hungary until 1940, uh, 1936, because as a Czech citizen, we go back to the old Czech citizenship, he could get no, he could not receive working papers or whatever permission to work in Hungary, as a Czech citizen.</span> <span id="s58">In '36 he received it, so he went from part of Hungary, back to Hungary, after all these various detours, in Yugoslavia, in Latvia.</span> <span id="s59">If that's confusing, I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q:What was his position?</span> <span id="s61">What was his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A:My father was a cantor.</span> <span id="s63">My father was a cantor in a synagogue and has been that all his life.</span> <span id="s64">And he had positions in major congregations in Riga and in Budapest and in Novi Sad and in Vienna.</span> <span id="s65">And later on in Israel and in New York and in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s66">And in order to be able to move in his own field, he had certain positions that he wanted to reach.</span> <span id="s67">And a cantor in the city of Budapest, in the synagogue that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people, was a major position, and he wanted that position.</span> <span id="s68">But he didn't have permission to go there until '36.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A:He was a Czech citizen.</span> <span id="s71">And the Czech citizens were not given Hungarian working papers.</span> <span id="s72">So the pattern of migration was not because he was either a Jew or because he, the war came.</span> <span id="s73">This was before that.</span> <span id="s74">There may have been some overtones of that, I don't know.</span> <span id="s75">But very legally he was not permitted to get papers until '36 at which point he did assume the position of being one of the chief cantors of the city of Budapest, which was a major Jewish community center in central Europe at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q:Are you aware of any changes in your family's life when Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A:Well, "Hitler came to power" needs to be addressed in terms of when - whether when he came to power in Germany, or as his power began to reach out throughout Europe.</span> <span id="s78">And what time are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q:Whenever it affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s81">Hitler comes to power in Germany and the laws, the various laws that are passed, the uh... I think there's a term called "Numerus Clausus."</span> <span id="s82">These various enumerated clauses that were passed to restrict certain life began way back probably in 1933.</span> <span id="s83">And they came, as history indicates, it's not germane to my particular story - it's available in lots of papers - that most of what happened was very legal, very correct, and did everything according to the rules.</span> <span id="s84">Now, if you want recollections from me for example, I know that uh one day, this was in Hungary, in Budapest, the capital of the country, in a very lovely apartment, a large apartment, on the fifth floor of the building where I had lived which I recall quite clearly.</span> <span id="s85">As a matter of fact, for the first time in forty some years I visited it last year.</span> <span id="s86">My wife and I went to Hungary and we went to the apartment.</span> <span id="s87">Didn't go in because I didn't want to bother the people and there was nobody home.</span> <span id="s88">So the building is now probably 80 or 90 years old - it's in reasonable shape.</span> <span id="s89">But in 1940 or so, 1938, it was a very lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s90">And I remember that one day, I can't tell you which year, but some place in that general period, in '39, '40, '41, a telephone installer came in and said that he must take the telephone away.</span> <span id="s91">And I remember asking why, whether I asked him or my parents I don't recall.</span> <span id="s92">He said Jews may not have telephones.</span> <span id="s93">Period.</span> <span id="s94">Another incident.</span> <span id="s95">Uh, we had a maid, a live-in-maid - there was a maid's quarters in the apartment, that was very usual in those days, in those circumstances, and uh, she was told she could no longer be with us.</span> <span id="s96">She wanted to take me with her to her village.</span> <span id="s97">My parents thought about it, chose not to do that.</span> <span id="s98">But maids could not be employed by Jews.</span> <span id="s99">So the maid left.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q:Why would she have taken you to her village?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A:Well, she thought she would in some way help me.</span> <span id="s102">Or maybe save me, or maybe protect me, or maybe help me, or raise me in a sense, because there were overtones of problems.</span> <span id="s103">Uh, I recall rather clearly that as a child of 5 or 6 or so I wanted a bicycle.</span> <span id="s104">Not an unusual request, a bicycle for a child of 5 or 6.</span> <span id="s105">My parents were certainly in a position to afford a bicycle or five.</span> <span id="s106">But there was major concern.</span> <span id="s107">I didn't understand the concern at the time.</span> <span id="s108">I just understood I didn't have a bike.</span> <span id="s109">And I probably threw the normal 5-year-old-tantrums about it.</span> <span id="s110">Later on I kind of understood that one of the reasons was that in a city, you ride bicycles in a park, and in the city of Budapest, large, urbane, sophisticated as it was, if a child with a yellow star on his chest rode a bike, somebody might have knocked him off the bike, taken the bike and left him on the curb, and nobody really would have said too much.</span> <span id="s111">And my parents thought it was just unsafe.</span> <span id="s112">Not unsafe in terms of the kinds of problems you might have because of traffic, but just unsafe.</span> <span id="s113">I know that when I went to school, the apartment we had was on a corner of a building - you could see down the street if you stood in the bedroom, there was a circular kind of a set of windows - and the street I lived on, my house was number at 13, my school was at number 44.</span> <span id="s114">You could see from the fifth floor apartment window at number 13 to number 44.</span> <span id="s115">You could almost see the school, which was down the street several blocks.</span> <span id="s116">And I didn't know this but I was told that my father, for example, often would both watch me walk to school and sometimes follow me walking to school because of some safety concerns that the kid might be knocked into traffic.</span> <span id="s117">Nobody would have necessarily said too much if a child age six or seven with a yellow star would be pushed into traffic.</span> <span id="s118">Accidentally or deliberately by somebody who was trying to make an incident.</span> <span id="s119">These are certainly things that in some way affected my life as a child, and uh, hindsight is always perfect.</span> <span id="s120">Part of what I find fascinating in my own case is that I have very good recollections.</span> <span id="s121">But the time that this took place I didn't have the emotional impact of what this meant.</span> <span id="s122">I learned that later.</span> <span id="s123">A six year old doesn't understand political realities, doesn't understand various kinds of anti- this or anti- that.</span> <span id="s124">Uh, to a 6 year old, in a rather peculiar way, wearing a yellow star makes him an adult.</span> <span id="s125">All the adults do.</span> <span id="s126">"Well, if they do and I don't, I'm a child.</span> <span id="s127">If they do and I do, I'm an adult."</span> <span id="s128">There's a certain badge of honor.</span> <span id="s129">They didn't understand the negative implications of that.</span> <span id="s130">To me, to be like an adult, I too have my own yellow star.</span> <span id="s131">It was an important achievement, of sorts.</span> <span id="s132">That sounds silly.</span> <span id="s133">But we are talking about a 6-year old child.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q:Do you remember when you got your yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A:The specific day, no.</span> <span id="s136">But it must have been some time in uh ... Well, Hungary was in a peculiar position.</span> <span id="s137">Hungary, being an ally of Germany, was not overrun.</span> <span id="s138">I am reasonably certain that the reason I'm alive today is because I was not under German rule in 1939.</span> <span id="s139">Now, the Hungarian Nazi Party, known as the Arrow Cross, was not what I would call benevolent.</span> <span id="s140">On the other hand... Shall we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q:We're going to have to stop.</span> <span id="s142">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A:I didn't want to pay attention to the flicker; but I figured when it went out, might as well stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q:Let's do this as quickly as we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A:Anything you want to say while we're off for a minute in terms of where we are?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q:This is very interesting and important and exactly what we want to have on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A:Well, is this the way you want to have it?</span> <span id="s148">I have another variation, another canned speech, although some of it is.</span> <span id="s149">I mean, I've done this before.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q:...breathing in my ear to tell you that she's terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A:Well, I know that.</span> <span id="s152">Come on!</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q:Go.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A:I was commenting on the fact that one of the--if you want to call it an advantage, or one of the blessings in disguise--was that Hungary was not occupied by the Germans until fairly late in the war.</span> <span id="s155">Hungary was an ally.</span> <span id="s156">Again, historians know that the region of Hungary was uh, struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler and they were allies, so Hungarian troops on the Russian front and so forth.</span> <span id="s157">As a consequence, the German presence, the physical presence of the Germans, specifically the SS and the Gestapo, did not enter Hungary until very late in the war.</span> <span id="s158">Literally until 1944.</span> <span id="s159">Earlier, the regime was run by the Hungarian Nazi Party--the so-called "Arrow Cross," the Nylas.</span> <span id="s160">And their symbol was crossed arrows, as opposed to the swastika that the Germans had.</span> <span id="s161">And as a consequence, the kind of life that one had was probably different.</span> <span id="s162">I'm not sure it was any better; but life was certainly different than it would have been under German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q:When you were six, you said that you weren't aware.</span> <span id="s164">Clearly, you weren't aware of these historical, political activities; but what about your friends, what about other six year-olds?</span> <span id="s165">Were you aware of danger to yourself from other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A:Well, I have the recollection of recalling at the age of six that I was scared.</span> <span id="s167">Of kids.</span> <span id="s168">I lived in a fairly closed society, by choice.</span> <span id="s169">I mean, we lived in a certain neighborhood.</span> <span id="s170">You remember, you realize that the kind of transport that's available today, the kind of mobility that we have today--not because of any sense of available conveyances... I mean, again, Budapest is a major city with a subway, with trolley cars, with buses, with cars, with taxis.</span> <span id="s171">You could go anywhere anytime.</span> <span id="s172">But if you went anywhere that was more than an hour away, it was a trip.</span> <span id="s173">Emotionally, it was not the kind of thing people did.</span> <span id="s174">People did not go to visit their friends.</span> <span id="s175">Certainly, children did not go to visit their friends.</span> <span id="s176">And Mom didn't drive you over for the afternoon and pick you up three hours later while she went shopping.</span> <span id="s177">It was not the norm.</span> <span id="s178">We owned no car.</span> <span id="s179">Few people did.</span> <span id="s180">It's not a question of where you were in the status of the community, but it was not the thing that people did.</span> <span id="s181">We used taxis, buses, trolley cars, subways--as everybody else did.</span> <span id="s182">As a consequence, the universe that one lives in is fairly limited.</span> <span id="s183">Interestingly, I mentioned earlier that I was back in Budapest last summer.</span> <span id="s184">And I kind of walked my neighborhood, all eight or nine blocks of it.</span> <span id="s185">It was that limited.</span> <span id="s186">It was my school, it was the park, it was the ice skating rink, it was the Danube banks where we used to take walks--which happened to be close to where I lived.</span> <span id="s187">It was the area of the synagogue, the area of the school.</span> <span id="s188">When we went to the zoo, or the circus, or to the amusement park, or to the other side of the Danube, those were excursions.</span> <span id="s189">Children did not do that by themselves.</span> <span id="s190">And in a sense, six or seven year-olds don't do it by themselves today, either.</span> <span id="s191">So the nature of life was that it was a fairly closed, kind of fairly limited society, for everybody.</span> <span id="s192">I was limited in my area.</span> <span id="s193">No ghetto.</span> <span id="s194">This is not a ghetto limitation, a legal limitation.</span> <span id="s195">I was limited in my area.</span> <span id="s196">I lived in the 7th District of Budapest, and I probably knew one quarter of the 7th District.</span> <span id="s197">And kids like I--Jews and non-Jews--probably living in the 3rd District, knew a quarter of their district.</span> <span id="s198">It was the nature of the world.</span> <span id="s199">I went to a parochial school, as everybody did.</span> <span id="s200">I mean, if you were Catholic, you went to a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s201">If you were Jewish, you went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s202">If you were something else--the term is "Reformed," meaning all Protestants--went to some Protestant schools.</span> <span id="s203">So I was with those children; and I recall having children in the building where I lived, around the corner from where I lived, who were my friends.</span> <span id="s204">I have no sense, Jews or non-Jews, and I have no sense of their being afraid, scared, or that they were impacted by the war anymore than I was.</span> <span id="s205">At least, that's not my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q:Alright.</span> <span id="s207">That's when you were six.</span> <span id="s208">Let's proceed a little bit more chronologically.</span> <span id="s209">Did you live in Budapest for all of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A:From Riga, if we back up, we moved to Budapest.</span> <span id="s211">I spent the summer, or a kind of a long summer, with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s212">I'm told that I had some kind of a reaction to...some allergic reaction.</span> <span id="s213">I developed some kind of hives at the age of one, and I was not inside Budapest.</span> <span id="s214">I was out in the fresh air of the suburbs for about six or eight months.</span> <span id="s215">But from that time until we actually were deported and left in 1945, I in fact lived in Budapest.</span> <span id="s216">The bulk of my life--I was eight when we left, so seven and a half years I spent in Budapest.</span> <span id="s217">From 1936, in the early...late summer, until the summer of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q:Tell me about being deported.</span> <span id="s219">What led up to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A:Well, history tells it that at one time the Germans came into Hungary in early 1944.</span> <span id="s221">Eichmann, as the man in charge of the solution to the Jewish problem, was attempting to solve the problem.</span> <span id="s222">He was approached--and the story is very complex.</span> <span id="s223">But it's not my personal story.</span> <span id="s224">So I'm not going to detail all the issues about Eichmann and his negotiations with a man by the name of Joel Brand, who was sent to negotiate with the Allies, was arrested in Syria, was in jail in Egypt, and survived the war and died fairly recently.</span> <span id="s225">Or a man by the name of Kasztner--a lawyer, a Hungarian lawyer, who negotiated with uh Eichmann--who then immigrated to Israel after the war and was assassinated there by some people who thought...by a person who thought that he had done something that was inappropriate, or there was a collaborator.</span> <span id="s226">Those particular stories are well documented elsewhere.</span> <span id="s227">Specifically, there was an arrangement made based on the concept that Eichmann enunciated as a blood for merchandise, or blood for material, or blood for an exchange.</span> <span id="s228">The exchange proposal was that Eichmann wanted 10,000 trucks, western trucks, to be used against the eastern front, and for that he would release one million people and stop the extermination in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s229">That didn't happen for many reasons, not the least of them being that the Allies would not give them the trucks and that they were not available, and the emissary was jailed in Syria [NB: Egypt], as I said.</span> <span id="s230">But there was a test group, essentially a group that was bartered, for serious money.</span> <span id="s231">The European Jewish community, the Hungarian Jewish community, and the rich Jewish community, they had money.</span> <span id="s232">And at that point, this is, we are talking about April/May of '44.</span> <span id="s233">Now, remember that the war ended in '45.</span> <span id="s234">The war was not going well for the Germans in '44.</span> <span id="s235">And I would not be surprised if they had made some decisions that said that whatever they do they will do to in someway improve their positions, whether it was personal or national I don't know.</span> <span id="s236">And an arrangement was made that some 1600 people would be assembled, would be placed on trains, and would be taken, I think... There were three choices that I recall--through Turkey, or through the Baltics, or through Spain--to Palestine.</span> <span id="s237">I think the final decision was to go through Spain.</span> <span id="s238">And the ruse was--and the Germans, you see, would do anything as long as it was legal and properly stamped, documented, indexed, filed and in a good chronology.</span> <span id="s239">It's amazing what kind of regimentation we were able to deal with.</span> <span id="s240">The 1600 plus people primarily professed to claim to be displaced persons captured in Central Europe, because of the war; but they really had Palestinian papers.</span> <span id="s241">Now, if you want to figure that one out, I mean, that's interesting.</span> <span id="s242">But the point remains, as long as you could provide Palestinian papers as citizens of Palestine under British mandate, no matter where they had been born they were Palestinians.</span> <span id="s243">If you could provide those papers, the Germans would accept; because it is part of understanding that you don't challenge the documentation.</span> <span id="s244">"If you say you are a Palestinian, we'll accept it.</span> <span id="s245">And if we accept it, we'll give you an exit visa."</span> <span id="s246">This was part of the arrangement.</span> <span id="s247">It had to be proper.</span> <span id="s248">It had to be legal.</span> <span id="s249">It didn't have to be correct.</span> <span id="s250">Well, I was a Palestinian expatriate of some sort, and so was my mother.</span> <span id="s251">Not my father - he was not part of the group.</span> <span id="s252">These 1600 people that were composed of people from various parts of Hungary--and substantially from Budapest--were assembled in a school for the purpose of being deported.</span> <span id="s253">It should look as a deportation; but they would really be deported through Spain, placed on a ship, and sent to Palestine to be repatriated in Palestine, which is...which is their adopted country.</span> <span id="s254">My personal little group was my mother, myself, my uncle--who was my father's youngest brother--and another child.</span> <span id="s255">And I need to digress just for a moment as to how this was composed.</span> <span id="s256">My mother and I got fairly reasonable.</span> <span id="s257">We were living in Budapest, and we were part of the group.</span> <span id="s258">We received at that point four spaces in this group, for my mother, myself, my uncle and a cousin...a first cousin of mine who lived in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q:How did you receive these spaces?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A:The allocations were made by decisions of the ruling Jewish community, council, party, Zionist underground, overground, leftist/rightist organizations who somehow got together and had to make decisions about who can, who cannot, who was healthy, who was not.</span> <span id="s261">I would not really today wish to be in their place.</span> <span id="s262">But in many ways decisions had to be made as to who in fact can perhaps afford it, who's free to do it, who's free to travel, who's maybe absence would not in some way be taken inappropriate by the Germans, some security issues, they would not be absconding with funds.</span> <span id="s263">The computers of today probably could not come up with enough variables to determine by what way these 1600 people were chosen, selected, permitted may be a better way of saying it.</span> <span id="s264">But we had four spaces.</span> <span id="s265">My mother, myself, my uncle and a cousin.</span> <span id="s266">The cousin was the son of one of my father's brothers.</span> <span id="s267">The child came to stay with us as this group was being organized, because his parents thought that he might, in some way, have a better chance with us through this group than being in the city where he was.</span> <span id="s268">The child did not speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s269">The superintendent of the building was very interested in making points, bounty points, with the local administration; and he kept complaining about the fact that there's a child staying with us who does not speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s270">Obviously, he's not Hungarian.</span> <span id="s271">Obviously, he doesn't belong there.</span> <span id="s272">We were concerned that the child would be turned in to the police.</span> <span id="s273">We sent the child back.</span> <span id="s274">I don't mean I, but we--my parents--sent the child back to his parents awaiting the formation of the group.</span> <span id="s275">The child was deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s276">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s277">Three days before the group was about to leave, a woman came to the house, a woman who was a very distant cousin on my mother's side through her husband.</span> <span id="s278">I mean, really not a blood relation.</span> <span id="s279">With her four year-old son.</span> <span id="s280">And she said that "I understand that you have a space available, because the other child is no longer available."</span> <span id="s281">We had been waiting for several weeks, perhaps a couple of months for them to form, to be given marching orders.</span> <span id="s282">"Take the child.</span> <span id="s283">We'll take the risk."</span> <span id="s284">My mother took the child.</span> <span id="s285">I had a brother for several years.</span> <span id="s286">Uh, so this was the group of four.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q:What about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A:I need to make tangential comments.</span> <span id="s289">First of all, that the four year-old at the time--and I'll give you names.</span> <span id="s290">It's important.</span> <span id="s291">His name is...his name at that time was Ivan Fleishman (ph).</span> <span id="s292">His name is Joash (ph).</span> <span id="s293">He lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s294">Uh, both his mother and father survived the war.</span> <span id="s295">All of them reunited in Israel.</span> <span id="s296">His father has since died.</span> <span id="s297">Not of war causes, uh age causes.</span> <span id="s298">His mother is still alive, and she is still my quasi-aunt; and I saw her last summer when I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s299">She is married, has several children, and is well.</span> <span id="s300">It's an amazing kind of a story of how he came into this, and how he probably was saved by being in this group with my mother, and my mother's willingness to accept it.</span> <span id="s301">The uncle who was with us was a student in the University of Budapest, was about to be married to a woman from another city--the city of Ungvár, which is now no longer Hungary.</span> <span id="s302">It's now in Czechoslovakia, it's called Uzhgorod.</span> <span id="s303">My aunt-to-be went back to her city to make preparation for the wedding.</span> <span id="s304">I think they'd gotten their...their non-religious, their...whatever, their civil license, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s305">So she went back to arrange, and she was deported.</span> <span id="s306">She went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s307">The uncle was with us, and I'll tell you where he was later.</span> <span id="s308">They reunited in Israel after the war.</span> <span id="s309">There were...they had twin children.</span> <span id="s310">Unfortunately, the uncle died of a heart attack at the age of 35 in 1948, 1949.</span> <span id="s311">But they made it.</span> <span id="s312">Where was my father?</span> <span id="s313">The Hungarian Jews...well, Jews were not conscripted into the Army.</span> <span id="s314">But, again, because we were not overrun, what Hungarian Jews did, they were conscripted into labor battalions.</span> <span id="s315">And they were ordered out to various kinds of duty, whether it was digging ditches, paving roads, do working in mines, and what not.</span> <span id="s316">Labor.</span> <span id="s317">I mean, physical kind of labor.</span> <span id="s318">Uh, if trenches had to be dug between the Germans and the Russians, the labor battalions dug the trenches between them.</span> <span id="s319">They were shot from both sides.</span> <span id="s320">My father was in a labor battalion, no longer in Budapest; and if he had in some way escaped that labor battalion to join us, he would have been clear, obvious.</span> <span id="s321">He would have been traced, he would have been shot.</span> <span id="s322">And I don't know what all the consequences would have been.</span> <span id="s323">So he was not part of this group.</span> <span id="s324">My mother and my father were separated at that time, and we went one way and he went another way.</span> <span id="s325">I already told you earlier he survived the war.</span> <span id="s326">So at least we know what the final story is.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q:Now, it seems that we have made a little jump.</span> <span id="s328">Let's try to fill in what we're missing.</span> <span id="s329">You were what?</span> <span id="s330">About seven, at the time of the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A:Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:When did your father leave, and how was this explained to you?</span> <span id="s333">It seems that you must have gradually become aware that things are not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A:Well, I knew that things were not very good.</span> <span id="s335">But I did not... What I was saying to you before is that I understood what went on, in a sense of recalling and having kind of cognitive understanding of what it is.</span> <span id="s336">It's the emotional impact, the scarring that wasn't there.</span> <span id="s337">My father was in one of the labor camps in 1939.</span> <span id="s338">His being gone for two weeks, a month, three days, was not at all unusual.</span> <span id="s339">I mean, I didn't understand exactly why.</span> <span id="s340">But other fathers went, so why shouldn't he go?</span> <span id="s341">There was nothing unusual about this.</span> <span id="s342">It was like being in the reserves, if you will; or having, in this...in this community we talk about government employees having TDY's--fairly long assignments in other cities or other countries for two weeks, three weeks.</span> <span id="s343">Even, you know, being in the Navy or something.</span> <span id="s344">There was nothing about it, it was so routinized.</span> <span id="s345">Interestingly, I mentioned that my uncle who was with us was my father's youngest brother, had been a university student.</span> <span id="s346">When he was called to labor camp for the first time--I remember as clearly as I'm sitting here today--I threw a wild fit.</span> <span id="s347">My grandmother, who lived with us at the time, fainted; because that was a first-time unique experience, that my Uncle David.</span> <span id="s348">I mean, his friends came; and they had to report at some, whatever, induction station.</span> <span id="s349">And they went.</span> <span id="s350">And I was convinced I'll never see him again, and I was convinced that something's going to happen.</span> <span id="s351">That was unusual.</span> <span id="s352">That disturbed me.</span> <span id="s353">My father's coming and going didn't, because from the age of three--my age of three--he was gone.</span> <span id="s354">And then he was home.</span> <span id="s355">And then he was gone.</span> <span id="s356">And then he was home.</span> <span id="s357">And I had no predictable kind of understanding as to when he would be or wouldn't be home.</span> <span id="s358">Uh, you know, the world did not at that point have ___________-based ______________, didn't have to take me to the game every Wednesday afternoon.</span> <span id="s359">And I was perfectly used to the fact that he would be home uh at times and at other times would not.</span> <span id="s360">When my uncle was taken, that was a particularly...that was particularly traumatic to me.</span> <span id="s361">Because it was the first time.</span> <span id="s362">So, there was nothing unusual about my father not being there.</span> <span id="s363">Unusual in that sense.</span> <span id="s364">I don't know if I filled that gap, but let me go on with the point of what happens at this deportation.</span> <span id="s365">Finally, the orders came that we would meet in a given school.</span> <span id="s366">And uh ...for the purpose of kind of forming the group; and we were in the school for several days.</span> <span id="s367">I don't know exactly how many.</span> <span id="s368">This is in June of 1944.</span> <span id="s369">[PHRASES MISSING--Re: waiting in a large gymnasium] . . . trains to arrive.</span> <span id="s370">We were put on trains; and these were the typical trains that you see in movies today.</span> <span id="s371">These were cattle cars with some straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q:Can you describe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A:Well, cattle cars are just plain freight cars with big doors with wooden floors.</span> <span id="s374">They were reasonably clean.</span> <span id="s375">They had some straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s376">They were not full of... Some had some residue of lime, or some other kind of chemical that had been transported.</span> <span id="s377">But they were not full of cattle droppings, and uh in that sense they were O.K.</span> <span id="s378">The reason they used these because these were more available than uh - they could not haul coal.</span> <span id="s379">They could not haul passengers, well, passengers.</span> <span id="s380">We were not passengers, we were freight.</span> <span id="s381">And we were put into these cars, uh, I am told later there were...may have been as many as 80 people in a car, which made it very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s382">But survivable.</span> <span id="s383">We were not there that long.</span> <span id="s384">The doors were closed.</span> <span id="s385">I don't know if they were sealed.</span> <span id="s386">They were certainly locked.</span> <span id="s387">You could not open them from the inside.</span> <span id="s388">But I'm not sure they were sealed with some kind of sealant material that you see sometimes.</span> <span id="s389">That happened in transports to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s390">And we started by train uh... I remember, and I've read in some of these pieces of information, that the train really circled the city for a day and the next morning we were back where we started from.</span> <span id="s391">I understand that they really didn't know exactly what to do with us.</span> <span id="s392">I also understand that the notion was being trained to neutral Spain.</span> <span id="s393">Israel was never contemplated by them.</span> <span id="s394">But the train did begin to go north.</span> <span id="s395">And the adults in the group, I mean, they had some sense of what was going on.</span> <span id="s396">I mean, everything was not a secret.</span> <span id="s397">And if you went, depending on what direction you went, you had an idea of where you were going.</span> <span id="s398">And the major fear was the awful fear of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s399">Auschwitz was known in 1944.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, it was known everywhere, including this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q:Did you know what that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A:I, personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A:I don't think so.</span> <span id="s405">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s406">But the train went on a different route.</span> <span id="s407">It went up the Rhine Valley; and eventually wound up, we were told, for a rest stop, for kind of a showers and some rest and relaxation, and whatever--an R&amp;R stop.</span> <span id="s408">We were there a couple of days, in uh...south of the city of Hamburg--which is familiar as the city of Hannover, which is a major railhead.</span> <span id="s409">And perhaps 20 kilometers south of Hannover, was a..</span> <span id="s410">.</span> <span id="s411">this new camp called Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s412">Bergen-Belsen is more known now than it was then.</span> <span id="s413">We were marched to that camp.</span> <span id="s414">Reasonably civilized treatment.</span> <span id="s415">Uh, people who were older, children, were taken by truck.</span> <span id="s416">I remember, I was with my mother.</span> <span id="s417">I was the man of the family.</span> <span id="s418">Here was my mother.</span> <span id="s419">My uncle was involved with some of the leadership of the group.</span> <span id="s420">My mother and the eight year old, and this youngster who was four.</span> <span id="s421">So I lugged the uh whatever suitcases we had, and I marched with my mother.</span> <span id="s422">And I recall that.</span> <span id="s423">I suppose I must have had some subconscious understanding of my role in the family as being the only male with my father away.</span> <span id="s424">And I said before that my father being away was not unusual.</span> <span id="s425">But I'm not suggesting that it had no impact at all.</span> <span id="s426">It was just something that was dis...not disturbing.</span> <span id="s427">But I knew that he wasn't there; and I was the man of the family, of sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q:But leaving your home was unusual, and what did it seem to you was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A:This was a deportation.</span> <span id="s430">I mean, it's a contradiction in terms.</span> <span id="s431">It was a deportation by choice.</span> <span id="s432">We were willing to take our risk, our chance, with this group.</span> <span id="s433">Even though on the German hand...in German hands, and even though we weren't too sure that we could trust those decisions, we were willing to essentially accept this deportation as opposed to staying where we were and taking our chances there.</span> <span id="s434">But people survived who stayed in Budapest as well.</span> <span id="s435">So...don't know exactly how many.</span> <span id="s436">So this was a deportation by choice.</span> <span id="s437">Now, remember when we left the apartment... I mean, usually if we went somewhere, my mother and father, or my mother or whatever, with a suitcase or two, went to my grandparents or something, we would take a cab.</span> <span id="s438">No.</span> <span id="s439">Here we had a horse and a wagon; and I don't mean a hansom cab.</span> <span id="s440">Kind of a horse-drawn wagon, which was kind of a freight wagon--which was still used in Europe at the time.</span> <span id="s441">And we sat on that with our baggage; and I remember my mother saying to me something to the effect is, "Don't look at this as a happy adventure.</span> <span id="s442">I mean, we are being deported."</span> <span id="s443">As though she was saying, you're being deported - on the other hand, it's a deportation with an asterisk.</span> <span id="s444">That's a deportation maybe with some possibilities, or maybe it won't be as bad as traditional deportations could be.</span> <span id="s445">We knew my grandparents, uncles and aunts had been deported to Auschwitz from surrounding communities.</span> <span id="s446">We didn't know their fate, but we knew they were deported not by choice.</span> <span id="s447">We were being deported by choice because we joined the group by...with some choice.</span> <span id="s448">So there's...there's an interesting kind of juxtaposition of being under SS guard by choice.</span> <span id="s449">But that's, in a sense, what this was.</span> <span id="s450">'Cause you didn't have to join the group.</span> <span id="s451">The SS certainly didn't determine who went into the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q:Can you remember what the conditions were that made it preferable to take this risky step?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A:Well, we thought we were going to be taken to some port of debarkation and sent to Palestine.</span> <span id="s454">That seemed like a much better choice than being bombed, or being deported to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s455">And we didn't precisely know perhaps exactly what happened in those camps.</span> <span id="s456">But we just had the assumption that since nobody has yet come back, it can't be too terribly nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q:Did you feel that you mother was afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A:Afraid in what way?</span> <span id="s459">Help me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q:I'm trying to imagine what it would be like to leave my home, as a very young child, and what my mother would be feeling or doing, what the atmosphere would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A:My mother's feelings, as I found out later, in a sense had to do with the fact that she was not just leaving her house.</span> <span id="s462">That, they had done.</span> <span id="s463">Remember, they were married in one community, I was born in another community, we were now living in a third community in the space of six or seven years.</span> <span id="s464">And by choice.</span> <span id="s465">So that was not unusual.</span> <span id="s466">But I think separation from my father was a major point.</span> <span id="s467">I mean, she at that point had to contemplate that maybe she'll never see him again.</span> <span id="s468">Had she stayed, he would have at least, I expect, come home--as he had come home from labor camps previously.</span> <span id="s469">As it turned out, he never came home from labor camps subsequent to that time; because by that time, although he was still in Hungary when we were deported, within several weeks he was in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s470">And was there for some time.</span> <span id="s471">Eventually he came back right after we left.</span> <span id="s472">But this business of being home three days and gone for a week, or being away for three weeks and home for two days, no longer would have played.</span> <span id="s473">And no one could have known that.</span> <span id="s474">But if my mother thought about replicating or maintaining what was the status quo, the assumption would have been he would have come home as he had done before.</span> <span id="s475">She had to make a decision and to agree with the decision--his decision--in their communication; my uncle's insistence that if one can in someway be given a better chance, take the better chance.</span> <span id="s476">Now her feelings.</span> <span id="s477">I go back to being, what...eight years old.</span> <span id="s478">And there was a certain sense of excitement.</span> <span id="s479">But dulled excitement.</span> <span id="s480">It's difficult to convey what it feels like when you are talking about feelings at the age of eight in retrospect.</span> <span id="s481">The understanding of what a Holocaust is about was totally foreign to me at the time.</span> <span id="s482">I'm not sure an eight year-old can comprehend what it is that people killed, what gas chambers are like, and whether they exist.</span> <span id="s483">Slowly I began to understand some of it, and I'll tell you about that in a moment.</span> <span id="s484">The group that we were with eventually does leave, and we were headed north.</span> <span id="s485">And we wind up in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q:Leaves on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A:Yeah, the train.</span> <span id="s488">The gathering point in Budapest, we leave on a train.</span> <span id="s489">We're on a train for several days.</span> <span id="s490">And the train is going in a direction that is not Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s491">And we wind up in a place that was unfamiliar to us, but we found that it was called Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q:Was there food on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A:Yes, but I don't know from where.</span> <span id="s494">I know that when we left, we were told that we could pack certain basic essential belongings, you know.</span> <span id="s495">Maybe a backpack and a suitcase, or something like that.</span> <span id="s496">We were not... I mean, we certainly didn't take furniture and cutlery with you.</span> <span id="s497">The adults, you know, there's other people, and I was not one of them, must have in some way had a notion that they were going to be on the road for some time and needed to pack.</span> <span id="s498">What was packed I don't know.</span> <span id="s499">Obviously they packed something, but I do know this.</span> <span id="s500">My mother packed three things.</span> <span id="s501">This is very unusual to do this.</span> <span id="s502">She had with her a liter bottle of honey, a liter bottle of fat, like chicken fat, and a, I don't know, a five or six pound, several kilo, piece of some kind of bacon-like substance.</span> <span id="s503">Now, bacon in my house didn't happen.</span> <span id="s504">A strictly kosher home with my father's background and my mother's background.</span> <span id="s505">But somehow, by some dispensation, or by some foresight, they thought that's new, that nutritious, let's take it.</span> <span id="s506">We can always not use it.</span> <span id="s507">I don't know how they justified it.</span> <span id="s508">But there's a sense of survival that says you take what you need.</span> <span id="s509">And we ate, I'm sure we ate.</span> <span id="s510">We had no malnutrition problems in the four or five days.</span> <span id="s511">Nobody died.</span> <span id="s512">I recall, for example, we stopped two or three days out.</span> <span id="s513">As I remember it was a cool pleasant evening, the doors of the cars were open and we kind of camped on the ground.</span> <span id="s514">There were little flap-top tents, but we slept outside on blankets and things.</span> <span id="s515">It was perfectly O.K. And there was some kind of cooking going on.</span> <span id="s516">But you ask me where the food came from, I don't know.</span> <span id="s517">Maybe it was provided by the folks who ran the train.</span> <span id="s518">You know, the German, maybe there was a, a, military mess backed up the truck and gave us certain food.</span> <span id="s519">Sixteen hundred people you know require, you know, you can't pack it in a doggie bag.</span> <span id="s520">But there was food.</span> <span id="s521">I can't tell you from where.</span> <span id="s522">That's not part of my recollection.</span> <span id="s523">We get to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s524">I see a march (ph) in Bergen-Belsen which begin to notice is there's barbed wire, there's fences, there's very big search lights, there's towers and there's guns.</span> <span id="s525">And that gives you the nature or the understanding that wait a minute, this is not, you know, Camp Summit.</span> <span id="s526">And you talk and you understand and you're given rules and you're given restrictions and you're told not to go near the barbed wire and you're told not to do this, and maybe not to shout too much or maybe not to do this and not the other thing.</span> <span id="s527">A small recollection, not particularly ________, but it happened while I am in camp.</span> <span id="s528">We get to camp sometime in June, the summer is there and winter sets in.</span> <span id="s529">The German winters are not particularly pleasant, uh you know, rain and snow and wet.</span> <span id="s530">Before we left, again, think about the kind of perception or some kind of clairvoyance that sometimes people have.</span> <span id="s531">Traditionally the people bought shoes at the store.</span> <span id="s532">If we bought shoes, we had the shoes made.</span> <span id="s533">We didn't buy them.</span> <span id="s534">You know, Thom McAnn wasn't available and neither was Florsheim.</span> <span id="s535">My mother had a pair of boots made for me.</span> <span id="s536">Not high boots, kind of ankle boots, because the assumption was if we're going to be traveling away under circumstances unknown, maybe those kind of high-top kind of boots would be better than softer city shoes.</span> <span id="s537">The way shoes were made is that you glued the sole in some way, and then you put holes in, and then you put wooden dowels in it, and then you kind of _______ at the bottom with these wooden dowels.</span> <span id="s538">You didn't sew them.</span> <span id="s539">I don't know about shoe making but that's the way hand-crafted shoes were made.</span> <span id="s540">They were not designed to go through muck and mire day after day.</span> <span id="s541">But at camp as the rainy season began, began, and we were told every four, every day at four o'clock there would be a roll call, a census taken.</span> <span id="s542">We had to be out.</span> <span id="s543">We had to be out at four.</span> <span id="s544">The census takers could have counted, the roll could have been taken any time after four - five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, whatever.</span> <span id="s545">We had to be out there.</span> <span id="s546">If it was muddy, it was muddy.</span> <span id="s547">If it was mucky, it was mucky.</span> <span id="s548">Well, the wooden dowels began to fall out of the shoes.</span> <span id="s549">My uncle, Uncle David, made some arrangements with some other people in our group to fix the shoes.</span> <span id="s550">Now think about, it is a fascinating notion to know that some people brought cobbler tools with them.</span> <span id="s551">Somebody was a cobbler.</span> <span id="s552">Somebody fixed shoes.</span> <span id="s553">So you traded, uh for cigarettes, which was a legal barter, uh rate of exchange, for shoe repair.</span> <span id="s554">My shoes were repaired.</span> <span id="s555">The dowels were replaced.</span> <span id="s556">And then my uncle says to me, son, you can't run around anymore.</span> <span id="s557">Well, I understood what he was saying.</span> <span id="s558">He was a young man at the time, he was in his early thirties, his late twenties.</span> <span id="s559">But he says to his nephew, you can't run around.</span> <span id="s560">What will an eight year old do when he can't even run around?</span> <span id="s561">I mean the only recreation is kind of run around and play tag and chase other kids.</span> <span id="s562">But if you run around your shoes fall apart.</span> <span id="s563">If your shoes fall apart, your feet get wet.</span> <span id="s564">Your feet get wet, you get pneumonia.</span> <span id="s565">You get pneumonia, you're taken to a German hospital.</span> <span id="s566">You go to German hospital, you die.</span> <span id="s567">So if you don't want to die, don't run.</span> <span id="s568">That's a difficult concept (ph) for an eight year old to understand.</span> <span id="s569">I did get pneumonia, from some other source, and I spent some time in bed, but in bed, you know, in the bunks, but that's a recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q:How much do you recollect or remember about the camp.</span> <span id="s571">?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A:I was, let me tell some recollections about the camp.</span> <span id="s573">I just said to you that somebody set up a shoe-making shop.</span> <span id="s574">Well, so there were several doctors with us.</span> <span id="s575">Because when I had pneumonia, I remember the doctor--his name was Feldman--he was from the city of Debrecen.</span> <span id="s576">I had some recollections of him.</span> <span id="s577">I was reminded of him recently in a different connection.</span> <span id="s578">But who treated pneumonia as pneumonia could be treated at the time with mustard packs and other kinds of things, which were the regimen of the day.</span> <span id="s579">But somebody... So the doctor is a doctor, the cobbler was the cobbler.</span> <span id="s580">I'm sure, although I don't recall specifically, somebody did something about repair of clothes, somebody was a tailor.</span> <span id="s581">There was a small school.</span> <span id="s582">And even more fascinating to me is the fact that within days I think, people were into business.</span> <span id="s583">They set out to do business in the labor camp.</span> <span id="s584">You asked me how, where the food came from and I said people must have brought some.</span> <span id="s585">And I remember, for example, I remember very clearly, that while my father was in labor camp, before we were deported, we would ship him tins of pre-cooked food.</span> <span id="s586">Cause it was much more nourishing than what he was receiving up there.</span> <span id="s587">Now again I don't know too much about how you prepare canned food, but I do know that what you have to do is somehow to vacuum seal it.</span> <span id="s588">So tins had the tops cut off, you took it to a factory that made tins, aluminum cans, and they would put a new top and kind of vacuum it and seal it in someway.</span> <span id="s589">And that could be shipped and it wouldn't go bad.</span> <span id="s590">We had some of those with us, obviously.</span> <span id="s591">So did others.</span> <span id="s592">From the notion of CARE packages to my father, we had some with us.</span> <span id="s593">We got to Bergen-Belsen in the summertime.</span> <span id="s594">The sun was out.</span> <span id="s595">The weather was nice.</span> <span id="s596">And I recall clearly people with chairs and benches or card tables of some sort, out in the yards, with hand-tooled jewelry-type things made of tin cans.</span> <span id="s597">As the tin cans were used, sparingly and lovingly and gently, they did not throw them away.</span> <span id="s598">They made certain kinds of artifacts out of them.</span> <span id="s599">What I'm saying to you is that the fascinating point comes from the fact that what happened immediately is that peoples' need to survive makes them want to create some sense of normalcy.</span> <span id="s600">I don't know whether the people that did this craft were in that business before they left, much as I don't know whether the shoe-maker was in fact a shoe-maker or an attorney.</span> <span id="s601">I don't know what he was.</span> <span id="s602">But somehow the need to survive, the need to stabilize, the need to somehow put down a normal set of existence within barbed wire, within turrets with machine guns, within hot lights, within .</span> <span id="s603">.</span> <span id="s604">the people who told you be out at four in the morning and they may have shown up at ten in the morning.</span> <span id="s605">I mean that was not normal.</span> <span id="s606">But within this abnormal normalcy, there was an attempt to have normalcy.</span> <span id="s607">The school ran.</span> <span id="s608">They decided to teach Hebrew and French.</span> <span id="s609">I thought (ph) it would have been German.</span> <span id="s610">What occurs if later we're in Germany, and after the war we might be repatriated, liberated to France, which was a neighboring country, or to Palestine, which is where we're headed in the first place.</span> <span id="s611">But we didn't have to teach Hungarian kids Hungarian.</span> <span id="s612">People knew Hungarian.</span> <span id="s613">And there would have been nobody there who could teach them Turkish, you know, which would have been.</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">or Spanish because there may be no Spanish-speakers.</span> <span id="s616">But French was not unusual.</span> <span id="s617">My mother didn't teach French.</span> <span id="s618">My mother was a teacher.</span> <span id="s619">She was a teacher, an elementary school teacher, before she was married.</span> <span id="s620">She knew some French because in their training, typically in Europe people spoke three or four languages.</span> <span id="s621">So teach them French.</span> <span id="s622">Well, think about the inanity in a sense, or the, the peculiarity of people.</span> <span id="s623">There's a French school in labor camp, in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s624">Now we didn't expect to be there for any length of time.</span> <span id="s625">And what I'm describing to you about this normalcy really happened several days after we got there obviously because we thought we were going to be there for few days.</span> <span id="s626">One of the visual kinds of recollections that I have is that as we march into camp, there's a large sign--and you've seen this sign in documentaries--above the camp, is "Arbeit Macht Frei"--"Work Makes You Free."</span> <span id="s627">If you work, it's OK.</span> <span id="s628">Our group, and as ______ would say of the group, was not turned out to work.</span> <span id="s629">Maybe we were special group.</span> <span id="s630">We came in as a transient group.</span> <span id="s631">We came in as a special group.</span> <span id="s632">The Red Cross...monitored us.</span> <span id="s633">Eichmann had a personal stake in this one, we understand.</span> <span id="s634">We, I don't mean we.</span> <span id="s635">I [was] probably too young to work, typically as an eight year old; but they did not, they were not turned out to work every morning, which was the major reason that the starvation rate was limited.</span> <span id="s636">We did not lose any human being in camp.</span> <span id="s637">Nobody died.</span> <span id="s638">Nobody died.</span> <span id="s639">And I think that's correct.</span> <span id="s640">And if there were deaths, there may have been one.</span> <span id="s641">I don't recall the circumstance.</span> <span id="s642">I now recall vaguely, and I cannot recall specifically, a young woman who did die.</span> <span id="s643">And I don't know exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s644">I think she may have had... I don't recall.</span> <span id="s645">But if so, I mean, the mortality in the camp was well below what it should have been in a concentration camp in a period of seven or eight months.</span> <span id="s646">Because, you see, we didn't leave the camp in three or four days.</span> <span id="s647">They decided they have us in camp, there's a way to hold us in hostage.</span> <span id="s648">Three hundred and some members of the six hundred plus...sixteen hundred plus group were, in fact, taken out of the camp within weeks and taken to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s649">I was not among that group.</span> <span id="s650">The balance of the group--another, whatever...thirteen hundred or so--were taken to Switzerland, by the Germans, based on additional ______ bribery.</span> <span id="s651">What else can you call it?</span> <span id="s652">More money was raised, more money exchanged hands, more money was deposited.</span> <span id="s653">Uh without talking about just, you know, kind of a..</span> <span id="s654">.</span> <span id="s655">Without being nasty about what I'm not really interested in talking about, I would imagine that the...the post-war German wealth of Argentina and Brazil came from, partially from, those monies.</span> <span id="s656">But we were taken by German train; again the Germans were uh meticulous in what they did.</span> <span id="s657">When they put us on the train, the train ran.</span> <span id="s658">It may have run over bombed out bridges, which I remember having a great fright about going over this bridge is over the Rhine or whatever else, which were heavily bombed.</span> <span id="s659">We saw bombers every day.</span> <span id="s660">Hannover, which is a near-by community, was a major railhead.</span> <span id="s661">And the Allies were bombing the __________ out of that place.</span> <span id="s662">We saw Russian and American airplanes all the time.</span> <span id="s663">It's interesting that when we read the history of the era today, we know that there was some discussion about bombing the rail lines to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s664">And then somebody said they couldn't do that because they couldn't find it.</span> <span id="s665">There were aerial pictures of the place, taken pictures of the rail lines.</span> <span id="s666">And conversely, I mean, I among others saw the planes--American planes with American markings, and Russian planes with Russian markings, bombers--flying in formation towards Hannover and towards Hamburg, which was also a severely bombed.</span> <span id="s667">So the planes were there, but the bombs didn't fall.</span> <span id="s668">Well, I'm glad they didn't fall on us in one sense.</span> <span id="s669">On the other hand, the notion that they couldn't bomb the rail lines leaves you... I mean, from personal experience, I..</span> <span id="s670">.</span> <span id="s671">I challenge that statement.</span> <span id="s672">In any case, they took us, by train, to the German-Swiss border.</span> <span id="s673">And the German trains cannot run in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s674">But the Swiss trains can't run in Germany, either.</span> <span id="s675">They are a different gauge, as I understand it.</span> <span id="s676">I'm no train...you know, I'm no authority on trains.</span> <span id="s677">As I understand, the Swiss did this in order to make sure nobody can invade them by rail.</span> <span id="s678">So the German train came up on one side of the...of the...of the platform, and we came out of these... These were passenger trains.</span> <span id="s679">These were not transport cars for cattle anymore.</span> <span id="s680">Passenger trains--not Amtrak, but passenger trains.</span> <span id="s681">Seats.</span> <span id="s682">We came out of these rather... And they were all...black-out had to be observed.</span> <span id="s683">And some of the windows were smashed, you know, without particularly...they were not pullman cars.</span> <span id="s684">But we came out of one side; and crossed the platform into these warm, lit, beautiful, typically Swiss-clean Swiss trains to be taken to the city of Saint Gallen, to a high school gymnasium, to a..</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">a gathering point to be deloused.</span> <span id="s687">The first recollection I have of Switzerland is that we were all deloused.</span> <span id="s688">I don't know if everybody had...was in fact infested with lice; but that was the first thing that had to be.</span> <span id="s689">Because the Swiss said, "We have rules."</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q:How did they de-louse you?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A:They made us take baths, and de-loused us with sprays.</span> <span id="s692">But we were first... Before we entered into the country, you know, we were not permitted to kind of mingle with the world until we were properly handled.</span> <span id="s693">You know, we had to be decontaminated.</span> <span id="s694">You know, the Swiss are even perhaps more meticulous in their own ways than Germans are.</span> <span id="s695">Uh, from that point, uh we were then...then the story continues in terms of what we did, about...about uh what we did.</span> <span id="s696">But at least we were out of the camp.</span> <span id="s697">And this was in 194-...I say, January of '45, maybe February.</span> <span id="s698">But it may have been late December [1944].</span> <span id="s699">I don't know exactly the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q:This is a good point for us to change tapes.</span> <span id="s701">Just have a drink of water, and we'll go ahead and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A:Can I breathe now?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q:You can breathe . . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s704">TAPE #2 . . . Now one of the reasons she was able to survive and to be in fairly good health is she got up every morning and she, informationally it's interesting, so ask me some __________, I'll make a couple of additional comments about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q:Can we roll?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A:O.</span> <span id="s708">K., just give me a cue.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q:I would like to begin.</span> <span id="s710">OK.</span> <span id="s711">Good.</span> <span id="s712">Alright, good.</span> <span id="s713">Now we are rolling.</span> <span id="s714">So let's go back to Bergen-Belsen, and I'd like you to describe if there's any interaction, what were the officials like?</span> <span id="s715">How did they treat you?</span> <span id="s716">How did they seem to treat others?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A:Interaction with other inmates of the camp did not exist.</span> <span id="s718">I mean, in a sense--I don't know if I could ever prove this--but if you approached the fence too close, I'm not certain that... I would expect the orders were to shoot, from the turrets that were guarding.</span> <span id="s719">I don't know.</span> <span id="s720">Nobody ever was shot, because people knew.</span> <span id="s721">But there was no contact.</span> <span id="s722">The other reason there was no contact is my recollection is that the group right next to us, with whom you could have shouted across the fence, was a group from Poland; and there was no common language of communication.</span> <span id="s723">Hungarians may have spoken French and German, but probably not Polish--at least not most of them.</span> <span id="s724">I certainly didn't.</span> <span id="s725">So typically what kids would have done is talk to each other.</span> <span id="s726">If there had been kids there, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s727">But I don't have any recollection of any kids around.</span> <span id="s728">Our particular quadrant in the camp, our section, in the back there were woods, if you faced the entrance.</span> <span id="s729">On the left were this Polish group.</span> <span id="s730">On the right, I think was vacant.</span> <span id="s731">And the front was right off the main road.</span> <span id="s732">So really, we were not surrounded by people.</span> <span id="s733">Our contact with the outside world--and I don't know what contact there may have been by adults, who had the communication ability by some communication with the German command.</span> <span id="s734">Although I think it was quite limited; because nobody knew where, you know, what was going on, precisely where we were.</span> <span id="s735">Except, they had a sense.</span> <span id="s736">I mean, people had traveled around Europe knew that you go from Budapest in a certain direction for three and a half days, you're going to wind up in a certain area north of the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s737">I mean, that's easy enough.</span> <span id="s738">Remember, Bergen-Belsen did not exist.</span> <span id="s739">It's near a small village of Arendenheim (ph), or something like that.</span> <span id="s740">I mean, there's no such place before.</span> <span id="s741">Auschwitz was a tiny little Polish village that nobody ever paid attention to, until it became Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s742">Nobody would know where O_wi_cim--or something of that nature in Polish--where that community is.</span> <span id="s743">The camp itself.</span> <span id="s744">So contact with others in camp was really nil.</span> <span id="s745">With the wardens, with the jailers, there was a different contact.</span> <span id="s746">I remember leaving camp several times while we were there to go to the showers.</span> <span id="s747">Now, we talk about showers; we have to remember what showers represented.</span> <span id="s748">I certainly didn't know.</span> <span id="s749">But I wonder how many adults knew that when you enter showers, one of two things can happen.</span> <span id="s750">Water or gas.</span> <span id="s751">Because the major way of extermination was the Zyklon [B] gas that came out of shower pods.</span> <span id="s752">Shower heads.</span> <span id="s753">Again, in our case, that was not the situation.</span> <span id="s754">We were given certain sanitary privileges, because the only place you had hot water was in the showers.</span> <span id="s755">I mean, not inside the compound.</span> <span id="s756">It's cold, and they didn't want to bury the pipes deep enough so they wouldn't freeze.</span> <span id="s757">Cold water we had, I think, with some arrangement.</span> <span id="s758">No hot water.</span> <span id="s759">So uh we went to the showers at various intervals.</span> <span id="s760">I don't recall exactly when, but any number of times.</span> <span id="s761">That's the only time that we left the camp.</span> <span id="s762">The only time others left the camp was to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s763">And I'm sure some people did who were taken into the base hospital or to the camp hospital, and they came back.</span> <span id="s764">And the other contact was when people went out to bring in the food.</span> <span id="s765">Our people, as it happens, were kind of katty-corner, maybe a hundred yards from one of the camp kitchens.</span> <span id="s766">And the food was brought in in these large like 50-gallon vats.</span> <span id="s767">Because everything that we got was some kind of liquid.</span> <span id="s768">Some bread and some kind of soup-like thing and some kind of coffee-like thing.</span> <span id="s769">My only recollections of food that were brought into the camp were a type of soup, with whatever floated in it, a type of coffee, a type of, and bread.</span> <span id="s770">Water was, you know, water was available.</span> <span id="s771">And people were let out under guard to go across the street, uh, people from our camp, and to...I don't know, a dozen people, whatever.</span> <span id="s772">Whatever it took to carry these vats, and to bring to the camp and put in certain place; and people would line up, and this would be served by our people.</span> <span id="s773">Under the supervision of the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s774">Beyond that, the only contact was with the German troopers who would come to inspect, as I said, every day.</span> <span id="s775">Initially, we were told to line up at four o'clock in the morning, regardless of weather and regardless of what time they came.</span> <span id="s776">I remember there were, I remember, two...whatever their rank was, I don't what.</span> <span id="s777">Two folks who were in charge of the detail that would come.</span> <span id="s778">And I remember both of these in the winter; because I guess earlier I just, it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s779">We would be out there, and by this time the shoes that I described before that had been repaired, had not yet been repaired, maybe hadn't fallen apart yet.</span> <span id="s780">And here comes, through the camp gate, this small _______ line of several soldiers and several officer types with their black shiny boots up to their knees without a fleck on them.</span> <span id="s781">I think somebody was running behind them and cleaning the boots as they walked in the mud.</span> <span id="s782">And one was a great big, tall, unpleasant-looking fellow, and he was the one who said four o'clock every morning, and when they asked him, well, couldn't you give us an idea as when you might be by, based on your sequence, we would be out a half-hour before.</span> <span id="s783">He says, four o'clock every morning.</span> <span id="s784">I'm boss and you're nothing.</span> <span id="s785">He didn't realize he was boss over nothing.</span> <span id="s786">He was then replaced.</span> <span id="s787">Not because of our concern.</span> <span id="s788">He was rotated on a different job.</span> <span id="s789">And next comes a short guy.</span> <span id="s790">I just remember he was a short guy.</span> <span id="s791">Also shiny boots, and he met with whatever the camp, our group leadership was, and they made an agreement that said, look, I will be out every morning, let's say at eight o'clock, or whatever the time was.</span> <span id="s792">I don't care when you gather, but when I come to that gate, you folks be out there.</span> <span id="s793">You can be there a minute before, two days before, but when I get there, you be there.</span> <span id="s794">We thought that was a major human, or humane kind of an act.</span> <span id="s795">He did say that if every he comes and we're not ready - four o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s796">It worked.</span> <span id="s797">I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s798">I mean those kinds of, the sense of what a week was or a month was is difficult for me to reflect on.</span> <span id="s799">And one day as he was walking by, he saw a young woman standing and her feet were literally out of her shoes because they'd disintegrated.</span> <span id="s800">I mean the kind of decent city shoes were not made for the mud of the country.</span> <span id="s801">And after several weeks, they just wouldn't last very long.</span> <span id="s802">And he took a notice of it.</span> <span id="s803">Uh, the next day or the day after or whatever, as he came by, his assistant had a pair of shoes for the woman.</span> <span id="s804">Unfortunately, they were about eight sizes too small.</span> <span id="s805">I mean, I don't know eight sizes, but you know feet tend to swell when they're in, or maybe they had a little frostbite or whatnot, and they were too small.</span> <span id="s806">I think they made some arrangement and the shoes were enlarged, because we had a cobbler, but there's a certain sense of humanity even under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s807">And a sense of comedy as well.</span> <span id="s808">But order.</span> <span id="s809">As he came by to check, as he came by to check the people, standing outside, those who were unable to come outside, that were sick and what not, were permitted to stay in the barracks.</span> <span id="s810">And some other officer, sergeant-type, would walk down the barrack doors and check those.</span> <span id="s811">Well, some of these camp guards really didn't come from the elite of the German Air Force.</span> <span id="s812">They were locals in sense.</span> <span id="s813">In uniform.</span> <span id="s814">And we dubbed one of them "Popeye," because he smoked a pipe and he had kind of a jut jaw, and was Popeye.</span> <span id="s815">Popeye sometimes would skip walking through the barracks.</span> <span id="s816">When he discovered there was somebody in the barracks who spoke German, all he would do is shout inside, "Alles in ordnung?"</span> <span id="s817">And if the response was, "Alles in ordnung," he'd go on.</span> <span id="s818">As long as order was maintained, he was happy.</span> <span id="s819">And, they, a piece of comic relief if you will.</span> <span id="s820">I know this on the inside because when I had pneumonia, I was in the barracks in the bunks, and I heard this.</span> <span id="s821">And one of the people whose name I don't remember, she was a grandmother-type but of course to an eight-year old, anybody over 20 is a grandmother.</span> <span id="s822">She was the one who was in charge of the inside.</span> <span id="s823">Uh, the barracks were elongated, long things sectioned.</span> <span id="s824">So our section may have had, I don't know - 40, 50, 60 people, a hundred people.</span> <span id="s825">And she was in charge of getting the census for the inside people in that particular barrack.</span> <span id="s826">Uh, I stayed in the barrack with my mother and other mothers and their children.</span> <span id="s827">There were no men in that barracks, but we were, we had free access to the men in the group.</span> <span id="s828">My recollection, interestingly, is that the group was overwhelmingly female and children.</span> <span id="s829">Out of 1600, but I don't really know.</span> <span id="s830">I know there were husbands and wives and other kinds of things there, but they were separate latrines.</span> <span id="s831">I went to the men's latrine - I was a big boy.</span> <span id="s832">So some recollections about the camp and life and some elements of very peculiar humor and some elements of humanity.</span> <span id="s833">But this was all within the confines of lights, barbed wire, showers, food that is uh indescribable, and live machine guns and turrets that surrounded your place, and I didn't know at what point they would have started shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q:When you say the food was indescribable, uh I'm sure you mean it was delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A:I was, I would respond if I could in some humorous way of saying delicious for I mean somebody would like it, but I can't think of anybody.</span> <span id="s836">The food was, talk about the ability of the human to invent and to in some way overcome certain adversity.</span> <span id="s837">My recollection was as I said we had a certain kind of bread, which was alright, and some kind of a coffee and some kind of a soup, stew, something.</span> <span id="s838">It was always in big vats, it was always some kind of liquid that could be doled out with a ladle, and it was also always something swimming in it.</span> <span id="s839">Uh, how thin or how thick it was we never knew.</span> <span id="s840">We didn't know if horse meat or not, but it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s841">The invention of the Hungarian cook, Hungarians are known as good cooks I'm told, I recall.</span> <span id="s842">And the invention of people's need to, that is generally that people need to survive.</span> <span id="s843">Tremendous will.</span> <span id="s844">I guess the soup would be, people would drink the soup.</span> <span id="s845">It was warm.</span> <span id="s846">It was warmer than the cold water.</span> <span id="s847">And that was OK.</span> <span id="s848">Now I don't know what everybody did, everybody had their own inventions.</span> <span id="s849">Mother would fish the potatoes, if there were any in the soup, out of the soup.</span> <span id="s850">OK.</span> <span id="s851">And maybe some of the carrots, and make a kind of potato salad kind of thing which she would combine with a little bit of the chicken fat in the bottles that were packed months before.</span> <span id="s852">OK.</span> <span id="s853">There may have been some salt and pepper that we may have brought.</span> <span id="s854">That's easy to carry.</span> <span id="s855">And the bread, which was fine bread.</span> <span id="s856">I mean, European peasants don't know how to make bad bread.</span> <span id="s857">The problem with the bread was not very much of it.</span> <span id="s858">So people became experts at slicing bread, so paper-thin that you could probably read through it.</span> <span id="s859">So you had bread which was this thin, packed with this much of this potato salad laced with a little bit of chicken fat which had some taste to it, and that was a much better piece of food than whatever was floating in the vat.</span> <span id="s860">But every morsel of it was used.</span> <span id="s861">I personally have never had problems with being over-weight, but I have some pictures at home, directly after camp, and everyone one of my ribs are showing.</span> <span id="s862">I mean, I must have been as close to being, and I was not emaciated, I suppose.</span> <span id="s863">We ate.</span> <span id="s864">We were healthy.</span> <span id="s865">But I am certain that if we had had the kind of nourishment that we had and had been made to go to work everyday, people would have begun to drop like flies.</span> <span id="s866">So this was the food in camp.</span> <span id="s867">Now, we also had some care packages through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s868">I don't know whether once or twice while we were there, I don't recall.</span> <span id="s869">And some people brought certain things with them, and I'm sure people bartered back and forth with tins and what not.</span> <span id="s870">And I don't recall that bacon or salt pork or whatever it was that was taken was ever used.</span> <span id="s871">I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s872">But I knew, I do know that the bottle of honey and the bottle of fat lasted the length of camp.</span> <span id="s873">And I'm willing to bet if we had been in camp five years, it would have lasted the length of camp.</span> <span id="s874">Don't ask me how.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q:You had a smart mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s877">Yes.</span> <span id="s878">A strong lady.</span> <span id="s879">A strong lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q:Were you aware of feeling that it was a bad time, a difficult time, a challenging time, or how did you think about that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A:It was a restricting time.</span> <span id="s882">To the eight-year old, it mostly, the thing that bothered me is the fact that first of all I knew there was danger.</span> <span id="s883">I mean, I was told in so many ways that the march to the showers had some potential problems.</span> <span id="s884">And I was not either so naive nor so young that I didn't realize that uniforms and helmets and machine guns and search lights did not represent, you know, kindergarten attendance.</span> <span id="s885">It represented some sense of danger.</span> <span id="s886">I mean, I mean, eight-year olds know what guns are to the point that they realize that guns are made to shoot people, and when you get shot, you die.</span> <span id="s887">So the danger was there, and clearly, I don't want to make any mistake about it, the turrets were there, the lights were there, the guns were there, and the barbed wire was there.</span> <span id="s888">What I don't know, I don't remember, I don't think so, I don't think the wires were electrified.</span> <span id="s889">And if they were, they may have been at a very low voltage , maybe give you a bit of shock to let you know, hey, you don't touch.</span> <span id="s890">But maybe that wasn't even the case.</span> <span id="s891">So nobody would have gotten electrocuted necessarily from touching the wires, but you don't have to be electrocuted when there are machine guns and turrets at every corner of your compound.</span> <span id="s892">So a sense of danger was there, clearly.</span> <span id="s893">And a sense of restriction.</span> <span id="s894">An eight-year old is told, don't run.</span> <span id="s895">Well, what else can you do when you have nothing else.</span> <span id="s896">You don't really go to school, you really don't have a bicycle, you really can't go to the park.</span> <span id="s897">That what you do is you kind of play tag, and if you can't do that, you're restricted.</span> <span id="s898">And those restrictions are difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q:Is there anything else about the camp that you think you should say before we go on to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A:I would suspect that there might be many other things which I might recall tomorrow, but for the moment I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q:Were you aware that other people had a very hard time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A:In our group, or in other groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q:No, in the other groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A:Well, sure.</span> <span id="s905">Uh, every day we would see people marching.</span> <span id="s906">We were out there standing at four o'clock in the morning waiting for the uh, roll to be called.</span> <span id="s907">We saw people marching past our camp and then in the evening, while we were not out being counted, we saw people marching back.</span> <span id="s908">And they didn't look too happy.</span> <span id="s909">Although they were marching with, very easily with, in that particular community in that particular area, with what looked like farming implements.</span> <span id="s910">They may have been working in fields, or digging ditches or storm drains or things like that.</span> <span id="s911">But they did not seem very happy.</span> <span id="s912">They did not seem very pleased.</span> <span id="s913">And nobody was, you know, marching to the band, singing a song, going out, you know, to be in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q:Did they look healthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A:No.</span> <span id="s916">They looked... It's important, No.</span> <span id="s917">To me, it's important; and my recollection is that these people did not look like the Allies saw the Auschwitz inmates and Bergen-Belsen inmates six months later--by which [time] they had not been fed for months, literally, and they were working every day and they were, you know, the...the skeletons.</span> <span id="s918">They did not look like skeletons.</span> <span id="s919">But when people are malnourished to some degree--enough to stay alive, but not to be well--they look sallow, they looked deep-set eyes.</span> <span id="s920">I also have [the] recollection that an awful lot of people had their heads shaved.</span> <span id="s921">Now, maybe they did that for cleanliness purposes, for de-lousing purposes.</span> <span id="s922">It's easier to keep yourself clean when you don't have a lot of hair.</span> <span id="s923">Uh, and they were in uniforms of some sort, some kind of work uniform, like prison uniform kind of things.</span> <span id="s924">Not stripes, necessarily.</span> <span id="s925">And they did not look like happy campers.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q:Well, let's proceed to Switzerland again.</span> <span id="s927">Uh, where we left off, you had just been de-loused.</span> <span id="s928">Did you have your head shaved ?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s930">Uh, no.</span> <span id="s931">Not in camp, nor afterwards.</span> <span id="s932">I mentioned before it's my impression, or maybe just my wishful thinking because being lousy in that sense is a very uncomfortable notion.</span> <span id="s933">I'm not sure we had to be.</span> <span id="s934">I think we were very clean, because I recall people, clearly, washing themselves and cleaning themselves, and picking at themselves.</span> <span id="s935">And I saw the men in the men's latrines, picking hair out of the, examining the pubic areas and whatnot, or their other hairy areas to make sure that there's nothing there.</span> <span id="s936">People, since we didn't go to work, people had time to do that.</span> <span id="s937">And since we didn't go to work and had some food, we were probably in much better physical shape.</span> <span id="s938">And if we had some sores from cuts whatever, they probably healed more so than if we had had no, nothing in our bodies with which to in some way attempt to heal those wounds.</span> <span id="s939">I am sure that my mother checked me five times a day, and the little boy who was with us.</span> <span id="s940">But no, my head was not shaved.</span> <span id="s941">Uh although it would not have been unusual; because every summer my head used to be shaved, by choice.</span> <span id="s942">Sometimes my father and I both had our heads shaved.</span> <span id="s943">We were kind of bald eagles for a while.</span> <span id="s944">Today I wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s945">It is no longer a sense of pride.</span> <span id="s946">But we got to Switzerland, to Saint Gallen; and from Saint Gallen--which is in the German part of Switzerland--we were taken to a city, to a hotel in the village of Caux.</span> <span id="s947">And it's [spelled] C-A-U-X.</span> <span id="s948">Caux is a community directly above the city of Montreux, in the French part.</span> <span id="s949">There was a hotel whose name escapes me, and I just can't remember it.</span> <span id="s950">I've not been back there, but my parents had.</span> <span id="s951">It was a hotel that was taken over...over by the Red Cross, strictly as kind of a transition point for DP's; because DP's were coming into Switzerland from various places all the time, it being a neutral country.</span> <span id="s952">Uh, my recollection of the place...well, several recollections.</span> <span id="s953">It's in a beautiful... It's in the Alps, it's beautiful, it's gorgeous.</span> <span id="s954">I mean, it's wintertime and the snow; and the rooms are heated and the beds are clean.</span> <span id="s955">And...and you can go to the showers whenever you wish.</span> <span id="s956">And uh if you go to the bathroom, you can even have a sense of privacy.</span> <span id="s957">You know, they're not latrines.</span> <span id="s958">Lots of good things about it.</span> <span id="s959">But again, the Swiss are neat.</span> <span id="s960">Everybody knows about them, so.</span> <span id="s961">I think that we were fed for the two or three weeks a kind of stabilization, was potatoes.</span> <span id="s962">And everything else.</span> <span id="s963">The point was to in some way nourish us a little bit, to fatten us up just a little bit, so we would be a little bit stronger.</span> <span id="s964">By this time, my father knew where we were, 'cause he traced us both through the arrangement that were done through Customs of Hungary and the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s965">And my mother and father were in correspondence by mail, which was a little difficult only because the war was still on when we arrived.</span> <span id="s966">But through either direct or indirectly, I know that my mother made contact with an aunt of mine who lived in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s967">That was a later part of the story.</span> <span id="s968">That aunt is still alive--93 years old--my father's sister who sent us a care package.</span> <span id="s969">Among them, a pair of shoes; because I told him my shoes had kind of seen their last.</span> <span id="s970">I don't know whose shoes they were, but they were shoes that were large enough to put eight pairs of socks on, and really use them as skis.</span> <span id="s971">Not quite, but they kind of slid down the side of a mountain.</span> <span id="s972">And it was delightful; because, you see, this is the first time that the restriction of territory was no longer on me.</span> <span id="s973">I mean, not that I could go climb mountains, but if I wanted to be outside, I was outside.</span> <span id="s974">If I wanted to be inside, I could be inside.</span> <span id="s975">I didn't have to worry about not walking beyond the fifty foot perimeter of the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s976">So this was a..</span> <span id="s977">.</span> <span id="s978">a place where we had a chance to kind of truly R&amp;R, not as Bergen-Belsen was.</span> <span id="s979">And the idea was, at that point again, that the whatever--whether it was the World Zionist Congress, or arrangements with the Jewish Agency overseas, or elements of the underground, elements of political parties-- whoever was making the arrangements, they had to divide the people up to go to various places.</span> <span id="s980">Because people could not stay in this kind of transition hotel.</span> <span id="s981">Other people were coming in.</span> <span id="s982">My uncle, Uncle David, who was with me, went to be in some community in one part of Switzerland with his agemates, as you will.</span> <span id="s983">And they didn't know what to do with 20 Hungarian-speaking kids ages probably six to maybe fourteen who were in the group.</span> <span id="s984">And who either had single parents, or couldn't stay with their parents or something.</span> <span id="s985">So someone came up with a brilliant idea.</span> <span id="s986">Maybe what they should do is send this group of 20 kids to Heiden, which is... Heiden is a small village in Saint Gallen, or [Appenzell-Ausser Rhoden] province in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s987">And it was a children's camp for kind of displaced persons, displaced kids--Belgian, French.</span> <span id="s988">I don't even know if they were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s989">My mother had been a teacher.</span> <span id="s990">"Ah-ha!</span> <span id="s991">Why don't we sent Ella..."--my mother's name was Ella--"...with these children?</span> <span id="s992">At least she speaks the language."</span> <span id="s993">I mean, not too many people spoke Hungarian in central Europe outside of Hungary.</span> <span id="s994">It's still one of the most useless languages around.</span> <span id="s995">It's marvelous in Hungary, but no place else can you speak it; except in certain sections of Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s996">But my mother went with this group, these kids, to Heiden, and kind of ran a one-room school house in Hungarian for ages six to fourteen.</span> <span id="s997">The director of this home of several hundred kids was a man by the name of Paul Miller.</span> <span id="s998">Paul Miller later came to the States and directed a children's home in Philadelphia; and I had some reunions with him.</span> <span id="s999">He is now gone; but if he were alive, he would be 100.</span> <span id="s1000">Uh, a Swiss-French-Belgian Jew who did this for...this was his calling.</span> <span id="s1001">But I remember Paul Miller later.</span> <span id="s1002">And we spent some time in the camp, in the camp...in the children's home.</span> <span id="s1003">My mother was the teacher.</span> <span id="s1004">And that was uh...and that created its own problems; because being the teacher's son, no matter what went wrong, I was at fault.</span> <span id="s1005">You know, somebody ratted on the kid.</span> <span id="s1006">I did it.</span> <span id="s1007">But we survived.</span> <span id="s1008">I had my share of beatings at the time, but that was not the worst.</span> <span id="s1009">Now, I was with my mother; and of course, the little boy was with us still.</span> <span id="s1010">And we were in Heiden after the war ended, which in Europe ended on the 8th of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s1011">Coincidental with my 9th birthday.</span> <span id="s1012">'Cause I wanted, it ended on my birthday eve (?)</span> <span id="s1013">.</span> <span id="s1014">To this day I celebrate my birthday as the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1015">We were still in camp until September of that year.</span> <span id="s1016">And the...all I can say is the powers that be made the arrangements to...in fact, to make the decision to continue our way south.</span> <span id="s1017">And at this point, we are no longer displaced Palestinians in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1018">But we just had a place, what was going on; and by this time we knew what had happened, and what Auschwitz was, and who didn't come back and who did come back.</span> <span id="s1019">And who my father, who did come back, could find.</span> <span id="s1020">And where the brothers were; and not only that cousin of mine that was deported, but his parents.</span> <span id="s1021">And another brother, and another brother.</span> <span id="s1022">And my mother's family and her parents, and her sisters and her brothers, and where they were.</span> <span id="s1023">The decision was maybe...my mother's decision again was to not go back to Hungary, which my father said we can do; but to in fact continue to, at that time, Palestine, where we arrived in September of 1945 by British troop carrier.</span> <span id="s1024">We went by bus and by train and by truck from Switzerland to Taranto, which is in the boot of Italy.</span> <span id="s1025">It's a big port.</span> <span id="s1026">Awaited nearby in the city of Bari, again for several days, until transport was secured.</span> <span id="s1027">And a British troop carrier on its way to uh Egypt dropped us off at Haifa.</span> <span id="s1028">I don't mean just us.</span> <span id="s1029">I don't even know at this point how many of the 1600 were in that particular group.</span> <span id="s1030">Because some stayed in Switzerland, some went back to Hungary, some went elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1031">Time had gone by, and the war was over.</span> <span id="s1032">So people made various arrangements.</span> <span id="s1033">But I do know that my mother and the two boys--myself and this youngster--and my uncle were on that boat.</span> <span id="s1034">And we wound up in Palestine of those days in September of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q:You say...you say you began to talk about, to find about the fates of other people.</span> <span id="s1036">Did your mother talk to you about this?</span> <span id="s1037">Did you begin yourself to have a sense of what had really befallen others that you knew, that were related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A:No.</span> <span id="s1039">The history...again, the information, as I am able to relate it to you, was something I could understand very clearly.</span> <span id="s1040">I've said several times in this discussion that the missing piece--not missing.</span> <span id="s1041">Uh, the piece that was not there was the emotional scarring that would have been there had I understood what this meant.</span> <span id="s1042">But the information was there.</span> <span id="s1043">And, of course, I've learned other things since.</span> <span id="s1044">By the end of the war, the concept of Auschwitz, as I say, was clear.</span> <span id="s1045">And we knew...I'm trying to think; I think all members of my family who died--and not all died, but most of them did--in fact, were in Auschwitz or on their way to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1046">Or in labor camp.</span> <span id="s1047">And there was documentation as to when they got there, when they left, when the deportations took place, when they got to where they got, and the fact that they didn't make it out.</span> <span id="s1048">Example: My mother had two sisters.</span> <span id="s1049">There were three girls in the family.</span> <span id="s1050">The two sisters and their parents, my grandparents, were deported together--towards Auschwitz--with the daughter of one of those sisters.</span> <span id="s1051">At the camp, as we know, they were separated.</span> <span id="s1052">The daughter went this way, never to be seen again.</span> <span id="s1053">The grandparents went that [way], never to be seen again.</span> <span id="s1054">The two sisters went a third direction, and they survived the war.</span> <span id="s1055">The younger sister is alive in Israel.</span> <span id="s1056">The other one, the middle sister--my mother was the oldest--died two years ago in Israel, after a very productive and happy life.</span> <span id="s1057">I mean, she was _____; yes, second husband, and second family.</span> <span id="s1058">Because the husband didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1059">He died in labor camp.</span> <span id="s1060">But we had, at that point, a very clear understanding.</span> <span id="s1061">And uh my recollection of those is that this was an understanding of what happened, and an anger about what happened, and a concentration of energy towards what has to happen next.</span> <span id="s1062">Not a preservation of what has just happened.</span> <span id="s1063">We did not have the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1064">And my mother didn't demonstrate to me the need to now sit and sulk about what was.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean, sadness and all, yes.</span> <span id="s1066">But we all set to go ahead, because you couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, she was now in...in Palestine with two children.</span> <span id="s1068">And what do you do now?</span> <span id="s1069">She's here, she couldn't be a teacher.</span> <span id="s1070">She was 37 years old--which is certainly not old--and a very seasoned 37.</span> <span id="s1071">Typically, uh people in those days if they had uh... I mean, they had certain ideological kinds of commitments and connections.</span> <span id="s1072">They went into the collective settlements called kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s1073">A 37 year-old in a kibbutz is a veteran.</span> <span id="s1074">A serious veteran.</span> <span id="s1075">'Cause the average age is 26.</span> <span id="s1076">And she never trained for this.</span> <span id="s1077">She never had any skills in agricultural things.</span> <span id="s1078">What do you do?</span> <span id="s1079">Arrangement was made that she would be sent to a kibbutz not far from the city of Haifa, uh Kibbutz _______.</span> <span id="s1080">A very-well known kibbutz which was originally peopled by persons from Yugoslavia and from Hungary; so she could talk to them.</span> <span id="s1081">She didn't know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1082">She spoke Serb and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1083">That was good.</span> <span id="s1084">And they said to her, very simply--I'm not sure that this happened in a confrontational manner--"Look.</span> <span id="s1085">You have two children and yourself.</span> <span id="s1086">If you can in some way make yourself useful here and kind of earn your keep, no problem.</span> <span id="s1087">But if you can't, we can't keep you.</span> <span id="s1088">We can't feed three people without in some way some quid pro quo."</span> <span id="s1089">So she said, "Look.</span> <span id="s1090">I mean, I am healthy.</span> <span id="s1091">I'll do whatever you need to have to do."</span> <span id="s1092">So they assigned her to the place she could do least damage.</span> <span id="s1093">See if you pick fruit, you can damage fruit.</span> <span id="s1094">But nobody can damage an onion when you pull it out of the ground.</span> <span id="s1095">So she... END OF TAPE ...she was there.</span> <span id="s1096">I mean, she did that.</span> <span id="s1097">The boy, the other boy and I--Joash, or Ivan, and I--were in age by groups.</span> <span id="s1098">I was with the eight year-olds, and he was with the five year olds.</span> <span id="s1099">Or eight...or four year- olds, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1100">No, nine and five by then.</span> <span id="s1101">Because kids lived by age groups.</span> <span id="s1102">Not with their parents.</span> <span id="s1103">And, you know, I did my daily whatever.</span> <span id="s1104">I went to school, and did my chores and played with the kids; and he did this with his.</span> <span id="s1105">And sometime we'd see each other.</span> <span id="s1106">I'd see my mother as well.</span> <span id="s1107">But the interesting part of the kibbutz business was that at some point--fairly soon--for some reason I don't recall, there was a..</span> <span id="s1108">.</span> <span id="s1109">somebody was sick or they needed somebody to take a shift in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1110">And my mother was...uh I mean, she said she was really not indispensable in the onion-picking department.</span> <span id="s1111">Anybody could do that, the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1112">And they began to remark that the fact that the food improved.</span> <span id="s1113">Now, why?</span> <span id="s1114">I mean, she was a very fine cook.</span> <span id="s1115">She learned from her mother.</span> <span id="s1116">But the reason that her cooking made a difference was that uh she was perhaps the only woman, adult woman, in the kibbutz who had ever kept house.</span> <span id="s1117">The others went to various training courses and agricultural schools and what not--married or otherwise--and came as young people, maybe 18 or 19, to Israel...to Palestine, settled in the kibbutz and built the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1118">And housekeeping skills were never imparted to them.</span> <span id="s1119">I mean, think about it.</span> <span id="s1120">And material in those days did not come with instructions in the microwave, pre-seasoned.</span> <span id="s1121">So my mother was able to steal a little bit of margarine, put a little bit of salt in it, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1122">Two hundred people ate every day, and it made a difference.</span> <span id="s1123">And they thought they made this marvelous discovery.</span> <span id="s1124">She became the chief cook of the day shift, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1125">And they I think elected her to membership in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1126">And they probably would have... would have probably paved her way with gold had she permitted that.</span> <span id="s1127">She found a niche.</span> <span id="s1128">She found a legitimate kind of a value, and became a valued member of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1129">Now there was no problem about staying.</span> <span id="s1130">They offered her... A kibbutz elects its members, unless you come in from the very beginning; and they offered her election.</span> <span id="s1131">That didn't happen, for other reasons which probably created the first clear recollection of trauma in my life that I remember.</span> <span id="s1132">We were in the kibbutz from '45 to '46; and in the fall of '46, my father finally gets to Israel.</span> <span id="s1133">The whole story about what happens with him, that is much too detailed.</span> <span id="s1134">Let me simply say that he gets to Israel by an illegal immigration ship, and that story's known to people.</span> <span id="s1135">And his particular story is the story of the...of the uh two ships that came out of [La] Spezia.</span> <span id="s1136">And the only reason I mention that is that we know the kind of conglomerate and docu-history that the ______ puts in the book Exodus; and in that, there is a chapter about a hunger strike taking place in Cyprus, which was not in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1137">That takes place in [La] Spezia.</span> <span id="s1138">That's a fishing village in western Italy...north, northwestern Italy, where two boats are chartered.</span> <span id="s1139">The people are on board, and a British destroyer blocked the harbor.</span> <span id="s1140">The strike takes place; and these people, because of the particular position of the at that time Labor [Party] government in England, they are...the human cry of [a] 96- hour hunger strike is so large in the world they are permitted to go to Palestine with these boats under British escort, not under British guard.</span> <span id="s1141">So my father gets there without going through Cyprus, and without landing on the beach; and kind of walks off the ship kind of with [his] own two feet.</span> <span id="s1142">It's a whole other story.</span> <span id="s1143">His story is fascinating; but again, it's not the particular one I want to dwell on.</span> <span id="s1144">I told you before that my father is a cantor.</span> <span id="s1145">He comes out of an orthodox background.</span> <span id="s1146">He is ordained as a rabbi from three seminaries, or whatever; and certainly his life is a religious life, and his commitment is a traditional one.</span> <span id="s1147">The kibbutz is ideologically left...left in kibbutz, a left-wing kibbutz--HaShomer HaTzair--where God does not exist, and Judaism is a nation and it's a heritage, and it's a tradition.</span> <span id="s1148">And uh in the kibbutz, when Passover comes and we have a Passover seder, the Passover seder is all translated or transmuted or transposed into issues of nature.</span> <span id="s1149">The reason that plagues took place is because Moses was really a naturalist, and he could talk to animals and whatever else.</span> <span id="s1150">And everything is explained.</span> <span id="s1151">Now, I'm not going to debate the veracity of the explanations--both biblical, historical or left-wing.</span> <span id="s1152">But God does not exist, religion does not exist and historical incidents are described by some kind of natural agricultural settings.</span> <span id="s1153">That's OK.</span> <span id="s1154">Now, my father arrives at this kibbutz; and it's very clear this is not...not something he is really willing to do.</span> <span id="s1155">They would like to have him as a traveling music teacher.</span> <span id="s1156">He is educated in Vienna in music, and he could... They would give him either a horse or a car or bicycle--I don't know which--so he could travel to several of these group of kibbutzim and uh teach music, run choruses, lead an orchestra.</span> <span id="s1157">I mean, various kinds of musically-connected things, which under some circumstances would have been OK.</span> <span id="s1158">I mean, my mother had just become the chef.</span> <span id="s1159">It was not what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1160">He wanted to stay in his field; but beside the fact that he wanted to stay in his field, the living situation, the emotional conditions of a left-wing kibbutz, were adjustments my father was either unable but certainly unwilling to make.</span> <span id="s1161">He takes a position in Haifa, in a synagogue, as a cantor.</span> <span id="s1162">But that means we have to leave the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1163">Well, that was terribly traumatic for me.</span> <span id="s1164">I did not want to leave the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1165">I did not want to...I mean, I finally found a niche of some sort.</span> <span id="s1166">I mean, finally...I'm only nine years old.</span> <span id="s1167">But for the last three years... I mean, when you're four it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1168">When you're six, it begins to matter; and at that point my group sense disappears.</span> <span id="s1169">I finally was back in school.</span> <span id="s1170">My first grade was in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1171">Part of second grade was in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1172">Third grade was in Bergen-Belsen, if you want to call it school.</span> <span id="s1173">Fourth grade was in Israel.</span> <span id="s1174">I was learning a new language, of course, my third language of school.</span> <span id="s1175">But I was very upset.</span> <span id="s1176">I thought the kibbutz was neat.</span> <span id="s1177">It was a life that I had not been familiar with, but became accustomed to.</span> <span id="s1178">Certain cultural things ________________ _______ this and that.</span> <span id="s1179">A process so there's a certain macho, a legitimate macho, which made a lot of sense.</span> <span id="s1180">It was outdoors, it was nice.</span> <span id="s1181">I was no longer segregated in some ways.</span> <span id="s1182">I was shocked a few times.</span> <span id="s1183">First day I get to the kibbutz, I'm nine years old and I was assigned to a room, you know.</span> <span id="s1184">I think there were three or four kids in a room--four corners, four beds, and shelves and desks and stuff.</span> <span id="s1185">And I think I wanted either to wash up or take a shower or something, and saw no problem.</span> <span id="s1186">Now this is very nice indoor facilities; very nice, a stucco building, heated, but not air-conditioned.</span> <span id="s1187">Maybe not even heated, there was not...no need.</span> <span id="s1188">And I walk in, and there were girls there taking showers.</span> <span id="s1189">Now, I knew what I saw; a little bit about girls, probably more than other nine year olds do.</span> <span id="s1190">I learned a lot in the children's home, when we were in a group of six and fourteen year-olds.</span> <span id="s1191">And fourteen year-olds in their pubescent kind of interest are different than a six year-old; and I probably learned more than my age would permit.</span> <span id="s1192">But I had never seen girls, and I certainly never showered with girls.</span> <span id="s1193">I mean, my notion was that boys showered and girls showered, and not together.</span> <span id="s1194">And this is not because of the free love and all that nonsense about kibbutz life.</span> <span id="s1195">I mean, kibbutz life was fine.</span> <span id="s1196">I just wasn't used to it.</span> <span id="s1197">They just came to the very pragmatic decision of who the hell needs separate showers.</span> <span id="s1198">I mean, two sets of facilities for boys and girls age nine.</span> <span id="s1199">OK.</span> <span id="s1200">If I remember, kind of making a bee-line and running as fast as I knew how out of that room; and I remember screaming, I left my towel somewhere.</span> <span id="s1201">I was going to get my towel.</span> <span id="s1202">I was acting embarrassed out of...out of my skin.</span> <span id="s1203">I got used to it.</span> <span id="s1204">The second time it was OK.</span> <span id="s1205">But it was __________.</span> <span id="s1206">I mean, this is not a major sexual traumatic experience.</span> <span id="s1207">It was just a difference in style.</span> <span id="s1208">I had no sisters.</span> <span id="s1209">Uh I just didn't shower with girls 'cause I'd never done that before.</span> <span id="s1210">Maybe since, but not before.</span> <span id="s1211">And uh this was the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1212">But we leave the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1213">We go to Haifa.</span> <span id="s1214">OK.</span> <span id="s1215">I adjusted to it in some ways.</span> <span id="s1216">Even my father didn't.</span> <span id="s1217">My father had a sister in this country, who he had not seen in 35 years--the only remaining sibling except for his brother, David, who survived the camp.</span> <span id="s1218">He was still alive.</span> <span id="s1219">His sister came out in 1914, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1220">As a youngster, as a young woman of 18 or so, to find her future in the country which was the land of milk and honey, and the streets were paved with gold.</span> <span id="s1221">She did OK.</span> <span id="s1222">Came visit her.</span> <span id="s1223">His pangs for family were strong enough, and we were able to do that.</span> <span id="s1224">I also think that he also came here to see what the world was about.</span> <span id="s1225">The cantor business in--by this time, not still in Palestine--was not particularly booming, because every immigrant who had ever gone to Yeshiva or to a cheder or anyplace could do it.</span> <span id="s1226">And there was no need for star-quality cantors.</span> <span id="s1227">And my father was that.</span> <span id="s1228">And that's why he had various positions on his way to his Metropolitan Opera, namely the [Doromboh (ph)] Temple in Budapest, which was really a star-attraction place.</span> <span id="s1229">He came to the States, came to Philly, was able to make some arrangements; and wrote to my mother and said, "What I want you to do is..." He always did this.</span> <span id="s1230">He left, and then he told us to pack up and come.</span> <span id="s1231">But that's not important.</span> <span id="s1232">And we came to the States.</span> <span id="s1233">We arrived...my mother and I arrived here in March of...March the 9th, 1949.</span> <span id="s1234">Lived in New York for a year, and moved to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1235">Grew up in Philadelphia, and the rest is current history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q:I'm curious what the reunion of your mother and father was in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1237">Do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A:Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1239">I recall it particularly, because there was some... some concern.</span> <span id="s1240">My mother come to this kibbutz, and uh I don't remember at this point anymore.</span> <span id="s1241">Look, it's also forty some years ago.</span> <span id="s1242">Although I have a fairly good recollection, some details escape.</span> <span id="s1243">I have no recollection of whether or not she knew any of the members of the kibbutz from her hometown, or maybe from school days, or through family.</span> <span id="s1244">Perhaps she did.</span> <span id="s1245">But she made friends with several of them.</span> <span id="s1246">I mean, you know, you have different levels of friendships.</span> <span id="s1247">And I recall that my uncle--Uncle David again--came, who was in a different kibbutz, uh came to our kibbutz to _________ one day and I, I'm sure I asked him why he came and I'm sure he gave me some reason.</span> <span id="s1248">I asked my mother why he came.</span> <span id="s1249">I'm sure she gave me some reason.</span> <span id="s1250">But between the lines there was some other expression, maybe from some other people, kids or whatever.</span> <span id="s1251">That he came really to talk with my mother because there had been some rumors that maybe she and some of these other kibbutz people were in some way establishing a relationship that would compromise my father.</span> <span id="s1252">Now, I never asked my mother if she did that.</span> <span id="s1253">I wouldn't dare.</span> <span id="s1254">But I knew my mother.</span> <span id="s1255">My mother was a uh very strong and very committed woman.</span> <span id="s1256">So even though this stuff was going on, I'm sure this was hot air.</span> <span id="s1257">My mother was a very attractive woman, 37 years old, and I'm sure there may have been some notion that said, look, if she were available, I'd be delighted to, and someone may have interest.</span> <span id="s1258">But I don't think that she expressed that.</span> <span id="s1259">So when my father came, their reunion, I have two recollections of it.</span> <span id="s1260">One, and I don't mean the specific moment.</span> <span id="s1261">When my father arrived at camp, at the kibbutz, I was not there.</span> <span id="s1262">I had taken an excursion, maybe in an attempt to avoid, I didn't know who the hell I was going to meet.</span> <span id="s1263">I hardly knew the man, in a sense.</span> <span id="s1264">But their reunion was one very instantaneous and very warm.</span> <span id="s1265">And soon too raised a major issue.</span> <span id="s1266">My mother also did not want to leave the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1267">She found a home.</span> <span id="s1268">But my mother understood that she had made a commitment and a lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1269">She also came from a traditional home, but she was not professionally traditional.</span> <span id="s1270">I mean, my father was, that was his livelihood.</span> <span id="s1271">And she made an adjustment for that.</span> <span id="s1272">And she was willing to leave the kibbutz, but the initial reaction was very instantaneous.</span> <span id="s1273">We want to remember that the kind of separations during the war in Europe did not permit you perhaps to separate.</span> <span id="s1274">Your mind was full, your emotions were full, your ______ may have been full of, or maybe somebody just away.</span> <span id="s1275">There is no human being alive that overcame any separation pangs, so the reunion was not one of a reunion having come out of a POW camp without communication for five years.</span> <span id="s1276">And secondly, there, well, they had been apart for two years, the better part of two years.</span> <span id="s1277">But the reunion, my recollection was very smooth.</span> <span id="s1278">The readjustment was very smooth.</span> <span id="s1279">One hitch.</span> <span id="s1280">Leaving the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1281">How big a hitch it was I don't know.</span> <span id="s1282">I think it was a much more dramatic and traumatic for me than it was for my mother.</span> <span id="s1283">Cause she understood.</span> <span id="s1284">My mother had a certain sense of duty, and she knew it.</span> <span id="s1285">She had been the cantor's wife before.</span> <span id="s1286">She would be that again.</span> <span id="s1287">But she did express it would be nice maybe to not, but I know I can't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q:But for you, you had finally found some . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A:I found age-mates, a group.</span> <span id="s1290">I was part of the, I think I recall.</span> <span id="s1291">The groups had names.</span> <span id="s1292">We were the Oak Group, the whatever eight, nine year, the fourth-graders or so were the Oak Group.</span> <span id="s1293">I don't remember what the youngster who was with us was in.</span> <span id="s1294">It was a different group.</span> <span id="s1295">But I thought that was terrific.</span> <span id="s1296">Twenty kids, boys and girls, you know, a class-size, dorm-size, a cohesive group with some good kids, bad kids, smart kids, dumb kids, fat kids, skinny kids.</span> <span id="s1297">It was a very nice group.</span> <span id="s1298">It was a perfect kind of a little tiny universe in which I could live.</span> <span id="s1299">And it's the first universe I had after some non-universes.</span> <span id="s1300">I remember the most previous experience was for eight months in Switzerland, being the representative eight year old in a group of six to fourteen.</span> <span id="s1301">We had no age mates.</span> <span id="s1302">And my mother was a teacher and that raised hackles with some people.</span> <span id="s1303">And you know, by others, uh.</span> <span id="s1304">A tiny digression, I recall one of the kids, one of the ogler kids whose face I recall but not his name, for some reason, he, somebody came to visit me, and he accompanied me back to the village, off-campus which was against the rules.</span> <span id="s1305">He was punished in some fashion, not corporal punishment, but punished for walking off campus without letting someone know.</span> <span id="s1306">He probably could have gotten permission to walk back to the village, I don't know, twenty minutes away.</span> <span id="s1307">So he could take the train back.</span> <span id="s1308">But he didn't tell anybody, so he was missed.</span> <span id="s1309">When he came back, he was pulled on the carpet by Mr. Miller.</span> <span id="s1310">Guess who had lumps on his back the next morning for having ratted on him?</span> <span id="s1311">But after all, if everybody got ratted on, the teacher's kid must have done it.</span> <span id="s1312">It wasn't all bad, but I'm saying these are the negative elements.</span> <span id="s1313">So that was not a very kind of a cohesive group for me to be in.</span> <span id="s1314">Not only because I was the teacher's kid, but I was also the only eight year old.</span> <span id="s1315">I don't recall another eight year old in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q:I would think it would have been hard that you wouldn't be able to talk to kids of you own age, to figure out your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A:That's what I did in Israel.</span> <span id="s1318">Now, in Israel incidentally, or Palestine in those days, most of the kids were not Holocaust kids.</span> <span id="s1319">They're natives.</span> <span id="s1320">Well, if you think about it, the people, the kibbutz had been established perhaps ten years before, maybe twelve.</span> <span id="s1321">Eighteen, nineteen year olds got to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1322">In their early twenties were child-bearing.</span> <span id="s1323">Their children would be anywhere from age zero to maybe twelve, fourteen, thirteen.</span> <span id="s1324">And in those days the kibbutz did not keep the kids in the kibbutz I think past fourteen.</span> <span id="s1325">If I recall, they would gather them in an intermediate or high school setting where several kibbutzim would bring the kids together and really live away from home.</span> <span id="s1326">So 9 year-olds were perfectly appropriate in the age range on the kibbutz on a parental life.</span> <span id="s1327">And I finally found a group, although it was a group that I had to adjust to and they had to adjust to me.</span> <span id="s1328">I didn't speak Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1329">They did.</span> <span id="s1330">I wasn't really much of an outdoorsman or agriculturalist.</span> <span id="s1331">Interesting difference.</span> <span id="s1332">Most of the kids most of the summer ran around barefoot.</span> <span id="s1333">Now, they had shoes and sandals; but they ran around barefoot.</span> <span id="s1334">And when you do that, you can run on anything.</span> <span id="s1335">Broken glass.</span> <span id="s1336">You develop a callus on the bottom of your feet.</span> <span id="s1337">This one didn't, because he'd never done it before.</span> <span id="s1338">And he looked like a ninety year-old man walking on the street, trying to make street, on the roads, trying to make sure that he avoids anything that could possibly... And I really was the loner used to ____ develop callused feet.</span> <span id="s1339">I mean, I got better at it; but I wore sandals most of the time.</span> <span id="s1340">But when people went into...into the swimming pool--yes, we had a swimming pool--I had to take my shoes off, and they didn't.</span> <span id="s1341">I mean, there were a certain difference.</span> <span id="s1342">But those were...those are reconcilable differences, not irreconcilable differences.</span> <span id="s1343">And I found a group, and I had to leave.</span> <span id="s1344">And that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1345">Now what it did to me, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q:In your group of friends, were there other children from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A:I said a minute ago that I think most of those kids were native born, or Israelis.</span> <span id="s1348">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1349">Truly, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q:Let's cross the ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A:Let me just think back.</span> <span id="s1352">I do recall some kids who were there, but they were European-born but not Holocaust kids.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean, they had gotten there before the war, like in '39; or their parents did.</span> <span id="s1354">So they may have...'39, yeah, they may have been two when they arrived, three or four.</span> <span id="s1355">And they were not Holo...they were European, not Israeli-born.</span> <span id="s1356">But not Holocaust victims.</span> <span id="s1357">And there's a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q:But you were unique in your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A:I don't know if I was unique, maybe there was another one.</span> <span id="s1360">I certainly...in the kibbutz there must have been somebody else.</span> <span id="s1361">I mean, there was the kid that was with us; but I don't have any recollection of another kid.</span> <span id="s1362">I may have in some way just decided to block that out, or I just plain don't remember.</span> <span id="s1363">That's also possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q:Because you're so old now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A:Older than I was then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q:Shall we cross the ocean, and remember how you came to the United States and what you went though?</span> <span id="s1367">I'm curious if you had to go through any processing, ______________ papers.</span> <span id="s1368">Did you have to present documents?</span> <span id="s1369">What did you go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A:Well, I can dispose of that very quickly, because I came in as a non-quota immigrant.</span> <span id="s1371">The laws of the land, the immigration laws, none of that was, the __________________ or whatever the laws were at that time, is that certain clergy can come in without waiting for quotas.</span> <span id="s1372">My father, being ordained and holding a position in New York as the cantor of the congregation and as the associate rabbi as well, was permitted ...when he came here he was permitted to enter non-quota.</span> <span id="s1373">Which physically meant he had to go to Niagara Falls, which was the closest Canadian, non-American, point to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1374">Went to Niagara Falls, crossed the bridge, walked back.</span> <span id="s1375">He entered the country non-quota.</span> <span id="s1376">As a consequence, his family didn't go through any processing.</span> <span id="s1377">We arrived by plane.</span> <span id="s1378">1949.</span> <span id="s1379">Left Palestine--at that time Israel--left Haifa in, on March the 6th, 1949.</span> <span id="s1380">Flew from a British military airport near Haifa by some two-engine plane to land in the Sahara.</span> <span id="s1381">I remember a man carrying out two pails, two buckets.</span> <span id="s1382">Those were the slop buckets.</span> <span id="s1383">This was a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1384">These were like DC-3 type planes.</span> <span id="s1385">We landed in Tunis.</span> <span id="s1386">We spent a night in Tunis, or several hours in Tunis.</span> <span id="s1387">We landed in Nice.</span> <span id="s1388">We landed in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1389">In Brussels, we spent the night I know for sure.</span> <span id="s1390">And transferred to a..</span> <span id="s1391">.</span> <span id="s1392">to then ocean-going airplanes - the Constellations.</span> <span id="s1393">They were very interesting planes, these sway-back things that TWA used to run.</span> <span id="s1394">But this was not TWA.</span> <span id="s1395">This was the Sabena, the British [NB: Belgian] airlines.</span> <span id="s1396">The first leg was the British, not British, the Belgian airlines.</span> <span id="s1397">The first leg was run by [Kobata (ph)], which at that time was their inland short route; puddle-jumping from, you know, from Haifa to Sahara to Tunis to Nice to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1398">Uh, spent the day in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1399">I have not been to Brussels since.</span> <span id="s1400">Will one of these days.</span> <span id="s1401">My mother bought a piece of lace, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1402">I mean, after all, in Brussels you have to do that.</span> <span id="s1403">And uh neither of us had ever flown before, of course.</span> <span id="s1404">Neither my mother or I. I mean, in 1949, the air travel was not as prevalent.</span> <span id="s1405">And I am always amazed to find that today, a very small percentage, proportion of the population, has never flown.</span> <span id="s1406">There are lots of people who haven't today, in the States.</span> <span id="s1407">Well, brave people that we were, it was the fastest way to come.</span> <span id="s1408">We got on the Constellation, went from Brussels to Shannon.</span> <span id="s1409">In Shannon, one of the radios went kaflooey.</span> <span id="s1410">And we sat in Shannon for several hours; because the captain--and I remember him, he was a short gentlemen, a Belgian I guess--who came and announced to the passengers that he will not take off without that particular piece of equipment.</span> <span id="s1411">We said we agreed, although we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1412">But we agreed.</span> <span id="s1413">Landed in Gander.</span> <span id="s1414">I mean, typical trans-Atlantic crossings; and those were from someplace--Brussels, London, something--often to Shannon.</span> <span id="s1415">Shannon-Gander was the trans-Atlantic piece to Newfoundland.</span> <span id="s1416">And then, Gander to Idlewild--not John F. Kennedy--in New York, where my father and my aunt and my uncle waited for us.</span> <span id="s1417">And I don't know, by bus, by taxi, by something went to Penn Central Station.</span> <span id="s1418">Then took the Pennsylvania Railroad--which still existed in those days--non-stop to Newark, non-stop to Trenton and non-stop to Philadelphia; from which we went by cab probably to...from that was the North Philadelphia Station to 2533 North Douglas Street, my aunt's house.</span> <span id="s1419">And we had arrived.</span> <span id="s1420">But no processing at all.</span> <span id="s1421">No hoops to run through.</span> <span id="s1422">I mean, just...I mean, immigration and customs; but you do that today, too, if you go overseas.</span> <span id="s1423">And that was not...nothing, no DP, no stock-pile, I mean no Ellis Island type things.</span> <span id="s1424">None.</span> <span id="s1425">And no de-lousing.</span> <span id="s1426">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q:That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s1428">We have about three minutes.</span> <span id="s1429">You can, if there's anything you can think that you want to say in that remaining time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A:Well, perhaps it's an interest of mine which is not just personal, but I think that part of the reason for doing this tape is to enrich history in tiny ways.</span> <span id="s1431">Because it's important for people to look at this tape and to look at other tapes and make sure that all the history that's possible, that possibly can be captured is captured.</span> <span id="s1432">Because although I am one of the youngest people that I know that went though this particular experience, the people who were there at this point are getting to be fewer and fewer in between.</span> <span id="s1433">And each story is unique.</span> <span id="s1434">Not all of the stories are valuable.</span> <span id="s1435">Not all of them are interesting.</span> <span id="s1436">Not all of them are noteworthy, but all should be recaptured in some way because you never know what kind of mosaic you want to put together and what piece of total information you get from this particular tape.</span> <span id="s1437">Let the scholars determine what is important and what is not.</span> <span id="s1438">But let's take whatever care we can to at least capture.</span> <span id="s1439">The technology is there to do it.</span> <span id="s1440">Wouldn't it be nice to have a videotape of the Civil War?</span> <span id="s1441">We can stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q:Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A:It was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q:You certainly did a beautiful job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">The yellow star was introduced in Hungary on March 29, 1944.</span> <span id="s1447">Mr. Mandel was wearing the star when he was 8 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Rezsö Kasztner was a Labor Zionist activist from Cluj who became the guiding spirit of the Zionist movement's Relief and Rescue Committee of Budapest in 1943.</span> <span id="s1449">Kasztner apparently believed negotiation was the only avenue for the rescue of Hungarian Jews, and sent Joel Brand to negotiate with Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1450">When Brand was detained by the British, Kasztner and Brand's wife took over the negotiations with Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Slovak: U_horod.</span> <span id="s1452">City located in what is now the Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR.</span> <span id="s1453">This area, then known as Carpathian Ruthenia, was part of the Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 and 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Ger: Sankt Gallen, or Fr: Saint Gall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Novel by Leon Uris concerning the ship of that name, which illegally delivered a group of Jewish Holocaust survivors to British-controlled Palestine in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Airport in Newfoundland, Canada.</span> <span id="s1457">Prior to the introduction of the jet engine, all trans-Atlantic flights had to stop either here or at Shannon to refuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0147 page \* arabic55</span></p></body></html>
