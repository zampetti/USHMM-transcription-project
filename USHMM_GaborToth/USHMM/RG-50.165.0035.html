<p><span id="s11">July 2, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">RG: I was born in Zloczow, Poland.</span> <span id="s13">I had one sister who died in the war.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in the 1920s.</span> <span id="s15">I went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s16">I hid during the war with Gentiles.</span> <span id="s17">They were paid to do so, My family was religious but not Hasidic.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">WH: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">IG: 1925.</span> <span id="s20">I was in DP camps after the war——Linz, Regensberg.</span> <span id="s21">I was in concentration camps- Mauthausen and also labor camps.</span> <span id="s22">I was born in Dombrova, Poland.</span> <span id="s23">My parents were killed.</span> <span id="s24">I didn't go far in school because I had to work.</span> <span id="s25">I was 14 when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WH: When did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">RG: In 1949 on the General Hahn.</span> <span id="s28">It took about 10 days.</span> <span id="s29">We came to Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WH: What gave you the faith that you would make it in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">IG: We were young and ambitious.</span> <span id="s32">Why shouldn't we?</span> <span id="s33">It's a land of opportunity.</span> <span id="s34">I have to tell you, when we came into Boston, everybody got a cardboard and in it was two eggs, an apple, an orange, cookies and a dollar.</span> <span id="s35">It was the second day of Passover.</span> <span id="s36">It came from HIAS.</span> <span id="s37">On the dollar was written something like "Good luck in the U.S." I bought some ham sandwiches with the two dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">RG: When we came to Grand Central Station my aunt and uncle and grandparents greeted us.</span> <span id="s39">We lived at first on Alabama Ave in East New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">WH: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">IG: Within two weeks I had a job in a dress shop doing everything — from a floor boy to a foreman.</span> <span id="s42">But then I heard about the chicken farms in Vineland.</span> <span id="s43">If you didn't have a trade it was a sure dollar.</span> <span id="s44">If you have 4,000 chickens you make a profit.</span> <span id="s45">You learn as you work.</span> <span id="s46">The JAS lent you some money but it wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s47">You had to have some money of your own or you couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s48">We came here to the Catskills for a two week vacation and were looking at farms</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">IG: Because we figured we'd settle down on a farm.</span> <span id="s51">Even though I'd never seen a farm or been a on a farm, I heard from my friends who went into farming in Freehold and Vineland.....</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: So why didn't you go to Vineland?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">IG: Because we were here already and we liked the climate.</span> <span id="s54">Here there was more land to buy, you could buy hundreds of acres.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: So why didn't more from Vineland come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">IG: They didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s57">Jersey was the style.</span> <span id="s58">And since more people were there you needed more money to go there and we didn't have that much money.</span> <span id="s59">And it was better than an apartment in the city because when you buy a farm you have already a house, and the chickens laid already eggs and with a couple of cows I'll have milk and cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">WH: But you didn't even know how to milk a cow!</span></p> <p><span id="s61">IG: You learn.</span> <span id="s62">At first I had more milk in my sleeve than in the pail when I was milking the cow.</span> <span id="s63">My hands swelled up the first couple days.</span> <span id="s64">They showed me how ----you pull and you squeeze and you pull and you squeeze.</span> <span id="s65">For him it was easy.</span> <span id="s66">He doin it for 20 years.</span> <span id="s67">But I learned.</span> <span id="s68">First, we bought a farm in Woodbourne later it became Jacoby Bungalow Colony.</span> <span id="s69">We bought the farm for 39,000 dollars and put down around twelve.</span> <span id="s70">We borrowed it, plus we had about $1,500 saved up.</span> <span id="s71">But we didn't make a go of it because I didn't care for the cows.</span> <span id="s72">You had to get up 4;00 A.M.</span> <span id="s73">So after seven months we sold it.</span> <span id="s74">Then we bought a chicken farm with 1,500 chickens.</span> <span id="s75">We did very well, sold eggs to the children's camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">RG: We raised two lovely daughters, one's a lawyer, married, The other daughter is married and works for Eastman Kodak in Rochester.</span> <span id="s77">But this husband's not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">IG: When we came here there were about 300 farms.</span> <span id="s79">But with diseases and recession, they all went by the wayside and closed up.</span> <span id="s80">This was in 1958,1959.</span> <span id="s81">But we stuck with it; we wouldn't give up.</span> <span id="s82">We didn't have where to go.</span> <span id="s83">Some of the others had trades----one was a butcher and another was a baker.</span> <span id="s84">A third one was in his 70s and figured he'd had enough.</span> <span id="s85">But the bank decided we were worthy and gave us credit and we kept on expanding.</span> <span id="s86">We were the first with cages.</span> <span id="s87">But then, after three heart attacks I fell behind.</span> <span id="s88">But we had 260,000 chickens.</span> <span id="s89">And we owed nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: Are you religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">IG: No but I belong to a shul in White Lake.</span> <span id="s92">Regina was president of the sisterhood for ten years.</span> <span id="s93">I was on the board.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: Where your daughters went to school in White Lake, what percent were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">IG: Maybe two percent.</span> <span id="s96">But in Monticello was already 50-50, in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">But you should know that basically, the egg farm is more a business than real farming.</span> <span id="s98">And you don't get subsidies like you do with wheat, corn, or milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WH: Did any of your children’s' friends ever say anything about their being children of refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">RG: Not refugees, but they sometimes made anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s101">One day, my older daughter came home from school in White Lake and said: ‘Mommy, nobody likes me.’</span> <span id="s102">She was 9 or 10 then.</span> <span id="s103">I found out the children were jealous because she was a very good student.</span> <span id="s104">So I told her ‘You don't have to tell all the answers.</span> <span id="s105">Keep it to yourself.’</span> <span id="s106">But in Monticello this wasn't a problem.</span> <span id="s107">She had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: Since this was a pretty hard life, did you ever ask yourself: 'For this we survived?</span> <span id="s109">To have such a hard life here?’</span></p> <p><span id="s110">RG: To tell you the truth, we were too busy with the farm to even think about it.</span> <span id="s111">But I do remember people who sold their farms and went back to New York City, used to come visit us and I was like a second rate person to them.</span> <span id="s112">They used to say: 'How could you stay behind here?</span> <span id="s113">Working like a dog.'</span> <span id="s114">I said: 'I have the same as you, TV, radio and I know exactly what's going on in the world like you do.</span> <span id="s115">My children are very well read because there's nothing else to do here, just to pick up books in the library.'</span> <span id="s116">We went to movies here.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: How many other survivors came to this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">IG: After the war, maybe 50 or 60.</span> <span id="s119">But we had no special group.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WH: Weren't these the people that you would have been most comfortable with?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">IG: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s122">We were mostly comfortable with American people.</span> <span id="s123">Because the war, I don't remember nothing and don't wanna remember nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">RG: We try to block it out (Maybe there's a personality type who settles there.)</span></p> <p><span id="s125">IG: We had both Jewish and Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s126">We didn't want to listen to all the stories about the war; how everybody was a millionaire, they all was rich, they all came from Warsaw or Cracow.</span> <span id="s127">I came from a small town and we were very poor and many times I went to sleep hungry, many, many nights.</span> <span id="s128">I had to work as a kid.</span> <span id="s129">What I noticed is the older generation, those who were in their late 20s and 30s when it happened, they like to talk about it (Could be)</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH: Did you know Jacubowicz?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">IG: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">He-was a shlemiel.</span> <span id="s133">He ran into New York to sell eggs, he made $200.00.</span> <span id="s134">But while he was there, the pipes on the farm froze, the chickens went into a moult and start laying eggs and he was out $4,000.00.</span> <span id="s135">That's what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">IG: The chicken farm is a business.</span> <span id="s137">If you don't know business, you can't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">WH: Is there a difference between survivors you meet from N.Y. and yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">RG: Yeh.</span> <span id="s140">Most of them are show-offs.</span> <span id="s141">They just want to play cards.</span> <span id="s142">We can't socialize with them in Florida because everybody plays cards.</span> <span id="s143">They tried to prove something, but you can't cover up with the jewelry, but you can't if there's nothing beneath it.</span> <span id="s144">You understand what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">RG: They didn't have the upbringing.</span> <span id="s147">They were prust (no class).</span> <span id="s148">We also tried to prove ourselves here.</span> <span id="s149">And it took a long time till they accepted us here in the community, in the shul.</span> <span id="s150">At first people wouldn't give us a tumble.</span> <span id="s151">We were the only European-born members.</span> <span id="s152">I joined the knitting club in the beginning and invited them to my home.</span> <span id="s153">But they never showed up.</span> <span id="s154">So naturally I never came again.</span> <span id="s155">If I wasn't good enough to for them to come to me, so don't do me no favor, invite me to your house.</span> <span id="s156">But later they accepted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: Who are your close friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">IG: I have only one close friend now for forty years, my wife.</span> <span id="s159">The others I consider acquaintances.</span> <span id="s160">And certainly not the refugees.</span> <span id="s161">because .</span> <span id="s162">with them is always jealousies.</span> <span id="s163">One has more money and my daughter married this one.</span> <span id="s164">I see when I'm in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: Did you feel people didn't trust you because you came from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">RG: In the beginning, people asked: 'How did they survive?</span> <span id="s167">What did they have to do?’</span> <span id="s168">Well, Irving survived because one day the Germans were gone; I survived because I was hiding, a third was a partisan.</span> <span id="s169">But the people here just didn't understand.</span> <span id="s170">Just like itl s useless to tell them what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WH: How did you feel when you visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">RG: I was reading The Source and when I came to Israel and saw what they had accomplished, I felt very guilty that I hadn't gone there when they were struggling.</span> <span id="s173">If I had gone then from Vienna I would have been on a kibbutz or something and I would have been very useful.</span> <span id="s174">But we support Israel.</span> <span id="s175">We give to anyone who asks for Israel.</span> <span id="s176">And we found the Israelis very friendly, very nice when we were over there.</span> <span id="s177">We loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: What achievement are you most proud of in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">IG: When I met my wife.</span> <span id="s180">This is my pride and joy.</span> <span id="s181">And I have two wonderful daughters.</span> <span id="s182">We never had any problems with drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">WH: What do you think was most responsible for your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">IG: I don't know.</span> <span id="s185">I just took it day by day.</span> <span id="s186">(An intellectual who would think about the larger ramifications might be overwhelmed and give up.</span> <span id="s187">Seeing it as one day at a time might well have enhanced survival.)</span> <span id="s188">I never thought I was gonna survive.</span> <span id="s189">Because when I saw what I was going on day by day in the camps, with people being killed, I thought it's just a question of time.</span> <span id="s190">We did not know when the war was going to end.</span> <span id="s191">We went on a death march and when we went into the forest I stepped over hundreds of corpses, men, women, and children.</span> <span id="s192">We pulled them to the side because it was raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">RG: I'm proud that even though hundreds of people, Americans and Europeans, many who were established for many years went out of business on the farms we were able to stay and make it.</span> <span id="s194">Human beings have a wonderful ability to forget, to block it out completely.</span> <span id="s195">When we came here we appreciated everything.</span> <span id="s196">You had to understand what it meant——to sleep in a bed, to have a sheet.</span> <span id="s197">We had a bathtub in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s198">In Europe it was in the attic.</span> <span id="s199">I remember when I got my first mixer.</span> <span id="s200">You cannot imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: How did you find the strength to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">IG: Because we knew life had to go on.</span> <span id="s203">What you gonna bring back the dead?</span> <span id="s204">Everyone was single, of the young men in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s205">We were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s206">(Knowledge of this gives you strength.)</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
