tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s14">A: I'm Meyer Adler.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Will you tell me where you were born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Berezova (ph), Czechoslovakia, 19...October 6, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s18">I wonder if you'd tell me something about your family, you early life before the war?</span> <span id="s19">A: Well, we were more of what I would describe as a typical Jewish family in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">I had two younger brothers and my parents, and a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s21">And just as I said normal kind of orthodox Judaism.</span> <span id="s22">Every Friday for example the sort of the world stopped.</span> <span id="s23">Everybody came home for Shabath and I went to services on Friday afternoon, on Friday evening rather, and Saturday it was just very peaceful and no...no labor, no money, none, no commerce of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, he was a merchant.</span> <span id="s26">He was doing several things.</span> <span id="s27">We had a lumber business and farming and things of that sort.</span> <span id="s28">Basically that's what he was really doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Do you have many recollections of that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Mostly the hardships really and also as things were getting tougher and when I remember...I remember the terrible...I guess it was a world depression at the time.</span> <span id="s31">There was a lot of famine and hunger during that period, but the hardship that came with the war I remember.</span> <span id="s32">I remember seeing the planes going over our town...our town, for example, when they were attacking Poland, when the war started I believe, and then the hardships that...once we were occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Can you tell me something about that from the detail of your first introduction to the war, when it happened, experiences you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Well, we were...and I'm not sure when it was but I..</span> <span id="s35">.</span> <span id="s36">at one time we were taken over as Czechoslovakia I guess was taken over by ...by Germany.</span> <span id="s37">We were gave...we were given to Hungary, so we became part of Hungary and I seem to remember that we had to re- establish citizenship, and that took quite a bit of effort and money to become Hungarian citizens, and that was maybe in...I don't...I'm not sure...it might have been 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: But do you remember when the war started?</span> <span id="s39">You say you heard the planes...</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well I remember at the time seeing planes going over to Poland.</span> <span id="s41">That's what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">We saw just a sky full of planes going over us, and that was in...I'm I'm pretty sure...I know the war...the war was in '39, so but that had very little effect really, just we were concerned for the world but and I was to young to really, to make much difference in, but I remember that scene and leaflets used to drop every so often, but so then we were taken over by Hungary and we became Hungarian citizens and life seemed to go on with some difficulty almost normal, but at one time soon thereafter Jewish kids could not go to public school.</span> <span id="s43">I used to go to parochial school and public school, and my father used to have to pay or hired somebody to give my private lesson more and you know, we were going more to parochial school which was like a..</span> <span id="s44">.</span> <span id="s45">like a cheder (ph) and that's what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s47">Tell us what happened as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, it just that it seems to have become more difficult as we went along.</span> <span id="s49">In other words, your rights were taken away.</span> <span id="s50">Jews could not have any businesses and at some level I remember that I was...I had to work.</span> <span id="s51">We had lumber business and there were ways to bring lumber down from the mountains, that I was working at that.</span> <span id="s52">There was a lumber mill and in fact my cousin ran the lumber mill, but this wasn't the one there.</span> <span id="s53">but there was a lot of lumber.</span> <span id="s54">That was the major business there, was transporting lumber from the mountains into to the lumber mill and chopping it up and making lumber out of it and shipping it off, but it was a rural area.</span> <span id="s55">There was no public transportation.</span> <span id="s56">I mean there was no train service or no buses or...those are some of the things that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Then the things began to close in, things got more difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well it was getting more difficult and Jews were going...were being beaten on and off by Hungarian police, and but really that what's I..</span> <span id="s59">.</span> <span id="s60">all that is foggy to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: How about your own family?</span> <span id="s62">How did...what was the impact of the events on your father and mother and brothers and you as time went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, my brothers were quite young and and for that matter not that I was an old man, and there was a two year difference between each of us, so ...but the family was close.</span> <span id="s64">I think you...during time of trouble you seem to get closer, and also we had...you know, there were in my hometown we had let's see...one uncle, two...we had...I had two uncles living in town, and some of the...some of them were living in surrounding towns, but we had, you know, a bunch of cousins, but there was...you know, the community was quite close to begin with.</span> <span id="s65">What happened to everybody, you know, was affected by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So you were able to live in the same place....</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: We lived in the same home until...until the end really.</span> <span id="s68">We lived in our own...you know...with less rights but, you know, and things were getting tougher and as I said, we had to spend whatever money we had I think to buy off officials and and I I remember those things.</span> <span id="s69">It was very difficult to becoming a Hungarian...establishing some...for some reason we had to establish Hungarian citizenship, and that took I seem to remember, a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Were your folks scared?</span> <span id="s71">Was there an atmosphere of apprehension around?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s73">There was a..</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">in fact in 1941 I believe our town...there was some talk that we were going to be deported at that time.</span> <span id="s76">Of course we didn't know what it was all about.</span> <span id="s77">We had heard some some things going on in Poland, that they were killing people but those were isolated...you know, nobody really believed it but for some reason in this little we were not deported.</span> <span id="s78">In fact the whole town, and there were several towns...we were not the only ones...who were left in tact.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you see the Nazis or were they...?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: I did not see any Nazis until...I'm not sure whether I saw them before Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s81">Q: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: The Hungarians...the Hungarians were just as bad.</span> <span id="s83">Q: Were there instances of Hungarians beating you?</span> <span id="s84">A: Beating us.</span> <span id="s85">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Do you remember any of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Oh not personally.</span> <span id="s88">I remember seeing them beat...you know, beating people and I remember particularly one guy they had arrested and beat the heck out of him for some trumped up charges, but there was...we were...in all fairness we were sort of shielded from a lot of it.</span> <span id="s89">I mean we were in a small town and we were off the beaten track, so it wasn't coming through daily.</span> <span id="s90">It wasn't the kind of the thing that you would see daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How long did that state of affairs last and when did things start to change materially?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Well, I think it was really not...on and off I think we went through periods where, you know, there were some problems coming or at least anticipation of some things, but basically the troubles didn't really...they were getting worse as as we went along, however in perhaps the end of '43 and certainly the beginning of '44...that's when things were getting bad, going from bad to worse daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Can you tell us about that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, it just...we sort of...we knew we were going to be deported, and it was a question of trying to prepare yourself for that deportation, and to our knowledge we were, or at least from what I recall, we felt we were going to go as a family to a camp and being used as labor camp, in other words to do labor, physical labor, and we had family gatherings and meetings about that as to how we should handle that and how we can handle it.</span> <span id="s95">After it became sort of a fact that we were going to be deported, we were really trying to prepare for that and also you baked and you prepared and like my mother .</span> <span id="s96">She used to make...she made all kinds of things including small pillows we can take with us so we'd have...in other words all...whatever we can carry, we should have a new home, and it was really...I remember one of the discussions my my mother used to complain to me that I'm not preparing for wherever we're going to be deported to and I said don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s97">I don't need pillows.</span> <span id="s98">I can sleep on the floor and my arm is going to be used as a pillow.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">And that didn't didn't go over too well, because as I said, they were baking cookies that would last a lifetime...those real hard "Kichl" and all those things and those are the things that I remember.</span> <span id="s100">Just preparing for that day, and having meetings as to what we can do about it, and there didn't seem to be very much that we can do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: So when the day came, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, several things happened before the day came because as it was getting closer, when we finally realized what was happening and when, I was becoming more and more vocal in the family, saying this seems stupid to sit here and wait to be arrested and taken somewhere.</span> <span id="s103">And my father after this used to say that he really doesn't know what we can do.</span> <span id="s104">However, he felt that we would be better off as a family.</span> <span id="s105">At least this way we can help each other and it seems...you know, it would make a lot more sense and I just didn't want to buy it.</span> <span id="s106">It just...it just seemed...I liked the idea of being as a family, but I didn't like for being picked up and just hauled off to some place, and we had had several discussions on that subject in, you know, in it might have taken a period of two or three weeks that we were...when we had finally realized that it was going and it was just...when it was pinned down pretty much as to when it was going to happen, so I had just kept on pushing for that, and I was going to go to Russia, and my father had never said no, but he didn't say yes, and then I..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">when we finally...the day before we knew we were going to be picked up like tomorrow...the announcement I think was made that tomorrow you all have to be home because they're going to come and take us.</span> <span id="s109">Early that morning I had decided...in fact I had said to my family that night that I'm going to go, so I had decided that I was going just to take off and very early that morning I got up and left town and started to go to where I thought was going to be Russia, and my kid brother said he'll come with me, so we went and I went out of town in the direction toward the Russian troops I thought, or Russia, and as soon as I got out of town, some gentile, a gentile we used to know, met me and told him, told us that my father had paid him to take us in the right direction, at least part way so we wouldn't end up in the German lines.</span> <span id="s110">And we went into the mountains and hid out for several days.</span> <span id="s111">Had heard what had happened, and we were running into...because we met several other people who ran away during the turmoil when the chaos started, when they picked people up, so we ran into several other people in the mountains and we sort of hooked up together and two weeks later in fact I met my father and my other...and my brother who also...they took off at the last minute and we hid out for a period of about I think it was two...two or two and a half weeks in the mountains and we kept...we were just hiding and kept on staying in touch with the local...local areas.</span> <span id="s112">Somebody used to sneak in and at night in in a town, try to pick whatever information he can get, and at the end of two weeks we had had picked up that the Germans had issued an order saying that anybody who is hiding who is in part of the family...in other words, if they had part of the family in custody in the ghetto, and the ones who are missing, if they do not surrender within forty-eight hours, they're going to kill the ones they had.</span> <span id="s113">So that we had surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: That was your mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: My mother and a brother.</span> <span id="s116">Yeah.</span> <span id="s117">So we surrendered and they didn't do anything to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">They just took us to the ghetto and we were there for about six weeks in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s119">And which was in a town...in a town called Izza (ph) and then after several weeks they had shipped people out to which turned out to be Auschwitz, and we were the last ones...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What town was the...excuse me...what town was the ghetto in?</span> <span id="s121">A: It was called Izza.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Izza?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: I - Z - Z - A?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I'm not sure...it was I - Z - Z - A or I - Z - A. [iza probably correct]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Could you tell us something about what it was like there, what you can recollect of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Well it was a a small town, a farming town really.</span> <span id="s128">It was very close to a big city...to a big city...it was a larger city called Chust_ and we were there more in barns.</span> <span id="s129">In fact, we lived several families in just a plain where cows used to live in, because it had the...I mean that's the kinds of floors...I mean that's what we lived in, and everybody was on top of each other and we had no privacy.</span> <span id="s130">I mean it wasn't a room.</span> <span id="s131">It was just like most most of it as I said barns and I imagine there were some houses but I don't remember seeing any...you know...because towards the end as they shipped people out, they kept on making the ghetto smaller but we were the last transport that were finally shipped out of there to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Were the Nazis killing people or doing anything to them in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No.</span> <span id="s134">I I didn't see any of that or at least I don't think there was any of this.</span> <span id="s135">They kept things pretty much hidden.</span> <span id="s136">Now I know they shot one person before we were shipped out because he had hidden...he used to hide as I told you earlier the women were busy sewing and baking and cooking, whatever, and people were hiding money and gold in like they dug out the heels of shoes and money was put in the lapels of your...I mean in coats and seams.</span> <span id="s137">They were hiding money, you know, to take with us.</span> <span id="s138">Some of those things I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Can you tell us what happened when the day came when they shipped you off and tell us about the trip to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, they took us to Chust.</span> <span id="s141">I remember it was a sunny day, and loaded us into these boxcars.</span> <span id="s142">Crowded in...it was very, very crowded, and you were locked in with almost no air, just that one window, and the door was slightly ajar but it was mostly, you know, you were locked in there.</span> <span id="s143">and there many people.</span> <span id="s144">I don't know how many there were but it was...there was barely room to sit on the boxcar.</span> <span id="s145">Certainly there was no room for anybody to stretch out.</span> <span id="s146">In the meantime all of us had all these dumb suitcases that we packed and baked and you know...clothing and food to take with us to our new home, which took up a lot of room.</span> <span id="s147">Inside for bathroom facilities, we had a bucket and that's it and everybody...in fact a couple of people die...died in our boxcar going there and we were in that I think for three and a half days that we traveled.</span> <span id="s148">We had no idea where we were going to but we did end up in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What were conditions like in the trans...in the in the boxcar among the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, it was just everybody was very...there was no problem.</span> <span id="s151">I mean people were just all miserable and sort of like misery loves company.</span> <span id="s152">Nobody has...I mean, you know, somebody is very sick and somebody died and, you know, it's like chaos.</span> <span id="s153">We were all not too far from it.</span> <span id="s154">We were given no food from what I recall.</span> <span id="s155">I don't remember being given any food except the stuff that we brought with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What time did you get into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: We came in...I think it was early in the morning.</span> <span id="s158">I mean, you know, like maybe ten.</span> <span id="s159">I I have no idea, but I seem to remember it was early morning kind of, not...in other words like tenish type of...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Tell us exactly what happened when you got there, as much as you remember of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Well, we were...many people, the ones who could see...we were trying to get to the window just to see as we were going by different areas... but I remember when we pulled in and as the boxcar...you know, the train finally came to a stop...we had stopped several times before that but I mean this really looked like a final destination.</span> <span id="s162">You can hear rackets and pris...the prisoners in Auschwitz that I I didn't know incidentally that was Auschwitz, but the man who opened up our boxcar door did comment quickly to say tell the young people that they are sixteen, that they worked in a factory, and he just unlocked the car and , but that was the comment I remember, and then as we got off and then we were told to deboard the train and we deboarded the train and one of my uncles had collapsed.</span> <span id="s163">He was...he was an ill man and he was very sick.</span> <span id="s164">He was just sitting there.</span> <span id="s165">I'm not sure whether he died that day or not...you know, right there or not, but he was...and we had to leave him and then the because they were announcing to say men should go here and women with children under sixteen to go some place else and I remember getting my two younger brothers and saying go with Mommy.</span> <span id="s166">We'll see you later, and I got them off to go there and we were just lining up to go through what turned out to be the line, the selection process or whatever it was called.</span> <span id="s167">And that was what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: You thought...you didn't know what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I had no idea what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s170">We weren't told...I I thought, and I would imagine everybody thought, that that we were just going to go through a serious search.</span> <span id="s171">We were told incidentally to leave all our belongings on the train, just to leave, and they told us you'll get it later and just leave it there and just go...go...you know, separate men and women and small kids.</span> <span id="s172">They go someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did they treat you brutally or did they seem...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No.</span> <span id="s175">I don't think...to be somebody, if there was problem, they hit...were hitting people if you didn't go.</span> <span id="s176">There were people with clubs and they were hitting people if you didn't go where you're supposed to, just to get you quickly off the trains and into these lines that they wanted you to go to, but that seemed to go, you know, very...you know, it seemed to progress quite well but there was, you know, commotion, chaos and there were a lot...it was a long train.</span> <span id="s177">There were quite a few people on that train, because we were not the only town that were on that train.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, as we were going through, and I don't understand this till this day and I've thought about it many a time, we were going through the line and of course I was not first in line.</span> <span id="s180">Needless to say I wasn't last either, but there were people lining up and my experience as a kid...I always used to tail my father.</span> <span id="s181">Wherever he went, I wanted to go where he went and even when he didn't want me to go, I used to sneak behind and go.</span> <span id="s182">My father was right ahead of me through this line that we went and a cousin of mine was a couple...a cousin that I had who had a club foot, who was limping...he was a little bit ahead of us, and as he went through this line and I don't understand really this till this day and I've thought about it as to my I would do this because when we came to the head of the line, he sent my cousin to the right.</span> <span id="s183">He sent my father to the right, and then he came to me and asked me how old are you.</span> <span id="s184">I said I'm eighteen.</span> <span id="s185">Did you ever work in a factory?</span> <span id="s186">Yes, two years.</span> <span id="s187">And he told me to go to the right.</span> <span id="s188">And I noticed...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: To the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: To the right is what he had told me.</span> <span id="s191">I think that's what it was.</span> <span id="s192">But I noticed that the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did he tell the others to go to the right also?</span> <span id="s194">So he told you to go in the same direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Right.</span> <span id="s196">But as he told me that, you know, and and I had noticed that these people were lining up behind him on the left, so that I just didn't pay any attention and just went and got in, you know, right behind them and turned left and went in, stood in line with those people.</span> <span id="s197">And I didn't...in other words I didn't follow my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did you...have you thought why you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I had no idea.</span> <span id="s200">All I..</span> <span id="s201">.</span> <span id="s202">the impression it made on me...these people are all in their late teens to twenties and you know some I guess...I should say really late, late teens...nineteen, twenty, and maybe in in their thirties, so all the people that were lining up... I had a lot of friends who were older than I but this just seemed like...as I said it was a split [second] decision.</span> <span id="s203">It was...it took all of one or two seconds for me.</span> <span id="s204">I didn't stop walking through the line.</span> <span id="s205">I just kept on going and I just turned to to go where these people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did you see your father on the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I saw him go...go to the other side, and never saw...never saw him again, never said goodbye to him or anything.</span> <span id="s208">Never said goodbye to my mother or my brothers for that matter either.</span> <span id="s209">I just told them go with Mommy.</span> <span id="s210">We'll see you later.</span> <span id="s211">I'll see you in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: That was the last you saw them?</span> <span id="s213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well, then we were marched off and were taken to some barracks where we were lined up and we were...they were shaving everybody, every hair on your body, and I remember really because when it came to me, I had just gotten a haircut and in that time we used to cut our hair... I had no hair at all and the guy who was shaving me, he couldn't find a hair on me.</span> <span id="s216">He said what the hell is the skin doing here?</span> <span id="s217">And he said...and I remember a guy from my hometown, he said what do you want from me.</span> <span id="s218">I didn't have a hair on my body, and he was surprised that he didn't have any pubic hair or anything to shave.</span> <span id="s219">That was his problem.</span> <span id="s220">He seemed to have had a problem with it, but he passed me through and then we went...after after the shaving, we went in to...took a shower and we were told to lay our clothes out before we went in there and it it was a shower in there and we got new clothes afterwards, the striped pajamas.</span> <span id="s221">And then we were marched into this camp and that's when the reality sort of hit, that I was on my own.</span> <span id="s222">That was the first time that I was ever on my own totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s224">What month and what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: It was June '44.</span> <span id="s226">I think it was on June 14.</span> <span id="s227">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s228">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: And as I said, I found myself in this hugh camp, dreary and with no ...I mean no...I mean the clothing only on my back and whatever I had was on my back, which they gave me that pajama uniform and just with many people and I was sort of separated from everybody...there was nobody there from my hometown.</span> <span id="s230">There were a couple of people but this was a hugh building, and we were just being pushed around and shoved and I had finally met a couple of people from my hometown but they were most of them a lot of people I didn't know.</span> <span id="s231">And we spent several days there and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What was a day like?</span> <span id="s233">Can you describe what the days were like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: The days were...the selection...you hoped that you're you're going to be in there to get work.</span> <span id="s235">Now what I realized after being there, just actually this happened a few hours afterwards really, because when I realized what was happening, I ended up in a in a in a building that was mostly kids, more my age and that didn't seem right to me for some reason, so I ran away from there.</span> <span id="s236">I was trying...you can go...they let you go...you were in a camp compound but you can go to the next building.</span> <span id="s237">I mean these were...there were several buildings there.</span> <span id="s238">So I sort of mixed...I was looking for places where there were more adults, people who were more working class, you know, people who were working because we could see people working, carrying stones and stuff like that, so that I mixed in with some of those and I was just going from place to place where for the better part of those weeks, is what I was trying to find myself someplace that I'd end up with more adults, and every time I ended up doing that, they had...they were looking for work details and some reason they always threw me out.</span> <span id="s239">I was too small and they would ...in fact at appell we used to march and be counted.</span> <span id="s240">I was standing half of the time on a stone so...just so I'd I'd appear a little taller, or a brick, and when we marched, five people locked arms...you know, locked in.</span> <span id="s241">I used to ask the guys to lift me up so that I wouldn't be that much shorter and that's...it worked, you know, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What were the eating and sleeping like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Sleeping...we slept in these barracks where I was at, where you sat down on the floor and you spread your legs and somebody else sat right in front of you, next to you, and that's how we sat and it was just a total row of people sort of just like that, and on top of each other and you dozed off as much as you could, but there was people to people.</span> <span id="s244">There was a person leaning on me.</span> <span id="s245">There was a people...I mean there was a person that was leaning on me.</span> <span id="s246">There was a person behind me, and there would be a person touching me from both sides, so to get up, it was almost impossible to turn over.</span> <span id="s247">You had to disturb everybody if you had to go to the bathroom or anything like that.</span> <span id="s248">In the meantime they used to come in at night and the barracks had a center I don't know what you'd call it...like, almost like a runway, and a guy used walk there with a whip and start hitting people and they're running around this and this happened...it seemed to have happened every night and sometimes several times a night, just hitting people with a whip and running around us.</span> <span id="s249">And there were...in this particular camp there were a lot of gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">They had the...they were sort of the authority, the ...they seemed to be running the camp during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Were they helpful or...</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Not really...well, they were...they were not helpful but they they were not...it was mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">There were some who were really more sympathetic than helpful, but they weren't exactly detrimental.</span> <span id="s254">Some...even though some of them were who I think were putting on a show.</span> <span id="s255">They had to beat you, and they were doing a lot of that.</span> <span id="s256">But the trick was to try to get some kind of work that you go on a work detail, and the food they used to give us was some kind of a soup that was more like some kind of just warm liquid of some sort.</span> <span id="s257">And I mean that's what I remember as a food, and I remember the...for breakfast they used to give us a coffee that I used to use, and I I never drank coffee in my life before that...I used to use that to wash my face with because it was warm and and I don't remember any...any...any other thing that we got for breakfast.</span> <span id="s258">Once in a while you'd see a little small piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So you ate very little?</span> <span id="s260">A: Very little, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How about toileting...how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: They had ...there was a building just for that purpose that you had to go to, and it was across...across the building there was a..</span> <span id="s263">.</span> <span id="s264">a central building that was just as big as this building.</span> <span id="s265">You had umpteen holes you know...they called them WC water closets, that's what it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What was going on inside of you during this time?</span> <span id="s267">What were you feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Very lonesome, very depressed, very sort of lost.</span> <span id="s269">I really...at that time I I really didn't have any idea what was going on but I also knew it wasn't good and you didn't have time to think.</span> <span id="s270">You were just...you were trying to survive, and during that period I remember one time where I had finally met some people...I said...I told you I was running around these different buildings within the same compound, and I met somebody, some people from my hometown and I met this one guy who had a brother, one fellow who was my age and he had a brother that was two years old, and they were there and so we were sort of stuck...trying to stick around together and we used to get beaten for wherever you went, many a time you run into somebody who'd beat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You yourself were beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s273">So that we decided one day and I suggested to the guy, you know, here it's terrible, so that we should...you know, they had the electric wire fences.</span> <span id="s274">We had decided to go and touch it and just so we...so we can die, and somebody had done that before us and the guy...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: You saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I saw the guy who did it just before, and the guard was walking around their perimeter came in to kick the guy to see he's dead, so I told this other fellow, I said look, I said...it's stupid here I said.</span> <span id="s277">They beat you even after your dead, so maybe we ought to try, maybe we'll make it, and that's when we decided not to commit suicide and we would to stick it out, and we did, and it seemed to me...I remember seeing people going to work and I I was just very seldom was I picked for one of those labor details.</span> <span id="s278">I was always thrown out.</span> <span id="s279">And then when it finally came...right after several weeks that I was there, I was at one place...there was a work group.</span> <span id="s280">It turned out to be it was over a thousand people.</span> <span id="s281">We were carrying rocks and at the end of the day...you know, after several hours of work, they counted off a group of people for some reason and they picked out...first before they started counting, they picked out some some people and put them aside and I was one of the ones they picked out and then they counted off which I learned later were a thousand people, so there were just a few of us left and they corner...cornered off those people that they were...that they had taken and put them in a..</span> <span id="s282">.</span> <span id="s283">it was...the sun was shinning.</span> <span id="s284">I remember it was a hot day and they were sitting in the sun and waiting and we were being separated and we were told to disperse, so we were carrying water to these people because they were begging for water and the guards let us give them water, so I made several trips to these people with...we found some dirty bottles of and containers and we gave them water to drink, and in the meantime these two fellows that I told about, this fellow who was my age and the older brother...the older brother was in the group that was cornered off and we were not.</span> <span id="s285">These two brothers wanted to stay together so we had...every time I hand them water, we made a couple of comments and and I told them that the brother, that they wanted to stay together and he said definitely that they would like to get together, so after making several trips with these water bottles, we had pre- arranged the next time I'm coming with water, the guy is going to flip that it will make it appear that he's handing me the water and I'll stay and he'll go with his brother, go out and...but he'll stay with his brother...the older brother came to stay with the younger one, so that when it...when I made that final trip he had, you know, changed sides to appear that he's handing me the water and I ended up with the water and he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Why did you make that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Because they wanted to stay together and I knew that I needed to get out of there.</span> <span id="s288">Q: This group...you knew it was going to go...?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: We just knew they they all looked healthy.</span> <span id="s290">They looked, you know, and I assumed that they're going to go someplace as a as a working force, and after that, maybe an hour or so later, we were being loaded on trains.</span> <span id="s291">They took us...it was a couple, a two or three day trip and we went from there to Germany, which turned out they took us to a train and we ended up...we came in the middle of the night to a a place which was one of the satellite camps of Dachau.</span> <span id="s292">I think it was called Landsber-Kaufering, and there...and I remember this was scary...when we got off the train, it was late at night and we walked in this satellite camp and we had to walk between a like railroad tracks and it was like two mountains, two...it wasn't mountains but two hilly areas that looked like...you know, really I though we were going...we were being taken there to be shot.</span> <span id="s293">That's the first time that I thought of being...that I'm going to be killed, and we marched into this camp and that's where we ended up being...I was stationed there for several months doing building and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Can you tell us about that, what life was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well, this was a camp where life was sort of normal to some extent.</span> <span id="s296">We were...the biggest problem we had was a field that they put cardboard huts...there were huts around made out of compressed... some kind of very heavy cardboard, because in rainstorms they used to sort of bend and also we had a little straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s297">We slept...we slept on the floor and if it rained, it came in, water came in so we sort of put dirt around it a little bit and we were getting food, you know, a normal...I mean our regular ration.</span> <span id="s298">It was certainly wasn't normal.</span> <span id="s299">I mean again most of the food was soup.</span> <span id="s300">Very seldom was there meat in it.</span> <span id="s301">Once in a while, you know, we get a little piece of bread and sometimes we get liverwurst and stuff like that and you're doing normal, all kinds of buildings, construction.</span> <span id="s302">We built factories.</span> <span id="s303">We...I remember that we for example, we built a factory and our job was to put...what the hell do you call it already...not soil but we were putting like sod on top of it.</span> <span id="s304">We had to carry physically sod and just put it, so from the air it looked...it didn't look like a a building.</span> <span id="s305">It just became a hill.</span> <span id="s306">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: You were still a pretty small boy at that point weren't you?</span> <span id="s308">Did you have trouble doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, I was doing it.</span> <span id="s311">I was...I was small.</span> <span id="s312">I remember that the camp commander had complained bitterly when when he had looked the next morning when he came into the camp.</span> <span id="s313">He says all these kids that are on this transport...there were a lot of, you know, several you know young...youngsters.</span> <span id="s314">But the camp was run...I mean we worked long hours when we were doing all kinds of stuff and there was some food.</span> <span id="s315">There were beatings on and off, but basically if you did your job, it wasn't too...you know, there wasn't too much meanness.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Were you yourself beaten by any of the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: There was one guy used to beat me...every time he saw me he used to beat me.</span> <span id="s318">I used to run away from him.</span> <span id="s319">There was another guy who helped him many a time, but in this camp, you know, it was just...we were really true laborers, and I remember going because of the fact that I spoke Jewish, I was able to understand German, and it turned out in this camp that I was at, in this particular camp there were about twenty-one or twenty-two hundred of us.</span> <span id="s320">Most of them, and I think in excess of two thousand were Hungarian Jews, and they were idealistic and these people didn't speak any Jewish and we were sort of out-casts to them, and there were about a hundred of us, the assorted nationality...not...we were all Jews but assorted from different countries.</span> <span id="s321">There were a few Polish, a few stragglers from here and there and so I used to be able to go sometimes and do like interpreting so if a German asked for a detail, like I remember on several occasions we used to go to farmers to deliver something or pick something up, then I used to be part of that detail only because I was able to communicate with them a little better.</span> <span id="s322">And then there was an an Austrian who was not in the army.</span> <span id="s323">He was in the work...I'm trying to remember what they were called...the work details, in charge.</span> <span id="s324">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s325">He was the one who was...who had us build all these projects and he gave us and he he did a lot of things for me that was very helpful, such as he used to go to his kitchen, for example, at lunch time, we'd go to one place where we'd get our food and of course the Germans got it some place else, and he'd go for seconds many a time and take two bites out of it and call would you go and wash my dish out.</span> <span id="s326">Of course it was full of food and you know, that was the greatest thing he could do for me.</span> <span id="s327">So there were some that were helpful.</span> <span id="s328">But we worked really long hours and every morning and every night you had to stand in line for hours to be counted, rain...rain...sun...it didn't make any difference and also another thing that I remember really that made an impression on me at the time...we became sort of religious, not to the extent of that we were religious, but we would have services.</span> <span id="s329">We'd have a minyan [religious quorum] every morning and every night, while we were waiting for appell, for people...you know, for them to come and count us.</span> <span id="s330">We were sitting there.</span> <span id="s331">You...you know, when a German came by, of course, you shut up but you were all praying all from memory and we did that quite a bit.</span> <span id="s332">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did that help?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I don't know what helped really.</span> <span id="s335">It helped.</span> <span id="s336">Yes, it helped.</span> <span id="s337">I guess it helped.</span> <span id="s338">But we were just really existing day to day.</span> <span id="s339">What...what did happen, there were people who did give up.</span> <span id="s340">I mean it's...there were suicides and the people used to go to the latrine and hang themselves.</span> <span id="s341">That was one of the most dangerous places to go to, because people were just, you know, falling.</span> <span id="s342">Then it happened I remember I was involved...we used to look forward to when the daylight bombing started, which I call it daylight bombing now, which I didn't know at the time, but every day at 10:30 the planes used to come over.</span> <span id="s343">We used to get a break from work.</span> <span id="s344">We used to love those things.</span> <span id="s345">Just go and stretch out on the grass and rest while...while, you know, while the sirens went off and we were allowed to stop the work, but I was also involved...I was one of the fellows when Munich was first bombed, I guess, or the first big bombing they did a lot of damage to it.</span> <span id="s346">They destroyed pretty much the railroad station, that I was taken there to...I was one of the guys who went to work to try to put that train station back in some kind of a work order, and that was where we used to have to go on the train a long time and come back.</span> <span id="s347">We spent really...in that train we were working very very long hours, between work and being on the train to and from Munich took a long time.</span> <span id="s348">But we did, as I said, many projects.</span> <span id="s349">They were building buildings.</span> <span id="s350">I remember laying railroad tracks, and that's when they used to lay...laying railroad tracks in the wintertime with no gloves and the hands used to stick to the tracks.</span> <span id="s351">You used to have to literally shake it to get it off because it was so cold...cold, and people used to haul things and I was in that when...when, you know, you had to pull stuff, you couldn't do it and that's when they they'll whip you like a horse, you know, pull, pull, pull.</span> <span id="s352">You have to do a lot of that, and but some...on several occasions I was able to get myself some jobs that were helpful, such as I used to clean out officers' and that gave me a lot of benefit only because in trash cans and in ash trays that I used to empty, I used to find cigarette butts.</span> <span id="s353">That was like gold.</span> <span id="s354">That's...in fact, gold...that was more like diamonds because every...for every butt you can give somebody, you can get his ration of bread.</span> <span id="s355">There were people who really traded that away.</span> <span id="s356">And so those things were helpful, but the big problem we had it was very, very cold because we had the same clothing for winter...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What clothes did you wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Striped...these striped pajama uniforms, and that was just a shirt, like a shirt and a pair of pajama pants and what I did in the winter time really is use cement bags as liners.</span> <span id="s359">We emptied the cement bags from cement and we use to use them to put them in our clothing and the shoes fell apart.</span> <span id="s360">In fact I had frozen off my toenail...my toe on of my feet was frozen and my the bottom of my feet in fact were frozen.</span> <span id="s361">I have had problems with that, and then I was just...it was...the big problem I remember really is being extremely cold and these working conditions were absolutely atrocious.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: How long did that last?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Well, that...that lasted pretty much till the end.</span> <span id="s364">It lasted till let's see...I came there...it must have been...I think it was in August when I got to Germany through December.</span> <span id="s365">I remember Christmas Eve being moved from that camp to another camp that we were building a new camp and that was...that's when my troubles really...because life was sort of normal between the period of August through December in this camp.</span> <span id="s366">You worked hard hours but it was more a normal kind of thing.</span> <span id="s367">But then when we were shipped to this other camp, things seemed to have changed.</span> <span id="s368">We had no idea...we had no news what was going on.</span> <span id="s369">I do remember seeing one fellow who...we knew that they came in and made selections every so often of people who were not fit anymore to work and took them away and I remember one Romanian doctor who told me that he was once...because he had told us he is going to go and volunteer for that, and we told...you know, we were telling him this is not the thing to do and his comment, he says I can't take it.</span> <span id="s370">He was a big fellow.</span> <span id="s371">He had swollen up.</span> <span id="s372">He really had puffed up.</span> <span id="s373">He was very...he had volunteered for...I mean he wanted to go into one of those transports, and they were shipped...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: He knew he would die?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Well, we sort of felt that, but also when they started to take us on train projects to work, people used to jump in front of the train.</span> <span id="s376">You'd see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: You saw people do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s379">Yes.</span> <span id="s380">Yeah.</span> <span id="s381">When the train was coming into the station, people would just jump in front of it, so you saw things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What happened when you got to the other camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That's when we were building that and and it was...really it was very cold and we marched all night.</span> <span id="s384">We came there and no place to stay.</span> <span id="s385">They said we have to build some kind of makeshift building and I was just deterior...starting to deteriorate.</span> <span id="s386">Soon there afterwards there were a lot of people who got very sick and that must have been I would guess maybe January or February, and people were just getting sicker and sicker and then they had started where there was one building they had put up which was in a..</span> <span id="s387">.</span> <span id="s388">in fact we were moved to another camp because it was just...it was terrible and when we got there, more and more people...it seemed like the whole camp was sick, so they had buildings that had people who were, you know, just sick and...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: In what way were sick?</span> <span id="s390">Did they have common characteristics?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: They would just...well, it turned out...I didn't know at the time but they had typhoid fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">I found out afterwards that's what...</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What did you observe of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, they just couldn't move.</span> <span id="s395">They were just terrible.</span> <span id="s396">They were...and I remember I went through a period there...in fact, then for some reason and I don't remember how it came about it, but I was thrown into one of those buildings with these very sick people.</span> <span id="s397">Every morning I remember all people did is go through...and that's how it started...that's what I did...they're going through...people slept on these...it wasn't a bed.</span> <span id="s398">It was like a platform.</span> <span id="s399">It was...and just next to each other.</span> <span id="s400">You slept in rows and we used to go in the morning and just pick up the dead bodies and throw them from the building and then they'd come and haul...haul them off, but I remember after a while I was...I was put put in one of those buildings to stay and that's where I..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">I mean I was down to...</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Were you sick then yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I was starting...had some sym...but I didn't...certainly didn't have...I developed typhoid fever I think while I was there but I wasn't when I..</span> <span id="s405">.</span> <span id="s406">I was still working.</span> <span id="s407">I was able to, you know, go on, you know, because most of the people couldn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What do you think you weighed at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Well, I don't know what I weighed at that point, but I was...when I was liberated I weighed thirty kilos, which is about sixty-two, what is it...about sixty-four pounds I guess.</span> <span id="s410">But I was laying in this place and I remember I had sores, because I was nothing but skin and bones, and I had hugh sores on my backside and uh because and I also remember one period where I didn't go to the bathroom for thirteen...three weeks rather, and that was the most painful thing when I finally did try.</span> <span id="s411">By then we were being pulled back as as the war...as April...March came and then April came.</span> <span id="s412">We were being consolidated, pulled back, which I didn't know for what reason or where, but...and then life seemed to have improved slightly and then we were...at the end of April we were being taken by train.</span> <span id="s413">We had sort of gone...gone together into an area where we were being loaded on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: You were no longer in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, this is still in that same general vicinity.</span> <span id="s416">They had...Dachau was a major camp and a lot of satellite camps around it, so what I guess they were doing at that time is pulling all the people back to what turned out to be Dachau, but we were loaded on this train and I remember it was April 27th when we finally got on the train, and we were pulled into this train station where we were parked, and the train was open cars, all open...open boxcars and next to us was an anti-aircraft gun train, with anti-aircraft guns and the planes came over that morning like they always did and looked at us and saw us in these open boxcars and took off.</span> <span id="s417">As they took off, the anti-aircraft guns opened fire and they shot down several of those planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: And they had hidden the anti-aircraft guns there...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Right behind us.</span> <span id="s420">Yeah.</span> <span id="s421">I mean I imagine they should...should have been able to see them from the air, because you can't hide a train and because it was an open train station.</span> <span id="s422">Well, that day they kept...the planes kept on coming back all day long and bombing the hell out of us, and the train station and the anti-aircraft guns and during that period really the lull...while the shooting had stopped, of course, there was chaos you know, people...we got out of the boxcars.</span> <span id="s423">We were climbing over and the Germans were disappearing and I remember this was April 27th, so we roamed around and we hadn't eaten because before that I mean we hadn't eaten for quite a while, so I saw a lot of bread on the German train, so I climbed on the train station...on the on my train and then up to the Germans and asked them to please, please give me some bread, so he started to hand me two loaves of bread and as he did that, one of our guards came over and pointed his rifle butt to my forehead just like this and pushed me across the track and told the German not to give it to me and he really pushed me physically across the track and while I was begging him he didn't say one word, just pushed me across and as soon as he did that, there was another prisoner who did exactly the same thing that I did, and he went and reached out for the bread and the guy shot him on the spot and killed him right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: One of the guards are doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s426">And he didn't say one word to him.</span> <span id="s427">So, .</span> <span id="s428">But that day went on and we got...we thought maybe we were liberated later that day because after...we looked around.</span> <span id="s429">There were just no Germans left and we got into the woods and then it seemed to have quieted down when the Germans round us up again and put us back on the train and took us into Dachau, because I remember getting there and the the people who guarded us at Dachau, the new...new prison guards who took over there were...the rifles were bigger than they were.</span> <span id="s430">They were all little kids it seemed like and they marched us into Dachau and also prior to that what happened was during all that chaos, I saw that train with food.</span> <span id="s431">I broke...you know, took a lot of food and we had uniforms...they were just very sloppy and loose so I..</span> <span id="s432">.</span> <span id="s433">whatever I could stuff in my shirt, I took...all kinds of food, so that evening some prisoners came and took it all away from me, whatever I had but they missed a package of butter that I had noticed a little later because I felt it sticking to my body.</span> <span id="s434">It was mel...it started to melt, so when nobody was looking, I kept on putting my hand in my shirt and breaking off a piece of butter and eating it.</span> <span id="s435">I ate up that whole package of butter, and if you want to know what happened to me after that...I was...I became so deathly...deathly sick that it was terrible, but I was dehydrated to begin with and I had diarrhea from that.</span> <span id="s436">That was...that was absolutely was a disaster, and then I was just really waiting to die.</span> <span id="s437">I was just lying there...I remember in Dachau because I was lying in this barracks and somebody came and told me, somebody who knew me really from Europe said just hang on.</span> <span id="s438">He says it won't be long now, and I had told him...I said it won't make any difference to me.</span> <span id="s439">I don't have long, but on April 29th, we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Can you tell us about the liberation, what you what you saw of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I saw really...as I told you I was very sick.</span> <span id="s442">I really didn't get out of bed.</span> <span id="s443">I had heard of the commotion and didn't pay any attention, so I saw very little of it.</span> <span id="s444">Fortunately for me as it turned out as when I came in...when they came in and they had seen what was going on, and I was close to the gate where I was, that I was taken to a..</span> <span id="s445">.</span> <span id="s446">by the military personnel to a military ho...to what seemed to be a military hospital by Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: American soldiers...?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: American soldiers...yes...by American doctors had taken me in and they were treating me.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: How did they react when they saw what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: They seemed to be very and very disturbed but they really...around me I mean you could see these corpses, or you could see people who looked like corpses.</span> <span id="s451">Most of us...there were quite a few people who died after the liberation too from illnesses or dehydration or it was very...you really...like my first food that I recalled that an American gave me, it seemed like charcoal to me, some kind of a..</span> <span id="s452">.</span> <span id="s453">it looked like really and it tasted like ground-up charcoal and believe me I tasted enough food because once I even went, while I was in the camp, we hadn't eaten for several days that I..</span> <span id="s454">.</span> <span id="s455">people were eating grass, so I went to...I tried that, and you know, dirty grass...it...to me it tasted as I said I'd just as soon die if I have to eat it, and I didn't eat it again, yet I used to go and eat behind the kitchen...I used to go and steal the rubbish because the potato peelings, that was...that was a great food, or anything the kitchen threw out, so...but and when...when, you know, in remembering stuff like that, when you went for example prisoners who used to work in the kitchen detail, that was a good job if you can get it, because if they knew you like you used to soup which just as I said was mostly warm some kind of liquid.</span> <span id="s456">Once in a while you get a potato in it...very seldom any kind of meat in it.</span> <span id="s457">I I don't recall ever seeing a piece of meat in it but it was basically potato soup kind of more soup than potato.</span> <span id="s458">But that was...they treated me quite well, and then they had moved me because I remember more of a reaction when a German nurse came into see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Where did the Americans take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: It was in same vicinity, some place in there in the Dachau area.</span> <span id="s461">Q: A hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: A hospital, and I was being treated and I remember when this German woman came in, and she was very young and when she saw me, she collapsed sort of and almo...she fainted kind of.</span> <span id="s463">And I remembered having a discussion with somebody because I said they claim they didn't know what was going on, and my question was how can you not know what goes on here when you see day after day train loads of people coming in, and nobody...and the trains are leaving empty.</span> <span id="s464">Now after this goes on for several months or years, you'd have millions of people there so we can't possibly...you know, something had to be going on there.</span> <span id="s465">So...I was also told that afterwards I was supposed to go to Dachau, that we were being taken there to be killed.</span> <span id="s466">But we didn't make it.</span> <span id="s467">We were...we were delayed on the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And they...when they got everybody together...?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Then they got everybody together towards the end of the war...right.</span> <span id="s470">See, as I said, to me I was liberated April 29th.</span> <span id="s471">The war was over just a few days later, you know...on May 8th so it wasn't much, but I stayed in that hospital for several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: When you were able to make the transfer from Auschwitz to Dachau, you, of course your family was not with you.</span> <span id="s473">What were your...what did you think had happened to them and when did you realize that you were alone and without any of your family?</span> <span id="s474">What happened at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I really didn't know and...I mean I didn't know really till after the war that they may...that they are probably dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: When you got out of Auschwitz, what did you think...what did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I just knew...at that time all I wanted to do...when I was in Auschwitz, I just wanted to get out, out of there, and I was told that we're going to go...I mean the people and the prisoners were saying they're being taken to a labor camp, and they're going to work, and that's really what we were trying to...again we were being taken and it was cold...that was one of the problems even on that train...you know, the nights were cold that we drove through.</span> <span id="s478">And I remember seeing we we we were moving constantly.</span> <span id="s479">We did stop in Vienna.</span> <span id="s480">I remember somebody had pointed that.</span> <span id="s481">He recognized it was Vienna that we went through.</span> <span id="s482">But we were just trying to survive really and didn't think too much.</span> <span id="s483">I assumed at that time they were just in a different camp, that they were also someplace working.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Might not be.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Oh yeah, not might be.</span> <span id="s486">I was...I mean there was no question...I assumed...I had no idea that they were dead or about to be dead.</span> <span id="s487">As I said, it was just...I assumed and I think most had assumed that they were just in a different camp.</span> <span id="s488">We were told there were a lot of camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: When you were in the hospital after Dachau, how long were were you there?</span> <span id="s490">How long did it take you to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I would say that was from say the end of April till maybe two or three months anyhow, because I remember that I had trouble walking even.</span> <span id="s492">I was very weak and they tried to build me up some.</span> <span id="s493">When they had finally released me, which maybe...I must have been at least two months because I remember then they took us on on trucks, the Czechoslovakians, to Prague I think.</span> <span id="s494">And we were going on the truck and I remember getting off the truck and I had to walk up steps and I really had trouble walking steps.</span> <span id="s495">My legs hurt.</span> <span id="s496">It was just...it was very difficult because I didn't have the strength, and I had gained back some strength by that time already and then I remember getting, you know, after kicking around for a few days there and there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: They just took all the Czech citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s499">They were taking you ba...taking you back to general vicinities, and we used to ride the trains then cause we didn't bother with tickets or anything, just...it was pretty much a free-for-all, everybody...the trains were moving and they weren't moving.</span> <span id="s500">You got on a train and it moved and it got stopped and stay stopped for two days sometimes.</span> <span id="s501">The Russian troops had, of course, I mean you know military trains had priority and it was...Czech was in the Russian hands at the time...most of them, and I used to hook up and I found to go back to my hometown, that the best way to travel was hooking up with Russian military trains that were going in the general vicinity, and it took me a long time to get home, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: After you got to Prague, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s504">I mean after...after that...right...I was looking back to go back to my hometown and I was not...I mean and you know, the rumor mills and they guys who were older, who were more able physically of course were investigating and finding, you know, rumor mills thought this...this is how you can go here and this is how you can go there and did you see so and so, did you see...you know...what do you know, but we were going back and after several weeks, you know...it it was...it was a very tedious and very long trip because as I said at the time you're moving, a train could stop for no reason and just stay there, and then the next train was passing us so we hopped that train from train to train.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: How about the people in the countryside?</span> <span id="s506">How did they treat you?</span> <span id="s507">Were you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Most of them sort of ignored us.</span> <span id="s509">There were some some people who were, you know, not hostile.</span> <span id="s510">They wouldn't dare be hostile but they certainly I wouldn't say friendly.</span> <span id="s511">The most memorable thing that I remember from that whole journey is when I finally got into my hometown and as I said this took several weeks because I had stopped in the biggest city near us.</span> <span id="s512">I stayed there but when I finally decided to get into my hometown, I'll never forget getting off a bus and there were three of us who got off the bus, and there were young kids standing on the corner, and somebody I heard made a comment...look, there are three more Jews Hitler didn't kill.</span> <span id="s513">I heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: I think this is about this tape, so let's stop at this point and I think they have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s517">So you got back to your own hometown after this arduous journey.</span> <span id="s518">What did you see when you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Everything was pretty much the way we left it.</span> <span id="s520">Nothing was destroyed really.</span> <span id="s521">It was...many yards were sort of over-grown and they looked wild.</span> <span id="s522">In our house there happened to be a caretaker who used to help us and he used to come in on and put wood on the fire and stuff like that...was living in it and but the town was very...you know, it was deserted.</span> <span id="s523">Of course, there were, you know, all the Jewish population was gone.</span> <span id="s524">There were only a handful of people who came back and even most of those didn't settle there.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Was that mostly a Jewish town?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: No, it was mixed but there were a lot of Jewish in there.</span> <span id="s527">Probably...I, I wouldn't say it was mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s528">I think it was probably more gentile, but there were a lot of Jews in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And when you got to your home, tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, the people that who were there, you know, were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s531">They put me of course and they, you know, they did what they could, you know, for me and they...I'm I'm not sure I should say they really resented that I came back but they did...you know, they were just...I just didn't feel comfortable in it and our neighbor who was a good friend of the family in fact had wanted to buy the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Well, before we get into that, did you...were you able to find out anything about the state of your family ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Not there.</span> <span id="s534">No.</span> <span id="s535">I had already found out pieces and things did not look too promising.</span> <span id="s536">Before...it took me as I said several weeks and we were talking to other people in...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: This is in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: This is in...not Prague as much but soon after, you know, through this several week journey.</span> <span id="s539">Then, you know, when I came there were people in this bigger town called that there was like a Jewish community, and you know, I went there and I had learned already that who came back and who didn't and also I was one of...because of the fact that I was in this hospital, I was one of the later ones to come back plus the fact many people who liberated earlier, like some of them were in camps that were liberated as early as January of '45 who were home already and they were...so you had picked up, you know, all kinds of pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: What did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: That the only thing that seems to be, you know, seems to be is that I had cousins.</span> <span id="s542">I had heard of some cousins, saw a couple, but no immediate family...aunts or uncles, nobody, no parents, so after being there for a while and then there was...you you know, that you sort of had a feeling that there doesn't seem to be, you know, you're keeping your fingers crossed, you're hoping.</span> <span id="s543">Then there was...in Romania they had a place where everybody would...was gravitating to, the ...somehow as I said we were moving more by the seat of the pants.</span> <span id="s544">Nobody had any...there were no plans.</span> <span id="s545">You went to the train.</span> <span id="s546">You got on the train.</span> <span id="s547">You moved.</span> <span id="s548">Somebody bugged you for a ticket...if it was a Hungarian or somebody, you just threw them off the train.</span> <span id="s549">A couple of people that I saw, they threw people off the train, conductors who were bugging them for tickets, because we didn't buy any tickets.</span> <span id="s550">But we ended up going to Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: This was after...?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s553">After home.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: When you got home you were telling us that somebody wanted to buy your house.</span> <span id="s555">Can you tell us...?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Right.</span> <span id="s557">This fellow wanted to buy the house and I just felt and I don't know why, but I didn't want to sell it.</span> <span id="s558">I felt number one, I had hoped that there...that somebody survived, yet and else I didn't want any money from...it just didn't look right for me to take money for it, so I told him that he has my permission, he's free to stay in the house as long as he wants to or if anybody...if any other member of my family comes back, it their's to decide to do whatever they want, and he asked me to give him that in writing and I did.</span> <span id="s559">I signed this piece of paper that he had written up, had somebody write it up for him, that gives him sole possession of this property that we have.</span> <span id="s560">We had other property, but the house basically, and he can stay there, and as I said only one stipulation...any member...any other member of my family can void that.</span> <span id="s561">And he gave me two sandwiches for that and I was...and I left.</span> <span id="s562">The next day I left town...</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: He gave you two sandwiches for that?</span> <span id="s564">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s565">I..</span> <span id="s566">.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Ever see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Never see him.</span> <span id="s569">Never saw him again.</span> <span id="s570">And I'm not sure that I have a desire to.</span> <span id="s571">Q: And then you say you went on to Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Then then we were going...you know, because we were told that people are gathering there, everybody seems to be gravitating there, and they had more records there, you can find out, so I went to Romania, and that was another...it took maybe a week to get there...but the...and you know, you're looking, mingling.</span> <span id="s573">There were all kinds of refugees there, you know, people in my position, mostly young people, you know, older than I but in their...</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You were about sixteen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I was about sixteen at the time, and they were all looking and mingling and, you know, did you...what town are you from?</span> <span id="s576">Do you know so and so?</span> <span id="s577">Whom...whom did you see?</span> <span id="s578">And after being there for I don't know how many days I was there...but learned nothing, so that's when I went back to Czechoslovakia, but not my home...home area.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: By this time, had you sort of given up hope or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Right.</span> <span id="s581">And I'll tell you what else happened.</span> <span id="s582">I ran into one of my older cousins and he had survived and his sister, and he said to me, you know, he says you are too young...you know, where are you going?</span> <span id="s583">I said I don't know where I'm going.</span> <span id="s584">We don't know either.</span> <span id="s585">He says why don't you come with us so where ever we'll go, at least...you know...and he was older.</span> <span id="s586">So I ended up going with them at and we stayed together till ...oh gee, that was...till 1946 or '47, and then we ended up leaving and going to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Was that when you realized that everybody was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Well, I'll tell you I was not unique.</span> <span id="s589">It wasn't...I'm not sure that I really know exactly how I felt or when I felt.</span> <span id="s590">You had hoped...I hoped that at that time still that there is...I'm not sure as to what level really I decided that everybody is gone.</span> <span id="s591">In fact even today sometimes I I hope, I think maybe but...everybody was in the same boat and there was really...there was...you were no different and you sort of started to live, to...you know, will come back, because after doing searching and as I said I feel bad about it today, and sometimes as I said, I I have hope that I may run into one of my brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Ever dream about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: I used to at one time, a lot.</span> <span id="s594">I used to blame myself.</span> <span id="s595">Q: You blamed yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">......</span> <span id="s598">I used to blame myself for taking my brother and sort of push him...go with Mommy, in Auschwitz and he wanted to come with me and I said no, you're too young.</span> <span id="s599">Go with Mommy and I'll see you afterwards.</span> <span id="s600">And I had felt that if he had come with me that maybe I could have pulled him through.</span> <span id="s601">That that was the problem that I had, but really that that was...but that was soon after the war and I thought about that many a time, but I used to have nightmares and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: For a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s604">How do you describe long?</span> <span id="s605">I think that was.</span> <span id="s606">.</span> <span id="s607">it must...certainly several months maybe, maybe a year or two, but more...it was more probably a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: After you get back to Prague with your cousins, what happened to you?</span> <span id="s609">How did you get...?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Well, we settled in a town called Usti nad Labem where we stayed there and in fact it was easy to get quarters because there were a lot of Germans that were deported or that had left and we moved into one of the some, you know, nice residence from, you know, from a former German and, you know, you lived there free and things started to deteriorate there and then we finally decided we're going to leave, and then to Germany to go back to try to get to Israel.</span> <span id="s611">That was always...try to go to Israel, and I had registered finally to go to Israel and it was very difficult to do, in fact and I went...I was on several transports going and I remember, you know, after trying and trying and we got stopped every time, finally the same cousin of mine had told me let's stick together and maybe he says let's see what happens and as I was going through...and then there was a chance...I had a chance to come to this country.</span> <span id="s612">I wanted to go to Israel the worst way, so my cousin did tell me on several occasions that we should go together but then when it was so difficult to go to Israel, he said and it looked like I had an opportunity to came to come to America so...and I didn't want to go and he sort of convinced me to go to...he says don't be a fool.</span> <span id="s613">He says go to America.</span> <span id="s614">He says get an education he says, then Israel will need you more...can use you more with some education he says than today.</span> <span id="s615">There are enough people like you.</span> <span id="s616">We don't need any more.</span> <span id="s617">And that's how he wound up registering for this it's called the U.S. Children's Committee.</span> <span id="s618">The organization...an organization that was called the U.S. Children's Committee and I think it was sponsored I was told by Eleanor Roosevelt but at that time if you were under eighteen and had no immediate family in Europe or no immediate family in America, they would bring you here, and I lived in a children's home for a while and this was '47 I think.</span> <span id="s619">So at the end of '47, October finally, we were...we...finally our papers had cleared and I came to this country November 10th, '47.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, they took us off the boat in New York and they took us to some kind of a..</span> <span id="s622">.</span> <span id="s623">I don't know if it was a home or a hotel and we settled in.</span> <span id="s624">In fact it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s625">I was there no more than a half hour and somebody was paging me and I said they can't mean me, so somebody says it's for you.</span> <span id="s626">I said it can't be.</span> <span id="s627">I said nobody knows me.</span> <span id="s628">I don't know anybody in New York.</span> <span id="s629">I never even heard of...I said it's impossibility.</span> <span id="s630">So the...somebody came and told me this is definitely for somebody who came on this transport.</span> <span id="s631">His name is Mayer Adler, and I went and grabbed the phone and it turned out it was a cousin of mine, a second cousin who was...who lived in America, who saw in the newspaper...I guess they printed names and towns that people are coming from, who lived in New York and came to see me, and I had seen them, you know, for...but the whole purpose was at the time for the people who sponsored us is to farm us out and get us out of New York, so they were trying to encourage you and just to go anyplace but stay in New York, and I had a friend of mine who came before me who ended up settling in Cleveland so somebody had suggested towns, you know, any place and I I knew nothing about America really, absolutely nothing, so suggested to me...Cleve...I said fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Cleveland is a good place to be go, and the interesting thing to me at the time was that I was going to Cleveland and they put us on the train and somebody met us from the...it was like family service or it was called Jewish Family or Jewish Children's Organization, and on the train going to Cleveland I didn't know if I was going to Cleveland, Ohio or Ohio, Cleveland.</span> <span id="s633">That's how much I knew about it, where I was going to.</span> <span id="s634">But I arrived in Cleveland and they put us in an orphanage and the orphanage had a little problem with us because basically we were...most of us were about eighteen, nineteen, there abouts and we were all very old people, and they were trying to treat...I mean we were with an orphanage with kids who were under...basically most of them were under fifteen and sixteen and they were trying to treat us like kids and that didn't go over too well, so finally they had decided they better...you know, and they were trying to find homes for us.</span> <span id="s635">Some people had had found family here that they can go and live with, but I was one of the last ones out of there.</span> <span id="s636">In fact and then we were going to a school till...</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Did your family take you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Well, finally one of my teachers had taken...had requested that I come and live with them, and that's what I ended up doing.</span> <span id="s639">I lived with them for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And what has happened to you...without going into much detail, what has happened to you since that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well, we were going...and first of all we came in this class that I attended to and this teacher was teaching that class, was in a temple.</span> <span id="s642">It was all for people like myself who didn't speak English or spoke very little English who were being taught English and what ever else we could be taught and they were all boys and girls my age and it was a relatively small group and we were being taken, you know, we were going there and living in this orphanage and then as I said they were farming out.</span> <span id="s643">After being in that ..., that was November...I guess November then for several months I had finally, you know, I moved out of there and I wanted to get a job and this teacher talked me into it and I entered high...you know, public school, so to go into public school I had a problem because my English was far from what they wanted, so that I had gotten...and they gave me some tests and I qualified.</span> <span id="s644">They said they can put me in seventh grade, and I told them forget it.</span> <span id="s645">I'm not interested in going to school.</span> <span id="s646">I sure am not going to seventh grade, so after some mediation they gave me further testing and they took me on probation into high school, tenth grade.</span> <span id="s647">If I can cut it, I can stay there.</span> <span id="s648">If not, they're going to have to kick me out.</span> <span id="s649">I said that's fine, because in other subjects I qualified.</span> <span id="s650">I can be in high school, but English was a big problem, so that I entered high school and I went from...in a year and a half plus summer school...one summer school...and I finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">They kept telling me...they were very nice to me because they helped me with English and I had to take accelerated courses and I had to take, for example...I was very good at math and one semester I remember I took Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry in the same semester, and that created some problems because when I came to Trigonometry, the teacher used to tell me to go and do homework and see him after class so he can tell me what's going on because I didn't know what the hell was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Your experiences hadn't gotten in the way of your making an adjustment?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No.</span> <span id="s654">It didn't seem to be.</span> <span id="s655">I mean, you know, you...every so often you felt, you know, down, but as I said there were other people like myself and I had to go on with life.</span> <span id="s656">I mean you can't...there were people who felt sorry for themselves and I worked for those people and I didn't see any sense to that.</span> <span id="s657">In fact I, you know, nobody owes you anything.</span> <span id="s658">You have to go out and you can't blame people.</span> <span id="s659">Like the other people who even I know now who blame what happened and they blame their problems today on what happened to them...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And you've made a reasonably OK life for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: I think I did well.</span> <span id="s662">I think I'm...I've done financially OK.</span> <span id="s663">I've have good family, a couple of sons and a wife.</span> <span id="s664">You know, they seem to be self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s665">Everybody seems to be OK.</span> <span id="s666">But I I don't think I have, you know, anything to, you know, feel bad about.</span> <span id="s667">I did go through periods, for example, that I remember early, you know, after I had been in this country for some time, people came to me.</span> <span id="s668">People were applying for...I don't remember what year it was...but people were applying to Germany for "Wiedergutmachung" [financial restitution].</span> <span id="s669">Germany was paying people like myself...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Resti...restitution...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Restitution.</span> <span id="s672">I think it's called Wiedergutmachung, but I didn't want any part of that for some reason, and I still don't know why.</span> <span id="s673">I do...I sort of suspect I felt I just felt at the time and I still really feel that I didn't want to get paid for it.</span> <span id="s674">Whatever happened, happened.</span> <span id="s675">I wouldn't want it to happen again but I sure as hell don't want to get paid for it because it would sort of...it would sort of make it...it's like buying a piece of gum and paying for it.</span> <span id="s676">It just...I'm not holding anybody responsible but to get paid for it just didn't seem right.</span> <span id="s677">That's all and that was one of the problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: I think that's a good point, place to stop at.</span> <span id="s679">Unless there is something else that you want to tell us about or something you'd like to...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Nothing really.</span> <span id="s681">That's...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: There was one other area, and you you were in the army in in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Well, first of all let me back-track a little bit.</span> <span id="s684">There's a point that I remember for example I was with people in a camp where people were being killed and I..</span> <span id="s685">.</span> <span id="s686">this is my...I kid about this because I was with people that if you're really going to get killed, if you go someplace, you know...you know you see they're shooting people, so don't go there, and I remember when I was at a place where they were killing people and you could see it and I told guys, don't be stupid.</span> <span id="s687">Let's not go.</span> <span id="s688">He says what can you do?</span> <span id="s689">He says you've got to go there.</span> <span id="s690">I said what can they do you?</span> <span id="s691">They're going shoot you here.</span> <span id="s692">Let them shoot me as least where I want, not where...I could not convince anybody to follow me.</span> <span id="s693">I walked away from there and I'm standing here to say that I survived.</span> <span id="s694">I tried to talk to people and you know, you couldn't do it wholesale but you certainly could look for a chance.</span> <span id="s695">If you see a guy shoots you fifty, a hundred yards from where you are, try not to go there and I had a problem convincing somebody, you know, a bunch of people to do that and as I said you couldn't do in bunches but you could do it one at a time.</span> <span id="s696">I just got up and walked away, and nobody stopped me because, you know, of course if somebody had seen me, I would have been shot.</span> <span id="s697">Well hell, I was going to be shot anyhow so that was...just interesting how people are, but to go back to when I finished high school, I tried...I first of all, the same teacher who had...who really worked very hard with me, who was taking me, sort of helping me had wanted me to go on to college and it was very difficult because number one, six months before graduation, before I finished high school, I wanted to quit because it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s698">I was working part-time.</span> <span id="s699">I was studying a lot and I was doing accelerated courses and I was doing extra courses so that I can graduate faster than the normal...I kept on skipping grades.</span> <span id="s700">I went from ten the first six months to the last month of eleventh to the last month of twelfth... I just...I was fed up and and then friends of mine who were...who were in the same boat as I who didn't go to school, who were making good money, and here I had no money, working hard and so I was very...you know, it was difficult, so prior to that I had plans to go to college, but I just as I said it was very...it was getting impossible so this teacher had me promise that I I would...for her sake I would graduate high school, and after I got out of high school I couldn't get a job at all.</span> <span id="s701">It was very difficult and at that time there were just no jobs so I ended up...Jewish vocation got me a job with this company that I hated from day one and I wasn't going to stay there...it was just temporary.</span> <span id="s702">And that was 1950 and while I, you know, was there, then the Korean War broke out, so in the meantime I still couldn't find a job so I said the hell with it.</span> <span id="s703">I might as well stay till I get drafted, till I go in the Army, so I stayed there till I get in the Army.</span> <span id="s704">Now I didn't want to go in the Army but I ended up going in the Army and while in the Army...it was during the war and they shipped everybody to Korea and I had applied for the Intelligence Service and because of my languages I was accepted.</span> <span id="s705">Now I..</span> <span id="s706">.</span> <span id="s707">but I was shipped off to Germany.</span> <span id="s708">In fact my whole battalion that I traded with...that I trained with, most of them went to Korea and four of us were shipped that wanted to go into Intelligence Service and shipped uh to New Jersey, ultimately to go to Europe and in New Jersey they decided they only take took two of us and I was one of the two they shipped to Europe, where I ended up.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: How did you feel about being in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I didn't...I didn't particularly want to go to Korea so it didn't...it really didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s711">I had no problem going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s712">Some of the things I had to do ultimately were a little more difficult but I had to live... when I got in this was a very good job because number one when I got back to Germany for the first six months I was with 7th Army Headquarters and they didn't need me.</span> <span id="s713">I had absolutely nothing to do.</span> <span id="s714">I used to go payday and I said are you sure my name's still on the pay...on the pay roster.</span> <span id="s715">But it was because we were exempt from duties and there was absolutely...I used to just get up in time to go to the for meals and then go and do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you...I understand that you ended up in the intelligence service.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Can you tell us something about that and about interrogating...talking to Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Well, part of the job then, finally when I had gotten an assignment, it was to gather information and we were doing and interpreting and uh and I was dealing with Germans.</span> <span id="s720">That what I was dealing mostly with Germans, not mostly...in fact ninety-nine percent.</span> <span id="s721">In fact I was sat up in a place, in a home where they rented a huge mansion.</span> <span id="s722">The Army owned them as intelligence outposts and while we were gathering information on Russia and subversion and all kinds of things, and then I think it was in 1950...must have been '52 that we had decided that we needed...they're going to have a West German Army, because East Germany had formed their...their own army, so the United States decided we wanted one of those and my...one of my jobs was at the time to go and select some officers for the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: They you with selecting German ...</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: That was...that was a little problem.</span> <span id="s725">I was talking to people, you know, and I had done a lot of things with Germans.</span> <span id="s726">In fact I had a very good job because they built me up in fact to because I could pass off as a German.</span> <span id="s727">I spoke fluent German at the time and there was really...there were all kinds of things that I did for...for the Army.</span> <span id="s728">You know, I had the a good life as far as, you know, I lived with maid service, no, no army kind of crap of any kind, but this one job, as I said it was to go dig out officers who looked on paper to be, you know, who were Wehrmacht, not Nazis, and try to decide who we will OK as...who would be, you know, who you can trust more.</span> <span id="s729">And I remember writing a report on one saying that I had a problem, that if I had a Germany army for my friend, for my allies behind me, and I the Russians in front of me who were my enemies, I wouldn't know which side to look first at.</span> <span id="s730">So...but that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did you detect any Nazi background on some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s733">There was a lot of that, but none of them were always Nazis, and then, you know, the office social life really was...I I had to socialize with a lot of Germans too, and it's really...I lived, as I said it was...the fellow who had my job before me didn't succeed and he was a seasoned army person, only because he didn't know how to...he couldn't get along with Germans really.</span> <span id="s734">You had to be able...it was important to do what I did and but to do what I did I had to be able to get along with them, and the Army didn't care much about my background and it was really...</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Any conflict about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s737">I did what I I had to do.</span> <span id="s738">I didn't do anything that hurt anybody to the extent, certainly nothing that I wouldn't talk about.</span> <span id="s739">I didn't do anything that was treating somebody unfairly.</span> <span id="s740">But it was an interesting part of an education for me and it was...and it was actually it was good experience and it was...it it meant...it...I was com...I was comfortable with what I did.</span> <span id="s741">It was difficult to do it many a time and some parts of it were very difficult, but I enjoyed the freedom that I can do...I like to do what I do with very little...as long as whatever I have to do, I have no restrictions, I can do...I can do a good job, but I I don't like to follow...to follow rules too much and...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: It's a good thing that you didn't follow rules, or you wouldn't be here today.</span> <span id="s743">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s744">Well that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s746">A: OK.</span> <span id="s747">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
