id="s2">NL: Dr. Samson, I want to again thank you very much for coming this long distance from Princeton in order to make your story part of our Oral History Archive.</span> <span id="s3">Let's start, if we may, by asking if you could tell us a little about your beginnings, your background, place of birth, something about your family, where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s5">Let's begin with my name.</span> <span id="s6">I am named Sonja.</span> <span id="s7">I am named after my maternal grandmother, who died before I was born, and in the Jewish tradition, a child should be named after the deceased closest kin.</span> <span id="s8">Her name was Susanna, and my mother did not like that name at all.</span> <span id="s9">Now, how do we get to the name Sonja?</span> <span id="s10">My grandparents, on both sides, Samson, and my mother's maiden name, Hoffman, all were born and raised in a town in the northeastern part of Germany close to the ocean and adjacent to the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s11">The name of the town is Aurich, A-U-R-I-C-H.</span> <span id="s12">I met a cousin in the early 50's, the only time I went to Israel, whose name was, like my father's, Joseph Samson, and he said he had traced the family genealogy to the Samsons having originated in Italy, and moved northward in the 16th Century.</span> <span id="s13">And part of the family ended up in Holland, part of the family in Germany.</span> <span id="s14">This cousin, Joseph Samson, who would be a man my father's age, they were first cousins, his branch of the family ended up in Holland, and my family in Germany.</span> <span id="s15">My maternal grandfather, Aaron Hoffman, was also called Adolf Hoffman, went into an apprenticeship, as was common in those days, to learn to be a salesman.</span> <span id="s16">You know that they apprenticed for years.</span> <span id="s17">So, during the course of his apprenticeship, he met his wife, my grandmother, maternal.</span> <span id="s18">Her name was Hilda Loew, L-O-E-W.</span> <span id="s19">She came from a southern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s20">They married and they established themselves in the Saar, which is adjacent to France, the French border.</span> <span id="s21">They were very successful, both of them starting from zero, and took advantage, I guess, of the fact that this was coal mines, that's what the Saar was about, and ended up with a substantial department store, probably one of the largest in the region, in a town named Dillingen, the capital of Saar is Saarbrücken, and Dillingen is not far from there.</span> <span id="s22">They did so well that by American dollars, by American standards--and I can go back into documenting how I know this to be a fact--but apparently they were millionaires.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">NL: First generation...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">SS: First generation.</span> <span id="s25">Right.</span> <span id="s26">Accordingly, my mother, Carla Hoffman, was born in Dillingen, and so was her brother, who was three years older than her.</span> <span id="s27">His name was Ludwig, or Louis.</span> <span id="s28">Now, since the rest of the family, that is my maternal grandfather, Aaron Hoffman, came from Aurich, he had some five or six siblings who were all in Aurich.</span> <span id="s29">Thus, there was a lot of traveling up and back between Aurich and Dillingen.</span> <span id="s30">Thus, I assume that my mother knew my father from childhood on.</span> <span id="s31">My father's family, the Samsons, were quite wealthy, quite well-to-do in a profession that is not thought of commonly as being a Jewish profession, but they were cattle-raisers.</span> <span id="s32">They raised cattle and sold cattle--Viehhändler.</span> <span id="s33">Do you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">NL: I read it.</span> <span id="s35">I read it.</span> <span id="s36">I understand some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">SS: So the Samsons, also, I think they are my paternal grandfather, Rubin Samson, has something like five brothers, all raised in Aurich.</span> <span id="s38">When my mother married my father in 1929, I think--I was born in 1931, they settled in Aurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NL: And you were born there?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">SS: And I was born in Aurich.</span> <span id="s41">Now back to the name--I lost it!</span> <span id="s42">So, I was to be named Susanna after my father's mother who had died.</span> <span id="s43">My mother did not like the name.</span> <span id="s44">1931, the 30's, was the height of the flourishing of Communism, especially in the Saar, among miners...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">SS: ...and my mother, being a rebellious lady, chose the name Sonja, which was a popular...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: But despite her upper middle class...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">SS: Right!</span> <span id="s49">Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s50">NL: ...rank, she had sympathy for the workers, the proletariat...?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">SS: Right, right.</span> <span id="s52">And neither parents, my father nor my mother, ever called me Sonja, except when somebody was angry, then it was "Zonyal".</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: What did they call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SS: Sonie.</span> <span id="s55">Sonie.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">NL: Sonie.</span> <span id="s57">Ah, that's nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">SS: So that was the only name that I really responded to.</span> <span id="s59">Sonja was always...</span></p> <p><span id="s60">NL: When you were being scolded?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">SS: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">NL: And what was their life like in the 30's?</span> <span id="s63">Was there a lot of labor discontent?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">SS: Well, I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s65">My, uh</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: From what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SS: Let's go back to Dillingen then.</span> <span id="s68">My mother and her brother were said to be raised as spoiled brats.</span> <span id="s69">He was said to have been a playboy, and the reason that that has been for me personally, problematic, is that, on the one hand, no one close in family survived.</span> <span id="s70">I'm really the only survivor, with the exception of one cousin, first cousin, Samson, and his sister, who have followed the pattern.</span> <span id="s71">And that is, the pattern has been, any time I ever wanted to talk to any distant relative in the United States, or this first cousin, whatever they have to say is totally colored by still ongoing envy, resentment and jealousy.</span> <span id="s72">It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s73">So that it's always been relatives of my parents' generation, that is, their first cousins, you know, the other side, and whatever, and there's still, "Oh, we remember Aurich and the parties" and all that.</span> <span id="s74">But in fact, I promptly gave up asking them anything because, well, at the time, it was disturbing.</span> <span id="s75">As I look upon it now, I'm keenly aware of the fact that their profound jealousy, resentment, in spite of the fact that these people, my parents, they were in camps, they were slaughtered in Aurich, I mean in Auschwitz, and all the rest.</span> <span id="s76">None of that seems to have erased the intensity of their envy.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NL: Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">SS: Yeah!</span> <span id="s79">This includes, by the way, my cousin Henry Samson, who is my first cousin, as I said.</span> <span id="s80">He survived in Belgium, with his sister.</span> <span id="s81">When I first moved to New Jersey, I contacted him, and all I got was in fact, in these photo albums there are photos of his sister, him and I as children, and the amazing thing about the photos--I look happy in the pictures, but they look surly.</span> <span id="s82">And he starts out with, "Oh, I remember when we went to visit you at your house in Aurich, how it was a big deal for all of us, you know, going to see Sonja and her family, and it was so wealthy, so opulent."</span> <span id="s83">And they just--in fact, they themselves, were quite well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">NL: But you were a notch higher?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">SS: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">NL: You were a notch higher?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SS: Oh, G-d knows, I was an only child and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">NL: But, I mean, the image of this wealth...</span></p> <p><span id="s89">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s90">So, I decided, the hell with all these people.</span> <span id="s91">At some level, there had been some fantasy on my part about this cousin who lived in Edison, New Jersey, that it would be nice...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SS: But I'm not willing go put up with that kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">NL: Break down all of those old...</span></p> <p><span id="s95">SS: Yeah, and to hell with it, to hell with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">NL: Do you have any memories of your life in Aurich as a child, so up to six...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">SS: Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s98">I do.</span> <span id="s99">More than that, I think for a terribly long time, I had an incredibly reliable, clear, uncluttered memory for events, which I've lost.</span> <span id="s100">And part of the reason, I think, was that I had made a very deliberate and conscious attempt to remember dates, places and so on, because until 1946 or '47, I always thought I would see my parents again, and it was important for me to fill in for them everything that had happened to me, where I had been, and what I had done.</span> <span id="s101">So my memory is sketchy, but, nonetheless, I think at some level, it's relatively sharp.</span> <span id="s102">About my mother, I remember vividly her stories of World War I. I don't know if you want to go into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s104">If you don't mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">SS: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">NL: She told these to you when you were a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">SS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">NL: She suffered much?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SS: No.</span> <span id="s110">My mother, I think, in part, one of the reasons for the family's intense dislike of her, I mean, that they couldn't overcome it, aside from the kind of, you know, sociological perspective, one notch higher.</span> <span id="s111">I think, in fact, she was a very interesting lady.</span> <span id="s112">She was an exceptional woman in the sense that, well, she went to school in Lausanne, so she spoke French fluently.</span> <span id="s113">It's been put down as having been a finishing school, but you know, a school by any other name was a school.</span> <span id="s114">She once broke her arm during World War I, she remembers that--remembered that--and was in a rehabilitation center in which they, because the arm was stiff, they put it in some kind of machinery, you know, that bent the arm backwards and forwards.</span> <span id="s115">And there were all these miners with their injuries, and she said that she cut the fan belt that activated the machine, and the whole thing stopped, and everybody was delighted.</span> <span id="s116">Now, whether that in fact was true or not--how the hell do I know?</span> <span id="s117">But, it says something about what kind of person she was, or pictured herself.</span> <span id="s118">She told stories about how they used to play war, how buildings would come tumbling down.</span> <span id="s119">She remembered, she said, being gassed, you know, gas was being used, and said in case that ever happens, just urinate in your underwear and hold it in front of your nose--and breathe through it!</span></p> <p><span id="s120">NL: Did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">SS: Apparently, apparently!</span> <span id="s122">But I've never forgotten that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NL: Quite a trick!</span> <span id="s124">Amazing.</span> <span id="s125">Probably an old wives' tale that worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">SS: Possibly.</span> <span id="s127">There seems to be some notion that maybe it does.</span> <span id="s128">Anyway, she fought, as I do, the perennial battle of the bulge, that is gaining excessive amounts of weight, and dieting, and that is also quite apparent in the photos.</span> <span id="s129">You know, expansion and contraction.</span> <span id="s130">And I seem to have the identical problem.</span> <span id="s131">My father was an exceedingly handsome man.</span> <span id="s132">Again, the photos show that.</span> <span id="s133">A very bright man, a very brave man, and a man of character, and his motto was, "Un homme sa parole", which means, A man, his word.</span> <span id="s134">And, that's how he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">NL: You heard that?</span> <span id="s136">You heard that phrase?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s138">And he lived that, and he died that.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">NL: You had a happy childhood, I take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">SS: Extremely.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: Although you were alone, you had playmates, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">SS: No, but you know, that's an American meshugas, when you need playmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">NL: Oh, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">SS: Or when you need toys, or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NL: How did you amuse yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SS: You want to go back to Aurich...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: Just a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">SS: And I, sometimes, you know, the stories that one recalls best about oneself, have a way, just like my mother's story, of saying something about the person, and I think at some level, I haven't changed, or there's a part of me that's still that.</span> <span id="s149">In Aurich, where we had a house--it was a big house--because I did go there after the war.</span> <span id="s150">It was then occupied, by, I don't know, five or six families lived in that house.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: Huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">And, you know, we had maids, and in Dillingen, I remember the chauffeur and his children, and the neighbors, and so on.</span> <span id="s154">But anyway, we lived--the house in Aurich was am Hafen, which means, I can't think of the word.</span> <span id="s155">It was on the riverbank.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">NL: Am Hafen...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">SS: Am--by Hafen means port, or bank, riverbank.</span> <span id="s158">And I remember one of my earliest memories was when I was about four years old.</span> <span id="s159">We left Aurich, I think, in 1936 or '37.</span> <span id="s160">I left in '36, so I was five years old, and joined my grandparents when I moved to Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s161">I lived with them for one year.</span> <span id="s162">My parents moved to northern France.</span> <span id="s163">But anyway, so whatever recall I have of Aurich has to be before the age of five.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SS: One story: This river which was in front of the house--well, there was the house, a road and the river, and that river always had logs transported, whatever, and that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s166">You couldn't go down, step down onto the river on the logs.</span> <span id="s167">Well, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NL: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">SS: With the neighbor boys, and I fell in and I got soaking wet and I went home, and when I got home, I was first greeted by the maid, who asked me what had I done, and it was clear.</span> <span id="s170">She spanked me and put me to bed.</span> <span id="s171">My mother came home and asked, "Where's Sonie?"</span> <span id="s172">and the maid told her.</span> <span id="s173">My mother came upstairs, spanked me, and said, "Don't do that again."</span> <span id="s174">And when my father came home, late in the evening, he did the same story.</span> <span id="s175">So that was the only time I could remember three spankings.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">NL: Three spankings How did you amuse yourself?</span> <span id="s177">Do you remember if you looked at picture books?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">SS: I re--well, in part, there are lots of photos, you know, sometimes it happens that when you look at photos, they cloud one's memory, and it becomes fixed to a photo in part.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">NL: I see what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">SS: So there is the, you know, a sandbox, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s181">I remember my mother, I think, loved to travel.</span> <span id="s182">She was a rather cosmopolitan lady and Aurich was kind of a dull dump and a hole, and so I recall frequently being on trains with her, visiting up and back.</span> <span id="s183">In fact, at times when I had the urge, or thought I should write a kind of autobiography, I was going to call it "Trains."</span> <span id="s184">There's so much good and bad, horrible and soothing in my life...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">NL: In Germany, mostly?</span> <span id="s186">Or across the borders?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">SS: Both.</span> <span id="s188">The across-the-border story with my mother was--and that I have a pictorial recall.</span> <span id="s189">We were crossing the border, my mother had smuggled something.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: This was already by '36, '37?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SS: No, no, this was also still before, after...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NL: You getting tired?</span> <span id="s193">You want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">SS: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s195">Whatever she smuggled, I don't remember--whether it was French liqueur or French--God knows what, but at the appropriate time when the inspector came, I recall lying on the bank, on a, you know, the thing you lie down on in the train.</span> <span id="s196">It's interesting when I think back, German, French and English sort of--English is not the language that...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">NL: That you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">SS: That I remember it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">NL: You don't remember it in--you think of it in French or German.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">SS: Well, as a friend once pointed out to me, in German I tell the truth, in French...</span></p> <p><span id="s201">NL: You elaborate?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">SS: No.</span> <span id="s203">In French, I lie, and in English, I intellectualize.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">NL: Oh my, that' a quite profound statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">SS: It is, because when I try--there are times that I sort of get external and out of touch, and if I want to get a sense of what am I really feeling, I try to think in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">NL: Still that powerful pulse of the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s208">But it's like layers, you know, like an onion.</span> <span id="s209">So anyway, on that train, I remember being awakened by the customs inspectors, as is--was customary--whenever you crossed the border, and just as he was looking through the luggage, I just vomited all over the place, and he ran off.</span> <span id="s210">This was one of my mother's favorite stories about me!</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NL: Oh, my, that's marvelous.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">SS: The other early story was in Dillingen, in my grandparents' department store--no, it wasn't in the store.</span> <span id="s213">I don't know, we were someplace, somewhere, in some town, some city.</span> <span id="s214">We were in a fancy restaurant, and the story that my mother told, and that a cousin who currently lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, confirmed, was that as I came back to the dinner table, I yelled with my most exuberant self, "Mutti, Mutti, ich habe einen grossen Haufen geschissen."</span> <span id="s215">Which means, "Mother, Mother, I shit a pile!"</span> <span id="s216">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s217">NL: That's a marvelous story!</span></p> <p><span id="s218">SS: So you want to know about playmates and stuff like that...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">NL: Well, that's the American bias.</span> <span id="s220">I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">SS: Well, it is an obnoxious kind of a bias, because we instilled in the kids that happiness is other kids to play with.</span> <span id="s222">And, you know, I didn't and...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">NL: You were happy...</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SS: ...and that wasn't part of my world, and when I was with kids, mostly it involved being in mischief, mostly for the reason of not being visible as a Jew.</span> <span id="s225">If there was something nasty to be done, which--it was a good cover up, and I was very deliberate and very conscious about doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">NL: Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s227">SS: I can tell a lot of stories about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">NL: Was there, then, a sense that you were not wanted there as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">SS: No.</span> <span id="s230">I'm referring mostly later.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">NL: Oh, later.</span> <span id="s232">But how about during this period up to the time that you moved away to Luxembourg?</span> <span id="s233">Were your parents involved in the so-called Jewish community at all?</span> <span id="s234">Did they go to shul?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">SS: Well, you know, all the stuff that's been written about German Jews being so assimilated and all that, my family on both sides were very interesting.</span> <span id="s236">On the one hand, they were utterly assimilated.</span> <span id="s237">My father was a very successful businessman, got along extremely well with his customers, the peasants.</span> <span id="s238">They trusted him, both in Germany and in France, where he really worked for a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s239">They trusted him.</span> <span id="s240">He was sort of like his own veterinarian.</span> <span id="s241">He never needed the recourse of a veterinarian, and at the same time, they were Orthodox Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">SS: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: How many Jews do you suppose were in Aurich?</span> <span id="s245">A handful?</span> <span id="s246">Several hundred?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">SS: It was a substantial Jewish community.</span> <span id="s248">It had a substantial shul, and just about in Milwaukee, in Chicago, in various places, there are a lot of Aurich Jews, and they flock together.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">SS: In fact, both in Chicago and in Milwaukee, two cousins who were brothers, Hoffmans, established their own synagogue to recreate...</span></p> <p><span id="s251">NL: The German.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SS: The German...</span></p> <p><span id="s253">NL: ...model.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s255">So, I'm terrible about estimating numbers, but I would say a number of sufficient to found their own synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">NL: And did you go to shul with your parents?</span> <span id="s257">Do you remember going?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">SS: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s259">In Aurich, no so much.</span> <span id="s260">Well, yeah, I remember in Dillingen, where my grandparents were.</span> <span id="s261">I remember in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s262">Again, about my mother--my father was Orthodox, didn't wear a beard, he didn't wear peyes [side curls], but he laid the tefillin [phylacteries].</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: Did he?</span> <span id="s264">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s265">Totally assimilated man...</span></p> <p><span id="s266">SS: And totally kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">NL: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">SS: I mean, I remember a story onetime when he came home because he traveled during the day and came home late at night, so I knew him relatively less well than I know my mother.</span> <span id="s269">I remember him coming home and being really sick to his stomach, and what had happened is he had eaten at some peasants.</span> <span id="s270">And I don't know how it happened, because he was very cautious.</span> <span id="s271">He thought he had eaten pork, and he just spent the rest of the day vomiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">NL: So you were raised very much in a Jewish religious tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">SS: Well, a crazy one, because of my mother.</span> <span id="s274">This crazy lady had five sets of dishes--milchig, fleischig, milchig and fleischig for Pesach, and trayf [dairy, meat, not kosher].</span> <span id="s275">And whenever my father was away, she would ceremoniously pull out the trayf dishes.</span> <span id="s276">And we'd have trayf.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">NL: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">SS: But, she never contaminated the dishes.</span> <span id="s279">We always had two kitchen tables, two sinks, two everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">NL: Two kitchen tables--that I've never heard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">SS: Two sets of towels?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">NL: Two sets of--two tables?</span> <span id="s283">Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NL: Do you remember any Eastern European Jews in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">NL: This is probably a little too far west for them, I would think they might...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">SS: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NL: Poland or Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">SS: No.</span> <span id="s291">And you know, as I mentioned, in Milwaukee and in Chicago, there is this whole colony of people from Aurich that I would have nothing to do with.</span> <span id="s292">I really don't like these people at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">NL: Sometimes this syndrome is associated with a certain smugness, but obviously this wasn't true of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">SS: Ah, petty, greedy...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">NL: ...provincial...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">SS: The reason that my accent is as bastardly as it is, when I came to the United States in 1947, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s297">I came by myself to join these relatives, and, I had forgotten German, because it was important during the War in France that I do, but at home these people only spoke German, and when I spoke English, they corrected me with their German accent.</span> <span id="s298">So I came to Milwaukee to learn English!</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: You were under many different contradictory influences.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s301">I came to Milwaukee to learn English, but instead, I had to learn German.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">NL: Your English is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">SS: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">NL: Did you go to school in Aurich?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">SS: No.</span> <span id="s306">I was under five.</span> <span id="s307">But, an interesting thing when I lived with my grandparents okay.</span> <span id="s308">In 1935 or 1936--I think, it was '35, there was the plebiscite, the Saar plebiscite, was it, do you know if...?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">NL: '35.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">SS: '35.</span> <span id="s311">Since my grandparents were from the Saar and yesterday when I looked through some of these documents for you, there was mention of that, too--apparently, my parents, during those years and even though they lived in Aurich, assumed or operated under a Saar citizenship.</span> <span id="s312">And since they opted--so during the plebiscite, as you well know--it meant that the Saar population could vote with it to become French or German, and, for all I know, the results were rigged in favor of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">NL: Overwhelmingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">SS: Overwhelmingly.</span> <span id="s315">Anyway, as people who had voted for France, they were given the option to leave, and it is under these conditions that they left, and I think that explains also, why the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s317">Why did they prefer France?</span> <span id="s318">Can you tell me that?</span> <span id="s319">Do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">SS: I don't, except that...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">NL: Well, Hitler was already in power.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">SS: Hitler was in power.</span> <span id="s323">I have one memory of--well, my mother, by virtue of her Swiss schooling and Swiss--in the French Swiss-spoke French fluently, and so would have been Francophile...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NL: Oh, so they were obviously afraid of...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">SS: They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Tape 1, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s327">SS: The one memory that I do have of Hitler was walking down the streets of Aurich with my mother.</span> <span id="s328">I might say that when I went back to Aurich in 1953, and I'll explain later my purpose for going, which was monetary, in my head Aurich was a small Dorf [village], you know, a little speck on the map!</span> <span id="s329">In fact, I was awed--it's a big city.</span> <span id="s330">It's a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">NL: Of course it has grown.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">SS: It has grown, but still...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">NL: Do you remember it as a tiny place?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">SS: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s335">In part, because, also, one of the early stories was an aunt who lived toward the center of Aurich, marketplace, and we lived, I guess, where the river was, more the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s336">Whenever I didn't like things at home, that is, with my mother, I would just take off and cross town and go to my aunt's.</span> <span id="s337">All by myself!</span></p> <p><span id="s338">NL: You were an independent child!</span></p> <p><span id="s339">SS: Oh, yes, I was very independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">NL: That's so much in conflict with the norms of that German-Jewish upper class, upper-middle class culture.</span> <span id="s341">Little girls just didn't do those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">SS: Well, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">NL: ...did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">SS: I have a feeling that this country's head is full of mushy stereotypes, which in fact, may or may not apply.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">NL: But--you were unusual, weren't you?</span> <span id="s346">A girl of your age...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">SS: I had an unusual mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">NL: But most Jewish mothers weren't like your mother in Aurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">SS: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">NL: So, you broke out...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">SS: You asked me about toys--I remember the earliest toy that I remember.</span> <span id="s352">There were dolls, and as photos will attest to, I didn't like dolls.</span> <span id="s353">And there are pictures of me with dolls.</span> <span id="s354">Maybe you can find--I didn't like them.</span> <span id="s355">She gave me an erector set, and I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">NL: That's interesting.</span> <span id="s357">I didn't like dolls either.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">SS: But anyway, so the earliest early memory was walking down the streets of Aurich, the shopping center, with my mother, when all of a sudden there were all kinds of sounds, noises, and this was, I guess, Hitler coming through town with his entourage, and I remember my mother just pulling me and running into a store.</span> <span id="s359">And, again, unlike American brats today, one didn't say, "Why do I have to go with you, Mommy?"</span> <span id="s360">You just did it.</span> <span id="s361">You felt it, You did it.</span> <span id="s362">Maybe that's a difference.</span> <span id="s363">Children did not challenge...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">NL: ...authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">SS: ...the adults.</span> <span id="s366">That's...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">NL: Can you tell us now why Mother and Dad, Mother and Father, separated from you in '35 or '36, and why you went to Luxembourg while they went to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">SS: I--you know, at the time, 1936, I was five years old, so I was not privy to...</span></p> <p><span id="s369">NL: Can you re-</span></p> <p><span id="s370">SS: No, all I remember was that it was happy to be with my grandparents in Ettelbruck and my assumption--Ettelbruck is in Luxembourg--and my assumption would be that they wanted the time to resettle and get their affairs and everything in order.</span> <span id="s371">But, again, it was a happy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">NL: It was a happy time?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s374">I was the first grandchild, much adored.</span> <span id="s375">I remember, you know, you asked about other kids.</span> <span id="s376">I always wore silk clothes, and always had something which I have thought since as being very neat--the underwear matched the dress.</span> <span id="s377">So that when the boys would flip up the dress, you know, it was all matching.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">NL: Oh, that was real elegance.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s380">And because my recollection of myself was that I was sort of, not a very neat little girl, whenever I got dirty, they changed my clothes and got me angeputzt [dressed up].</span></p> <p><span id="s381">NL: In an ensemble?</span> <span id="s382">And where did Mother and Father go?</span> <span id="s383">What city of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">SS: They didn't go to a city.</span> <span id="s385">They moved into a village by the name of Rocquigny, R-O-C-Q-U-I-G-N-Y, which is in the Ardennes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">NL: And Father planned to re-establish his business there, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">SS: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s388">They bought a house and he had cattle and did the same thing he did in Germany.</span> <span id="s389">And judging by letters that I have, documents, which appear to be character references, apparently he did well, was highly respected and liked.</span> <span id="s390">And unlike her, he didn't know French and learned it.</span> <span id="s391">In fact, someplace I found a little book that he used to study French for vocabulary.</span> <span id="s392">So my stay with my grandparents was a happy one.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">NL: And how long did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SS: I would imagine, I think it was about a year.</span> <span id="s395">But, you know, my parents would come and go and visit.</span> <span id="s396">The interesting thing is, again, keeping in mind that my grandfather was an Orthodox man.</span> <span id="s397">I remember him saying, and I remember going to shul with them in Ettelbruck, being very condescending of Jews who used organ music in shul, and he said, "When people listen to music, they don't pray."</span> <span id="s398">So he was against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">NL: And you remembered that?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">SS: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s401">To this day, I don't feel comfortable in a Reformed shul–at all.</span> <span id="s402">In fact, if anything, I would characterize myself as an Orthodox atheist.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">NL: Oh!</span> <span id="s404">I wasn't prepared for that!</span></p> <p><span id="s405">SS: I'm both.</span> <span id="s406">If I relate to anything Jewish, then the feelings are Orthodox tradition, and so on.</span> <span id="s407">Okay.</span> <span id="s408">Anyway, my one--I have many memories of Ettelbruck–but one I remember in particular was being in a religious Catholic, run by nuns, school.</span> <span id="s409">And I remember that--it must have been at Christmastime, because there was the créche, you know, with the little porcelain Holy Family, and where the big treat was for every child to be able to hold the little Jesus--and I think I dropped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">NL: And it broke?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">SS: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NL: Were you punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">SS: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: Or reprimanded?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">SS: Not really.</span> <span id="s416">But it was understood that children are clumsy, or something like that, and you shouldn't do it, and I felt bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">NL: Were there other Jewish children in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s419">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s420">That's the only...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: You don't remember feeling conspicuous as a Jewish child, especially?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">SS: As a child, as I said, I was well-fed, well-nourished, well taken care of.</span> <span id="s423">I never felt deprived.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">NL: But in the school setting?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">SS: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s426">But it occurred to me as an adult, reflecting upon that, apparently my grandfather foresaw something, or a lot, and that that was part of a kind of training he wanted me to have--to know how to get along with goyim [non-Jews].</span></p> <p><span id="s427">NL: Aha!</span> <span id="s428">Or was it their adaptation?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">SS: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s430">Remember, the man was an Orthodox Jewish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">NL: He couldn't very well conceal his beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">SS: He didn't wear a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">NL: He didn't wear a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">SS: None of them wore beards.</span> <span id="s435">Okay, to give you a sense of that--my grandfather died of illness in 1938.</span> <span id="s436">It was some kind of cancer, skin, excruciatingly painful, and, again, it's the same story all over again.</span> <span id="s437">I have one of the cousins who imported me, facilitated my coming to the United States, in Chicago, was a physician.</span> <span id="s438">And the same story--I couldn't get any meaningful information about my family.</span> <span id="s439">Now, I understand that what he died of was a kind of condition that is rare but predominantly found among Jews.</span> <span id="s440">And I mentioned that to a friend who's a dermatologist once, who could name it...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NL: And there is that pattern?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">SS: There is that, and I forget what it was.</span> <span id="s443">Anyway, so he died of illness in 1938.</span> <span id="s444">He was transported from Luxembourg to a hospital in Strasbourg in France.</span> <span id="s445">That's also where he's buried.</span> <span id="s446">And my mother apparently had promised him that she would never smoke on Shabbes.</span> <span id="s447">And my mother, like I, or I, like my mother, was a chain smoker, and I never knew her to smoke on Shabbes or Yom Kippur, even after he died.</span> <span id="s448">You know, what I'm saying about this sense of...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s450">Very strong sense of uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">SS: Commitment...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NL: The appropriateness of these values.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">SS: A commitment.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">NL: A commitment.</span> <span id="s455">Yeah.</span> <span id="s456">Past death.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">NL: In Luxembourg itself, through the 30's--well, you were there only a year...</span></p> <p><span id="s459">SS: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NL: And you were a very little girl.</span> <span id="s461">You don't have any sense, either, as a result of your experiences at the time or what you learned about the situation later, were there any rumbling of neo-Nazism or Nazism...?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">SS: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">NL: Were Jews suffering in Luxembourg?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">SS: I know that my grandparents were absolutely, as you noticed on the photos, you know, they look upon me as the adored child.</span> <span id="s465">They were extremely proud of the fact that I learned to speak the Luxembourg, which is a Plattdeutsch [Low German], fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s467">You picked it up in that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s469">And you know, this delighted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">NL: There were apparently no ominous signs during that year--political signs.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">SS: I'm sure there were.</span> <span id="s472">I'm sure that there were.</span> <span id="s473">I mean, I remember, that image is mostly in France, listening to the radio, I'm hearing Hitler blasting out in the familiar dog bark.</span> <span id="s474">Yes, I think that one sensed it, that it was there, but obviously at age five or six, I had no way, really, I don't think, of conceptualizing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: And so, after a year, Mother and Father then took you with them?</span> <span id="s476">Is that what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s478">Then I came to France, and I didn't know a damn word of French, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s479">NL: You had to learn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">SS: ...at age seven, I guess, I learned French.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NL: Best time in the world to learn a language, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NL: You picked it up quickly, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s484">And what were some of your impressions of the French school?</span> <span id="s485">You were enrolled in a school, I suppose.</span> <span id="s486">Was that a difficult adjustment for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">SS: It was difficult because by the time I got there, they were doing fractions that I didn't know.</span> <span id="s488">I didn't know how to do fractions.</span> <span id="s489">It was difficult because of the way the French do divisions, for example, is different from the way they do divisions in Germany.</span> <span id="s490">So it was difficult for my parents to help me, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s491">But, then, that was good training.</span> <span id="s492">That became a way of life, because during the ten years that I lived in France, I once counted having attended something--I don't remember--I told you once--how many schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">BL: Fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">SS: For the ten years I lived in 14 different places, and I don't know, I was in school, I wasn't in school, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">NL: For how long a time were things relatively equable for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">SS: In France?</span> <span id="s497">Well, 1939, my father volunteered into the French army, so he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">NL: Excuse me--as far as you know, out of some feeling of identification with the anti-Nazi cause?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">NL: And/or a way of achieving French citizenship, or had he already acquired that?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">SS: Oh, no!</span> <span id="s502">Come on!</span> <span id="s503">You know very well that you could be in France for 582 years and never attain French citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NL: But I thought service in the army accelerated that process.</span> <span id="s505">Anyhow, it's not relevant here at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">SS: Maybe.</span> <span id="s507">No, I think more--for a long, long time, I was--I succumbed to the Bruno Bettelheims, and the Hannah Arendt notion of Jews being led to the slaughter like sheep, you know?</span> <span id="s508">And I really felt angry at some level, or anguish about my parents not having come to America when they had the money, about not having gone into hiding when they could have or should have.</span> <span id="s509">And yet, as I alone struggled through this, I returned back to: "But, who are these people, my parents?"</span> <span id="s510">That's what I said--"Un homme sa parole"--and I remember my father saying, "Why should I hide?</span> <span id="s511">God knows I am an honest man.</span> <span id="s512">Honest men do not hide."</span> <span id="s513">I mean, there was this kind of--at some point, I must judge it, and I put it down as a kind of naive, blind, you know, religion kind of thing.</span> <span id="s514">In fact, I was wrong.</span> <span id="s515">I was profoundly wrong.</span> <span id="s516">This man had principles.</span> <span id="s517">This man, at age 39, not knowing the language, joined the French army.</span> <span id="s518">He was ready for combat.</span> <span id="s519">Now, you want to play Tweedlededee or Tweedlededum: Did he do it to save the family, to get citizenship, whatever?</span> <span id="s520">He enrolled in the army in war.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NL: He believed in what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">SS: Obviously.</span> <span id="s523">Obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">NL: And the Bettelheims and the Hannah Arendts, I think, are doing an ex post facto sort of judgment.</span> <span id="s525">This is how I interpret it.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SS: Well, I don't like Bettelheim at all.</span> <span id="s527">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s528">NL: But, your father obviously didn't want to change his whole system of values simply because the world was changing or seemed to have been changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">SS: Isn't that the hallmark of a genuine Orthodox Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">NL: And this eternality of values, you see, he was committed to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s532">But, I mean, you know, there was a story that you know better, maybe I read it in your book, about on Yom Kippur, how the Jews--it was the atheist Jews in Auschwitz who refused to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s534">So Father enlisted.</span> <span id="s535">What was their life like let's say in '38 after Munich?</span> <span id="s536">Have you recapitulated that?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">SS: Well, we lived in Rocquigny, in this Dorf.</span> <span id="s538">I remember traveling up and back to visit my grandparents in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s539">My mother's brother married a Belgian lady, and they lived in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">NL: Did you sense any greater anxiety in your parents as the decade drew on?</span> <span id="s541">You were very young, of course, but do you recall any anxiety on their part--'38?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">SS: You know, I don't know how to describe that.</span> <span id="s543">Let me try to formulate it.</span> <span id="s544">No, no.</span> <span id="s545">Let me try to describe that.</span> <span id="s546">I didn't mean to pass over.</span> <span id="s547">Among the very vivid memories, I mean so vivid, I can feel it, I can see it, was, I was three times in concentration camps with my parents, twice in Gurs, once in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s548">On each occasion, I can clearly see all or most of the other people about crying and sobbing and whatever.</span> <span id="s549">I have no recall, not a single one, of my parents behaving that way.</span> <span id="s550">I remember my mother organizing, carrying the big containers of food with somebody else, and whatever little pieces of solid there were in this soup, this slop, were at the bottom, and my mother organizing that whatever comes out of the bottom goes to the children first.</span> <span id="s551">The rest could be distributed among the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">NL: She was taking charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s554">So that--truly, how can I answer your question?</span> <span id="s555">I don't know that I can.</span> <span id="s556">I think that I do have some letters that my mother wrote to my father.</span> <span id="s557">They're written in German and I can't read German that well, but which do describe, I think, some of her struggles with trying to get monies or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">NL: But in the pre-war period, you don't remember any growing anxiety about the place?</span> <span id="s559">I'm just trying, I'm groping for some understanding of why your father enlisted before France was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">SS: It was involved in '39.</span> <span id="s561">He enlisted in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">NL: Yes, but France wasn't occupied, until 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">SS: Until what?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">NL: Until 1940.</span> <span id="s565">Maybe it was the attack on Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">SS: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NL: Because there was a technical alliance between England and France to support the viability of Poland.</span> <span id="s568">Maybe it was that.</span> <span id="s569">Well, it's not that important.</span> <span id="s570">Where did he go when he enlisted?</span> <span id="s571">Where was he taken to?</span> <span id="s572">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">SS: We looked at these documents last night, and it wouldn't be in here.</span> <span id="s574">Anyway, some camps--I had forgotten that--I had quite forgotten that--but he ended up in some camp, Saint-Just, in the departement de Oise, and from there, he was sent to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">NL: From the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s577">See, here is a letter that my father had written Monsieur le Préfet Β Pau the 26th of August 1940.</span> <span id="s578">I don't know if you read French, but I can translate it for you.</span> <span id="s579">You know what a préfet [chief administrator] is.</span> <span id="s580">"I have the honor to present to you the following facts: In April 1939, I had myself inscribed at the gendarmerie at the police, of Chaumont-Porcien, Ardennes, with the intent to enlist in the French army.</span> <span id="s581">The first September of the same year, I signed an engagement with the Bureau of Recruitment, [SS injects a few French phrases here and there as she translates] also in the Ardennes."</span> <span id="s582">Now, he was working, I think, on rewriting and rewriting this.</span> <span id="s583">Again, his French wasn't that good.</span> <span id="s584">"Following my internment the 5th of September 1939," you see, he said, in April he enlisted and in September, "following the decree taken against foreigners, I was interned in the camp of St. Just en Chaussée, Oise.</span> <span id="s585">"1 I never heard of this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">NL: No, nor have I. Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">SS: "In order to then be sent, I became what they call prestataire au travaux militaire étranger," [service provider] part of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">NL: Military...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">SS: But you saw the photo, he was wearing a French uniform...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NL: Yes, but this is very, very interesting, the first time I ever hear about what is, in effect, the deportation to a camp before France was conquered, and this...</span></p> <p><span id="s591">SS: There is one other reference to that--you know, until I found this, I thought I'd made it up.</span> <span id="s592">There's one other reference.</span> <span id="s593">There's a woman by the name of--and I don't have the book, I think my daughter has it, a woman who wrote children's stories called Sachs, S-A-C-H-S, who wrote a children's story called A Pocket Full of Marbles.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">NL: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">SS: Do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NL: I just know the title.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s598">Now, she describes the story that was told her of a woman named Fanny Kruger, whom I know, who's in San Francisco, and her father too, according to the book, had joined this same outfit, prestataire, and he too.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">NL: ...he, too, was sent to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">SS: And ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s601">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">NL: This was long--not long, but it was a full year before the Vichy decrees--the Statut des Juifs–before the capitulation of the Reynaud regime, before Petain came on.</span> <span id="s603">This was an independent decision of the French government, and we know that they didn't--well, you know, Koestler's book, The Scum of the Earth, in which he talks about the camps in France that had been used originally for persons who had fought in the Spanish Civil War.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s605">That was what Gurs was set up to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">NL: And Gurs was one of those.</span> <span id="s607">We really--I really must find out what there was in the motivation of the French to deport people who were already in the French army.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">SS: No, no, he wasn't deported...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NL: Well, it's a deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">SS: Well, it's putting them in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NL: Well, it's an internment.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">SS: It's an internment.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">NL: Yeah, it's an internment.</span> <span id="s614">Obviously, they weren't acknowledging his commitment to the French army.</span> <span id="s615">That's something that I will certainly want to investigate.</span> <span id="s616">It is, because this is pre-Vichy, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">SS: You know, I might comment on this.</span> <span id="s618">Before I called you, as I told you I--do you want to take that off?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">NL: Let me just repeat for a moment.</span> <span id="s620">You were saying that Mother probably had some reserve or some savings so that you and she could manage without Father...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">SS: You remember I said, well, because of the situation of the plebiscite, my grandparents, Hoffmans, as well as my parents, I think, were given some amount of ability to liquidate their businesses at a great...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">NL: Sacrifice...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SS: Sacrifice, but nonetheless</span></p> <p><span id="s624">NL: ...they...</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SS: I don't think they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s626">NL: ...were able to liquidate...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">SS: They didn't get the full value, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s628">While my father was in the so-called French army, I was with my mother in the village of Rocquigny, and here is a photo.</span> <span id="s629">This is my mother.</span> <span id="s630">These are French officers, and I remember that they came for dinner, and they seemed to be pretty chummy.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NL: You remember Father's coming home in his uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">SS: No, I never; no, he never came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NL: He never came home, on leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">NL: For those few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">SS: But then, in 1940, and you would know the date better than I, as I said, I forgot.</span> <span id="s637">After a while, I forgot all the dates.</span> <span id="s638">Sometime in 1940, there was the evacuation of northern France as a result of the Germans bombarding all of the towns and civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NL: May and June of '40, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">SS: May and June of 1940.</span> <span id="s641">So when--that's when that part of France was evacuated, and, in fact, there's a French movie about that that begins with the evacuation.</span> <span id="s642">I think it was either "Jeu de Guerre" or, I forget which one, where most people fled on foot.</span> <span id="s643">Now, my mother and I took a train to LaRoche-sur-Yon, which is right here on the Atlantic Coast.</span> <span id="s644">In other words, we went from the Ardennes to LaRoche-sur-Yon, and this was the area that had been designated as the area of evacuation for people from Ardennes, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NL: The French government authorized that, or arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">SS: Whatever.</span> <span id="s647">Now, given a letter that my mother wrote, the last thing before I was separated from my parents, she wrote a will which is this: "Camp de Rivesaltes, on 13 September 1942, in which she indicates that the furniture was in LaRoche-sur-Yon, which means that she must have had the opportunity to move all belongings from the Ardennes to LaRoche-sur-Yon.</span> <span id="s648">Because unlike the rest of the French population, I have no recall...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">NL: You didn't walk, you were on the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">SS: Exactly.</span> <span id="s651">And this document would confirm it.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">NL: Um hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">SS: Incidentally, you asked me how did I retrieve the photos.</span> <span id="s654">In part, it was through the person, the friend who had been entrusted with the furniture, which was put it in a storage...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">NL: Container?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s657">In LaRoche-sur-Yon, he sold everything but saved the albums.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s659">He saved the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s661">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">NL: Could we just step back a minute...</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s664">NL: This is Tape 2, continuing an interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.</span> <span id="s665">We were talking about the evacuation from your home just at the time of the bombardments, probably in June, May or June of 1940.</span> <span id="s666">Do you remember the bombardments?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">NL: You think Mother and you left before...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">SS: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">NL: ...that happened?</span> <span id="s671">She had some indication that there was danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">NL: I think so.</span> <span id="s673">From Rocquigny, I remember that there was a neighbor, Breck, who was a garage mechanic.</span> <span id="s674">And I used to spend a tremendous amount of time watching him repair cars, and he was an elderly man, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: 40... [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s676">SS: Not really, because he used to, yeah, well okay.</span> <span id="s677">He used to talk and tell lots of stories of World War I and the French were very much for World War I. That's hard to say, World War I. And it was very vivid.</span> <span id="s678">After the war, I returned to France in 1953.</span> <span id="s679">I returned to Rocquigny.</span> <span id="s680">I saw this man and was, when I told him who I was, his greeting was, "Oh, I thought you were all dead."</span> <span id="s681">And that was the beginning, middle and the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">NL: Same thing happened in Poland.</span> <span id="s683">Yes, not much difference.</span> <span id="s684">So you don't remember any bombardment, and you and Mother took the train, whereas the other evacuees went by foot, or many of them did.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">NL: And so you think you left as a result of a government order?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">SS: Or it may just have been foresight on their part.</span> <span id="s688">They had a lot of foresight, except, as I said, to come to America.</span> <span id="s689">But there is something to be said about their notion: you don't flee, you fight, and that seemed to have been my father's position.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">NL: And then that comment made, which I don't think we have on tape.</span> <span id="s691">"An honest man is protected by God."</span></p> <p><span id="s692">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">NL: Why should he have anything to fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s695">Only honest.</span> <span id="s696">"God knows I am honest, and honest people have nothing to hide."</span> <span id="s697">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">NL: Now, Father was still at Gurs when you were evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">SS: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s700">As best as I recall, there were no news from my father.</span> <span id="s701">From LaRoche-sur-Yon--I'm trying to see, 1940, my mother and I were in LaRoche-sur-Yon.</span> <span id="s702">I wrote this sometime from memory.</span> <span id="s703">From LaRoche-sur-Yon, my mother and I ended up in Gurs in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">NL: What about your life in LaRoche-sur-Yon?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">SS: I remember living in a hotel.</span> <span id="s706">I remember eating lobster, and the goodies, trayf [not kosher].</span> <span id="s707">It was an ocean city.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">NL: Without the fifth set of dishes?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">NL: Did Mother seem to be somewhat relaxed?</span> <span id="s711">Do you recall anything about her behavior that was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">SS: Somehow, as you ask, the word does not seem to relate to my mother.</span> <span id="s713">My mother was a funny lady, a very open lady, a very eccentric lady, a fun lady.</span> <span id="s714">She could be a very angry lady, but I'm not so sure about anything in between.</span> <span id="s715">That, of course, may be a function of my age.</span> <span id="s716">You know, I always felt very loved and protected and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">NL: And in a happy setting with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s719">And all I remember really was that I was with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">NL: Were there other children in the hotel?</span> <span id="s721">Were there other Jews in the hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">SS: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">NL: You don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">SS: No idea.</span> <span id="s725">Anyway, let me talk about what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NL: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">SS: Rather than what I don't.</span> <span id="s728">My mother and I ended up in Gurs.</span> <span id="s729">As I mentioned, we had not heard from my father.</span> <span id="s730">As you well know, Gurs, like all the other camps, were sub-sectioned into islands, each one partitioned off.</span> <span id="s731">They called it--well, anyway, each one closed off with barbed wires, and whenever a new transport arrived, there were all kinds of communications going on, people across the barbed wire, separated by ditches.</span> <span id="s732">Asking, you know, names, who arrived and that's how we found that my father was in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">NL: My--and the first knowledge...</span></p> <p><span id="s734">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">NL: That he was, in about a year and a half?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">SS: I would think so, unless my mother heard from him, then I would have had some recall of...</span></p> <p><span id="s737">NL: The news.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s739">I might add, in passing, and, you know, I guess, just for the sake of a description that you asked of what it was like and so on.</span> <span id="s740">I might add that my mother and father were--I don't think they had done anything formal, but it was understood that they were going to divorce.</span> <span id="s741">And this was true already when we lived in Rocquigny, and the man that she was involved with was a man that I recall.</span> <span id="s742">I have quite a clear memory of him, and I guess the interesting thing about that is that my father knew about it, but that through none of the ordeal, I think the last that this man was in the picture that I recall was in LaRoche-sur-Yon.</span> <span id="s743">I think, he was the one who oversaw the furniture and sold them to survive.</span> <span id="s744">He was a Jew, a man by the name of George Levy; he was a French Jew.</span> <span id="s745">But that had nothing with, to do with, you know, as there are in here letters that my mother wrote to my father.</span> <span id="s746">They wrote letters of mutual concern and caring, and certainly that was true in the camp and afterwards, so that a divorce was a grownup issue that had no effect.</span> <span id="s747">Does that help to put in perspective what these people are like?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s749">I also am wondering if perhaps the imminence of the divorce might have had something to do with Father's decision to enlist in the army?</span> <span id="s750">But that's really irrelevant, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">SS: I think it would be irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NL: Yeah, I think it's just a speculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">SS: Even then it was 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">SS: The man was 39 years old, and he's not a kid, on the rebound.</span> <span id="s756">You know, people didn't think that way in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">NL: Do you have any specific images of life at Gurs?</span> <span id="s758">Were you with Mother?</span> <span id="s759">Did you sleep in the same area?</span> <span id="s760">Was it a barracks-type of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">SS: Yeah, they were wooden barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">NL: Wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s763">Did you go there by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">SS: We went there by train.</span> <span id="s765">Well, you see, because I went to Gurs twice.</span> <span id="s766">Let me get--maybe, we'll hold the detailed questions for a moment, and let me just give a brief chronology.</span> <span id="s767">From the camp of Gurs in 1940, we got out of Gurs, and up until '42, we lived in a village near Gurs, called Garlin.</span> <span id="s768">However, my father lived in a village not some distance away, where he had a small farm, and he commuted, that is, visited my mother and myself, on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s769">He had one bicycle, and I used to ride on the front thing of the bicycle.</span> <span id="s770">And I recall frequent visits, my father coming to visit, and my going there to stay with him.</span> <span id="s771">As some of these letters would show, where my mother wrote to him while I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">NL: So then he was released from Gurs, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SS: Yes, the three of us were together in Gurs, once we found each other.</span> <span id="s774">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s776">once you found each other, you were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">SS: We were together.</span> <span id="s778">And this was until August 26, 1942.</span> <span id="s779">August 26, 1942, was my mother's birthday, and for her birthday my father was coming to spend the day with us and bring a chicken or whatever, you know, to celebrate her birthday, which, again, is what I am saying about.</span> <span id="s780">Here are two people, who had in peacetime thought of divorce, and in wartime like, you know, it didn't exist.</span> <span id="s781">You know, it was there, but it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s783">Take some coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">SS: Instead--that's all right.</span> <span id="s785">Instead of my father coming on that day, the 26th of August, a truck came with the French police and rounded up my mother and I and we were on our way to Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">NL: No warning, no preparation?</span> <span id="s787">Just a sudden.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">SS: No.</span> <span id="s789">No, and again, my father was already on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">NL: He was on the truck.</span> <span id="s791">They had picked him up?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s793">If you look at the map, I indicated with an X, this is the general region where he was, so the truck, the truck must have come this way and from there we went to Gurs.</span> <span id="s794">Now, when you ask me about details of Gurs, obviously these pictures all merged between time one and time two.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">NL: Time one was, of course, short and I presume...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">SS: So was time two.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">SS: Time two we were in Gurs August 26, 1942; we were transported by train to Rivesaltes on September 13, 1942.</span> <span id="s799">And I think that a few days later--I would have to research it--but no more than a week or two weeks later, my parents were sent from Rivesaltes to Drancy.</span> <span id="s800">I stayed in Rivesaltes alone until I got out.</span> <span id="s801">Okay, so that's all of it, the chronology.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">NL: What was life like even in the merged images that you have at Gurs?</span> <span id="s803">Did you have enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">SS: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s805">That's why I described my mother taking charge of the food distribution, which was mostly liquid slop with some solid stuff in the bottom.</span> <span id="s806">The barracks were wooden barracks, which had this shape going down and then fanning out on the sides, where you put your head to sleep and it was open.</span> <span id="s807">It was on the ground.</span> <span id="s808">I think there was some straw on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">NL: Do you have an image of lots of people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">SS: Oh, sure, all of the barracks were...</span></p> <p><span id="s811">NL: Filled.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">SS: Filled.</span> <span id="s813">I'll talk about how I got out of Rivesaltes, to say something about that in a minute.</span> <span id="s814">What else?</span> <span id="s815">Waking up very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s816">It was, I think, this must have been the first time I remember it being cold and wet and damp, and I remember waking up damp and wet.</span> <span id="s817">And achy.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">NL: Achy.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">SS: In fact, the pain was something like the arthritic pain I have now; maybe that's where I got it.</span> <span id="s820">I remember the toilets, which were sort of huge cylindrical cans.</span> <span id="s821">You know, you walked up some scaffolding, some scaffolding, wooden scaffolding and there were these cans that you shat into.</span> <span id="s822">It was a strange experience, certainly coming from a private bath, central heating and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s823">But the most unsettling experience was having diarrhea, stomach cramps, and alleviating oneself and never being sure whether it was me or the person next door, and looking down and it was all warm shit, couldn't tell if it was you or somebody else.</span> <span id="s824">That kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">NL: How did Mother explain this move to you?</span> <span id="s826">Or don't you remember any discussion?</span> <span id="s827">Did you want to know why you were being sent to such a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">SS: No, because I think in those days, adults didn't talk to kids.</span> <span id="s829">It was understood that when you talked about stuff and you made decisions, the kids were there.</span> <span id="s830">You heard and didn't barge in.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">NL: You obeyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">SS: It wasn't a matter of obeying.</span> <span id="s833">You had a certain kind of respect.</span> <span id="s834">These are difficult times.</span> <span id="s835">The adults have to make difficult decisions and they are doing the best they can, and you considered, I considered myself fortunate, you know, that it wasn't hush-hush and whispered, that the discussions were open, but you listened like a proper child that didn't have any wisdom or anything to contribute.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">NL: And Mother and Father and you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">NL: In the same physical area?</span> <span id="s839">Did they have work?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">NL: They didn't.</span> <span id="s842">Well, how did they spend their days?</span> <span id="s843">How did you spend your day?</span> <span id="s844">What would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">SS: Well, sitting in...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NL: Sitting in the barracks?</span> <span id="s847">Walking?</span> <span id="s848">Was there any way of walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">SS: There was walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">NL: There was walking.</span> <span id="s851">Was there...?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">SS: But there was more of a tendency to stay close to one's parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">NL: Did you have any visitors?</span> <span id="s854">Did any social agency people come to you with food or clothing...</span></p> <p><span id="s855">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">NL: ...or medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">NL: Do you remember being examined by a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">SS: No, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">NL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">SS: Nothing, I'll tell you my Jewish agency stories.</span> <span id="s862">They are very bitter.</span> <span id="s863">Maybe I better move from Gurs to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s864">I remember the long train ride.</span> <span id="s865">I remember also going from the train into the trucks to go to Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s866">Incidentally, there is one French movie that I saw recently that attempted to recreate exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s867">What was the name of that movie?</span> <span id="s868">It was "Entre Nous".</span></p> <p><span id="s869">NL: "Entre Nous."</span></p> <p><span id="s870">SS: Did you see that movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">NL: No, I don't think...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">SS: The opening scene...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">NL: The opening scene--Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">SS: It's quick, like, you know, two seconds.</span> <span id="s875">But it is Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">NL: I don't know if it has come to Philadelphia, but I certainly will.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">SS: Well, it came to Princeton.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">NL: Well, Princeton has the McCarther Theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">SS: No, no, it was a real commercial shopping mall.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">NL: Made in France, I presume?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s882">Right, and the woman who produced the movie is the daughter, I mean, it's autobiographical, it's autobiographical, it's about her mother and father that she made a movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">NL: It was very moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">SS: Oh, yes, but there is a scene of Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s885">I guess, she succeeded in attempting to an extent to recreating it.</span> <span id="s886">And as I recall, as I know, what I noticed most about the scene at Rivesaltes was the omission in the movie of the barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">NL: Just another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">SS: Excuse me while I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">NL: While you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">SS: Rivesaltes was then in September, 1942.</span> <span id="s891">Rivesaltes, as you well know, is at the opposite, at the Mediterranean end of the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s892">I remember it as being unbelievably hot.</span> <span id="s893">As I recall Gurs full of mud and nasty and cold and wet.</span> <span id="s894">You could never keep dry or warm.</span> <span id="s895">Rivesaltes the image was one of glaring, sun-beating heat, and there were a couple of sunflowers.</span> <span id="s896">I remember picking the seeds and eating those.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">NL: Similar barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">NL: And the same general physical condition?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">SS: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">NL: And not enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s903">Hungry.</span> <span id="s904">Starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">NL: Starving?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">SS: Yeah, both, I mean, you know, this slop.</span> <span id="s907">It didn't do any...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">NL: I'm going to take a minute.</span> <span id="s909">Let's speak now for a moment about your school experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">SS: We will get back to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">NL: Of course, we will.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">SS: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NL: You were at school in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">SS: Well, you see, when we got out of the camp of Gurs, we were in the village of Gurs, for a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">NL: Excuse me for interrupting.</span> <span id="s916">Do you know why you were released?</span> <span id="s917">Or did Mother and Father arrange that with the authorities?</span> <span id="s918">Do you understand how come you were only there for a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">SS: Can you turn that off for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">NL: Tell us now a little about your school life in the village of Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">SS: All right.</span> <span id="s922">To date, I remember being in school in Rocquigny, which would have been 1939, 1938, 1939, learning French.</span> <span id="s923">No school, and then I think when I lived in Garlin, which was 1941, 1942, going to school there.</span> <span id="s924">Okay.</span> <span id="s925">I remember two things.</span> <span id="s926">I remember one thing, number one, being a very good student.</span> <span id="s927">I read avidly; I read everything there was in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">NL: Available.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">SS: Available.</span> <span id="s930">Right.</span> <span id="s931">And the teacher befriended me.</span> <span id="s932">She liked me.</span> <span id="s933">In fact, some place I have a picture of her; her name was Mademoiselle Dominique.</span> <span id="s934">And it was the tradition for, I don't know what holiday, probably Bastille Day or one of those that the student who did the best, scholastically, was permitted to raise the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">NL: A great honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">SS: And so I was designated to do that and the whole village got into an uproar about a Jew doing that.</span> <span id="s937">Now, this was 1941, '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">NL: After the Statut des Juifs.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s940">So I didn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">NL: You didn't do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">NL: The teacher had to back down?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s945">Had to back down, right.</span> <span id="s946">The principal had to back down.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">NL: But, you did get this feeling of support from the teacher?</span> <span id="s948">How about the other students?</span> <span id="s949">Do you remember any nastiness among them?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">SS: No, no.</span> <span id="s951">In Garlin and the village of Gurs, which is at the foot of the Pyrenees, which is, you know, across the street from Spain, bullfighting was the big sport.</span> <span id="s952">So, they had these old bullfight arenas, somewhat dilapidated.</span> <span id="s953">I remember spending days playing with the kids in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s954">NL: In the arenas?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">SS: In the arenas, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">NL: So, there was no persecution by the children, as happened elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">SS: No.</span> <span id="s958">As long as, and I think, that's what I alluded to earlier, which was as long as you went along with whatever the games were, the kids I remember, going off with some boys.</span> <span id="s959">Children also worked, like, tending to cattle, walking way off into, you know, the mountains and so on.</span> <span id="s960">And, I remember a boy teaching me how to make a flute.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">NL: A flute?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">SS: You know, whittling wood and so on.</span> <span id="s963">My mother was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s964">She, she, I think, must have had polyps in the uterus.</span> <span id="s965">Because she bled profusely, and required surgery, and I remember living there and taking care of her.</span> <span id="s966">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s967">NL: Was she able to get hospital care?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">NL: Who did the surgery?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">SS: She didn't get surgery.</span> <span id="s971">She just continually bled.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">NL: Just continually bled.</span> <span id="s973">And you tended her?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">SS: And I tended her.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">NL: And Father at that point was...?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">SS: He lived.</span> <span id="s977">Ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s978">NL: He lived apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">SS: He lived apart, but then there had been another reason other than the separation, because I remember long periods when the three of us lived together and periods of separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">NL: I see, separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">SS: And, judging from the writings it may have been that he was looking about to find a place and so on.</span> <span id="s982">But, I do remember tending her.</span> <span id="s983">You know, I remember memories like her lying down and, of course, there was no plumbing, and using a bedpan, and I remember to empty it, and I remember one day tripping and...</span></p> <p><span id="s984">NL: Spilling the blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">SS: ...blood covered.</span> <span id="s986">And feeling bad about not wanting her to see it, because she felt bad.</span> <span id="s987">I remember cutting wood, you know, and going out in fields and gathering wood for heat and for cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">NL: Was this a hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">NL: You were living there freely?</span> <span id="s991">But in very primitive conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">NL: Farmstead, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">SS: Yeah, I remember various places.</span> <span id="s995">But back about this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">SS: In France, they have the exam, which the English call the 11-plus.</span> <span id="s998">You take at age 11, which determines whether you can go on, pass the damn thing, you go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">NL: To college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">SS: To college.2 You fail it and you are put in a vocational track.</span> <span id="s1001">I remember going to the major city, Pau.</span> <span id="s1002">I think, it was Pau to take the exam, and it was a long ordeal, a long production.</span> <span id="s1003">Excuse me, anyway I remember the day that the results were announced.</span> <span id="s1004">My mother had sent me to the store to get something.</span> <span id="s1005">I bumped into the teacher who yelled at me, "You passed, you passed," and hugging me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">NL: The same teacher who...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">SS: The same teacher, right.</span> <span id="s1008">And you know, but the exams were done elsewhere, and they were sent from the Ministry and so the teachers had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1009">I remember after then, you know, we bade each other goodbye, the teacher and I and I am going on to the store, and the teacher yelled at me and she said, "But you live the opposite way.</span> <span id="s1010">Aren't you going to run home and tell your mother?"</span> <span id="s1011">And I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1012">I have an errand.</span> <span id="s1013">I have to go to the store."</span> <span id="s1014">So, I went and did the errand, went home and told my mother all excited, "I passed, I passed," and my mother just looking at me with a warm smile, saying, "Well, I expected that of you."</span> <span id="s1015">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">NL: Of course.</span> <span id="s1017">That's lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">SS: There is another story about my mother in the same village, in Garlin.</span> <span id="s1019">And you asked about how did children occupy themselves.</span> <span id="s1020">Well, we had a hunch some kids and I, and as I said, part of not being pointed at as a Jew or ostracized or whatever, was to share in whatever activities, mischief , and whatever went on.</span> <span id="s1021">Anyway, that day some kids noticed two lovers who were walking down the road into the fields, and it was decided to follow them, which we did.</span> <span id="s1022">We ended up in a field, and there were bushes and what not, and sometime later we saw these two young people having sexual intercourse, and we were gawking, and a lady showed up.</span> <span id="s1023">And she screamed and yelled, "I'm going to tell the teacher.</span> <span id="s1024">I'm going to tell the principal!"</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">NL: There were two of you or a gang?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">SS: A gang.</span> <span id="s1027">And so we ran like hell, and I came home all out of breath and looking terrified, and my mother looked at me and she said, "Good God, what happened?"</span> <span id="s1028">And I told her, you know, exactly what I had seen, what happened, and she just howled.</span> <span id="s1029">She said, "You don't think he was going to follow you and try to catch you, with no pants on, do you?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">NL: But you were then completely accepted by the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">NL: Then, I gather you didn't wear a Jewish star and did Mother not wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1034">Now remember, this was in so-called unoccupied France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">NL: This was Vichy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">SS: The year is 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">NL: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">SS: '41. '</span> <span id="s1039">42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">NL: Did you hear about a man named Vallat V-A-L-L-A-T-, who was in a Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, who actually stood on principle about not, about refusing to accept the decree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1042">I read about it afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">NL: So, you weren't required to identify yourselves as Jews in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">SS: In fact, my parents did.</span> <span id="s1045">There is a document here in which they did declare themselves as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">NL: They had to register?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">NL: The registration was something, but you didn't have the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s1049">And do you want to speak about any other school experiences you had in the village of Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">SS: I think there will be more as we go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">NL: But, do you think the children knew you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, perhaps they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">SS: No, you see, at that time and that's the cloak, the disguise, that I used later when I was in the French underground; they must have known because the incident about raising the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">NL: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">SS: But kids were aware of the evacuation of people from northern France, so that there were refugees all over the country, which was not specific to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">NL: I also wanted to emphasize the point that Dr. Lerner was making, namely, that the arrests and the driving of the trucks, the repression, were all in the hands of French rather than German police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1058">They were French police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">NL: French police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">SS: I never saw a German in any of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Tape 2, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">NL: Continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s1064">Now, let's go back to Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">NL: You were there just for a very short time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">SS: Right, with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">NL: With your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">SS: And, then a short time alone.</span> <span id="s1069">I think that the feeling of now, for now and what next may be worse, to me prior to that, that is, in Garlin, that feeling was heightened by--there was a girl, I remember.</span> <span id="s1070">She was older than I in school.</span> <span id="s1071">I used to spend some time with her, and her mother had recently died of illness.</span> <span id="s1072">And she was in mourning, and she used to talk about her mother and how she missed her and so on, and I remember very distinctly at the time, going home with greater diligence, greater anxiety, to check up on my mother, the fact that it was a double thing, the fact that my mother was ill and the fact of camps looming about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">NL: The loss...</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">SS: Camps looming...</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">NL: Oh, camps looming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s1077">I had been in Gurs once before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">NL: But, I thought the fear that you, too, might lose your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">SS: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1080">That was the point.</span> <span id="s1081">That was the point.</span> <span id="s1082">So that, you know, you asked me about memories as a child in the camps.</span> <span id="s1083">Maybe, this is the part that, and the reason that I weathered it in the way that I did with my parents, my mother had promised me, and she had said, no matter what, under no circumstances ever will we separate.</span> <span id="s1084">And she promised me, she gave me her word, and my mother was the kind of lady that, like my father, and he, too, that a promise is a promise and you just don't break it.</span> <span id="s1085">So, I think that with that, my you know, being quiet and sensing, accepting the ultimate security for me and my world, was okay.</span> <span id="s1086">I was with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">NL: They will take care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">SS: I was with my father.</span> <span id="s1089">It wasn't even a question of who takes care, but I will be with them.</span> <span id="s1090">I will be with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">NL: Together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1093">And I think that, well, that this my befriending with this girl and obviously my hanging around with her, that was part of my way of dealing with--and her position, of course, was always, "You are so lucky, you still have your mother," and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1094">But I think that what was in it for me was a constant kind of dealing with, "I've got my mother.</span> <span id="s1095">She is there."</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">NL: A rock.</span> <span id="s1097">Mother remained ill up until the time she was sent to Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">NL: Never got medical care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">NL: Did you hear at all from your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">SS: Yes, I'll get to that later.</span> <span id="s1103">Let me first...</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">SS: Install myself out of Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s1106">Okay.</span> <span id="s1107">On that day, there was early--I, okay, the rumors about being shipped out, about being transported, being deported, of course, were constant.</span> <span id="s1108">And there was no real way of knowing which one was a false alarm and which one was the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">NL: These were rumors by the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">SS: Yes, by inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">NL: Or others?</span> <span id="s1112">Were you able to get any newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">SS: No, nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">NL: Radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">SS: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s1116">You know, all you could take with you was, I think, was 20 kilos.</span> <span id="s1117">You know, it was a suitcase, in which you typically took your blanket.</span> <span id="s1118">I still have my woolen blanket...</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">NL: Let me interject again.</span> <span id="s1120">Dr. Lerner was saying that at one point Mother prepared you in very hot weather with lots and lots of clothes.</span> <span id="s1121">Was that when you left Rivesaltes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">SS: No, that's when we went.</span> <span id="s1123">Okay.</span> <span id="s1124">It's August 26.</span> <span id="s1125">It's hot.</span> <span id="s1126">For my mother to celebrate my mother's birthday.</span> <span id="s1127">Okay.</span> <span id="s1128">So the clothing that were packed in part consisted of the warmest you had.</span> <span id="s1129">You know, it was anticipated by my mother obviously, that, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">NL: Things might get worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">NL: Or cold, certainly.</span> <span id="s1133">So, you were speaking about rumors.</span> <span id="s1134">Did you hear them as a child, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">NL: You heard Mother talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1138">You heard adults always.</span> <span id="s1139">You know, they say that we are going to be shipped off, and the only time that I remember my mother really breaking down and crying was when the rumor was that they were going to be sent to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">NL: That scared your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">SS: That frightened her.</span> <span id="s1142">And it's not clear whether that had to do with the old issue of the Yekke versus the Pollack or whether there was something, German Jew.</span> <span id="s1143">I suspect that it was more some sense about things being bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">NL: Very bad, The Jews, I think, even though they didn't know exactly what was happening there, knew that Poland was the last resort.</span> <span id="s1145">Also, in Czechoslovakia, there was this terrible fear of being shipped to Poland, and the other side of this fear was that if they stayed with their countrymen, that they would be better protected.</span> <span id="s1146">Now, I wonder if there was any sense that you would be better off in France simply because you were French?</span> <span id="s1147">But, maybe, you couldn't discern that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">SS: There was a sense, of course, of having chosen France as a country away from Germany, and, you know, my parents did a good job of acculturating in a lot of ways.</span> <span id="s1149">Yes.</span> <span id="s1150">But, I remember the night before, and I think the rumors must have been, the night before they were shipped off, rumors must have been much more intense, which led more veracity and credence to them.</span> <span id="s1151">And, this I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s1152">And maybe this is what I am doing now, forty years later.</span> <span id="s1153">I remember lying down, on the floor, on whatever it was, straw whatever, and fantasizing when all this is over, I will be in America, because my mother talked a lot about these relatives in America.</span> <span id="s1154">So, I knew the names of all the relatives.</span> <span id="s1155">I knew everybody's name.</span> <span id="s1156">I knew everybody's character, I knew what they were like, from descriptions.</span> <span id="s1157">And of--all I remember, like, a fantasy of my telling people in America what it was like.</span> <span id="s1158">And, of course, the let-down, when I came to America and nobody wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s1159">You know, leave the war behind and forget all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">NL: But at that time Mother was thinking of perhaps America as an alternative to her or to you or to both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">SS: To everybody, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">NL: To everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">SS: I think, everybody saw that America was the place...</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">NL: Everybody was thinking...</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1166">For freedom, for liberty and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">NL: But, your parents did nothing as far as you know to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">SS: To implement that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">NL: To make this possible.</span> <span id="s1170">They didn't apply to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">SS: Well, I don't know, because, again, in the letters there are notes that, letters that my mother wrote to my father when they lived in the different villages, involving many trips to the City of Pau which is a main capital.</span> <span id="s1172">In Pau, also, there was a lady who was a distant relative of my mother's friend.</span> <span id="s1173">She's a lady whom later I lived with, so there must have been attempts made.</span> <span id="s1174">The letters, by the way, cannot be taken literally because there was always the danger of censorship and so on, so always...</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">NL: Coded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1177">But, anyway, the next morning we were awakened very early, it was still dawn, dawn is morning, and told to assemble at the main place in the camp with luggage and all, and you know, we formed these long lines, and the lines were alphabetical.</span> <span id="s1178">And given that my last name is Samson, which is my maiden name, we were pretty much down at the end of the line.</span> <span id="s1179">And even though my mother had promised and my father had promised, we would never under any circumstances separate, it was decided that I should stay and that they felt that by separating there was a chance that I could get out.</span> <span id="s1180">So, I remember my mother going to one barrack where they had a representative of the Jewish agency, OSE [Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants-Children's Aid Society].</span> <span id="s1181">And I remember clearly this lady then coming back to where we were in line and saying, "I'm terribly sorry, I'm sorry," and I remember, she and my mother discussing, you know, "The barrack is full.</span> <span id="s1182">We have no more room."</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">NL: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">SS: For me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">NL: That you have to leave with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">SS: That I have to leave with them.</span> <span id="s1187">Then, of course, I was terribly relieved.</span> <span id="s1188">And my mother was terribly distressed.</span> <span id="s1189">And, as I remember, the way it went is the authorities which again were French-uniformed men, had a table that they transported down the line, came and people went, you know, different places and just as they came close to S, either that same lady from OSE or another one said, "Okay, we'll take her."</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">NL: That is, keep you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">SS: Keep me.</span> <span id="s1192">And I remember very--in a great hurry saying goodbye to my parents and them saying, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1193">We'll see you again," and, of course, that was the last time I saw them.</span> <span id="s1194">And I was taken by this lady into that place, and my memory is vague and yet very vivid, it's a very non-verbal...</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">NL: Do you remember the feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">SS: Yes, it's a very non-verbal going into that barrack and I--it's like I totally let loose and I ran away and they came and got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">NL: You tried to run out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">SS: I tried to run back to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">NL: To your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">SS: They were gone.</span> <span id="s1201">They were gone.</span> <span id="s1202">I wanted to go with them forever.</span> <span id="s1203">Right.</span> <span id="s1204">And I remember that the adults had to literally subdue me.</span> <span id="s1205">I just remember being totally out of it, out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1206">The closest, the next to closest that I can remember being totally out of control, crazy, I guess, more like a child having a tantrum.</span> <span id="s1207">But it wasn't a child-like tantrum, I mean it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">NL: The real thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">SS: I mean, it was horror, it was pain.</span> <span id="s1210">I remember, too, that my mother and I wore the same dress.</span> <span id="s1211">It's a print I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1212">It was a deep purple and there were little squares, little yellow lines, and she wore a dress like that and I wore the same dress.</span> <span id="s1213">I have a photo of her and me together somewhere wearing these same dresses, and just going around frantically the next day and every day after asking people, "Did you see a lady wearing this dress?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">NL: Had other children been separated from their parents, too, perhaps at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">SS: Yeah, the barrack was full of children.</span> <span id="s1216">I have no idea of when and how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">NL: Did anyone give you any comfort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">SS: The thing that I learned was, after I was separated from my parents, that the reason, you know, remember clearly, I mean, I clearly, clearly remember because it was such an intense relief, such a weight off my shoulder, when this woman said there is no more room for a child, your child which, of course, I now have since looked upon with utter bitterness.</span> <span id="s1219">You know, I don't even find words to describe it.</span> <span id="s1220">There is a goddamned wooden barrack and, of course, there is room for one more child, there is room for ten more, there is room for 100 more.</span> <span id="s1221">I might say sadly that that was just the beginning of the kinds of experiences that I had with Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s1222">I hate them.</span> <span id="s1223">I hated them.</span> <span id="s1224">I mean to this day I haven't contributed to a Jewish charity.</span> <span id="s1225">I will contribute to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">NL: Don't you know they have the same kind of agencies, some of the same kind of organizations there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">SS: I know, totally irrational.</span> <span id="s1228">I'm sure that they did their goddamned best.</span> <span id="s1229">That was my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">NL: Just one thing about this woman, about whom you feel so bitter and it's not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s1232">Just let me tell you the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">SS: The background is, if you recall, there was a lady, let's give her a name, Paula, who was a distant relative of my mother's.</span> <span id="s1235">Her connection was married, you know, the daughter of, I can give you the genealogy, but it is a distant cousin, who was also a friend, who had fled to France from Lithuania, and who was living in the City of Pau, and my mother used to see her and I remember seeing her.</span> <span id="s1236">I remember this lady from Aurich.</span> <span id="s1237">I remember her visiting us in Rocquigny.</span> <span id="s1238">Paula's brother-in-law was a man named Dr. Olschwanger, who had gone to London, and he was sent, according to Paula, and I don't know if it is true, he was one of the founders of OSE.</span> <span id="s1239">He was a physician.</span> <span id="s1240">I haven't seen the name in writing, so I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">NL: Can you spell it for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">SS: O-L-S-C-H-W-A-N-G-E-R.</span> <span id="s1243">Does that sound familiar to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">NL: I have never seen it.</span> <span id="s1245">No.</span> <span id="s1246">It would be interesting</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">SS: But, anyway, Paula found out that we were in Gurs and then Rivesaltes, and Paula went and pulled all kinds of strings.</span> <span id="s1248">From Pau Paula by then was in Montpelier.</span> <span id="s1249">That's right, from Pau she went to Montpelier and in Montpelier, she found out we were in Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s1250">Maybe my mother was able to send her a postcard some time.</span> <span id="s1251">She pulled every conceivable string to get my parents [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">NL: I was wondering if that was in the Italian zone, but the Italian zone was closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">SS: No, at that time the Italian business was much later.</span> <span id="s1254">This was 1943.</span> <span id="s1255">I think, the Italians did not occupy till--this is '42.</span> <span id="s1256">I think, the Italian occupation was '43, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">NL: After the Normandy--after the North African landing, November, '42, early '43.</span> <span id="s1258">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">SS: So, anyway, because then I found a note.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">NL: From her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">SS: From her, you know, to that agency in the camp trying to--that she had written to my mother: "Dear Carla and dear Joseph, I am trying to get you and Sonja out," and that's how come I got out of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">NL: Through that letter.</span> <span id="s1263">But it came too late to save Mother and Father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">NL: Or, perhaps, it wouldn't have helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">SS: Anyway, that isn't the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">NL: But that letter helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">SS: That is not my focus.</span> <span id="s1269">My focus was really--my profound bitterness, or maybe guilt, a lot of guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">NL: Of course.</span> <span id="s1271">Because you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">SS: Because I survived.</span> <span id="s1273">Because somebody knew somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">NL: The only point that I was going to make about the OSE woman was that she was, of course, behaving like a bureaucrat, thinking in terms of statistics, but also, I doubt very much if she knew what the destination of those transports was going to be.</span> <span id="s1275">It's not even clear, according to some sources, and this is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">SS: Yeah, but I have a document here about my being released from Rivesaltes, which is on UGIF [Union Générate des Israélites de France French Jewish Council] paper, which gives the reasons for having liberated me from Rivesaltes, as enfant abandoné, an abandoned child.</span> <span id="s1277">Which, of course, when I saw that, at the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">NL: It disturbed you to no end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">SS: Yeah, my parents did not abandon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">NL: Maybe that was a way of satisfying the Vichy government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">SS: I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">NL: It's hard to fathom all these things...</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">SS: So, anyway, I..</span> <span id="s1284">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">NL: They went to Drancy.</span> <span id="s1286">You heard nothing more from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">SS: Yes, I got a postcard from my mother from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">NL: On the way to Drancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">SS: Yeah, which said, "Sonja, we are fine.</span> <span id="s1290">Everything is fine."</span> <span id="s1291">And love, you know, kisses, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">NL: It's not clear from the evidence that even Vichy officials knew what the destination of the transports from Drancy were, certainly not in '42.</span> <span id="s1293">I'm not, of course, excusing this woman, but just saying that she may have, she may not have known what their destiny was to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s1295">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">NL: It was an offensive thing to say, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">SS: I guess not to say, to do.</span> <span id="s1298">It was the fact that if it hadn't been for Paula's pull, I would have gone with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">NL: Would have gone with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">SS: I'm sorry, I'm not being very ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">NL: No, I--did you have any other encounters with Jewish Agency people while you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">SS: That's why I want to go on.</span> <span id="s1303">No, that was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">NL: That was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">SS: I remember that there was some Samson cousins who had come from Germany, who were in Rivesaltes, because I was sent to a different part of the camp and I spent a day or so, I saw them.</span> <span id="s1306">I think, it was in Gurs the first time, I think, I was--there was an infirmary.</span> <span id="s1307">I don't remember why I was there briefly, and in the bed my mother recognized a woman who had been a German movie star, Dita Barlow.</span> <span id="s1308">But, anyway, I got out of Rivesaltes in a truck with the other kids, and our first destination was, either in Montpellier, in Perpignon, which is this major city, in a convent.</span> <span id="s1309">And I spent a week in the convent.</span> <span id="s1310">And that was probably the most unhappy time in my life.</span> <span id="s1311">I longed, I longed for the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">NL: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">SS: Ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">NL: Were they harsh to you?</span> <span id="s1315">At the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">SS: I think, they did their best, but it was a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">NL: You had to wear a cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">SS: No, there it was clear that we were Jewish kids, but, yeah, they were harsh.</span> <span id="s1319">I mean, they had the kids, their own kids who were punished wearing donkey hats, walking about, but I think it was--while the camp had all the barbed wires and everything, you could see the sky and there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">NL: And you had your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">SS: They were humans.</span> <span id="s1322">They were people in civilian clothes, and there it seemed like getting into a dungeon forever, that you would never get out of again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">NL: They had black habits on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">SS: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">NL: Well, that's very frightening to a child, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">SS: Yes, but you remember my experience in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s1327">My grandfather had prepared me for it.</span> <span id="s1328">Living.</span> <span id="s1329">Remember when I went to the nursery school in Luxembourg, and he had prepared me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">SS: But that was the shock.</span> <span id="s1332">I think, it probably all piled up being in a strange place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">SS: Being removed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">NL: Being removed from your parents.</span> <span id="s1336">That probably was overpowering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">SS: Right, it was.</span> <span id="s1338">I got out of the convent and I got to a place called Palavas-les-Flots, which is a resort place on the Mediterranean, south of the city of Montpellier, and I think, I spent a couple of months there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">NL: Was that in a convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">SS: No, no.</span> <span id="s1341">That was under the auspices of orphanages.</span> <span id="s1342">Under the auspices of UGIF and OSE.</span> <span id="s1343">It was all children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">NL: What was your experience there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">SS: And that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">NL: Was that a little happier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">SS: That was close to Montpellier, where eventually Paula came and saw me and I rejoined her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">SS: Yeah, my experience there was hungry, starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">NL: In the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">SS: Yeah, and in the mornings, seeing cans of empty food that the bureaucrats of the agency...</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">NL: Had eaten, but weren't sharing with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1354">The only other memory I have of that, that was painful because all the kids there shortly after I got out, they were rounded up and shipped off.</span> <span id="s1355">But there was a terrible storm one night, a terrible storm, I guess, a kind of tornado, like we have here, because I remember waking up in the morning, because I remember waking up in the morning with bricks on me on the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">NL: My word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">SS: Looking at the sky and I apparently was the only one who slept through it all.</span> <span id="s1358">So, I think that's how I dealt with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">NL: Unpleasant things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">SS: Withdrawal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">NL: Go to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">NL: Was there any schooling at the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">NL: How did you spend your time there, do you remember, any days that you recall, besides being hungry.</span> <span id="s1366">I guess, that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">SS: You know, these are the two, the only two images that I have.</span> <span id="s1368">You know, the roof having caved in literally and, you know, watching yenim [them, the others] eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">NL.: And you were there, you think, for a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1371">According to this, it was--no, maybe not.</span> <span id="s1372">Yeah, it looks like maybe a month or a month and a half or something, not terribly long, two months...</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">NL: And from there you were trucked again or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">SS: No, from there I joined Paula and her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">NL: She came for you.</span> <span id="s1376">Paula came for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">SS: Yeah, and I stayed with her in Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">NL: And were there any children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">SS: Yes, she had my darling, her son, who was seven years younger than I and who, when we used to fight, used to delight and console himself with the notion that I, that he was seven years younger than I, and that meant I would die seven years before he would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">NL: You would have discussions of that kind?</span> <span id="s1381">That's typical of children, too.</span> <span id="s1382">I remember thinking that about other children and about my mother, lamenting the fact that she was going to die much before I would.</span> <span id="s1383">So, that's very characteristic of children, I think.</span> <span id="s1384">Did you go to school while you were with Paula?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">SS: No, but look it's 5:20, and, well, I don't know what do you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">NL: Tell me a little about your life with Paula.</span> <span id="s1387">Did you go to school in Montpellier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1389">Let's see, we weren't in Montpellier very long.</span> <span id="s1390">According to this, we were--no, November, I got to Montpellier and then we went to Vic-sur-Cére, which is in central France [north of Montpellier].</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">NL: She was moving, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">SS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1393">They, she and her husband, remember she is from Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">NL: From Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1395">So, she, of course, was a foreigner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">SS: Sure, and her husband, Leon, was from Poland.</span> <span id="s1397">I can't remember from where.</span> <span id="s1398">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1399">Memel?</span> <span id="s1400">No, that Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1401">That was Paula.</span> <span id="s1402">He was from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">NL: Anyhow, they were on the run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">SS: They were on the run, so from Montpellier we went to central France and there we lived in a village, [might have meant to say "villa"] which we shared with another family by the name of Epstein.</span> <span id="s1405">And they had, the Epsteins were a family of four.</span> <span id="s1406">They had a son and daughter and the son, Roland, in fact, was mentioned in a book that I read relatively recently.</span> <span id="s1407">He was also a member of the Underground and he smuggled children to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">NL: The, the Scouts, Eclaireurs?</span> <span id="s1409">Was he a member of the Eclaireurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1411">I forget which book, relatively recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">NL: Do you know his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">SS: Epstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">NL: Oh, Epstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">SS: Well, it was a book about the Jews in the French Underground, and he was mentioned in it.</span> <span id="s1416">Anyway, we lived with them and shared a house.</span> <span id="s1417">There was no food, you know, your question that my birthday present in 1943 was one egg.</span> <span id="s1418">That gives you an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">NL: Were you getting any help at all from any of the farmers in the area?</span> <span id="s1420">Did they help you with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">SS: No, only, you know, you could buy stuff at a high price...</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">NL: If you had money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">SS: Yeah, yeah, [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">NL: And Paula and her husband were living off what?</span> <span id="s1425">Cash they got from selling goods, or did they still have some money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">SS: Yeah he traff...</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Tape 3, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">NL: We are on Tape 3, Side 1, continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.</span> <span id="s1429">About trafficking in [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">SS: And Vic-sur-Cére, in this part, which is close to Aurillac, living with the Epsteins, there I remember going to school, and I remember walking some five kilometers to and from school.</span> <span id="s1431">I don't have much memory or recall about school.</span> <span id="s1432">But I mean, it was the usual, wherever I went to school, they had traveled a lot of ground that I had to catch up on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">NL: You were always behind, of course, in your studies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">NL: Do you remember having any trouble studying or did you have enough light or were you able to get books?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">SS: We used candles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">NL: Candles.</span> <span id="s1438">Did any of the children give you any food, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">NL: Were they aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">SS: There was a source of food on the way to school, which was swell.</span> <span id="s1442">There was a factory there where they extracted the oil from walnuts, and they discarded this compressed walnut.</span> <span id="s1443">Tasted awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">NL: But you used to eat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">SS: Awful.</span> <span id="s1446">It leaves a terrible after-taste, but you could gorge yourself on the stuff and really get sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">NL: No vegetables in the fields that you could...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">NL: That you could swipe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1451">Also, it was winter to an extent.</span> <span id="s1452">Anyway, from there we went to Chambéry in Savoie, and I remember one attempt with Paula, Leon, and their son, who always was seven years younger than I, trying to get to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1453">And I remember getting as far as the border, and I think that must have been the time when there was--when it switched from the Italians to the Germans, and the borders were closed and there was no way of getting to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">NL: It would have been October, '43?</span> <span id="s1455">The autumn of '43 Mussolini fell and the Italians were thrown out of the Riviera area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">SS: Must have been around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">NL: Winter, you said.</span> <span id="s1458">So, you couldn't get through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1460">So we went back to Chambéry and in Chambéry there was a school, a boarding school, which used to be, structurally, was an old convent from the 15th Century or so, ancient place, which was a public school, because, you know, by then I was 12 years old, the public school in--there were none for that age in the villages, so a lot of the farmers and peasants would send their kids to Chambéry, the capital of the region, and Paula and her husband lived, and the son, lived in the town of Chambéry in an apartment, and I stayed in the school, and the principal knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">NL: What was his attitude toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">SS: Her.</span> <span id="s1463">It was a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">SS: Made like she didn't know.</span> <span id="s1466">But the assistant principal, I think, had some dealings with the Underground or something, so they were willing to hide a Jewish kid in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">NL: You were the only one, as far as you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">SS: As far as I knew, until one day, much towards the end of the war, there was another girl who sang, who had a nice voice.</span> <span id="s1469">In fact, she was said to have a voice, she sounded like popular French singer at the time, Charles Trenet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">NL: Oh, I have some of his records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">SS: And she sang "Bei mir bist du schain."</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">NL: For heaven's--in Yiddish!</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">SS: Not in Yiddish, in French.</span> <span id="s1474">It was translated in French.</span> <span id="s1475">But there was something about the way she sang it, that a week later, I said to her, "You came from far, too, didn't you?"</span> <span id="s1476">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1477">That's the only time we ever talked.</span> <span id="s1478">It was very dangerous in that school, because a dormitory is not like an American school dormitory.</span> <span id="s1479">A dormitory there consisted of this huge dorm, I mean, a massive thing with beds one close to the other, and you ate and you slept with each other all the time, and certainly a lot of the girls did--there was a lot of prying.</span> <span id="s1480">There was another, this was the collΠge.</span> <span id="s1481">There was another school, a lycée, in which several Jewish kids were reported to their parents by their classmates and were deported.</span> <span id="s1482">So, it was very dangerous, and I had to account for Paula, who came to visit me and I pretended she was my mother, but she had a different name because she was remarried.</span> <span id="s1483">I mean, I just concocted a whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">NL: You just fabricated a whole story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">SS: Oh, yes, I was very facile at that and never mixing up stories.</span> <span id="s1486">I just kept it straight.</span> <span id="s1487">So, it was in the boarding school that I really in part survived by hanging out with the more rebellious kind of kids, girls.</span> <span id="s1488">It was an all girls' school.</span> <span id="s1489">And engaged in mischief in the interest of, you know, "You are one of us," kind of thing, and that lessened the kind of questions, the probing, the questions.</span> <span id="s1490">I remember there was one girl who was particularly, "acting outside" we would call it today, by the name of Maxine.</span> <span id="s1491">And she was Protestant, and so we shared a lot in common because we were different, a Protestant in a totally Catholic country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">NL: Were you expected to adhere to certain religious customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">NL: Say prayers and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">SS: No, it was a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">NL: But, of course, mostly Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">SS: Yeah, the kids were Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">NL: And were Paula and her husband also then required to falsify their identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">SS: Yes, in fact, I..</span> <span id="s1500">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">NL: Make up stories...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">SS: In fact, I helped them invent a false name.</span> <span id="s1503">I was good at that, also.</span> <span id="s1504">I had a lot of special skills!</span> <span id="s1505">Their last name was Slucki, Slutsky, in any other language.</span> <span id="s1506">In French it was Slucki, S-L-U-C-K-I, and I invented the name Slushard because they hadn't thought about it.</span> <span id="s1507">It's funny.</span> <span id="s1508">There are some things you remember with a great deal of vividness.</span> <span id="s1509">Because I felt that if they were arrested and the son, the boy was little, and if he slipped into Slucki, well, Slucka is, Sluchard is hard for him to say.</span> <span id="s1510">Also, there is a Suchard chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">NL: Very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">SS: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">NL: Were you furtive about your behavior, or had you overcome that fear, that apprehension about your identity, so that you could move freely among the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">SS: No, I was forever on guard.</span> <span id="s1515">Forever on guard.</span> <span id="s1516">I mean, including, with this girl Dora.</span> <span id="s1517">Later, we became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">NL: The Protestant girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">SS: No, the Jewish girl that sang "Bei mir bist du schain."</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">NL: Oh, the Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">SS: We never talked.</span> <span id="s1522">That was the only time we talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">NL: And that was a very brief conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">SS: Very simple.</span> <span id="s1525">I said to her, "You are from very far away, too, aren't you?"</span> <span id="s1526">And she said, "Yes," and that was it.</span> <span id="s1527">And she said, "Yes," and that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">NL: That was it.</span> <span id="s1529">But, you got some food at this boarding school, finally, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">SS: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1531">I remember every other day having noodles, pasta vermicelles, these little noodles, and you couldn't tell the noodles from the white worms.</span> <span id="s1532">They were thoroughly intermixed.</span> <span id="s1533">So we got meat as well.</span> <span id="s1534">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">NL: Oh, my dear, my dear.</span> <span id="s1536">You didn't get sick from all this, I hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">SS: No, I was strong as a horse.</span> <span id="s1538">I didn't get sick until recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">NL: How long did you stay in the boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">SS: Well, about a year.</span> <span id="s1541">About a year.</span> <span id="s1542">Okay...</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">NL : A long stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">SS: Well, you know, at that time, of course, at age 12, one year is a twelfth of your life, and at 50 is one-fiftieth of your life, so a year seemed long, endless, very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">NL: Very long.</span> <span id="s1546">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">SS: Things were very difficult in the school.</span> <span id="s1548">There were the usual furloughs, the weekends going home, vacations, and everybody had a place to go home to.</span> <span id="s1549">When you mentioned food, the French have a tradition called goφter [snack], which is at four o'clock you eat something.</span> <span id="s1550">And, of course, since all of these were farm girls, they each had a little wooden box, with a lock, from home full with all kinds of goodies and, of course, I didn't have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">NL: Did they share any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">SS: Rarely, and when they did, I saved the food and brought it to Paula, for the kid, and didn't eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">NL: You went home every weekend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">SS: No, I could never sleep there.</span> <span id="s1555">I could only go there and visit.</span> <span id="s1556">You see, the whole idea of putting me in the boarding school was, in case their apartment would be raided, then they would only find three people instead of four.</span> <span id="s1557">This meant, of course, that during holidays and such times I was all by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">NL: You stayed in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">SS: In the school, which was, I mean, it still is, an enormous convent, medieval, with huge arches, ceilings, and I don't know, about 40 feet high, or whatever, and that was scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">NL: You were the only child left there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">SS: Right, and there was the concierge, who was a seedy kind of a character, and there was a huge wall around it.</span> <span id="s1562">But the most dangerous part was oftentimes coming back to school at night, being followed by Germans, who were marching up and walking about the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Talking about food, you know, we had, as you know, there were ration cards for bread of which, of course, there was never enough, and I had found a bakery where there was a woman, saleswoman, who was very absentminded or whatever, so I'd always have the bread stamps in one hand and always--that was going on errands for Paula, and figured out a way of, you know, say, if it was 10 cents, have a dollar bill or whatever that required change, and of giving her the money, and while she counted and so on, and having, showing the money and the stamp, and while she was busy with the money, I'd hide the food stamp and get out that way without ever giving her the stamps and that's how we got our bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">NL: She would never ask for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">SS: I was able to distract her.</span> <span id="s1566">But also having it ready in case it dawned on her that she didn't, hadn't collected the stamp, you know, "Oh, I'm sorry."</span> <span id="s1567">It was at that same goddamned bakery that in back of me one day, two German soldiers looked at her in awe at her fingernails, which had dark red polish, and one saying to the other, "Oh, look at her Blut" [blood] with relish.</span> <span id="s1568">And I swore I'd never wear make-up.</span> <span id="s1569">I'd never wear--okay.</span> <span id="s1570">What was difficult also was that Paula and Leon, by virtue of being hidden, they hid in a house, I mean, in an apartment in Chambéry on the second floor, but on the third floor, these were narrow round bat-like stairs, but upstairs lived a whore.</span> <span id="s1571">So, there was constant trampling, and it was terrifying, because you always heard the boots going up and, of course, it was the soldiers going up to the whore and you never knew, you know, the knock on the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">NL: Were they able to get out of the house at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">SS: They didn't.</span> <span id="s1574">They didn't.</span> <span id="s1575">They relied on me to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">NL: You brought food for them and messages, I guess, information, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">SS: Well, they could sneak out a little here and there, but I'd take Ariel, their son, out, which was an ordeal, because we got along fine until we were close to getting near the house.</span> <span id="s1578">He really was a brat, and then he would let go of my hand and run upstairs and cry like I had done something terrible to him.</span> <span id="s1579">Yet, the whole time we were out, we would sing, we would harmonize or whatever.</span> <span id="s1580">I remember one time, walking home with Ariel.</span> <span id="s1581">Chambéry is a medieval town.</span> <span id="s1582">That's where the Duke of Savoie used to have their castle, whatever, and walking down one of these narrow streets, when all of a sudden I heard a bang and shooting and I saw a man falling dead.</span> <span id="s1583">I was walking with Ariel, and I just yanked him and went all the way around and we ran and made it.</span> <span id="s1584">Interestingly, this brat understood when things were for real.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">NL: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">SS: Not a word.</span> <span id="s1587">Not a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">NL: Oh, interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">SS: Anyway, that part was difficult, was the having to go back to that dorm at night, and always being chased or followed or whatever by Germans.</span> <span id="s1590">I was 12 and I was developed early, secondary characteristics, breasts, and so on, so that part was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">NL: Was there any adult there whom you liked, who liked you, who gave you any special attention?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">NL: A teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">SS: The only special, the only attention that I got was for being a good student.</span> <span id="s1595">You know, I always pulled that, and I got some attention for not being so good in gym.</span> <span id="s1596">You know, you had to do gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">NL: You had to do gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">SS: But, no...</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">NL: And so, after a year, Paula and her husband and Ariel left this area?</span> <span id="s1600">What happened?</span> <span id="s1601">You said, you were at school for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">SS: Chambéry got to be too hot a city for anybody, and so they found refuge in the mountains in Savoie in a castle owned by people who inherited the castle, and they hired out, he as a gardener and she as a cook.</span> <span id="s1603">And then in May...</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">NL: And you, you went with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">SS: No, I stayed in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">NL: You stayed in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">SS: I stayed in the school.</span> <span id="s1608">Then, in May of 19--May 25, 1944, Chambéry, the city was bombed and, well, alerts were too frequent; I mean, hardly was there a night that you slept through.</span> <span id="s1609">Most [unclear] there were alarms.</span> <span id="s1610">You see, Chambéry, as you know, was a strategically located city, because that was the crossroad between France and Italy.</span> <span id="s1611">That's where the main railroad was and that was the beginning of the main thoroughfare between the two countries.</span> <span id="s1612">So, I remember many times waking up when the rest of the girls came back up from having been downstairs in the cave, in the shelter and I..</span> <span id="s1613">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">NL: You slept through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">SS: I slept through it.</span> <span id="s1616">Or many times sleeping downstairs and mostly we slept standing up.</span> <span id="s1617">But on that day the city was bombed, and the city was bombed badly.</span> <span id="s1618">We knew it was the Americans who had done it because they had missed the main railroad depot.</span> <span id="s1619">[laughter] The whole goddamn town was in flames.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">NL: Let me interrupt you just a minute, please.</span> <span id="s1621">Were you getting any news about the progress of the war during any of this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">NL: Were any of the teachers sharing any of this with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">NL: Singing "Maréchal, we love you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">NL: Did you have to express your loyalty to Pétain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">SS: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1629">In fact, there was an essay contest which I won.</span> <span id="s1630">[laughter] It was an essay contest sponsored by Vichy by Maréchal Pétain.</span> <span id="s1631">It had to do with something, write something about yourself, which I totally invented and illustrated and sent in, and I won the first prize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">NL: How did you fabricate this new identity?</span> <span id="s1633">Do you remember how the story went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">SS: I think, I have the story someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">NL: But you had to express your loyalty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">SS: No, not in it, but that was part, to just participate in this literary competition.</span> <span id="s1637">It was in itself an act of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">NL: Did any Vichy dignitaries come to the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">SS: No, I think, they sent whatever it was, a book, a mention, you know, a shindig.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">NL: Was there any underground rebelliousness in the school, that is, a pro-Allied, anti-German feeling that you could detect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">SS: None that I was

id="s1645">NL: Wasn't that the song "Maréchal, we love you"?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">SS: Maréchal, nous vous...</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">NL: This was the heart of Vichy land?</span> <span id="s1648">At least, this was the posture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1650">Anyway, the whole goddamn town is in flames.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">SS: And the Americans had done it again.</span> <span id="s1653">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s1654">By then we were able to recognize by the drone of the airplanes...</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">NL: Which plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">SS: ...whether it was British or American.</span> <span id="s1657">I'm sure I couldn't do that today.</span> <span id="s1658">Also, the city for some reason, that was May, was depleted of water.</span> <span id="s1659">Maybe it was a drought.</span> <span id="s1660">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1661">I just remember walking through the city all in flames and the usual question: Where the hell do I go now?</span> <span id="s1662">Paula and Leon, as I said, were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">NL: Did you hear from them through any route, any passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">SS: Well, sure enough, Leon came.</span> <span id="s1665">He was a good man.</span> <span id="s1666">He came and got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">NL: He came and got you.</span> <span id="s1668">After the bombardment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1670">He came and got me.</span> <span id="s1671">He had heard the town was in flames and he came and got me and he told me that he had found a nice place for me.</span> <span id="s1672">That this was a place in Savoie, in the mountains close to where he and Paula were hiding, and that it was an auberge, which was kind of a pension kind of thing, and that the lady of the house needed an all-around maid.</span> <span id="s1673">And he had found me a place.</span> <span id="s1674">So, Leon and I take the bus and we get to the place.</span> <span id="s1675">You get off the bus and you walk and this is really isolated.</span> <span id="s1676">In the mountain, a little road goes up, and as we get to the top of the road, I see this woman who looked like a formidable lady, and as I got to know her, of course, this was her typical posture with her hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">NL: Hands on her hips?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">SS: Her hands on her hips.</span> <span id="s1679">You know, "What's this?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">NL: No nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">SS: And looking and saying to Leon, "Is that you again, I told you I didn't want to ever see you again.</span> <span id="s1682">What the hell are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1683">Get away."</span> <span id="s1684">And I don't know what I said.</span> <span id="s1685">I must have said something, as she narrated it later.</span> <span id="s1686">She liked me right away.</span> <span id="s1687">She knew she couldn't stand him.</span> <span id="s1688">She knew she didn't want any part of him.</span> <span id="s1689">There was something about me that she liked and so in her grubby, gruff way, she said, "All right.</span> <span id="s1690">Leave her here and you get lost and I don't ever want to see you again."</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">NL: And where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">SS: He went back to the castle where he was in hiding.</span> <span id="s1693">So, I am living now with this lady.</span> <span id="s1694">Her name is Frazie and her daughter, her daughter was about 20 years old, and this is '44; I'm 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">NL: 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">SS: Yeah, I'm 13.</span> <span id="s1697">And the house itself was built also in medieval times.</span> <span id="s1698">The walls were made of stone, a meter and a half wide.</span> <span id="s1699">Frazie was a fascinating lady and that could take a whole hour to talk about her, where she came from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">NL: She had tenants?</span> <span id="s1701">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">SS: No, Frazie–I stayed, I was living there with her daughter, going into the fields, doing chores.</span> <span id="s1703">There was no water.</span> <span id="s1704">The well was a kilometer down, downhill, and you shlepped every drop of water on your back.</span> <span id="s1705">You know, with a thing on your back and two pails on each hand.</span> <span id="s1706">And they had one on the head, on top.</span> <span id="s1707">They were good at that.</span> <span id="s1708">I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1709">But, anyway, I knew something strange was going on in this house, because there were men that came and that went, and it took me two months, even though I slept in the same bedroom with Frazie and her daughter, Lucie, and we were together all the time and I spent a lot of time alone with Lucie.</span> <span id="s1710">It took me close to two months to figure out that it was the Underground.</span> <span id="s1711">I didn't know if it was the Underground or the French militia.</span> <span id="s1712">That was difficult.</span> <span id="s1713">But I tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">NL: What clues did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">SS: "Oh, goddamn it, we haven't had meat in so long.</span> <span id="s1716">I guess, if it weren't for the Germans, maybe we might have meat," they would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">NL: Anti-German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">SS: "Maybe we might have meat."</span> <span id="s1719">"I am not anti-German, but if it weren't for the war or something," you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">NL: Indirect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">SS: Oh, very, very indirect, totally...</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">NL: These were young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">NL: Who were coming and going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">SS: Yeah, and no matter what, I mean, I was smart and clever and so were they.</span> <span id="s1726">The other part was Frazie's reason for not wanting anybody in the house.</span> <span id="s1727">This went on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">NL: She knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">SS: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">NL: She didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">SS: Oh, I invented a new story for Frazie.</span> <span id="s1732">It was after the war that I talked to Frazie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">NL: What identity did you create for yourself, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">SS: My parents got killed during the evacuation of France of Northern France.</span> <span id="s1735">My father had been in the army and I guess, [unclear], you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">NL: And you could be consistent?</span> <span id="s1737">You remembered it to tell...</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">SS: As Frazie said after the war, it wasn't till after the war that I told her I was Jewish, it wasn't till after the war that I told Paula, who was five kilometers away in the village, that this was the French Underground.</span> <span id="s1739">I mean I didn't trust Paula with that, and I didn't trust Frazie that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">NL: Remarkable, the skills you developed for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">NL: It is remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">SS: Yeah, I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation, the first paper, on coping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">NL: Coping--you knew how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">SS: You know, that was before coping became a drugstore product.</span> <span id="s1746">But, anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">NL: So, what were some of the other clues that you had that this was an Underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">SS: Just to stay with that one trend of thought.</span> <span id="s1749">Frazie said after the war, when I told her that I was Jewish, she was very, very hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">NL: That you hadn't told her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">SS: That I didn't trust her.</span> <span id="s1752">She said I did a good job about my story.</span> <span id="s1753">But she said there was only one loophole that if it hadn't been that we were so busy and so involved with, you know, survival, and more than that, the whole business of the Underground business, that what she noted, the one discrepancy that she noted--remember, this was 1944.</span> <span id="s1754">My story was that I last saw my parents in 1940.</span> <span id="s1755">And she felt that I had too much of a vivid recall.</span> <span id="s1756">She realized, when she thought about it, which she really didn't allow herself to do much either, that that part didn't jibe.</span> <span id="s1757">You know, a recall of two years versus four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">NL: Four years.</span> <span id="s1759">Interesting.</span> <span id="s1760">She was a very alert lady, too, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">SS: Very, very bright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">NL: What was this Underground doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">SS: It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">BL: She had a star, a Michelin star, for her inn, before the war, with no running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">SS: One star, Michelin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">NL: Well, that's low grade, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">SS: To get any star in Michelin is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">NL: Oh, is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">SS: You know, the number of one-stars in Michelin, a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">NL: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">SS: You know, the guide, the guide Michelin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">NL: The guide, yes.</span> <span id="s1773">I thought, three or four would make it an excellent...</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">SS: Well, they only, they have one four-star, I think, in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">NL: Oh, so one-star is very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">SS: One star is in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">NL: Without running water.</span> <span id="s1778">Did she have good food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1780">She was a superb cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">NL: So, you were fed there, I hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">SS: No, there was no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">NL: This was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">SS: The star was pre-war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">NL: So, the eating was no better here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">SS: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1787">Except that there, you know, she grew vegetables and stuff, but, again, all the food there really went to serve to the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">NL: What were they providing for the Underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">SS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">NL: Arms as well as food or hiding places for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">SS: No, basically, hers was a substation of the headquarters of the French Underground, the Armée SecrΠte.</span> <span id="s1792">The link there were, was that, like one of the men, Jacques, who later married the daughter, Lucie, he was a parachutist from London, and up in the mountains, arms, ammunitions, and so on were parachuted, and so, her house was a meeting ground, a liaison from--and also at times they had a radio to listen to the messages, to get ready to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Tape 3, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">NL: ...role of the underground at this home.</span> <span id="s1795">Were you privy to any of these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">SS: Well, when I finally established myself with the daughter first...</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">NL: Lucie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1799">I knew that I had to get through Lucie.</span> <span id="s1800">And it was more that kind of strategy, more and more whatever current event was going on, to make a comment about it without acknowledging which side are you on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">NL: You were able to walk the tightrope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">SS: Right, and then, as I got to know Lucie better, and win her confidence, then I became a little more daring about making the kind of comment I made earlier about there being food if it weren't for the Germans, before, it would be: "It's rough that there is no food during the war."</span> <span id="s1803">That kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">NL: That was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">SS: That was a gradual...</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">NL: That was the extent of the shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">SS: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">NL: For instance, to me, that seems to be an almost imperceptible thing, but it spelled a great deal to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">SS: And for her.</span> <span id="s1810">First you say, "It's rough, isn't it, there not being any food?"</span> <span id="s1811">And then, she would say, "Α la guerre, comme Β la guerre."</span> <span id="s1812">[Expression meaning "War is war."]</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">NL: So you went incrementally...</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s1815">And then, went along with Lucie making more such observations.</span> <span id="s1816">Say, the only car you would see down the road, down the valley, you know, up from the mountains, which as I said was the main highway between France and Italy, and then to say, "By God!</span> <span id="s1817">A car!</span> <span id="s1818">I wonder if that's a police.</span> <span id="s1819">Maybe it is, police chief, I guess the French police, could be a French police.</span> <span id="s1820">Could be the Germans.</span> <span id="s1821">Could be the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">NL: To me...</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">SS: Then, a week later, a month, you'd say, "Ah, Germans do have petrol.</span> <span id="s1824">We don't."</span> <span id="s1825">This kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">NL: Ah, that sort of differentiation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">SS: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1828">Hey, your life is at stake.</span> <span id="s1829">You don't babble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">NL: But for a 13-year old to have picked these techniques up, that's what's astounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">SS: I should think that was true of most young people who survived alone, you know, the way that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">NL: Survival...</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">SS: You know, you put your foot in your mouth and you have no more head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">NL: And you learned that very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s1836">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">NL: So, you began to, then, share some of these subtle things with Lucie.</span> <span id="s1838">How much time did you spend with her mother?</span> <span id="s1839">How much conversation did you have with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">SS: Not too much.</span> <span id="s1841">Frazie was a relatively gruff lady and very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">NL: She was gardening and cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">SS: Cooking and tending to stuff and, of course, as I later learned, dealing with the Underground.</span> <span id="s1844">But, you know, she is a peasant stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">NL: Peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">SS: Frazie just died.</span> <span id="s1847">She was in her 80's.</span> <span id="s1848">She died last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">NL: Not much communication?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">SS: Well, after the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">NL: But I mean at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">SS: No.</span> <span id="s1853">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">NL: How did you spend your

you shlep up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">NL: Did you--were you able to get into town at all, or were you confined to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">SS: There was no time for anything.</span> <span id="s1861">When I finally, when I finally made contact with Lucie, it was an enormous relief.</span> <span id="s1862">You know, part of what I remember was really being most concerned about sleeping with these people.</span> <span id="s1863">My fear always was that I might talk in my sleep.</span> <span id="s1864">And for some reason I was quite terrified of that.</span> <span id="s1865">Apparently, fortunately, I never did.</span> <span id="s1866">But that was nightmarish.</span> <span id="s1867">That preoccupied me.</span> <span id="s1868">And I had adopted a style as much as now, I babble a lot and I talk a lot and so on.</span> <span id="s1869">I talked very little.</span> <span id="s1870">I talked very, very little.</span> <span id="s1871">And I never showed

differentiate.</span> <span id="s1875">When you--the places where you express sympathy are not places that hit me.</span> <span id="s1876">In the same way, one day you said, "How was it about being in the camp after having been used to silk pillows and silk linens and so on?"</span> <span id="s1877">Right?</span> <span id="s1878">Well, these are not the thoughts that come.</span> <span

there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">SS: It still is.</span> <span id="s1939">I think that in some major ways, I am a hopeless optimist about almost everything, and in an equally fundamental and major way, I am an extremely depressed, really depressed person.</span> <span id="s1940">And I don't think the grieving has ever ceased.</span> <span id="s1941">I think that the grieving never had anything formalized.</span> <span id="s1942">And I think that as a result, the notion--okay, that what made the grieving so difficult was the fact that until the day that I got those papers that we discussed earlier, with some arbitrary date saying my parents were killed in Auschwitz, the fantasy that they were alive was very strong.</span> <span id="s1943">It was lesser for my mother.</span> <span id="s1944">I always had a kind of fantasy that because she was ill, that probably she was spared much of the nightmare and died because she was ill.</span> <span id="s1945">But I always had the fantasy that my father, being so strong and so adept and having the skills and trades of a peasant who could survive anyway, that maybe he had been liberated by the Russians and he was still alive.</span> <span id="s1946">The final realization that all of that was fantasy had nothing to do with some papers issued by some Nazis, Germans, but it really became concrete the day that I got on the boat in Sweden, in Göteborg, on the "Gripsholm", to come to the United States, and as I watched the distance between the land, Europe, and the water, the ocean getting wider and wider, that is when I really broke up.</span> <span id="s1947">And that's when I, for some reason, that was a finale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">NL: The separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">SS: That was it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1950">But so, the problem was that, you know, people, when people kept coming back, not knowing, not knowing--I corresponded after the war with relatives in the United States, as much as I thought, badly as I told you, that's not--there is more about Jewish agencies, I thought the most remarkable people in the world were the Chicago Post Office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">NL: Strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">SS: After the war I addressed a letter to my cousin, his name, Chicago, Illinois.</span> <span id="s1953">And they delivered it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">NL: Oh, that is remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">SS: I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">NL: I don't think it could happen today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">NL: The Post Office is much more efficient is those days.</span> <span id="s1959">Well, if you are not too tired, let's just take another few minutes for your experiences with the Underground, after you gained Lucie's confidence and you were able to indicate where your sympathies were.</span> <span id="s1960">Were you enlisted in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">SS: Well, by, you know, once I was accepted as a member of the family, as someone who could be trusted, and that you couldn't--you weren't trusted until you have proved yourself.</span> <span id="s1962">I mean, as much as the French are verbal and so on, it was a war.</span> <span id="s1963">And words didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s1964">It was deeds.</span> <span id="s1965">And once I demonstrated that I was dependable, then there was no more problem.</span> <span id="s1966">After the war, they said, all of them, that is, Frazie, Lucie, and Jacques, who was a young man, that perhaps one of the things among others that they best remembered about me was my sense of humor.</span> <span id="s1967">That the most grotesque, horrible, miserable time, for some reason, I found something funny to say, to put it in perspective, and to laugh, and I think that--you asked me how did I survive, and I think that was part of it.</span> <span id="s1968">Okay.</span> <span id="s1969">What my major part of the war contribution specific to the Underground was the delivery of messages.</span> <span id="s1970">As I indicated, because Jacques, who had been parachuted from London, and there was another man, a captain, who was the commander-in-chief of the region, who often came there, they received, they knew the code of the information that was transmitted from London, which had to do with the delivery of ammunition and stuff, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1971">So then, the object was to transmit the messages to the various smaller units along the way.</span> <span id="s1972">And the main method of locomotion, I am thinking of the 2,000-year-old man, you know, the story about the 2,000-year-old man, and when he was asked which kind of locomotion did you use in those days and he said, "Fear.</span> <span id="s1973">We ran like hell."</span> <span id="s1974">It was bicycles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">NL: Bicycles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">SS: And knowing the mountains, you know, climbing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">NL: You bicycled up those mountains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">SS: Bicycling up the mountains and also going up to the mountains to the farmers to get eggs.</span> <span id="s1979">That was another, that was a neat trick, and I was not born and raised in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1980">The shoes we had were wooden soles.</span> <span id="s1981">And I am appalled by the current fad!</span> <span id="s1982">Goddamn America!</span> <span id="s1983">You know, these clunky wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1984">We had no leather.</span> <span id="s1985">Try to climb mountains with these wooden cloppers, but, anyway, you did it mostly on your ass.</span> <span id="s1986">That is, you go all the way up to the mountains, which was a four or five hour walk.</span> <span id="s1987">Lucie showed me the way once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">NL: Once?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">SS: Once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">NL: And you had to master it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">BL: And she showed you the way to get up a tree, too, but not the way to get down, and you figured that out yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">SS: So, you know, getting some eggs from the peasants, carrying them in the basket, and the idea was to get back down and you didn't dare break an egg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">NL: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">SS: You didn't dare.</span> <span id="s1996">So, that's why I said you ended up with a raw tochis from sliding down.</span> <span id="s1997">But there wasn't a broken egg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">NL: Did you meet any other young people who were involved in similar activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">SS: It was not a social club.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">NL: But, I mean, no other networks that you contacted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">NL: Because there was a very wide ranging network, and many...</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">SS: Right, but I assumed that because this was the headquarters, it was very isolated, and it was important that it be so.</span> <span id="s2004">Anyways, how did we transport messages?</span> <span id="s2005">There were two methods.</span> <span id="s2006">Lucie happened to have a big mouth, and I don't mean it figuratively.</span> <span id="s2007">I mean it literally, a big, oral cavity.</span> <span id="s2008">And in those days in France, aspirin containers were flat little things, sort of oval shaped, you know, that you pull apart and put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">SS: It's hard to describe it verbally.</span> <span id="s2011">They were made out of tin or something.</span> <span id="s2012">And that's what aspirin came in.</span> <span id="s2013">Because she had such a big mouth, the message was housed in that thing, and she hid it in her mouth and she had practiced how, if necessary, she could swallow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">NL: Swallow it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s2016">You didn't get caught with a message in your mouth.</span> <span id="s2017">Not having a big mouth and, in fact, having a very small mouth, I mean, oral cavity, I invented a method of carrying the messages, which is, you take, I put the message in a container like that and attached the container to a wire so.</span> <span id="s2018">On the container I made a hook like a nail bent around like that.</span> <span id="s2019">I also had a cork.</span> <span id="s2020">Anyway, take a cork, put a thing on it, put the message, remove the seat of the bicycle.</span> <span id="s2021">Sorry, I'm thinking in French now.</span> <span id="s2022">Remove the seat of the bicycle, then you have this long bar, right?</span> <span id="s2023">Okay, put the message in there, top it with a cork, and the cork has a bent nail so that you can tip the bike upside down, shake it, it won't fall off.</span> <span id="s2024">But if you know about it you can go down there and retrieve it and pull it up.</span> <span id="s2025">That's when also it was important for me not to know German, because one time, on one of these missions on a bridge, the Germans stopped me and wanted my bike, and they talked about me and I could understand what they said and that was the scary part.</span> <span id="s2026">The scary part was not just understanding what they said, but it was the fear that they would see that I could understand them, and to continue acting like I didn't understand them.</span> <span id="s2027">I was just a dumb peasant kid.</span> <span id="s2028">Since Frazie didn't know that I was Jewish and Lucie didn't know, they decided, Frazie decided it was important that I, you know, be communion.</span> <span id="s2029">So, they understood about the war and all that and poor orphan, so I got private tutoring from the local priest, and with the local priest the difficult part was, I was supposed to be dumb, and, you know, all these terrible things that had happened, and I didn't know much about Catholicism.</span> <span id="s2030">And he was awed, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2031">I have heard of Jesus and I knew the basic prayers.</span> <span id="s2032">So, I became a good Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">NL: Went to mass?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">SS: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">NL: Communion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">SS: Oh, yes, the whole bit.</span> <span id="s2037">I still smell that holy water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">NL: The incense, the holy water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">NL: How long did you stay with Frazie?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">SS: Till the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">NL: And for this part of the country, when was liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">SS: We liberated ourselves, actually, August 22 through 24, 1944.</span> <span id="s2044">Right.</span> <span id="s2045">The war formally ended in '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">NL: Paris was liberated, I think, in '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">SS: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2048">That's when we literally liberated ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">NL: What was the signal for liberation?</span> <span id="s2050">How did you know you were--the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">SS: The same Captain Blanchard came in a uniform in a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">NL: Revealed himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">SS: And said, "You can put up the flag."</span> <span id="s2054">That was also the day that I caught the man whom I later learned was the butcher of Grenoble, which is a city.</span> <span id="s2055">Here is Chambéry.</span> <span id="s2056">Okay.</span> <span id="s2057">And Frazie's house was like 40 kilometers from Chambéry up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s2058">Here is Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2059">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">NL: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">SS: No, I have thought about it and, you know, I could ask, I could write to Lucie and find out.</span> <span id="s2062">What happened on that day, as you asked, Blanchard came up in a car and again, that same top of the road, it was a dirt road, where Frazie's house was.</span> <span id="s2063">By the way, Frazie's first cousin lived, had a house adjacent to her house, just separated by another little tiny road, but quite adjacent.</span> <span id="s2064">Until the end of the war he didn't know whether it was the French Underground or the milice [militia].</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">NL: Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">SS: You know, and as I said, I saw Paula once in a while, but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2067">I was afraid that if I let Paula know that I was in the Underground, and she ever got caught or her husband or her son, she'd sell out.</span> <span id="s2068">And likewise I was afraid that if I got caught and Frazie and Lucie, that the price for harboring a Jew would be double, number one.</span> <span id="s2069">Number two, they were quite anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">NL: You picked that up?</span> <span id="s2071">It was obvious?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">SS: It wasn't hard.</span> <span id="s2073">I mean, all Jews have flat feet and long noses!</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">NL: But they expressed this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">SS: Yeah, they told jokes about it and they talked about Jews in that way, and when after the war, when I told them I was Jewish, the first comment was, "But you don't look it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">NL: Or, you're not like the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">SS: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">BL: A white Jew.</span> <span id="s2079">A wonderful phrase.</span> <span id="s2080">A white Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">NL: So, then, your friend came up in a car and in uniform and announced that you could raise the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s2083">And almost simultaneously or within minutes of his arrival, up the road came again, you know, we are standing at the house and here is the kitchen and you can look out and you can see what is coming up way down the road, what's coming up the road.</span> <span id="s2084">Because the Germans apparently had been finally very suspicious of the activities.</span> <span id="s2085">And we were slated to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">NL: Erased.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">SS: Oh, yeah, so we did a timely job.</span> <span id="s2088">We did it before they got us.</span> <span id="s2089">But the documents they found afterwards there was no doubt about it, that the house had been cased and they were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">NL: And how long did you stay with Frazie after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">SS: Well, then, after the war I went back to my famous boarding school and then we moved up, but you wanted to hear the story about the last day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">NL: Yes, the last day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">SS: The butcher of Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2094">So anyway, Blanchard came and there was, you know, embracing and shaking of hands and celebration and all that.</span> <span id="s2095">When this man and this woman show up at the top of the road, you have to be Lucie or myself to be able to manage that road on the bike without getting off and walking.</span> <span id="s2096">It's steep.</span> <span id="s2097">They were pushing the bike and they looked dragged out, pretty farshlept and haggard, and the man said to Blanchard, that they had just left the Germans who had temporarily seized them, that they knew of important German documents that would be priceless to the French in the Underground, and what he wanted was a pass to get across the Underground line to go and retrieve these papers.</span> <span id="s2098">And in the moment of the heat, celebration, Blanchard pulled out a pad of paper and was about to give it to them.</span> <span id="s2099">They were all busy, I mean, they're French, and I watched and I didn't like these people and I didn't like what he was doing, and the best way to get to a Frenchman--I mean, I'm saying this because I remember that it was deliberate on my part, saying to Blanchard, the man also said that there were a lot of bikes down the road, and I said to Blanchard, "Look at this old rusted, rusty thing that I have been dragging for the work.</span> <span id="s2100">I'd like a new bicycle.</span> <span id="s2101">Why don't you instead of writing that thing to the man, why don't you let me go with him so I can get a bicycle."</span> <span id="s2102">That's the only way to appeal to a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s2103">They understand greed.</span> <span id="s2104">[laughter] So, there was a chorus, "Oh, yes."</span> <span id="s2105">By the way, my name, in keeping with what I said earlier, the name I made up for Slucki for Suchard, my name was Solange Sansont S-A-N-S-O-N-T, spelled in the French way.</span> <span id="s2106">So my initials remained the same, and Solange, I told him, you know, nobody ever called me Solange.</span> <span id="s2107">I was called always Sonnie.</span> <span id="s2108">Now, we are back to the same thing.</span> <span id="s2109">Again, I was afraid of slipping and, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">NL: No, it's very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">SS: So, the course then, was well of course, since I was entitled to my piece of celebration, of course, Sonnie should have a bike.</span> <span id="s2112">The Germans stole a lot of new bikes.</span> <span id="s2113">"Go with the man and get a bike."</span> <span id="s2114">And that is how, because I didn't trust him, this man and I embarked and we walked down the road and we walked and we walked and we didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s2115">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2116">And I took shortcuts, so that he couldn't find his way back.</span> <span id="s2117">And we get to the main road, along the river, the IsΠre, which is a major river again, that connects between France and Italy.</span> <span id="s2118">And along that road, the road was littered, and I mean littered, with dead German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2119">Many of them were young, they were all ages.</span> <span id="s2120">And he got very frightened.</span> <span id="s2121">It was a funny, strange feeling I had.</span> <span id="s2122">I didn't hate them.</span> <span id="s2123">I was no longer scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">NL: It was the chief difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">SS: That was it.</span> <span id="s2126">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s2127">I mean, how do you hate a corpse?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">NL: And the man walking with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">SS: He started shaking and probably got diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">NL: And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">SS: I didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s2132">Remember I'm a kid.</span> <span id="s2133">Here's this man and I said to him looking around, I said, "Monsieur, did you see enough?"</span> <span id="s2134">Tape 4, side 1: August 4, 1985 (in Princeton)</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">NL: Now, continuing my interview with Dr. Sonja Samson, of Princeton, this is Nora Levin interviewing on August 4, 1985.</span> <span id="s2136">All right, Sonja, if you will continue, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s2138">As I recall, and I don't want to repeat myself, I left off at the place which involved a day in 1944, August 21 or 22 where, involving the butcher of Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2139">I don't remember the details of what I said last time.</span> <span id="s2140">As I recall, I left off at the place where this man came up the road with a woman.</span> <span id="s2141">They were pushing bicycles.</span> <span id="s2142">They looked disheveled and they knew for some reason--it wasn't clear then how--that the underground headquarters were at that house and also that Blanchard, the local, the captain of the local Underground, that is, the French Armée SecrΠte, the Secret Army, had stopped by.</span> <span id="s2143">His reason for having come was to simply tell us that it was okay to put up the French flag.</span> <span id="s2144">The man approached Blanchard and said that he wanted a permit to cross the lines because, by now, all the lines were overtaken by the French Underground, that he knew where the Germans had hidden a substantial number of documents and that he could retrieve them and bring them back to the Underground and that they would be of great interest.</span> <span id="s2145">Carried away by the enthusiasm of the day, the elation that it was all over, that we had won at least in that part of France, Blanchard pulled out a piece of paper and was about to write this man a permit.</span> <span id="s2146">I didn't like the man and I didn't like the woman, and I barged in and I said that I had heard from talking to the man's wife briefly, that down the road there were many bicycles that the Germans had stolen and abandoned, and that I would like to go along with the man to get a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2147">Blanchard and the other people who were there thought, of course, I was entitled to a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2148">I had used this old clunker before and, certainly, the least they could do for me was to let me have a bike.</span> <span id="s2149">So I said, "There's no need.</span> <span id="s2150">The guys know me.</span> <span id="s2151">There's no need for you to write such a permit.</span> <span id="s2152">I'll get through.</span> <span id="s2153">Don't write him one."</span> <span id="s2154">So he pulled it back in.</span> <span id="s2155">And the only reason that the son of a bitch didn't get, you know, a piece of paper that would have let him--a pass, pass is the word.</span> <span id="s2156">Okay.</span> <span id="s2157">So, I..</span> <span id="s2158">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">NL: How did he react?</span> <span id="s2160">When you interjected yourself that way?</span> <span id="s2161">Must have been furious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">SS: Possibly.</span> <span id="s2163">He didn't show it; he looked very docile.</span> <span id="s2164">If he had expressed any such, he would certainly have aroused suspicion, so he just responded passively and didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s2165">So, it was decided that his wife, his so-called wife, looked also disheveled and tired and I suggested maybe she could stay behind.</span> <span id="s2166">I didn't feel like struggling with two of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">NL: Were you at all frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">NL: At the prospect of going off with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2171">No.</span> <span id="s2172">It wasn't foolish, you know.</span> <span id="s2173">It really wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">NL: Well, you diverted him obviously from something quite nefarious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">SS: Yeah, that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">NL: Very vital.</span> <span id="s2177">But, now that you are with him, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">SS: What was foremost in my mind was not personal safety.</span> <span id="s2179">It really never was, but really the damage that this man could do.</span> <span id="s2180">So we set off on foot.</span> <span id="s2181">He and I, and we walked, and I took all kinds of shortcuts to go down the mountain and get over to where the main road was.</span> <span id="s2182">I mentioned that before.</span> <span id="s2183">That's the major highway between Chambéry and Italy.</span> <span id="s2184">And it's Valley IsΠre, the major river and we walked and we walked and it was August, and August in Savoie can be and usually is sort of like here, extremely hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">NL: Was he menacing in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2187">He walked somewhat stooped and somewhat frightened.</span> <span id="s2188">And it was a very odd experience that he seemed throughout extremely docile.</span> <span id="s2189">There were still fire shots that could be heard in the distance and he was frightened and I assured him.</span> <span id="s2190">[laughter] I kept saying, "Stick with me and you'll be all right!"</span> <span id="s2191">We walked, and we got to the major highway, and the highway was littered to the right, to the left, with hundreds and hundreds of bodies, of dead soldiers, German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2192">That was a very strange experience.</span> <span id="s2193">I hadn't seen many corpses before in my life.</span> <span id="s2194">I had seen some, but not many, and it was very odd.</span> <span id="s2195">It was very odd, the day before, these were the people pursuing us, these were the people who had frightened me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">NL: Did you feel some elation or joy at seeing them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">SS: That's what I am describing.</span> <span id="s2198">I felt relief, that it was over.</span> <span id="s2199">I felt pity.</span> <span id="s2200">Here were these yesterday, strong healthy men who were savages, because the night before and every night up in the mountains you could sit there in the Alps and as far as the eye could see at night, you saw fire.</span> <span id="s2201">You know what they did.</span> <span id="s2202">They rounded all up the villagers, men, women and children, rounded them up in the center of the village and burned them.</span> <span id="s2203">And we found out afterwards that our town was next.</span> <span id="s2204">They had, they knew just about with certainty what we were doing.</span> <span id="s2205">It was just a matter of one day or two.</span> <span id="s2206">So, it was kind of shocking.</span> <span id="s2207">I mean, that was yesterday and here it is today.</span> <span id="s2208">I have often been awed about the fact that I felt no hatred.</span> <span id="s2209">I didn't rejoice.</span> <span id="s2210">I felt, I don't know, I think partly numb, partly tormented, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">NL: Maybe even disbelieving?</span> <span id="s2212">That there could have been such change in one day in your life...</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">SS: That, too, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">NL: What was the reaction of this man through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">SS: I just looked at him and I said to him, "Have you seen enough?"</span> <span id="s2216">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s2217">And he was shaking.</span> <span id="s2218">I mean, he was shaking like a leaf.</span> <span id="s2219">He was terrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">NL: The world had turned upside down for him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">SS: He was terrified.</span> <span id="s2222">And you know, again you could hear occasional shooting in the distance, and I said, "Come on, follow me.</span> <span id="s2223">We are going back."</span> <span id="s2224">And we walked back and we never said a word.</span> <span id="s2225">I never asked about papers, documents, nothing.</span> <span id="s2226">By then I had figured it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">NL: Now, when you say "back," you meant back...</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">SS: To the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">NL: To the house.</span> <span id="s2230">Right.</span> <span id="s2231">He followed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">SS: To the house.</span> <span id="s2233">He followed like a puppy.</span> <span id="s2234">Now, once we got back, I called Frazie and I made it clear that I wanted to talk to her alone, quick.</span> <span id="s2235">I said, "Frazie, something is wrong with this guy.</span> <span id="s2236">Quick, did you check his bikes, did you check the luggage?"</span> <span id="s2237">She said, "No."</span> <span id="s2238">I said, "Do it."</span> <span id="s2239">We did and, of course, he had all kinds of ammunition and hand grenades and God knows what, all kinds of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">NL: Did he have any papers on him which she could check against?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">SS: I think that she simply called Blanchard and the others and they came and got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">NL: Arrested him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2244">And three days later, we found out that he was the butcher of Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2245">You know, Barbie was the butcher of Lyon.</span> <span id="s2246">This was the butcher of Grenoble.</span> <span id="s2247">There's more to the story.</span> <span id="s2248">I'm giving a very abbreviated version.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">NL: Was he ultimately tried in the French court, or did he also escape?</span> <span id="s2250">Like Barbie did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">SS: I think no.</span> <span id="s2252">I think that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">NL: What was his name, again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2255">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2256">And when I was back there, I meant to ask the people there.</span> <span id="s2257">Someday I'll ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">NL: But he was referred to as the "butcher of Grenoble."</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s2260">Right.</span> <span id="s2261">See, what I learned, and as I've mentioned to you, the current work that I do, I work as a forensic psychologist, and I have found that experience repeated over and over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">NL: Which experience, Sonja?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">SS: Yesterday's...</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">NL: Monsters?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">SS: Nightmares, monsters, sadist, bully, once caught, I mean, they fall apart.</span> <span id="s2266">Totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">NL: What are the dynamics involved here?</span> <span id="s2268">It's just that when they have power, they have murderous intentions?</span> <span id="s2269">Or can be murderous.</span> <span id="s2270">Once they lose their power, all their strength goes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">SS: No, what takes over is utter self-pity and only one thought: "What's going to happen to me?</span> <span id="s2272">What are they going to do to me?"</span> <span id="s2273">Which is all too frequently mistaken by psychologists, by psychiatrists and by the court, as representing remorse.</span> <span id="s2274">And guilt.</span> <span id="s2275">It's not.</span> <span id="s2276">It's just whining self-pity.</span> <span id="s2277">But I learned it then, and it's infallible.</span> <span id="s2278">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">NL: Now, what then did you do after this experience?</span> <span id="s2280">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s2281">It's August, '44.</span> <span id="s2282">Did you try to reach any possible living connections and contacts?</span> <span id="s2283">Or were you so numb that you just wanted to stay put for a while?</span> <span id="s2284">You were how old, at this point, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">SS: I was born January, 1931.</span> <span id="s2286">So I was 13.</span> <span id="s2287">No, to me the war was not officially over.</span> <span id="s2288">The end of the war had not, what is it?</span> <span id="s2289">The treaty had not been signed, and I didn't really trust it until--when was it, May?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">NL: May '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">SS: Yeah, I didn't trust until that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">NL: Did you see any acts of retaliation against any French collaborators in this period?</span> <span id="s2293">Late '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">SS: Somehow, I don't know quite why nor how I personally did not.</span> <span id="s2295">But I heard and I read and, you know, the same thing that has been known, which is, you know, the shaving of the women's heads, or women who had collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2296">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">NL: You may have been isolated from that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2299">But it was also, you asked about the butcher of Lyon, of Grenoble, I mean, and I think that they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">NL: The French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">SS: Yeah, I think that the most expeditious justice was done on the spot.</span> <span id="s2302">I think that, to a large extent, they weren't taking chances and they just killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">NL: So, you stayed on at the house for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">SS: And I returned to Chambéry to the boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">NL: To the boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">NL: Were any of your former friends or contacts still alive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">SS: If you recall, there was one girl who had hidden in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">SS: Who was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">SS: That I knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">NL: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">SS: I didn't see her again, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">NL: You don't know what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">SS: I saw her again when I went back to Europe in 1953.</span> <span id="s2317">I contacted her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">NL: So, she did survive then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">SS: Yeah, she did survive, and I think, her father survived or her mother.</span> <span id="s2320">One or the other came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">NL: What did you find at the boarding house then?</span> <span id="s2322">Were you welcomed back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">SS: At the boarding school?</span> <span id="s2324">It just continued like before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">NL: Did you feel any special protectiveness or tenderness toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">SS: I never acknowledged that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">NL: Not even after...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">SS: It wasn't over.</span> <span id="s2329">It wasn't over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">NL: It wasn't over for you.</span> <span id="s2331">So, you then continued with your classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">NL: Were you able to discipline yourself sufficiently to study again, or was it something of a relief to be able to do that, finally?</span> <span id="s2334">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">SS: I remember that, at that time, I think, today we would call it acting out, but you see, at that time, nothing had really changed.</span> <span id="s2336">Food was still unavailable, and nothing had changed.</span> <span id="s2337">Except for the fact that there weren't any Germans right there in town, nothing had changed.</span> <span id="s2338">There was no sense that the war had ended.</span> <span id="s2339">That only happened in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">NL: So, you were still hungry very often, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">SS: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2342">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">NL: Were you able to get food in some other way, other than through school?</span> <span id="s2344">I think, I remember your saying you used to go, what, out to the country, out to the weeds, and forage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">NL: Did you have to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">SS: After that, on extended weekends and vacation I would go back to Frazie.</span> <span id="s2348">That’s the lady of the Underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">NL: Ah, yes, at the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">SS: Right, and sometimes peasants would give me a piece of bread and so on.</span> <span id="s2351">But I did join girls who were, it's called "going over the wall."</span> <span id="s2352">The boarding school, I described that earlier, was an old convent with huge walls, I guess, about 12 feet tall, that surrounded it like a fence.</span> <span id="s2353">And some of the girls had boyfriends and stuff that they climbed the wall and met.</span> <span id="s2354">I decided to go with them.</span> <span id="s2355">I was tired of being so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">NL: Scaled 12 foot walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">NL: This would have to be at night, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">SS: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2360">And on the other side we met boys, and I met up with a boy whose parents owned a vegetable stand.</span> <span id="s2361">So, in exchange for a kiss, I got two oranges, which I took back and brought to Paula for her kid, for the boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">NL: Both.</span> <span id="s2363">You didn't keep any for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2365">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">NL: Were you able to get something for yourself?</span> <span id="s2367">You turned everything over...</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">SS: No, but that isn't the end of the story.</span> <span id="s2369">Then, somehow, I guess, a neighbor or somebody who lived across the street--that's all I did.</span> <span id="s2370">I mean I just went out for the walk.</span> <span id="s2371">I don't know if I described, but life in that boarding school was quite hideous.</span> <span id="s2372">I did mention a bit, I say, I used to daydream being outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">NL: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">SS: I did describe that.</span> <span id="s2375">Okay.</span> <span id="s2376">So that was kind of fulfilling my daydream.</span> <span id="s2377">You know, the climbing over the wall and being outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">NL: And did you make some close friends among the students with whom you could daydream?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">SS: I did it alone.</span> <span id="s2380">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">NL: But, I mean, in your own life within this school, were there any friendships that were especially meaningful to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">SS: None.</span> <span id="s2383">No.</span> <span id="s2384">It was all distant.</span> <span id="s2385">You know.</span> <span id="s2386">None.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">NL: So, you didn't even have that compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">NL: Who were these other children?</span> <span id="s2390">Can you describe them a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">SS: Yeah, they were--I guess that boarding school would be the equivalent of American high school.</span> <span id="s2392">In the villages, say, for example, the village in which I lived, when I was in the Underground with Frazie, the closest school, grammar school, was five kilometers away.</span> <span id="s2393">I had mentioned to you, I think, when I lived in central France, in Vic-Sur-CΠre, walking approximately five miles to and from school.</span> <span id="s2394">Those were the equivalent of our grade schools, but as far as the equivalent of high school, there weren't any except in the major cities.</span> <span id="s2395">I guess, the préfecture was, which to be roughly translated, if one thinks of each French département, as equivalent to a state, it would be the capital.</span> <span id="s2396">Even though it's not analogous because they are not independent states.</span> <span id="s2397">But that's in, say, the préfecture, that is...</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">NL: Major city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">SS: The major city would have a high school.</span> <span id="s2400">Now, it was public school and the citizens of Chambéry would send their kids to the day school.</span> <span id="s2401">The peasants would use the boarding school.</span> <span id="s2402">Is that clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">NL: So, it was not private at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">SS: Oh, no, public.</span> <span id="s2405">So that all the girls, to answer your question, of course, in France they did not have coeducational education, so all the girls were peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">NL: Peasant girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">SS: Peasant girls, primitive, very superstitious, and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s2408">We were caught.</span> <span id="s2409">The other girls had climbed that wall many times.</span> <span id="s2410">I did it once.</span> <span id="s2411">And we were caught.</span> <span id="s2412">We were caught and it became a big affair.</span> <span id="s2413">The town newspaper had, you know, "Nuns escape from the convent," and it was sort of a scandal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">NL: You were punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">SS: Paula was called in, and Paula and the director of the school went through their tap dance of hurt.</span> <span id="s2416">"How could you do this to us?"</span> <span id="s2417">I’d done it to personally to hurt them that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s2418">[laughter] "Of all people!</span> <span id="s2419">After all we have done for you.</span> <span id="s2420">We’ve saved your life."</span> <span id="s2421">Endless, endless nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">NL: Were you able to dismiss it, or were you badly hurt by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">SS: Well, I'll give you an example.</span> <span id="s2424">I had kept a diary, and I have never in my life, to the best of my knowledge to this day, have ever been jealous or envious of anyone, ever.</span> <span id="s2425">Funny, that way.</span> <span id="s2426">But it was a goddamn well written diary.</span> <span id="s2427">I wrote well.</span> <span id="s2428">And sometimes I am jealous to know that that thing no longer exists.</span> <span id="s2429">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">NL: Someone took it or was it just lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">SS: Oh, because when they found out, they raided all my clothes and all my belongings and they found the diary even though I wrote not too explicitly.</span> <span id="s2432">But, nevertheless, I poured out how I felt about Paula, how I felt about the director and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s2433">It was rather transparent.</span> <span id="s2434">So, after everybody had read it, when I got it back I just tore it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">NL: Oh, they did return it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">NL: But it had been despoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">SS: It had been violated.</span> <span id="s2439">And I've much regretted that many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">NL: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">SS: Because I think it had a kind of vividness and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">NL: Surely.</span> <span id="s2443">So contemporary with the events.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">SS: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">NL: Adolescent's point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">NL: How else did they punish you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">SS: I was expelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">NL: You were expelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">SS: I was expelled and that meant living with Paula who was hysterical about what I had done.</span> <span id="s2451">It was also at that time on the day--well, I needed to have my tonsils removed, because I kept getting recurring throat infections, and this was done sitting up in a chair in a physician's office.</span> <span id="s2452">He sat there.</span> <span id="s2453">I sat here, and the nurse held a big tray and to this day when a dentist has to insert a needle way back I can re-feel it, I get this horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">NL: No anesthesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">SS: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s2456">So not only that, but that bastard was elated at the size of my tonsils and insisted that I look at them.</span> <span id="s2457">He had never seen them that big.</span> <span id="s2458">So after that, I walked home.</span> <span id="s2459">And Paula had to take care of me and, of course, our relationship was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">NL: Damaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">SS: Very strained, to say the least.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">NL: You never could recover whatever it was that you had before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">SS: I guess, maybe that wasn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">NL: There was not much to recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">SS: Probably.</span> <span id="s2466">Thus, I remember the day of the declaration of the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2467">I forget what day it was, June?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">NL: May 8th.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">SS: May 8.</span> <span id="s2470">Okay, I'll accept that.</span> <span id="s2471">I remember walking through the streets in Chambéry and people screaming and yelling and, you know, like the movies that you see about the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">NL: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">SS: First of all, I couldn't talk because I had my tonsils out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">NL: You were still suffering?</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">SS: And, secondly, I was just bewildered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">NL: What now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2478">It didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s2479">It was like an intellectual concept.</span> <span id="s2480">That was some idea that had no genuine reality for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">NL: Were you thinking at all about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">SS: Never stopped.</span> <span id="s2483">Never stopped thinking about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">NL: Never stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">SS: In fact...</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">NL: Did you make inquiries in '44, '45 of anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">SS: Well, let me just--I wrote the diary basically, the diary basically--I took photos basically, did all kinds of things for my parents to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">NL: You took photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">NL: You had a camera, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">SS: No, but, you know, when people took a picture and you’d get one, you know, school pictures, you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">NL: And you saved them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">SS: I saved them, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">NL: So, they would know what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">SS: Right, so that when you ask, did I think about my parents, I would say that on one level, I never thought about anything else.</span> <span id="s2496">You know, it was like an omnipresent kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">NL: Did you ask about their possible whereabouts?</span> <span id="s2498">Any people?</span> <span id="s2499">Did you have any access to official agencies, government, municipal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">SS: I think that...</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">NL: Did you ask Paula, to--</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">SS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">NL: To intercede for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">SS: To let the organizations know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">NL: Which organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2507">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">NL: She knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">SS: Paula?</span> <span id="s2510">Well, she was Jewish herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">NL: She was Jewish herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">SS: Remember, she was very distantly related to me.</span> <span id="s2513">Very distantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">NL: So, she presumably contacted Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s2516">One of the surprisingly painful experiences consisted of letters.</span> <span id="s2517">I think I mentioned to you when I spoke to you before, there was a family by the name of Epstein that we lived with for a time.</span> <span id="s2518">Roland, the son, was caught, smuggling children into Switzerland and I told you there was a woman, Latour, I think is her name, who wrote a book on the French Underground.3</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">NL: Anny Latour?</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">SS: Right, and she described Roland.</span> <span id="s2521">She mentioned him.</span> <span id="s2522">So Roland was deported but he was able, apparently, in the camps in Germany to pass for a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s2523">And, I think, that he faked being an Arab, which he could.</span> <span id="s2524">He had very black...</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">NL: An Arab?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">SS: Well, to account for his circumcision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">NL: How clever!</span> <span id="s2528">I've never heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">SS: Sure, how do you explain that you are circumcised if you are a man.</span> <span id="s2530">He had olive colored skin, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">NL: So many other Jews did, too.</span> <span id="s2532">It's the first time I hear of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">SS: Yes, he was a clever man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">NL: And the Germans believed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">SS: Apparently, because they treated him as a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s2536">I mean, not as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2537">All right.</span> <span id="s2538">So, Mrs. Epstein wrote me very moving letter...</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">NL: She wrote this to Paula?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">SS: To me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">NL: To you in care of Paula, or to you?</span> <span id="s2542">Your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2544">"Dear Sonja, Can't tell you how overjoyed we are and excited and jubilant."</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">NL: This is '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2547">"Roland came back."</span> <span id="s2548">And almost, a sort of P.S., "I hope you will hear from your parents, too."</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">NL: One letter or did you get more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">SS: One letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">NL: One letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">SS: Then I had a..</span> <span id="s2553">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">NL: Did you write to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2556">What was there to write?</span> <span id="s2557">I heard nothing.</span> <span id="s2558">They hadn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">NL: You didn't think, perhaps, the Epsteins might have heard something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">SS: I was very arrogant and I figured that if my parents were alive, they would find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">NL: They would find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">SS: I wrote to the places where we had lived together, to tell them that I was alive and if they heard from my parents.</span> <span id="s2563">I wrote to the family in America.</span> <span id="s2564">I wrote and let it be known to all the people that I felt my parents would contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Tape 4, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">NL: This is side two continuing an interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">NL: About the Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s2568">You heard from none of the Jewish organizations?</span> <span id="s2569">No representative ever came to Paula's?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">NL: And inquired about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">NL: Were there any local Jewish agencies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2575">This was May.</span> <span id="s2576">Shortly after that, Paula and her family and I moved to a suburb of Paris.</span> <span id="s2577">They originally had lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s2578">And they did not return to Paris, so we lived in the suburb of Paris.</span> <span id="s2579">And you asked me, did I write, so I wrote.</span> <span id="s2580">I had written to these relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s2581">Remember, I told you about the Post Office which delivered a letter addressed to my cousin in Chicago.</span> <span id="s2582">No address.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">NL: No address.</span> <span id="s2584">That was all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">NL: No further communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">SS: They were wonderful in those years!</span> <span id="s2588">They don't think like that anymore.</span> <span id="s2589">I wrote a letter to Manfred Hoffman, Chicago, USA, and they got the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">NL: They got the letter.</span> <span id="s2591">You must have been, you must have been so embittered by this total lack of care and concern about you?</span> <span id="s2592">Or did you feel already hardened by the world, and not expecting anything more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">SS: No, I had never expected anything; I was simply, literally heartbroken from the day that I was separated from my parents and had no expectations of anyone else.</span> <span id="s2594">They were good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">NL: And you obviously thought then they might still be alive, or you hoped...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">SS: As I learned more and as I got more of these "Dear Sonja" letters, so elated, so excited, “Our loved one came back.</span> <span id="s2597">P.S. I hope your parents will, too," You know, I don't know, how to say?</span> <span id="s2598">I was pleased.</span> <span id="s2599">Obviously, people who wrote, wrote about people that I knew, that I liked, cared about.</span> <span id="s2600">As I heard more and more about what, about the camps in Germany, increasingly, I, at times, tried to prepare myself and console myself with the thought that my mother, as I had described, had been ill, and that perhaps she had perished en route and hadn't suffered in the camps.</span> <span id="s2601">But until the day that I got on the boat crossing the ocean, coming to the United States, I must say, I maintained the fantasy that my father had survived.</span> <span id="s2602">Maybe, he was freed by Russians, fantasy like that.</span> <span id="s2603">But on that day, as the distance between the Old World and the New increased, I think that's when I had to come to grips with reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">NL: What was your life like with Paula in the suburban home outside of Paris?</span> <span id="s2605">Did you go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">SS: Yeah, I went to the school there, but the most important thing in my life then was that I had a friend, I had a--I am sorry, I dismissed something because I was so focused when you asked a question, did I have any close friends in the boarding school?</span> <span id="s2607">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s2608">I did have one, but she was a day student.</span> <span id="s2609">And she was a close friend, and her name was Fanny.</span> <span id="s2610">She was Jewish, she was a Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s2611">And I think that maybe the reason why did it slip me by, I think that Fanny was far more important to me than I was to her.</span> <span id="s2612">She had an extended family with many brothers and sisters and a father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">NL: Living in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">SS: Yeah, living in Chambéry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s2616">They were in hiding apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">SS: They commuted between Chambéry and Lyon, up and back, up and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">NL: And survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">SS: And survived.</span> <span id="s2620">I think, all of them, in fact.</span> <span id="s2621">The oldest brother was taken, was deported.</span> <span id="s2622">He survived.</span> <span id="s2623">He came back.</span> <span id="s2624">Another brother was very active, I think.</span> <span id="s2625">I'm not sure if he was in the Underground.</span> <span id="s2626">I certainly know he was very active as a Zionist and he started--he was one of the people who started Hashomer Hatzair after the war in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">NL: Do you remember his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">SS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2629">Szchulklaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">NL: Szchulklaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">SS: S-Z-C-H-U-L-K-L-A-P-E-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">NL: Your friend, was she identified as a Jewish girl at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2634">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">NL: She, too, had to pass as a non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">NL: And there was no suspicion about her identity, apparently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">SS: No, in fact, it was interesting, she had a close friend who was non-Jewish, and they looked very alike.</span> <span id="s2639">Fanny was sort of a, the face was sort of high bone structures sort of, probably, almost Asiatic origin.</span> <span id="s2640">You know, many Jews have this--I suspect that that must have been her origin way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">NL: Did you admit to each other that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">NL: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2645">And I spent a lot of time with her, but, then, as I said, her family commuted up and back between Chambéry and Lyon, so she was not in the boarding school, in the same school, I mean, but as a day student.</span> <span id="s2646">I could talk a lot about that, but let me focus on something else.</span> <span id="s2647">Her brother, through Fanny, they went back to Lyon, and when I came to the suburb of Paris, we continued to write and that's how I got involved in Hashomer Hatzair through her, through her brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">SS: And there were kids my age who survived, I would say that a goodly number went into black market, into all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s2650">"Hustling" is what we call it today.</span> <span id="s2651">And I saw clearly that there were two possible choices available.</span> <span id="s2652">One was to hustle, which is what Leon did, by the way.</span> <span id="s2653">That's how financially so many survived the war.</span> <span id="s2654">He trafficked in gold and all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s2655">And the other was to be a Zionist.</span> <span id="s2656">That seemed to be my style.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">NL: Pure and decent, more hopeful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">SS: Hopeful.</span> <span id="s2659">Constructive.</span> <span id="s2660">Building, rather than...</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">NL: Building rather than negotiating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">SS: Yeah, and so I became extremely active in Hashomer Hatzair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">NL: In the Paris movement, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">SS: Paris.</span> <span id="s2665">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">NL: You traveled to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">NL: To meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">SS: On weekends, yes.</span> <span id="s2670">From the suburbs to Paris the train was, I don't know, I can't remember, but maybe about 45 minutes, half an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">NL: Encampments, or just meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">SS: In summer, we had a summer camp, and in winter we had a winter camp.</span> <span id="s2673">And in between I went around the Jewish neighborhoods in Paris and recruited little Shomrim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">NL: That must have been a more positive time of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">SS: Well, the nightmare was when the time came, all my friends, Fanny and then the others, through Hashomer, were talking after 1945, 1947, made illegal aliyah [immigration to Palestine], and I was a traitor.</span> <span id="s2676">That was the hardest thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">NL: They had to leave by way of Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">SS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2679">I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">NL: You separated yourself from them at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s2682">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">NL: Were you pressured into going with them in anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">SS: No, I wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">NL: You wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">SS: You asked me what was there, what involvement, what emotional tie.</span> <span id="s2687">That was it.</span> <span id="s2688">I really wanted to.</span> <span id="s2689">That was the only thing that had meaning to me.</span> <span id="s2690">But there is a part in me that always has been the old German Vernünftigkeit.</span> <span id="s2691">Do you know what Vernünftigkeit is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">NL: Responsibility?</span> <span id="s2693">Duty?</span> <span id="s2694">Doing the appropriate thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">NL: The proper thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2698">It's interesting, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">NL: Even after all you have been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">SS: In, in German you say to a child "sei vernünftig," which means "be reasonable."</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">SS: Literally, I think.</span> <span id="s2703">But it's right what you said.</span> <span id="s2704">In French, you tell a child, "Sois sage".</span> <span id="s2705">Sage comes from...</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">NL: Wisdom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">SS: Sagesse.</span> <span id="s2708">Wisdom, and in English, it's "be good."</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">NL: Interesting.</span> <span id="s2710">You were the only one of the group that decided you just couldn't make that threshold of illegality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2712">No.</span> <span id="s2713">Nothing to do, God forbid.</span> <span id="s2714">I had been illegal all these years.</span> <span id="s2715">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">NL: I'm stumbling here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">SS: No.</span> <span id="s2718">Okay.</span> <span id="s2719">Going to a kibbutz, I understood its profound limitations.</span> <span id="s2720">Just remember, I had lived all those years on farms in villages; I knew farming inside out.</span> <span id="s2721">I also knew that what I really wanted to do was to get an education, become educated.</span> <span id="s2722">I knew that in France there was no way.</span> <span id="s2723">I had no papers.</span> <span id="s2724">I couldn't stay in France.</span> <span id="s2725">I was not a French citizen.</span> <span id="s2726">I was apatride.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">NL: Stateless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">SS: Stateless, and you know, you can live in France for 582 years and not obtain French citizenship.</span> <span id="s2729">But even if I had, with whom and where would I have stayed.</span> <span id="s2730">There was nothing for me in France.</span> <span id="s2731">There was no place, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s2732">And so I thought, as I said, that was probably, that was undoubtedly the hardest decision of my life, which was that my plan was to come to America because I knew, I had read, that in America I could go, I could work and go to school, and my plan was to get a degree and then go to Israel, and I'd be much more useful and valuable to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">NL: You were afraid, in other words, that going with the Hashomer Hatzair group you would become involved in building a kibbutz, working on the farm, and thus you would be deprived of schooling?</span> <span id="s2734">You didn't think you could get any schooling in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s2736">And at that time, it was realistic, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">NL: At that time it was, of course, still very primitive and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">SS: It was 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">NL: Were there any agents coming in from Palestine, from Jewish Palestine, to try to convince you to go, or was the movement itself in a momentum of leaving?</span> <span id="s2740">Did you have youth leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">SS: Oh, yes, shelichim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">NL: Shelichim did come.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2746">I didn't talk very much about these things to anybody.</span> <span id="s2747">I mean, this was my private, my own struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">NL: Your evaluation of things.</span> <span id="s2749">I see.</span> <span id="s2750">I thought once in Hashomer Hatzair you could begin to share lots of private things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">SS: I did share, I did share my doubts and my struggle with Fanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">NL: With Fanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">NL: Let's go back a bit because it would be interesting, I think, to hear what the movement meant to you while you were active between '45 and '47.</span> <span id="s2755">Did it divert you?</span> <span id="s2756">[clicking in background] So, Sonja, could you speak a little more about some of the activities of the Hashomer Hatzair group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">SS: Did I say that on tape about the fact that after the war, yes, I think I did, many people went, youth went into hustling and there was nothing for me in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">NL: Right, but once you found Hashomer Hatzair, after you were in it for two years, very impressionable and important years, what did those experiences give to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">SS: Give me a sense that there is life beyond destruction, that there is something that can be built, that there is something to look forward to, that there are ideals that are bigger than the individual.</span> <span id="s2760">I became an atheist, I think, after I got out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2761">If you recall, I had said, I think, had mentioned earlier that my father was a very Orthodox man and felt that he didn't want to hide because he

from the well, and then shlepping back up, and I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s3075">I must have said something funny and Lucie started laughing, and she tripped and she fell with the bucket with all the linens that had just been washed, and we were almost uphill, and we had to collect all the stuff, go back down and redo it.</span> <span id="s3076">Anyway, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">NL: So, you were helping to keep house for Leon then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3079">I am going back to Frazie now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">NL: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">SS: But I want to go back to Frazie because of the goyim.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">NL: Oh, excuse me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s3084">One of the things that, no matter how things were and how horrible and how awful and so on, I could tolerate almost everything.</span> <span id="s3085">One thing that I really could not stomach, literally, was the fact that in those days, again, there were no disposables, but what did women do for menstrual hygiene?</span> <span id="s3086">You had a rag, which was used, and then when the rag was dirty, it was soaked in a bucket of water.</span> <span id="s3087">And the same tepel [pot] that was used for cooking is where the menstrual rag would soak.</span> <span id="s3088">I mean, you would rinse it out a bit, and you know, coming from a kosher household, that was rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">NL: Oh, my!</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">SS: The other thing that was rough was when it was cold in winter, how did you bathe?</span> <span id="s3091">Well, there was, you know, Americans who collect these porcelain, what do you call these things?</span> <span id="s3092">For washing bowls?</span> <span id="s3093">[speaking in background]</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">NL: Sink.</span> <span id="s3095">Tubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">SS: No, no they are portable.</span> <span id="s3097">Porcelain bowls that are portable, that you pour water in.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">NL: I don't know what the technical name is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">SS: You see them in antique stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">NL: Right, basins.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">SS: Basins, yes.</span> <span id="s3102">Right.</span> <span id="s3103">Okay.</span> <span id="s3104">So water would be heated on the stove which was, of course, a wood-burning stove, and I see nothing romantic about wood-burning stove, it's a pain; it's a shlep; it's a misery.</span> <span id="s3105">So the warm water would be poured in the basin and Frazie got first turn and she would wash, and then Lucie, her daughter, would wash from head to foot in the same water, the same basin and, of course, since I was the low man on the totem pole.</span> <span id="s3106">I would be third [laughter].</span> <span id="s3107">Remember, I was born and raised in bathtubs with running hot and cold water.</span> <span id="s3108">Those things were difficult, very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">NL: Aside from the hunger that you felt most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">NL: Never having enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s3113">But that, you know, the French are unbelievably dirty and filthy, even when they have running water.</span> <span id="s3114">They are pigs.</span> <span id="s3115">[laughter] They invented nail polish to hide their dirty fingernails.</span> <span id="s3116">They invented perfume to cover the stench.</span> <span id="s3117">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">NL: That's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3119">What you had to endure.</span> <span id="s3120">And, so, to come back to Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">SS: To Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">NL: You were taking care of Leon when she went on these expeditions to Belgium?</span> <span id="s3123">You were keeping house for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">SS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">NL: Washing for him, cooking for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">SS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">NL: So, they were indeed not maintaining you.</span> <span id="s3128">You were taking care of them in a large sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">SS: Did I ever tell you how I learned about--or did I mention that on tape, I don't know, about the British landing?</span> <span id="s3130">I'm sorry, the association is menstruation.</span> <span id="s3131">During the war, God knows why, you know, expressions come about, and when in America women will use expressions like "the curse," "having the curse," the expression during the war for some dumb reason was "Les Anglais ont debarqués."</span> <span id="s3132">The British landed [laughter], I never forget the day I bumped into Leon in the village, and he said, "Sonnie, Sonnie les Anglais ont debarqués!"</span> <span id="s3133">[much laughter].</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">NL: That was hysterical.</span> <span id="s3135">Oh, my!</span> <span id="s3136">Yes, you want to say a few words about the Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3138">It wasn't until, once I made contact with the relatives in America that they sent and arranged for the paperwork for me to come.</span> <span id="s3139">I don't know if I mentioned before, but I came on a special shindig for war orphans, on a special thing.</span> <span id="s3140">That's how I was able to come in April '47, among the earliest post-war, I think.</span> <span id="s3141">Then the Jewish agencies, I imagine, maybe my relatives in America must have contacted them or something, then they became very interested in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">NL: Was this HIAS, do you know?</span> <span id="s3143">Well, it's not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">SS: I could look it up and see what I remember going to the office, the main office in Paris.</span> <span id="s3145">I remember that they were giving to--as I mentioned to you earlier today, 1947 we were still starving in France.</span> <span id="s3146">There was no food, none.</span> <span id="s3147">And they were also having rations and food that they received from America, and one day I said, "How come...?"</span> <span id="s3148">Paula said, "Ask 'em, ask 'em for condensed milk," and stuff like that, and so foolishly I asked, and the woman looked at me and said, "You, you're too fat.</span> <span id="s3149">You don't need that."</span> <span id="s3150">If you look at the photos of myself, I was exceedingly overweight, but that was from eating garbage, absolute junk.</span> <span id="s3151">And so they felt I, food on me was wasted.</span> <span id="s3152">That was one response.</span> <span id="s3153">The other response was that the only thing that they really did for me, but, again, that was through the relatives in America, was to arrange for me from Paris.</span> <span id="s3154">I took a train to Göteborg in Sweden to come to the United States, so I was under their auspices with a group of other Jews, immigrants, for that train ride.</span> <span id="s3155">But then they wanted to give me socks and all kinds of things a week before I went to America.</span> <span id="s3156">[laughter] So, by America I could tell them how good they were to me, and I refused it.</span> <span id="s3157">I came with one duffel bag, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">NL: This was the experience of most of the other children, too, you gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">SS: To the best of my knowledge, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">NL: Non-existent help?</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">SS: None.</span> <span id="s3162">In fact, part of it was--I don't know, I got very bitter.</span> <span id="s3163">You could see the director of the place and various people who worked there in an out of huge limousines, chauffeur-driven, etc., and it was that dealing with them was excruciatingly humiliating.</span> <span id="s3164">It was a putdown.</span> <span id="s3165">What they were doing was so transparent.</span> <span id="s3166">Hell, I had survived.</span> <span id="s3167">You know, I had survived the French Underground and so on.</span> <span id="s3168">I could see what these people were doing.</span> <span id="s3169">The last week indoctrinating me about what to tell in America about the wonders they had done...</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">NL: So, they should seem to be making a good impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">SS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">NL: You went on the "Gripsholm", I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">NL: From Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">NL: Did you know anybody at all on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">NL: Not a soul.</span> <span id="s3179">It must have been a shattering trip for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">SS: It was an interesting trip.</span> <span id="s3181">In Göteborg a crew of merchant marines from Sweden boarded the boat to rejoin their merchant marine boat in New York.</span> <span id="s3182">So that was one set of passengers, aside from the handful of Jews.</span> <span id="s3183">The other set of passengers were American war brides.</span> <span id="s3184">And the two met on top of each other.</span> <span id="s3185">It was a floating whorehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">NL: And you were witness to all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">SS: Oh, God [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">NL: Did it upset you very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">SS: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">NL: This was the first image you had of the New World, of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">SS: Of what was going to America.</span> <span id="s3192">And yes, here were all these war brides, you know, women from all over that American soldiers were going to marry.</span> <span id="s3193">They were rejoining their husbands, new husbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">NL: And committing adultery in the process?</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">SS: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3196">I mean, it was grotesque.</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">NL: Were there any other young people your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">SS: There were some.</span> <span id="s3199">There was one girl in particular, as I look on that photo.</span> <span id="s3200">It was, I think, I remember two girls in particular.</span> <span id="s3201">It was really appalling because they were standing in line outside of the women's cabins.</span> <span id="s3202">I don't know if that what you call them, down below the deck, with the smell of coal.</span> <span id="s3203">I loathe boats.</span> <span id="s3204">And they were standing in line, and you could see them staggering out red in the face, huffing and puffing, and it was awful.</span> <span id="s3205">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">NL: You landed in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">SS: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s3208">See now.</span> <span id="s3209">There it was useful to feel part of Hashomer, part of Zionism, part of a purity, part of a, you know, a sense, "That's decadent, that's goyim, that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">NL: You mean, this delineation between the Jewish world and the non-Jewish world?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s3212">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">NL: That's interesting.</span> <span id="s3214">And you were presumably going to meet with your relatives and live with them?</span> <span id="s3215">Was that your understanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">SS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">NL: Sonja?</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">SS: Um'm--whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">NL: In New York and Milwaukee?</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">SS: No, in New York I was met by a cousin of Paula's.</span> <span id="s3221">She was a Kubovitzky daughter, Simone was her name, and her husband, Charles.</span> <span id="s3222">So Simone was from Belgium, but she and Charles had lived in New York since before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">SS: They were lovely people.</span> <span id="s3225">I liked them a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">NL: They met you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">SS: Simone met me at the boat.</span> <span id="s3228">And you know, I wasn't the only one.</span> <span id="s3229">That was true of everybody almost, standing up high on the boat and there all these people on the pier.</span> <span id="s3230">I remember, by the way, I described the distance between the Old World and the New, and as the distance increased, that's when, that was my coming to grips with the reality of the death of my parents.</span> <span id="s3231">Seeing the Statue of Liberty, it was quite something.</span> <span id="s3232">It was real, you could see it.</span> <span id="s3233">And I'm not sure what it meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">NL: Did you have a feeling of resurgence of hope?</span> <span id="s3235">Of the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3237">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">NL: That you were glad you had come?</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">SS: I wasn't sure about that.</span> <span id="s3240">It was exciting.</span> <span id="s3241">It was troubling.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">NL: Any sense of adventuresomeness perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">SS: I think I was scared.</span> <span id="s3244">I was scared.</span> <span id="s3245">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">NL: Going into the unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">SS: Another language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">NL: Another language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">NL: You hadn't learned any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">SS: No.</span> <span id="s3251">I knew "yes" and "no."</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">NL: Oh, without a language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">SS: And "please."</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">NL: So did the Kubovitzkys then take you to their home?</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">SS: No.</span> <span id="s3256">This was Simone, the daughter.</span> <span id="s3257">Her last name was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">NL: They greeted you and then, where did...</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">SS: Simone met me at the boat, and I don't know, you know, by shouting up and back names, that's how we identified.</span> <span id="s3260">It took some six hours to disembark and it wasn't Ellis Island, but for all practical purposes, it might have been.</span> <span id="s3261">You know, I have seen photos of Ellis Island and these big hangars on the pier in New York.</span> <span id="s3262">And the processing was slow.</span> <span id="s3263">It took a whole day.</span> <span id="s3264">And, of course, as usual, first class first, etc.</span> <span id="s3265">I stayed with Simone and Charles and they had a little girl, Jackie.</span> <span id="s3266">She was about four years old, she was a lovely child.</span> <span id="s3267">She understood, she spoke French, they taught her French.</span> <span id="s3268">So she taught me English in the two days and two nights that I spent there.</span> <span id="s3269">And they wanted very much to keep me for a week.</span> <span id="s3270">But it happened to fall shortly before Pesach, and there were the long distance phone calls to the relatives.</span> <span id="s3271">I absolutely had to be there for Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">NL: Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">SS: Chicago, Milwaukee, the world.</span> <span id="s3274">And they really wanted to keep me and I liked these people and I felt comfortable and I wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s3275">But, we talked and Vernünftigkeit [good sense, rationality] had the best of all of us.</span> <span id="s3276">"You better go," and I went.</span> <span id="s3277">Do you want to hear about the ride from New York to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">NL: If you aren't too tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">SS: I get on the train--there were no plane rides in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">NL: Again, all alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">SS: Yeah, well that I had got used to.</span> <span id="s3282">But after hours and hours on the train, I remember when people said, "We're coming close to Chicago.</span> <span id="s3283">We're coming close to Chicago," and everybody is excited and I look out the window and I broke up and I wept.</span> <span id="s3284">I think, that's the first time ever that I cried publicly.</span> <span id="s3285">I looked around--I expected, you know, I came from Paris, cosmopolitan city, I came from New York.</span> <span id="s3286">Well, like all American cities, the outskirts are awful.</span> <span id="s3287">I'd never seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s3288">And I imagined that that's Chicago [laughter].</span> <span id="s3289">So, then, the relatives picked me up and there were two or three sets of cousins, distant cousins, and we went to Manfred's apartment.</span> <span id="s3290">Manfred was a physician, M.D., Dr. Hoffman.</span> <span id="s3291">Now I'm saying it like the French.</span> <span id="s3292">You are supposed to say it like the German.</span> <span id="s3293">And Manfred had his practice in his apartment, which was above some store or other on Devon Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">NL: I don't know what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">SS: She knows what is north?</span> <span id="s3296">[questioning Barbara Lerner] Devon Avenue is a busy street, commercial street, and their living room was the reception room for the patients, and the three of them, Manfred and his wife and their darling Howard, all shared one bedroom, and I slept in the examination room on one of those.</span> <span id="s3297">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">NL: Was he still a struggling doctor, or were they just very poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">SS: A stingy doctor.</span> <span id="s3300">He still, in 1947, had bags of sugar hidden under his bed [laughter].</span> <span id="s3301">And coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">NL: Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">SS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Tape 5, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">NL: This is Tape 5, Side 2 continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">SS: So, he really meant it, which is absolutely awesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">NL: Meant it when?</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">SS: When they asked me where did I choose to live, "by Milwaukee or by the doctor in Chicago."</span> <span id="s3309">[laughter] I was clear.</span> <span id="s3310">They lived like sardines.</span> <span id="s3311">Of course, I would have preferred living in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3312">How can you choose to be four people in that little bedroom?</span> <span id="s3313">Anyway, I then also learned what the hurry was about my coming for Pesach.</span> <span id="s3314">Harry in Milwaukee, his brother Manfred in Chicago, had founded their own shul, their own synagogue, like they did "by Aurich" in Germany, you know, German, Aurich-type services.</span> <span id="s3315">And the big shindig, of course, was for Dr. Hoffman to tell the congregation about what a wonderful man he was and how he had imported me and make a big production out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">NL: So you had to be produced.</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">SS: In fact, four sets of relatives, Milwaukee, Chicago, in Chicago there was another cousin and her husband, and in Baton Rouge there was the fourth set, had split the fare to bring me over.</span> <span id="s3318">The doctor was well-to-do, yes, he was.</span> <span id="s3319">The cousin in Milwaukee, by now--they all started from scratch, true enough, or whatever they could bring over.</span> <span id="s3320">The cousin in Milwaukee had a shoe polish factory.</span> <span id="s3321">Doing quite well, thank you.</span> <span id="s3322">They all did quite well, thank you.</span> <span id="s3323">And they all started and made me feel indebted.</span> <span id="s3324">I often had the fantasy of giving them each a fourth, a fourth, a fourth of the ticket.</span> <span id="s3325">[laughter] So, our beginning was not too good.</span> <span id="s3326">[Tape is turned off and on.]</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">SS: ...have trouble seeing at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">NL: Not really, but I want to get going before it gets dark.</span> <span id="s3329">So, Sonja, now would you be good enough to tell us a little about your adjustment to schools?</span> <span id="s3330">Which part of the family did you decide to live with?</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">SS: Well, I decided, because it wasn't a decision.</span> <span id="s3332">I mean, the situation was so idiotic, that I had to choose Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s3333">And you wanted to know about my education.</span> <span id="s3334">Okay.</span> <span id="s3335">As I indicated, when I came I did not know any English whatsoever.</span> <span id="s3336">Moreover, I didn't know any German any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">NL: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">SS: Well, I hadn't spoken it in many, many years, number one.</span> <span id="s3339">And number two, for me to know German during the war was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s3340">In fact, there were a couple of encounters that I had in the Underground when I was carrying messages.</span> <span id="s3341">In one instance on a bridge a German stopped me and looked at me and wanted to investigate my bike.</span> <span id="s3342">I was carrying a message, and they were debating in German what to do with me, and so I had to pretend like I didn't understand it, and if they had looked at me, you know, I was passing as a dumb peasant girl, and that was one of the more frightening experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">NL: So you had to repress all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">SS: Right, and I had to look, you know, like a dumb...</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">NL: Peasant girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">SS: Right, and yet I understood every word and they were really seriously debating and considering what to do.</span> <span id="s3347">So it was very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">BL: Whether to kill you or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3350">But besides that and all the things, anyway, besides that, the issue was, you know, there was no opportunity to speak German.</span> <span id="s3351">I was five when I had left Germany, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">NL: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">SS: And now I'm 16.</span> <span id="s3354">So, I arrived in Milwaukee in a 180% pure German-speaking household.</span> <span id="s3355">There was Harry and his wife.</span> <span id="s3356">There was the old lady and the old man, her parents, good Onkel Solly and Tante Meta and es war alles Deutsch [it was all German], and the child that they had produced between all of them.</span> <span id="s3357">[laughter] She spoke better German than English, to give you an idea.</span> <span id="s3358">She was born in Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">NL: But spoke better German than English?</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">SS: Yes, so began a new war.</span> <span id="s3361">I thought of it as a war after the war.</span> <span id="s3362">If anything really killed my sense of humor, my optimism, my drive, it was Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s3363">I simply was not prepared to undertake a new war, and that's what it was.</span> <span id="s3364">They disapproved of everything about me.</span> <span id="s3365">First of all, there was the French accent.</span> <span id="s3366">I learned English of course, French was my language.</span> <span id="s3367">I was never literate in German.</span> <span id="s3368">So, forever, when I spoke English, they would correct my accent with a German accent.</span> <span id="s3369">That's why I have a bastard accent, by the way.</span> <span id="s3370">I had to learn German all over again, because that was what was spoken at home, and every time I opened my mouth in English, it was being corrected by a German accent.</span> <span id="s3371">And they had come to America as adults, you know, in 1938, '39, '38.</span> <span id="s3372">So, this is 1947, and they were not very linguistically inclined, so you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">NL: What about your schooling?</span> <span id="s3374">Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">SS: That's where I'm going.</span> <span id="s3376">So one of the things was, my idea was one thing: to go to school; their idea was to have a maid.</span> <span id="s3377">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">NL: To make you the maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">SS: Right, and so first thing, they sent to me a place for new Americans, which was an evening course with adults, where they taught English, and I didn't want any part of that.</span> <span id="s3380">None.</span> <span id="s3381">They were all sitting there with their dictionaries, translating in and out.</span> <span id="s3382">You know, all this nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">NL: What disturbed you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">SS: That's not how you learn a language.</span> <span id="s3385">I mean, I had learned, you know, different languages before and I knew that that was not the way.</span> <span id="s3386">When you are in a country you speak the language with people, not with foreigners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">NL: This was translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">SS: Yes, that's when--one of the things I did was, I went to the library and I got books, I knew the plot and in French like Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, one of my favorite books, and since I know the plot I got the book in English.</span> <span id="s3389">And I read it and I kept getting books where I knew the plot, so that wouldn't stop me, and I just kept reading in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">NL: And you used a dictionary?</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">SS: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">NL: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">SS: No.</span> <span id="s3394">Just read.</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">NL: Just read?</span> <span id="s3396">And not understanding many of the words, but understanding the sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">SS: I knew the plot.</span> <span id="s3398">I had read Dostoevsky in French.</span> <span id="s3399">I knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">NL: Also, of course, there is a great similarity between French and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">SS: Right, anyway, so then came summer school.</span> <span id="s3402">And I asked...</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">NL: But meanwhile, you had to do a lot of housework in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">SS: Sure.</span> <span id="s3405">Yeah.</span> <span id="s3406">Summer school.</span> <span id="s3407">I found out there is summer school, and I told my cousins I wanted to go to summer school.</span> <span id="s3408">Would they be kind enough to accompany me and act as an interpreter for the principal?</span> <span id="s3409">So we went to the school.</span> <span id="s3410">The high school there was Riverside High in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s3411">The principal was a man by the name of Mr. Schnecker.</span> <span id="s3412">Milwaukee is a German town, you know.</span> <span id="s3413">It was in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">SS: And so, he asked me through my cousin what courses did I want to take.</span> <span id="s3416">And I said, two courses in Physics, no, one course in Physics and one in Chemistry and one in English.</span> <span id="s3417">And they argued, you know, they talked between the two of them, and I could understand some of it, but it was preposterous.</span> <span id="s3418">You know, now I had to start with the first English.</span> <span id="s3419">I'll take any English that you want.</span> <span id="s3420">My idea...</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">NL: Yes, I was going to ask why you chose Physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">SS: Because in Physics and Chemistry the key words are the same in English as in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">NL: Aha!</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">SS: Right?</span> <span id="s3425">And my idea was to be among English-speaking and to, as quickly as I could, accumulate credits so I could graduate and get a high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">NL: Were you able to get any sort of transcript from France?</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">SS: Didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">NL: Or, how would you become eligible for college?</span> <span id="s3429">I mean, you didn't have any school records.</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">SS: Well, I finagled.</span> <span id="s3431">I got an A in Physics and in Chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">NL: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">SS: I got a 90 out of a 100 in English.</span> <span id="s3434">So, I went back to Mr. Schnecker at the end of summer school when I now could speak a little.</span> <span id="s3435">The other thing is I immediately took a job.</span> <span id="s3436">I worked, I forget what my first job was.</span> <span id="s3437">I think, I worked in a bakery or a grocery, some place.</span> <span id="s3438">Number one, I wanted money.</span> <span id="s3439">Do you know that at the end of a year-and-one-half when I left Milwaukee for Chicago, I had saved $500.</span> <span id="s3440">To give you an idea in those days, babysitting costs, you earned 25 cents for the whole night.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">NL: For the whole night?</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">SS: Yes [laughter].</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">NL: You must have worked many, many hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">SS: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s3445">But anyway, when regular school started in fall, I went to see this nice principal and I said--and I took more advanced courses.</span> <span id="s3446">The way in which I did it, literally in a year-and-a-half, was, I kept arguing with him, "How could you pass Physics if you didn't...?"</span> <span id="s3447">and I took a course in Trigonometry.</span> <span id="s3448">How could you pass Trigonometry, which I did with an A, without Algebra or Geometry, right?</span> <span id="s3449">He said, "You can't."</span> <span id="s3450">I said, "Then you can give me credit for that, can't you?"</span> <span id="s3451">and he said, "I guess I'll have to."</span> <span id="s3452">[laugher]</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s3454">Had you studied some of these other subjects at that terrible school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">SS: Well, look, I did.</span> <span id="s3456">I made a thing--during--I was born in 1931, arrived in Milwaukee 1947.</span> <span id="s3457">During the--okay, during those years, I was in four different countries, 18 different places, 12 different regions, and 9 different schools, when I was in school.</span> <span id="s3458">Most of the time I was not in school.</span> <span id="s3459">I could read.</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">NL: But Trigonometry is a fairly complex mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">SS: But you've got to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">NL: Okay.</span> <span id="s3463">I just think your mastering of English must have been phenomenal?</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">SS: No, I..</span> <span id="s3465">.</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">NL: Of course, it was!</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">SS: I--I..</span> <span id="s3468">.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">NL: Well, you see mastery of English and a diploma and so on as a way of liberating yourself from this family, too, and becoming an autonomous person.</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">SS: Remember, my goal was to go and get an education and graduate from a university.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">NL: So, you were highly motivated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">SS: And I found out that people in America graduate school when they are 18.</span> <span id="s3473">When I was 18, I was going to graduate.</span> <span id="s3474">And I did the same with college.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">NL: Was there any person in your life during those years who gave you any sense of reinforcement or help?</span> <span id="s3476">Or sustenance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">SS: I had one friend in Milwaukee, George.</span> <span id="s3478">George was exactly my age, and George had survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3479">Except George was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s3480">His English was awful.</span> <span id="s3481">[laughter] I don't believe that Hungarians are capable of learning any language in the world.</span> <span id="s3482">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">NL: He was struggling with English?</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">NL: So you were able to talk to each other about the war...?</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">SS: Not really.</span> <span id="s3487">George talked very little about the war.</span> <span id="s3488">George was busy finagling.</span> <span id="s3489">George was going to make headway, and George was a very hedonistic man, and I always kidded him and I said to him, "George, you will either marry a blonde who looks like a movie star, or you'll marry a woman who's very rich."</span> <span id="s3490">I saw him many years later in Chicago and George indeed had gone through medical school and he had wanted--he always talked about wanting to be an obstetrician.</span> <span id="s3491">He liked the idea of giving birth after Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3492">Instead, he became a psychiatrist and he kidded me.</span> <span id="s3493">He said, "Sonja, I didn't marry money.</span> <span id="s3494">I married a blonde."</span> <span id="s3495">[laughter] And he became a psychiatrist who couldn't speak English.</span> <span id="s3496">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">NL: Well, it gave him a certain European quality which, I guess, has its advantages.</span> <span id="s3498">So you prevailed on this principle to give you the necessary credits.</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">SS: He was a swell man.</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">NL: He was a sensible man.</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s3502">He realized that I was stubborn.</span> <span id="s3503">He always--he also appreciated...</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3505">SS: ...that I delivered what I promised.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">NL: Did you get any help, any special encouragement from any teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">SS: Yes, there were two; one was a dumb teacher, Miss Dunway, who really was very nice, very sweet.</span> <span id="s3508">She taught French.</span> <span id="s3509">And she was very stupid.</span> <span id="s3510">I conned her into giving me credits for French.</span> <span id="s3511">And as a trade-off, I translated stuff for her and whatever.</span> <span id="s3512">There was another teacher whom I really liked.</span> <span id="s3513">Her name was Miss Zeman.</span> <span id="s3514">And she had an advanced course, her creative English course, and I got into that, and there were very few students in that course.</span> <span id="s3515">And she was nice.</span> <span id="s3516">I remember she invited a few of the other kids and myself, you know, special group, Christmas Day at her house, and she had a car and sometimes she took me for rides.</span> <span id="s3517">Yes, she was very good, very supportive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">NL: And so you got your diploma?</span> <span id="s3519">And then decided to go to Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3521">Then I went to the Jewish Vocational Service in Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s3522">And they had a psychologist.</span> <span id="s3523">I remember her name, Snitson [or Slipson?]</span> <span id="s3524">, she was nice.</span> <span id="s3525">She gave me a complete battery of tests.</span> <span id="s3526">That's where I had my first exposure to the Rorschach.</span> <span id="s3527">She gave me a Rorschach.</span> <span id="s3528">And it's funny, after 20 some years of administering the Rorschach, that's what's so marvelous about that instrument, I can still--and, you know, having tested hundreds and hundreds of people--I can remember with great vividness some of my responses.</span> <span id="s3529">It's a wonderful test.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">NL: Extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">SS: Anyway, on the basis of that, they decided that I was highly motivated, I had a lot of good drive and so on, and that's the first time that anybody ever really helped me.</span> <span id="s3532">They awarded me a scholarship, tuition scholarship to any university of my choice.</span> <span id="s3533">I guess, I must have done pretty good on their tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">NL: You must have been exceptionally well.</span></p> <p><span id="s3535">SS: They gave me a whole battery.</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">NL: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">SS: So my choice was the University of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3538">NL: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">SS: And I went to the University of Chicago, and I applied and they interviewed me and everything, and they accepted me.</span> <span id="s3540">However, they said, under no circumstances, no way at all, would I be able to work and go to school, to the college.</span> <span id="s3541">That it was much too demanding, and they wouldn't hear of it.</span> <span id="s3542">So that was the end of that dream.</span> <span id="s3543">I couldn't go to the University of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">NL: They couldn't give you any help, any subsidy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">SS: That was before affirmative action and, and packages.</span> <span id="s3546">[laughter].</span> <span id="s3547">You earned what you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">NL: Oh my God...</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">SS: So, that's how come I choose Roosevelt University in Chicago, which had a very good program.</span> <span id="s3550">It was an interesting school.</span> <span id="s3551">It was founded in 1946.</span> <span id="s3552">It was the first university in the country that had, that eliminated all admission quotas.</span> <span id="s3553">It was the first university in the country that admitted people on the basis other than quotas.</span> <span id="s3554">It attracted professors from all over the country, because of that, and many of the professors...</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">NL: You mean, quotas or formal credits?</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">SS: No, no quotas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">NL: Quotas...</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">SS: Remember, in those days they had Jewish quotas...</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">NL: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">SS: ...black quotas, green quotas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">NL: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">SS: Yes, yes, Roosevelt was founded on this concept.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">NL: A liberal arts school?</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3565">Many of the professors were working on their Ph.D.'s at the University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s3566">Many came from all over the country to teach there out of ideology.</span> <span id="s3567">And most of the students were the GI's.</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">NL: Ah yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">SS: So it was an extremely exciting, good place.</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">NL: And they let you work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">SS: Of course, it was a semester system and, yeah, it was a great school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">NL: So you got your BA there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">SS: Got my BA there by working.</span> <span id="s3574">I worked at several factories.</span> <span id="s3575">I got fired from a few.</span> <span id="s3576">I got fired from several.</span> <span id="s3577">I worked for Eastman Kodak and I got fired because it was piecework and I exceeded--you know, they had a system of every week they posted how many pieces did everybody do, and I did more than the others [laughter] and the best of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">NL: You were a rate buster.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">SS: I was a rate buster!</span> <span id="s3580">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s3581">I learned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">NL: You couldn't slow down?</span></p> <p><span id="s3583">SS: I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s3584">You know, I mean, the idea was to do as fast as you can and get more money.</span></p> <p><span id="s3585">NL: So management fired you or the union got you fired?</span></p> <p><span id="s3586">SS: God no, there was no union.</span></p> <p><span id="s3587">NL: Oh, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">SS: So, I went from one factory to another.</span> <span id="s3589">The last, you know, one was Republic Steel.</span> <span id="s3590">I was making steel drills, that is, the tip of the drill on an enormous grinding wheel, you know, where you measure the tip with a micro somebody.</span> <span id="s3591">And there I got very angry because I understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s3592">The men working right next to me, the same huge grinding wheel, and it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s3593">One guy slashed his leg and almost cut it off.</span> <span id="s3594">I mean, it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s3595">The men were making 75 cents an hour and I was making 50 cents an hour to do the identical same thing.</span> <span id="s3596">Roosevelt University, then Roosevelt College, had started a Labor Education program.</span> <span id="s3597">And their director, the first, one of the first early programs in the country, 1949, 1950.</span> <span id="s3598">So one day, coming home from the factory in summer, in blue jeans full of dust and grease and all the rest of it, which wasn't done in those days--Roosevelt was located in downtown Chicago and women only wore skirts and blouses--in my shlumpy dirty jeans, I went up there and asked to speak to Frank McCallister who was the director of that program.</span> <span id="s3599">And I told him that I wanted to work with him in unionizing that place.</span> <span id="s3600">[laughter] So, he listened to me and about, oh, I don't know, a few months later, he called me and he said, "I've got good news for you and bad news.</span> <span id="s3601">The bad news is, I don't think it will work to unionize that place.</span> <span id="s3602">The good news, I need an interpreter."</span> <span id="s3603">He had just gotten the business under the Marshall Plan.</span> <span id="s3604">Trade union leaders from Europe were coming to the United States to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">NL: So you had to interpret for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">SS: He hired me as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s3607">Now I was making beaucoup money.</span> <span id="s3608">Wow, you know, and I got to travel around the country and it got to be a joke between us, because he would call me and say, "Well, there's a group of three or four, you know, and it's going to be on these dates.</span> <span id="s3609">Can you make it or not?"</span> <span id="s3610">He knew not to ask me.</span> <span id="s3611">Of course, I would go any time.</span> <span id="s3612">And I'd study around it and so on.</span> <span id="s3613">Through that I met some rather marvelous people.</span> <span id="s3614">I met one man, Beaubien [she pronounces it "Beaubain."]</span> <span id="s3615">, who had a position in France comparable to the one that occupied by Walter Reuther, who at the time was the head of the automobile workers, and so Beaubien and I became very good friends because most of the idiots in interpretation and translation would always say, "Qu'est-ce qu'il dit, Madame, qu'est-ce qu'il dit, Madame?"</span> <span id="s3616">"What's he saying?</span> <span id="s3617">What's he saying?"</span> <span id="s3618">always afraid of missing a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">NL: You let the conversation flow?</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">SS: Whereas with Beaubien, you know, he would let me ask the questions for him.</span> <span id="s3621">He knew I would hit what he wanted to know.</span> <span id="s3622">We worked out a very nice little thing there.</span> <span id="s3623">So I went with him and met Walter Reuther.</span> <span id="s3624">He was a friend of Victor Reuther, who was in Paris, and I met the Detroit crowd and so on.</span> <span id="s3625">So those were good years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">NL: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s3627">Those were the halcyon years of American trade union activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">SS: Well, they were good years for me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">NL: They were good years for you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3630">SS: I was making a lot of money.</span> <span id="s3631">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">NL: Well, thank you for that.</span> <span id="s3633">Now, could we swing back, because I don't want to forget your interest in speaking about Grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">SS: Before we go to my grandmother, I just would like to add with a note of sadness, I had over the years several times written a letter to the people at the Jewish Vocational in Milwaukee, and I never mailed it, the letter.</span> <span id="s3635">But it was saying to them in the letter was, "Dear People, I think it's rather sad that you have never followed up on what I did with the scholarship..."</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">NL: They never did...?</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">SS: "...that you so generously awarded me."</span></p> <p><span id="s3638">NL: Ah, why don't you write that letter, and mail it?</span> <span id="s3639">Wow!</span> <span id="s3640">Mail it.</span> <span

<span id="s3645">Dr. Sheldon, the psychologist, was a lady then in her late 50's, 60's and all the people, I mean, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s3646">NL: Did they continue awarding scholarships, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3647">SS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s3648">Whether I was the only one or whether there were millions.</span> <span id="s3649">[laughter] Until the day I got my BA, I sent them, you know, the tuition thing, or the University did, and they paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">NL: But no follow through?</span></p> <p><span id="s3651">SS: Never.</span> <span id="s3652">I mean it's crazy.</span> <span id="s3653">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">NL: It's really ghostly.</span> <span id="s3655">Very strange.</span> <span id="s3656">[pause] Do you want to step back to the story now about Grandmother, or can you think of other points in your experiences that you would like to comment on?</span></p> <p><span id="s3657">SS: Okay.</span> <span id="s3658">Before we go on, I want to reflect on the fact that that is really how I learned English.</span> <span id="s3659">I learned English by mingling with Americans.</span> <span id="s3660">I learned English by thinking English.</span> <span id="s3661">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s3662">I can think of words when I learned them.</span> <span id="s3663">I remember the first time that I heard the word "kids".</span> <span id="s3664">And I had no idea what it meant.</span> <span id="s3665">And then somebody thought of telling me "children."</span> <span id="s3666">I knew "children" and not "kid" and so on.</span> <span id="s3667">I never translated ever.</span> <span id="s3668">The idea was to think in the language.</span> <span id="s3669">And what I would do if I didn't know a word in writing or reading that was important, I looked it up in an English-English dictionary, looked up the word till I found the word, saw if there was a word that I understood.</span> <span id="s3670">If I didn't, I would take that word and look it up and kept going.</span> <span id="s3671">Sometimes it meant looking up five or six words until I found one that I really understood, and then go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">NL: So you never used a French-English dictionary?</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">SS: I bought my first French-English dictionary after I graduated, after I got my BA.</span> <span id="s3674">That was my reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s3675">NL: Interesting.</span> <span id="s3676">Did you listen to the radio, too?</span> <span id="s3677">Did you learn some English that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3678">SS: No, I only listened to classical music.</span></p> <p><span id="s3679">NL: Music.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">SS: They didn't have TV in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3681">NL: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">SS: I guess TV would have helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">NL: I know some Russian newcomers, Russian Jewish newcomers, learn English through television.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">SS: I would imagine so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">NL: It's a good device.</span> <span id="s3686">Now, Sonja, we can go back now a bit.</span> <span id="s3687">Which grandmother is it you want to speak of?</span> <span id="s3688">Is it mother's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">SS: Yeah, my father's mother died before I was born.</span> <span id="s3690">I was named after her.</span> <span id="s3691">I think that the story about my grandmother is too lengthy, the hour is late.</span> <span id="s3692">It's involved.</span> <span id="s3693">I would prefer to meet you again, or I'll make a tape and I'll mail it to you, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s3694">NL: All right, Sonja.</span> <span id="s3695">Now before we end, are there any thoughts you have about leaving some word for young people who will be studying this history, the history of the Holocaust, in future years?</span> <span id="s3696">Any warnings or ideas that you would like to share with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3697">SS: That's a lot in two minutes!</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">NL: No, not two minutes.</span> <span id="s3699">You can take a while or do you want to think about that and also...</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">SS: I can start off the top of my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">NL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">SS: That's a difficult question...</span></p> <p><span id="s3703">(The interview ended here.</span> <span id="s3704">It was hoped that Dr. Samson would mail another tape, but she became ill.</span> <span id="s3705">After numerous false starts, it was diagnosed as lung cancer of a fast ravaging kind.</span> <span id="s3706">She underwent heroic therapies at Sloan-Kettering, but succumbed August 16, 1986.</span> <span id="s3707">See letters dated April 25, 1986, and
