born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Born in Brussels, in August 3rd, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s10">How far back, in generations, does your family go, in Belgium?</span> <span id="s11">A: In Belgium, no more than three generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Well, I think my father came from a little village in Poland called Blaski.</span> <span id="s14">He had seven brothers, and my father and his brother immigrated in Belgium, and a brother came in Belgium after the second -- the first World War, okay?</span> <span id="s15">One emigrated to Israel and another emigrated to the United States, and the rest were assassinated of course, by -- by the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Wha-What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Aaron.</span> <span id="s18">Aaron Brombart, and -- yes.</span> <span id="s19">And he came in Belgium, as I found out recently from the Belgium government archive, exactly in 1925.</span> <span id="s20">And he only married my wi -- my mother, sorry, in ’39, because he was engaged in a divorce with his first wife, who he married in Poland before he came to Belgium.</span> <span id="s21">And there were all those bureaucratic, you know, legal matters were pending.</span> <span id="s22">Then, I don’t know exactly when they pronounced the divorce, but what I know, that he ask in 1937, the Polish government to release his mise -- our sister, Sarah, in order for her to come to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So he had a child in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: In Poland, yes, from his first --</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Wh-Wh-Where -- where was he born in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Blaski.</span> <span id="s27">Must be a famous village because practically everybody that I -- I met here say they came from Lódz, Blaski and all the sur-surrounding area.</span> <span id="s28">Then, he marry first in Poland, before he came to Belgium, and from again, the last documents received from Belgium show that his first wife also came at one moment to Belgium, and I think he arranged all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Very complicated name that I have to find out with --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Okay, we’ll talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: -- with -- yes.</span> <span id="s33">And -- but I never had any contact with her, I never saw her except a glance at one ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Then his relationship with your mother started when?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: I-It started -- he came in ’25, I-I was born in ’33, then they must have met before that.</span> <span id="s36">And there is all kind of story because my mother had two sister, and one sister married a -- a cousin from my father, coming from Poland, and I have photos where he -- he’s seen in -- in this Blaski, the other wearing peasant clothes, he had the nice, you know, jacket and the hat, etcetera.</span> <span id="s37">And presumably he was responsible also to bring this cousin to Belgium, too, who married the sister of my -- of my -- of my mother.</span> <span id="s38">I think it’s a -- a little complicated still.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Tell me about your mother’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well, my fa -- mother family came from Poland, and they were all born in -- i-in Poland, and they came in -- in -- in Belgium.</span> <span id="s41">We have photos etcetera.</span> <span id="s42">I think also, ’25 - ’27.</span> <span id="s43">And I don’t know in ’27.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Because you said in the beginning your family goes back three generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, I thi -- I think it’s not correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s47">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I -- is not correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I think it’s two generations maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: It’s just your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Tell me what kind of work your father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes, he was a -- in the ladder, you know.</span> <span id="s57">I know that they work, you know, in a little room for 12 hours a day, etcetera.</span> <span id="s58">I think for -- for probably two or three years, before he enter in a very successful business of his own.</span> <span id="s59">You know, with -- you know, 20 workers or 30, which is --</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Also a ladder business?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes, a ladder -- a -- a -- and a -- a ladder business.</span> <span id="s62">But then came a, you know, a past, you know, story that when he came to Belgium, as -- as I mentioned in another oral history, he went directly to work in the mines, coal mines in Liege for -- for a year.</span> <span id="s63">And he had always a connection with the mining industry, not because -- we talk about later, that there was [indecipherable] in the last family who -- who were miners, but h-he took me practically everywhere -- every year back in the mines, you know, to -- to see what’s up, I mean, etcetera.</span> <span id="s64">And [indecipherable] were before -- a-after we went in the mines, etcetera.</span> <span id="s65">That h-he became very, as I mentioned, very successful, but again I -- with all those document, I have no proof that -- of the fact that he went directly to Liege and work in the mines.</span> <span id="s66">This is not in the archive of the -- of the Belgium government.</span> <span id="s67">They ja -- mentioned that he resided in Brussels, that he had this job, that before he went, there were exchange of letter with the Polish consulate, etcetera.</span> <span id="s68">And we mentioned that his salary was X Belgian franks a year, and that he was a good worker [indecipherable] and that they will provide housing, etcetera, which was essential for somebody to -- to come to -- to Belgium from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Okay, now you were born in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Let’s talk about your family at that time, was it a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, they were not religious.</span> <span id="s73">It was not that.</span> <span id="s74">They follow, let’s say, some practice, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Passover, Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s77">I -- I was Bar Mitzvah, too.</span> <span id="s78">I was very keen to have all the gifts, but anyway, it was a -- in the Brussels Jewish family, an event, because not only the ceremony took place at the Grand Synagogue in Brussels, but it tooks three -- three days.</span> <span id="s79">You know, the first days with -- the banquet was for the immediate family and friends.</span> <span id="s80">The second was for my father clients, you know, and the third one was for all his workers.</span> <span id="s81">So, you know, th -- it was a big -- a big things.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: But this was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You’re talking about your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes, bar mi -- it was just after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Was just after, okay, let’s get back to before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">As I mentioned, th-the family of my mother, they came from Warsaw in ’25 - ’27, the mother, the father and three sister, okay?</span> <span id="s91">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So these are your grandparents, and your aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Grandparents, correct, and actually they were all employed by my father, you know, and -- but I was born in the basement of a li -- of the apartment from my grandfather, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Where -- where did you -- you live in Brussels?</span> <span id="s95">In the center, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: In -- in one of the -- yes, in -- in Brussels area.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: In the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: In the city, wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: In a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: In -- in an -- a small apartment [indecipherable] a small apartment, but I was born at my grandmother place, and apparently on August the second, but my father went to the city hall on the third, then a-all the papers said I was born on the third.</span> <span id="s101">How about that?</span> <span id="s102">A-Again, an administrative little problem.</span> <span id="s103">And we live in the [indecipherable] some kind of basement and -- until we moved to a -- a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s104">This must be then in -- in ’35.</span> <span id="s105">[indecipherable] was born in thir -- ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s107">Would you describe your family at that time, pre-war, as being middle class --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: -- upper class?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: My father was certainly middle class, okay?</span> <span id="s111">He -- he prosper at that time.</span> <span id="s112">I have only remembrance that h-he was very successful.</span> <span id="s113">Many things, all the photos that I have, we spent at the seaside, you know, in Belgium.</span> <span id="s114">I remember at that time, you know, there was all those ballroom dancing, etcetera and I remember each time I had -- they -- they -- they -- they put in front of the bed all the balloons, all the gift, etcetera, a-a-and -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s115">Later, it was a very large room, and my sister was in the same room, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Now, this is the sister that was born after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, no, no, that’s my half sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Your half sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Who came in ’37.</span> <span id="s120">And I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So did -- did your family ha -- did your parents have any more children after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: And she was pregnant when she was deported, yes.</span> <span id="s125">That’s -- has been also documented by doctors and all that.</span> <span id="s126">Then, many things about -- very nice upbringing, you know, spoiled, like [indecipherable] by my mother, a-and my father, certainly.</span> <span id="s127">And -- and the rest of the -- the family, my grandfather was a clockmaker, something like that, yes, a-and the other wa -- you know, as I mentioned work in my fa-father business, they never make it at the same level that my father, in term of revenue, income, etcetera.</span> <span id="s128">And then came the -- the war, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Yeah, well, we’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s130">Were your parents Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Let us say that because he had one of -- of his brother in -- in -- in -- in Israel, I think he was more or less Zionist.</span> <span id="s132">He was a member of the -- the Jewish labor bun -- bund [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s133">And this is a very interesting question, because it led to a development later on, when his -- or certainly my mother, were convince that th-there will be not, you know, harm, you know, and therefore th-the -- there was some distance between Zionists, you know, and the belief that th-they will be, you know, recognized as Belgian citizen and so on and s -- and so forth.</span> <span id="s134">Then, how -- however, my -- our sister was a leader of the Hashomeritz --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Hatzair?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: -- ye -- Hatzair, and you know, she -- she develop into a fantastic girl, and they were -- they were debate if they have to leave for Israel or not, st -- you know?</span> <span id="s137">But I think she was one who says we have to go, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s138">Too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What language is it you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: At home I speak French with my wife, and she speak Fre --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: No, no, I meant when you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Grow -- oh, French.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: You spoke French.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: French.</span> <span id="s145">But I unders -- began to understand Yiddish, because all my father and -- and -- and his friends were speaking Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: From Poland [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Fr-From Poland, and -- and they were in Brussels, th-th-then they finally -- yes, they were speaking --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: No, I know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s150">They were speaking Yi-Yiddish, I never learned Yiddish, I learned a bit of Hebrew because of the Bar Mitzvah and the gift, but -- but nothing, nothing else, it was French, I wa -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you live in a -- I know you were very young --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s153">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s154">Yeah, yeah</span></p>

No, non-Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s157">The -- the Jewish, they were -- the only strict Jewish neighborhood was in Antwerp, you see?</span> <span id="s158">Then, in Brussels it was very --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: -- integrated, and the other center was in Liege, was also integrated, there -- there -- there was no -- not any form of -- of -- of residences in the street for -- for Jewish, or something like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: When you were very young, did your parents belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s163">No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: But you still observed Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes, Passover, but that was done by the grandmother, etcetera, not by -- by -- by her family.</span> <span id="s166">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So you remember going over to the relatives for the

<p><span id="s199">Q: And so what year did you start school?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Well, school, that was the -- the second phase, let us say.</span> <span id="s201">I remember very well when the German invaded Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s203">Okay, well, we’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q:

id="s214">Q: Did -- did -- yeah -- did you feel Jewish?</span> <span id="s215">I’m talking again before the war, did you feel Jewish?</span> <span id="s216">Did you know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: We know that we were Jewish, but I didn’t feel that, that it was something special at that time.</span> <span id="s218">I think this was really an integrated, you know, fa -- Jewish family who respect the origin, but you -- we didn’t, you know, feel any --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Be-Before the Germans invaded, had you ever heard of a man named Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: You did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s223">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: So your parents

it’s -- it’s -- i-i-if we go into the details of that, he -- especially from my mother’s side, she -- and my father, too, never real -- realized that there may be some consequence, though they should have, with the German situation, and with all the fal -- the Jewish immigra --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Poland, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: -- Poland, Germany, and the newsreel and the paper --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: -- etcetera.</span> <span id="s235">I -- I will not say that I never forgive them, but I think they did a very big mistake, because the sister of my mother, and th -- and their two ch -- and the father, and the two chil-children, went into hiding, okay?</span> <span id="s236">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Do you remember their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh yes, their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Well what -- what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: When

id="s249">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Minna Lewin?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Lewin, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: -- and I think she was the second in ma -- first was Esther, her, and then my -- what I want to mention is that in this pre-war period, and leading to the -- the invasion from the German, I know this because after the war, that contrary to some of the friends o -- friends of the family --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: -- it was my mother who resisted, you know, leaving.</span> <span id="s256">She -- she wanted to keep, you know, an eye on -- on her mother and father.</span> <span id="s257">The other didn’t care, they go -- went.</span> <span id="s258">She refused when my father was able to purchase, you know passport from Central American countries, who were sending their passport.</span> <span id="s259">And some of those families were in a camp, but in -- n-not of the same camp.</span> <span id="s260">The German, they -- they were in camp in -- in -- in France for -- for -- for a -- for Central American citizen were not in the war, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, I never forgave them, to use the word, and -- and she stay and stay, contrary to my father advice, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s263">And this is why, an illustration of that, that is why my father send me, you know, in hiding before, because he -- he sensed that something, you know, may happen.</span> <span id="s264">And unfortunately also, my grandfather became involved in a -- in a Jewish, you know, organization, incorporated with the German, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span

her -- of her belief that she will not face anything that, you know, the German will not do anything, you know, and things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s474">And this lead to what I mentioned before, that she refused my father a --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did it -- did --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: -- a-advice to -- to -- to leave for this America, or to France, or like all

wear this, from your other friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yeah, I -- I think a little, yes, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s479">But th-the significance was not there.</span> <span id="s480">And why it will have been more of a significance if I -- I had been member some Jewish group [indecipherable] etcetera, like my sister was with Hashomer Hatzair, but I was not, I was not.</span> <span id="s481">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s483">So then you went to school til mid ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

remember going -- ma -- my mother put me with the scouts, the Belgium scouts, etcetera, that I like very much, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And they didn’t discriminate against you

mining pits, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: And at that time, you know, y -- you were this mountain of things, then [indecipherable] I remember going, and they took me to a ci-cinema once in awhile, you know?</span> <span id="s861">I know th -- that they -- as I think I mentioned, to store where they bought some furniture, you know?</span> <span

imagine by that time -- I know you were in a Catholic party, or you were -- you were in the socialist party.</span> <span id="s893">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And they were all socialists?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: And they were all socialists and [indecipherable] you know, never anything to do with religions, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Mm-hm,

doesn’t mean anything for many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s902">Then -- yes.</span> <span id="s903">Then what I wanted to mention is that the first time I realize that there was a -- really a war, okay, was when I joined my father in May o-of ’44 -- th -- I went to school in that time.</span> <span id="s904">And again, everybody knew that I was Jewish, but they -- th-they -- they -- they protected.</span> <span id="s905">You know, they, of course, not a -- an issue any more on that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with David Brombart.</span> <span id="s908">This is tape number two, side A. And we were talking about your living with the miners.</span> <span id="s909">And you stayed with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Stayed with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: That was the last -- was that the last family you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: No, a -- th-the last one was when I went to visit, for the first time, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: That was in -- in May of ’44 -- of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay, so up to that time you had stayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: With th-the -- the miner’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: With the miner’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: And was a -- mention was a very good with me, and you know, took some chances, you know, in th -- in going to -- to -- to movies, going out, etcetera, and some -- I had the sense that there was a German prob -- i-issue.</span> <span id="s919">For instance, I remember very well in front of a [indecipherable] which a -- in the city in Belgium close to Olne, there was, in front of the train station, I was going somewhere with them -- I remember well that there was a German, or -- or a Belgian SS officer in black, you know, and I knew that I should not be close to him, okay?</span> <span id="s920">Then when he -- he turned right and turned left.</span> <span id="s921">You know, I was circling around, i-if he notice or not.</span> <span id="s922">At that time I think they -- they knew that everything was lost a-and they didn’t pay some attention.</span> <span id="s923">I will tell you more about the nu -- another illustration of that.</span> <span id="s924">Then I went to school, or at least attended some classes where my father was hidden.</span> <span id="s925">Again, I think th-the teacher was -- you know, at that time it was one teacher for -- for a big class, you know, I mean so many pe -- and it was a little place, and -- and I realized something very important arrive -- it was in June ’44, and he didn’t tell us that the invasion arrive, but he --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: This is the Normandy invasion, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: And he didn’t -- but he didn’t -- he teach us a song, which is -- it was called, “My Lovely Normandy.”</span> <span id="s930">You know, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Can you sing a little bit of it?</span> <span id="s932">Why don’t you sing a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: I don’t know si -- no, I-I -- I -- I have to be -- think about that.</span> <span id="s934">Normandy, my love, or my tera -- my city, or something like that.</span> <span id="s935">A place that I will always return, or something like that, I remember.</span> <span id="s936">Then I went to my father, I said something was happen in Normandy, you know?</span> <span id="s937">And he said, yes, the invasion, because he had the radio.</span> <span id="s938">During all this time, in that place, h-he -- he di -- ik -- he never went out for -- for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: But what town was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Jistu, in Jistu.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: He was in Jistu?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah, he was Jistu, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: This is a place where I visit him in May or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: -- ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: So that was the first time you saw him since you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Since I left, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: What was it like when you first saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Oh, he was very pleased, of course he was so pleased, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: How did he look?</span> <span id="s952">What was his health like?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: His health at that time was, I think, still okay.</span> <span id="s954">But after, he developed some heart problem.</span> <span id="s955">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s956">And he never went out from that house, so it was in -- in a [indecipherable] and he was exercising only in an attic, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: How long was he hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Oh, from -- from ’42 til ’44, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: In the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: No in the same, no.</span> <span id="s961">At first he went in Brussels, but with the same family.</span> <span id="s962">When he escape, or etcetera, he went with that family, did it for money, but that’s all right, and then took him to this place in Jistu, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Jistu.</span> <span id="s964">And he stayed in their --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: There.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: -- house.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yeah, a little farmhouse, I remember, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Did he go out at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s970">And he just was in this attic, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: So no one knew he was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: They were afraid to tell the neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No one know he was there except one and twice that the farmer says, you know, there is somebody there.</span> <span id="s975">And the -- the wife -- the -- the wife said it’s my brother visiting, or something, you know?</span> <span id="s976">And -- and he was in an attic, and he was circling in this attic all the time, I still remember trace of his path, you know?</span> <span id="s977">And he was counting some coins, you know, to do something.</span> <span id="s978">And -- sorry -- and -- a-and I think he went outside once or twice, because there was no, at that time, bathroom in the house, so of course you have to go outside.</span> <span id="s979">And -- and then came, obviously, after the Normandy invasion and -- and we saw hundreds of American plane -- or planes coming in, you know, and we couldn’t understand what they were dropping, all those aluminum things, you know, that were to escape the [indecipherable] system or things like that.</span> <span id="s980">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Now, wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: -- did you just visit your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: -- or did you stay with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: I -- I could not return, because of the bombing, y-you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: You -- you -- you came in-initially just to visit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Just to visit him, and then I was unable to go back to Olne --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Back to where you were hiding --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: -- because the bridge -- yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: So you stayed with your father in the farm house?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Up in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s995">I was -- no, they couldn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s996">I was able to -- to -- to move around, to move around.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: All around.</span> <span id="s999">And as I mentioned, I attend some of the classes in June of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So you’d -- okay, so you lived in the farmhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yes, with my father, until the liberation in September ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1006">And he also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Wh-When you went to visit him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: -- did you know you were going to stay with him, or you</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Oh no, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: You thought you were just going to visit for the day or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Sure, sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s1013">Sure -- no -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1014">No, th-the plan was to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: To go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: -- back, at least you -- and in like -- probably didn’t like the idea for me to be with him if something happen, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: So that’s when you went to the school in Jistu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: For -- in Jistu, and in June, you know, there was this -- this in -- the invasion --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: -- and the teacher mention, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1021">Then thing became more clearer in term of -- of the invasion, the in -- the American and British are coming, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1022">And my father was -- he devised something which I think many Jewish family did with their naiveté or their idiocy or whatever.</span> <span id="s1023">He -- he hided in a -- he had a -- a -- there was a big armoire, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: And then he had the straw that you can close the door from the inside, outs -- yeah, the inside, so that if everybody went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: He had to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: -- he will hide, like when the German or the Belgium police came, they knew the tricks, of course.</span> <span id="s1028">It will -- I mean.</span> <span id="s1029">absolutely nothing, but he did that, you know?</span> <span id="s1030">But then, i-in -- in August, September, the -- th-the -- the -- the German became to -- to -- to return to Germany, you know?</span> <span id="s1031">And I remember they stop in the village, you know, but they were already disorganized.</span> <span id="s1032">I remember a German youth smoking a pipe on -- on the head of the cars, you know, they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1033">But there was a German officer, I have to find out -- he had the yellow uniform, maybe from a tank is still something, and people were obliged to feed him, you know, when he co -- he came in the house, I could not [indecipherable], then I went in the dining room, and I don’t know what his reaction was, did he know, or did he say the hell with it, you know, ah, we -- we don’t do that any more, or didn’t want to do it, he was not an SS, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1034">And they departed.</span> <span id="s1035">Okay?</span> <span id="s1036">Then, I remember very well the incident with the German tanks, three or four, passing in the -- you know, we can see the -- in the village.</span> <span id="s1037">I remember also that the -- the ally bomb some of the roads.</span> <span id="s1038">And as you know, the German escape with everything they wi -- they had, and with horses and things like that.</span> <span id="s1039">And I remember the people in the family went to pick up some horse meat, you know, from the horses who were, you know, dying of that and whatever.</span> <span id="s1040">And at one moment, must be in the beginning of September or end of August, we saw three American Jeep, you know, passing by.</span> <span id="s1041">They say hello, but they went.</span> <span id="s1042">And then on -- after the liberation of Brussels, some of the -- the workers of my father, who were still in -- i-in touch with him, because as you know, what happened with this factory and many Jewish similar factory, in order for the German not to -- to take over -- you know, my father sold the -- the business to -- to them, you know, okay?</span> <span id="s1043">Then they came with a truck and we went back to Brussels, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: But they were not in touch with your father while he was in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: He was -- they were in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: How were they in touch with him while he was in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1048">For -- for money question, for anything.</span> <span id="s1049">They probably knew the family Verbrugen etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Because during that time, they bought, with [indecipherable] money of my father, a very big mansion in Brussels, you know, and we returned to that.</span> <span id="s1052">We saw this with a sign, this is not -- not enter, you know, property of the Belgium government.</span> <span id="s1053">It was a -- an office from the German, or something like that, okay, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Now, did you think your mother was still alive?</span> <span id="s1055">Did -- what did you know at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: I knew that she was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: But did you think she was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: You know, there were -- I remember meetings with Jewish friend, my family, etcetera, they were all talking about that, okay?</span> <span id="s1059">And all a -- a-all of them had somebody wh-who -- who has arrested, deported, okay?</span> <span id="s1060">And I remember one or two saying, you see, your mother is not alive any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Okay, now -- but I’m talking about when you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Those different houses.</span> <span id="s1064">Did you always at that time think she was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Difficult to say.</span> <span id="s1066">I was totally out of -- o-of this whole picture, who-who-who-who-whole picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Even after the liberation, my father never talked to me about the details, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: It’s only in ’45 or later, when he show me a letter from the international Red Cross, who says, you know, we have to -- to tell you that your sister -- because he mention [indecipherable] and mother are dead.</span> <span id="s1071">Okay?</span> <span id="s1072">A-A-And that’s all what he say -- h-he said, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Do you remember how your father reacted?</span> <span id="s1074">Was he an emotional man, or was he very reserved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: He was reserved, but emotional too, because at that time this whole affair with my -- my grandfather and the Jewish committee came out, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Oh, okay, let’s talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: And -- and i -- I think he simply blamed the grandfather not to have protect more my mother, who was being arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: This is his mother -- this is his wife’s father, or his father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: No, that is the f -- th-th-the father of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Okay, your -- your maternal grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Maternal.</span> <span id="s1082">Th-th-the grand -- his grand -- his -- my grandfather from that side, the [indecipherable] remain in Poland, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: -- with no knowledge of nothing.</span> <span id="s1085">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1086">But then, after the war, i-i-it wake up, that he accuse my -- probably my grandfather of no -- to have not protected enough my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Right, he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: -- though he got all tho-those kinds of money, you know, that she was not supposed [indecipherable] to be put in the train, but to remain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1090">And what did your grandfather

all in French, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Oh -- oh yes, that was all in French.</span> <span id="s1205">And -- and piece of [indecipherable] I realize what happened with my mother [indecipherable] but not the intensity of it, or th-the murder, or the assassination, the arrest.</span> <span id="s1206">And I began to -- to -- to get back to the same ki -- guys I was friendly when

and -- and this was the beginning of a -- of a new chapter where I begin to -- to be interested in politics an-and labor unions, you know?</span> <span id="s1215">Because a-again a reaction to -- to what happened before, okay?</span> <span id="s1216">And we became active in some organizations, okay?</span> <span id="s1217">And -- and this was the period from ’44 til ’49.</span> <span id="s1218">Was still, you know, discussion and then I became active in the political movement, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Okay, but for -- we-we’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Tell me about the end of the war, what was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Oh, it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: -- and liberation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yes, it was a [indecipherable] and everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s1225">People who were like my -- my aunt came back to Brussels, you know.</span> <span id="s1226">We were to [indecipherable] and the people who were in a camp in Switzerland came back, and they went -- the ones who were in the ca -- escaped to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1227">They were -- they were in Kerbene, France for all the [indecipherable] came back.</span> <span id="s1228">We had a lot of memories, and I remember the discussion then was the situation in Israel, and you know, the -- the -- the independence [indecipherable] Israel and this I remember all that.</span> <span id="s1229">Some were member of the [indecipherable] who wanted the greater Israel, and the [indecipherable] and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1230">I remember that we were, of course, concerned [indecipherable] the Egyptians were 15 miles from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1231">Of course, there it doesn’t count, everything is so close.</span> <span id="s1232">We -- and this I remember, and a son from one of my father brothers in Poland also immigrated in Belgium, okay?</span> <span id="s1233">And he became a famous radiolog, one of the top, you know, doctors in radiology, okay?</span> <span id="s1234">Write a thousand of book.</span> <span id="s1235">If you look on the web, you will see his books all over, all over the place.</span> <span id="s1236">But then came the story that because he was a doctor, he -- he went -- he was asked to join the UN observer in Palestine, you know, during the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s1237">And do you know that he took me with him, you know, and I knew that my uncle was there, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1238">I didn’t -- still don’t understood, but it was very fun --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Are we talking about the 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: You’re talking about the 1948 War of Independence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah, yeah, War of Independence.</span> <span id="s1243">He was the UN observer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: And he took you and you were 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: 15, o-or what.</span> <span id="s1246">And it was a trip in the plane, in the army plane and then all that.</span> <span id="s1247">And then I began also to -- t-to -- to -- to learn th -- about what was the politics, you know, I -- I began to sense, beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Right now you’re in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Oh yes, I was in the high school, okay?</span> <span id="s1250">And -- but it was ’48 like you -- you mention, and I learned more about the events with Palestine, the creation of the state, about the Egyptian, etcetera, and about international politics.</span> <span id="s1251">Because m-my uncle was in the UN observer, never observe anything.</span> <span id="s1252">We were always in the beach in Tel Aviv, you know?</span> <span id="s1253">And when the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- some other people in the UN says, you know, you have to go and observe the Jewish are doing things like that, they went in another direction.</span> <span id="s1254">You know, when the -- when the -- th-the [indecipherable] you have to say what they did.</span> <span id="s1255">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1256">And you know, we landed in -- not in Tel Aviv, there was no airport, but in Haifa, you know, in the little place of that, and it was fun, except that I took the events seriously, beginning to -- to understand and there -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s1257">And -- and met some -- my uncle was there, you know, and other member of the family, you -- a-a-and I forgot to mention who I met in Belgium after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1258">They were in the -- in the Jewish brigade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: You see?</span> <span id="s1261">And the Jew -- I remember the Jewish brigade when th-the -- the allies told the officer of the Jewish brigade, you know, it’s enough, you are killing enough German, you have to be done [indecipherable] any more over there in Germany, in the occupation.</span> <span id="s1262">Then they came to rest in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1263">I remember walking very calmly with one of my uncle was the Jewish brigade, etcetera [indecipherable] which I met later, he was in the army, he was in the army paper all the time, and -- and of course they departed.</span> <span id="s1264">And the -- of course explaining that we don’t care about the British, we don’t care about anybody.</span> <span id="s1265">Want to learn -- want to -- to use the arms, you know, with [indecipherable] as you know in the history in Lebanon th -- and things like that [indecipherable] that was the bi -- the main group, a thousand of them.</span> <span id="s1266">Okay, then I met them again, anything.</span> <span id="s1267">And my father joined me at that time also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: He came over from Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: -- from Belgium in ’48, and that was my first trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: How long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: I think three weeks only, because nobody care about this UN business anyway.</span> <span id="s1272">The same today.</span> <span id="s1273">[laughter].</span> <span id="s1274">Same.</span> <span id="s1275">It was already clear at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: When you said your Uncle Lukt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: -- was supposed to go and observe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: -- instead he went to the beach, did he purposely not want to observe, or he just wanted to go to the beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: No, no, he -- he was one of the -- the many who realized this was a futile exercise, that both the Israeli, the Israeli, we were there, didn’t want them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: -- to observe anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: So he purposely went to the beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yes, like with the other officer -- and -- and -- and after awhile -- I don’t know the details, but I presume the UN says, you know, this is enough [indecipherable] think they won this thing, and you know, there is no point, because there were things that the Jewish did because they had to do it at that time with the arms and things like that.</span> <span id="s1286">And were not very, you know, acceptable in -- in quotation, but there was nothing else to do, huh?</span> <span id="s1287">And that’s was it.</span> <span id="s1288">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: So you came back to Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: I came back to Brussels and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Went to -- back to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Went to high school, and explained the kind of high school, it was a [indecipherable] then the -- the socialist party who -- in Belgium high school, you know, where they train people at that time for the different movement in the sort of -- the co-ops movement, cooperative movement.</span> <span id="s1293">Of course, does not exist any more, it’s -- that thing -- for the health service, because until today the health service is run by political party in Belgium, and [indecipherable] then you are to go in a socialist health plan or Catholic health plan.</span> <span id="s1294">And there a story with that too.</span> <span id="s1295">My wife was a very conservative [indecipherable] and didn’t want -- not practi -- religious for [indecipherable] but still today says something against the -- the socialist movement.</span> <span id="s1296">Anyway, the fa -- my son Eric was born in the socialist hospital.</span> <span id="s1297">And then she say, n-never again, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1298">Then [indecipherable] my daughter, Sarah, she went to the red -- Red Cross hospital.</span> <span id="s1299">Then the third one was the political -- you know, strict political party and the other were the -- th-the humanitarian and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart.</span> <span id="s1302">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s1303">You were talking about your experiences in high school, you had come back from Israel, and then you went and you were talking about the health care system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah, well, in -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1306">So you finished high school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Or what was your high school experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Well, after the liberation I went to the first years of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1312">And then because I began to be influenced by politics and [indecipherable] I -- I went to the socialist training center school, okay?</span> <span id="s1313">With, a-at that time a boarding school, but I didn’t go to -- because it was in Brussels, I didn’t go to the boarding school, and this was an institution delivering a diploma in social work, okay?</span> <span id="s1314">Again, see, in Belgium you are th -- e-even in 1907, a public school, and a Catholic school system, okay?</span> <span id="s1315">And the third one is the state’s system, okay?</span> <span id="s1316">And for instance, my wife went to the state social training school, okay?</span> <span id="s1317">And at that time, th-th-th-th-the -- the social worker’s profession was not -- was not recognized as a -- as a university, you know, school.</span> <span id="s1318">It’s only later, now, that it -- it deliver Master, before it was only Bachelor.</span> <span id="s1319">And because I was so involve in this politics that I didn’t even finish th-the -- the -- the -- the course.</span> <span id="s1320">They say, you don’t need it, go immediately into you know, the -- the socialist movement, okay?</span> <span id="s1321">And we will take you as the leader of the socialist youth.</span> <span id="s1322">When we say socialist, I have to explain this again to some of our American friend.</span> <span id="s1323">socialist, in the United State has a communist meaning.</span> <span id="s1324">Of course, this was not the case, this is social democrats.</span> <span id="s1325">Like, for the election of the last few days in France, when they call a socialist, he is not more socialist than I am, but it -- it -- it is to be understood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to work for them, but before that, when I was 19 years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: This is 1952?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A:

more Jewish after what you had been through, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: No.</span> <span id="s1350">No.</span> <span id="s1351">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: -- you had to be hidden because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: -- no, I -- I knew for me it was something linked with the heritage.</span> <span id="s1354">Something that you cannot -- like my other -- like this doctor tried to -- he said to divorce himself from, you know, the Jewish identity, okay?</span> <span id="s1355">I know that I was Jewish because we had the -- my friend was Jew -- friend of my father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1356">We came to -- to be a -- a member of the Maccabee in -- in Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: But weren’t you angry that because you were Jewish you had to go through what you went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: -- and you lost your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: No, well, you know, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: There was no feelings of anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: -- there is no -- no feeling of -- no, it was more the feeling of the stupidity of the entire situation, you know, because of the -- as I tried to mention, if I had anything to say, we were -- we were -- we would have left Belgium even before the invasion, you know, like many did.</span> <span id="s1363">And it is an accident of, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in history that one -- two brothers came to Belgium, the other went to -- to -- to -- to U.S., and -- and the other ones were -- went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1364">Then it’s more of that kind of things, because in this political action, there was never any sign of anti-Semitism, any sign of you are Jewish, or not.</span> <span id="s1365">This never, never, never happen.</span> <span id="s1366">It may have happened here, in the United States, but not -- and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: But when you -- but for you, in growing up, you had no anti-Semitism --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1369">When I went to the army -- you know, when you ask in the army, I want to go there, they just do the opposite, you see?</span> <span id="s1370">A-And -- and -- and -- and I -- I ended up in the Air Force near a -- we were the few planes that Belgium had, you know?</span> <span id="s1371">And -- but it was very important in my, let’s say, development.</span> <span id="s1372">Hu -- I became totally independent, I didn’t want to hear about my father saying you have to take th -- over the business, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1373">All this was something else.</span> <span id="s1374">Okay, I become an activist and -- and -- and developed this whole campaign that no Belgium conscript, draftees, can be sent to Korea -- it was the time of the Korean war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Korean war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: And I say, you know, send the volunteers, but we have nothing -- you know, we were all in favor of facing the Chinese and all that, but we didn’t want drafting to come.</span> <span id="s1377">No, i-it is a bit like here, when they decide no draft any more, volunteer.</span> <span id="s1378">And certainly when later on [indecipherable] the campaign against sending Belgium to -- in the Congo, was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1379">I say, you can send anything you want, except the draftees, you see.</span> <span id="s1380">And of course, now there is no more draft, then this was a -- a good idea to advance at tha -- on that time.</span> <span id="s1381">And the army was a lot of fun again [indecipherable] because it was a comedy, you know.</span> <span id="s1382">When I finished th-the instructions, you know.</span> <span id="s1383">And of course when we were French speaking, they were sending you in the Flemish speaking, you know, training.</span> <span id="s1384">I -- nobody could understand.</span> <span id="s1385">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Did you know any Flemish?</span> <span id="s1387">A: Yes, because in Brussels you had to learn in school Flemish, and [indecipherable] still bilingual today, you know?</span> <span id="s1388">[indecipherable] I could.</span> <span id="s1389">And I remember one or two questions from officers, but are you really Belgian?</span> <span id="s1390">Because you know, at that time you can see [indecipherable] I didn’t look when I was young, like I look now.</span> <span id="s1391">I became more, you know, tan and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1392">Then I say, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1393">If not, I will not be here, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1394">They never said Jewish or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s1395">That I use for the first time during my military service, my Jewish origin, you know?</span> <span id="s1396">And this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: In what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: In the sense that I-I knew somebody who said, you know, the Jewish holidays are coming, you know?</span> <span id="s1399">Go to the commandant and say you are Jewish, I want to attend.</span> <span id="s1400">He says, you’re crazy, because I was already before active in the socialist movement.</span> <span id="s1401">I said, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1402">You don’t go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1403">I say, here, the letter.</span> <span id="s1404">I knew the -- the cantor, who was -- who -- oh, my father, you know, as -- a -- a something -- a [indecipherable] -- I don’t know the word.</span> <span id="s1405">Oh my father, the fact that he became one of the -- in the army, the -- the religious om -- officer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: The chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: The chaplain.</span> <span id="s1408">And he went to my father and say, look, I want to be this chaplain, I n -- I need a letter from you saying that I speak Flemish.</span> <span id="s1409">If not, I will not get the job.</span> <span id="s1410">Then my father say, you know, you’ve -- good, very good friend, you’re Flemish.</span> <span id="s1411">And then he’s the one who says, you know, you’re the Flemish.</span> <span id="s1412">Then, it was really crazy because it was the training camp, it was September, you know, I went in August.</span> <span id="s1413">I was with a girlfriend in France, in holiday, my father say look, you have to go.</span> <span id="s1414">I say okay.</span> <span id="s1415">And -- and -- and I went to the commandant, he sa -- gave me a week, you know?</span> <span id="s1416">And said at that time we were trying to -- to train for a parade, where we were giving, you know, a blind man a -- a -- a dog, you know.</span> <span id="s1417">And then they say you cannot do that, you will not be there.</span> <span id="s1418">You know, you have to stay and watch all the -- th-the -- the guns, you know, make -- it was a comedy.</span> <span id="s1419">Of course, when I ca -- went back, they got me, but in turn that I was every day on -- on duty.</span> <span id="s1420">And -- and I say yeah.</span> <span id="s1421">Anyway, that’s a -- a -- a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1422">It was a comedy because the commandant of the Brussels airport, you know guards, we were guards, so-called special unit to guard the airport, introduce -- I introduced myself.</span> <span id="s1423">They say Brombart, Brombart.</span> <span id="s1424">He got i-in his book and he find oh, that his mistress asked to watch for a Brombart, in case you have a Brombart treat him well.</span> <span id="s1425">So funny, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: How di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: What was the connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Well, he had mistress who knew probably my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Maybe she was also his mistress, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1432">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1433">He say okay fine, you will -- you will serve in my office, he was the -- the -- the food thing.</span> <span id="s1434">I had to check the balance of every can of champagne for the officer, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1435">I had many visits from the inspector, you know, if the -- the [indecipherable] but for me it was nothing, I-I knew five bottles less, two, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1436">And na-na -- I learn all the tricks.</span> <span id="s1437">Keeping the coupon from the chocolates, you know.</span> <span id="s1438">And the officer guy came and say I want five bottle of wine, and -- and I gave -- I put, you get fi -- you got five, fine.</span> <span id="s1439">But only -- he got only three, I got the two other.</span> <span id="s1440">And it was a comedy.</span> <span id="s1441">And I was immediately assigned to be in the education offices, and I run the -- the information center on the thing, and I remember when my biggest audience and people in was when Stalin died in ’53, and that was something.</span> <span id="s1442">He was still believed to be somebody, and they came.</span> <span id="s1443">And we were -- we were not eating in the mess, we were eating in the kitchen, you know?</span> <span id="s1444">It was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1445">And at the end they say, you know, [indecipherable] just get out of our way and they gave me the living out pass.</span> <span id="s1446">Then every night I was at home, have to go back in the morning.</span> <span id="s1447">Was really a comedy.</span> <span id="s1448">And -- and a -- I was supposed to serve 24 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: -- 24 months --</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: -- because of the Korean war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: And I serve only -- it was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And then it was 12, and then there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s1457">So, very good.</span> <span id="s1458">And because I am now a so-called Korean veteran, I got another 500 dollars a year.</span> <span id="s1459">It’s crazy -- it’s crazy, I say, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1460">Then they say, you have this -- this free a -- free health service, and free on the train, I say, oh, now I have another train [indecipherable] free three times a day, or -- or anyway, that’s the whole [indecipherable] on the thing.</span> <span id="s1461">But anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Then you left the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: And then immediately --</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s1478">A: And -- and at that time it was not the same man any more.</span> <span id="s1479">I-I-I-Is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Was he bitter about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: No, but he lost his business, more or less.</span> <span id="s1482">Then he had some real difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Did he talk about your mother at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: But many people says, you know, your father don’t remarry because of you, he wants to, you know, cover you so much.</span> <span id="s1487">And when he wants me to go in his business, I say, I -- you know, I’m going into the socialist movement.</span> <span id="s1488">And of course, he was s-s-so concerned about me.</span> <span id="s1489">But he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Did he become more religious after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: No,

<p><span id="s1495">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: He thought that I will find some difficulties, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1497">And on the contrary, I -- I assert myself very well, and everybody was as-as -- very surprised.</span> <span id="s1498">Ha -- very surprised.</span> <span id="s1499">And then I went to work from ’64 to ’58 in the socialist party, and -- full time and paid etcetera.</span> <span id="s1500">And -- but at the same time, I was also a -- active, and a militant of a [indecipherable] group, who was called the young socialist guards, you see?</span></p>

bit English, staying with a family also, but it was a few months.</span> <span id="s1623">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1624">And he says, you know, we are creating that, okay, and he was a -- one

interesting period with this -- send me a letter saying your salary will be 8,400 dollar.</span> <span id="s1648">Then the -- the people dealing with the AFL-CIO, are you out of your mind?</span> <span id="s1649">You know, he has to get 12,000.</span> <span id="s1650">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1651">Which was a good salary --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: -- in -- in ’64.</span> <span id="s1654">Then -- but he was like that.</span> <span id="s1655">I remember his son came once to s -- at the office, he say, I need some pair of shoes, then it’s 20 dollar.</span> <span id="s1656">I s -- he had no idea.</span> <span id="s1657">All his life, he has live on these expenses.</span> <span id="s1658">He could have bought half of Brussel, half of Paris, you know, in those time, and afterwards, nothing.</span> <span id="s1659">To get in a suit, you know, we had to carry him, you know, to a -- to a [indecipherable] to a tailor.</span> <span id="s1660">Literally carrying, yeah.</span> <span id="s1661">Because -- you know.</span> <span id="s1662">Anyway he say, this and this, there was a good sect -- a secretary, assistant, main assistant who says, you know -- she was the one who says, you know, he needs 12,000 dollar or we’ll never, you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1663">When I arrive --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Okay, you arrive in the United States with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No, a month before the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: A month before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Before.</span> <span id="s1668">Again --</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: What was it like for you to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Oh good, I had visited the United States once or twice on my international travels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Oh, you had been there already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Okay, and then at that time I was so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: What did the United States mean to you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Oh, th-th-th-th-the -- the liberation people, and th-the fr -- the th-the fight for freedom, because we were all in the Cold War operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: But you’re Belgian and you’re leaving your home country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Oh, it was international business.</span> <span id="s1677">We had so many friends who worked in Paris, at UNESCO or in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1678">You know, it was at that time, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: But did you feel Belgian?</span> <span id="s1680">Do you know what I mean, you -- you did not feel Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: No.</span> <span id="s1682">No, I -- I -- no.</span> <span id="s1683">[indecipherable] feel Belgian [indecipherable] anyway, for us, it was the nin -- in where I was born, and where I work, it was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1684">You know, I serve in the military service.</span> <span id="s1685">You know I [indecipherable] politic life in Belgium, that it was very important to me.</span> <span id="s1686">But at that time the young people were looking for in-international exposure.</span> <span id="s1687">At that time it was very important to -- to me.</span> <span id="s1688">It’s not the same today, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Did you think you were coming temporarily, and you’d be going back to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Or somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: And -- but i-i-in the 70’s, people didn’t want to leave their pro -- because the salary were higher in their own country than internationally, and they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1695">No, for me it was great, because of Irving, and all the others, like Mrs. Kirkland, but that was a bit later, when her husband succeeded George Meany.</span> <span id="s1696">It was th-th-th-th-the -- the maxima, and, as I indirectly says, began to be associate with the AFL-CIO, and Irving -- y-you know, disclose a lot of his operation in western Europe in -- from Greece, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1697">We knew -- he -- he told me those are government finance operations now, you know, he begin to talk.</span> <span id="s1698">And I say yes, I-I say, including the organization you are working in.</span> <span id="s1699">I say very well.</span> <span id="s1700">And this was good for me.</span> <span id="s1701">And when, in ’67, when was in [indecipherable] the disclosure came that all those organization went financed by the CIA -- you see, I say I don’t care a damn [indecipherable] CIA or not.</span> <span id="s1702">CIA for me is an org -- agency of the U.S. government, and I don’t think if they do many thing [indecipherable] president of the na-national [indecipherable] council or the Congress don’t know, that’s their business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: [indecipherable] End of Tape Two,

Tell me a little more about Irving Brown.</span> <span id="s1707">Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Yes, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1709">Bu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Did you dis -- did you discuss your childhood with him?</span> <span id="s1711">Did he ever ask you about what you went through with -- during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1713">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: So you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: All this was aft -- and he -- o-only what I was doing at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: -- where I came from in terms of the politics of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Yeah, but I meant your earlier experiences as this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Oh no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: -- as a child, and what you went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1726">But I didn’t know until much, much later, because it’s a physical --</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: That he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: -- yes, his physical appearance was -- was not Jewish, okay?</span> <span id="s1729">And it help him very much, I presume, is a be -- when he was working with the Arab countries.</span> <span id="s1730">Where I -- I succeeded him in the Arab countries, but at that time they knew that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: And this is particularity of the old U.S. policy in north Africa, in the Maghreb, and -- a-and the fact that I knew very well that there was no unity between Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia.</span> <span id="s1733">That actually they hated -- if -- themselves.</span> <span id="s1734">That in Tunisia they were totally in favor of Israel, you know?</span> <span id="s1735">And -- and actually when the -- their leader came to our convention in the United States, of the AFL-CIO, you know, Congress, first thing they ask, where are the Jewish restaurant?</span> <span id="s1736">Cause they want the delicatessen, they know that the food will be that much better.</span> <span id="s1737">Even it was not a kosher, there was not set up, but I remember in ra -- in -- very well in Chicago and in San Francisco, etcetera, the [indecipherable] because

and something near the old Madison -- no, near the -- where the new Madison Square is, okay?</span> <span id="s1747">And it was, I discovered -- he got this because of his political influence, of course, like the visa, or anything he does.</span> <span id="s1748">Takes the phone, I need 100,000 dollar for that.</span> <span id="s1749">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1750">No -- not -- those things are over, huh?</span> <span id="s1751">But anyway, he got this apartment from his friend -- I know the name, Zimmerman and Harry [indecipherable] etcetera, in the co-op, you know?</span> <span id="s1752">And the co-ops is -- you know, it’s incredible, it never happen.</span> <span id="s1753">There is a waiting list of 300 people there.</span> <span id="s1754">Yi -- they put some -- through somebody, I all -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1755">Anyway, we arrive there, Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1756">It was a one -- two bedroom apartment [indecipherable] a little balcony, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1757">And one month later, my wife want to [indecipherable] it -- I always move and she did all the work, of course.</span> <span id="s1758">And she -- she came, she say, I’m coming.</span> <span id="s1759">I say th-the -- the -- there was a strike in Belgium, the fur -- the furnishing not here.</span> <span id="s1760">Then I rented an apartment in Queens from

want to go in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1771">Okay.</span> <span id="s1772">Then there was a strike in New York at that time.</span> <span id="s1773">Then Irving said to somebody in the main office, give them their bloody containers, you know?</span> <span id="s1774">And I say, we don’t do that [indecipherable] container.</span> <span id="s1775">Then the -- the -- the mayor talked to -- to the customs and the custom inspectors say [indecipherable] came to the apartment with the thing, and -- and -- a-and they are [indecipherable] in front of -- in -- in the apartment, you know?</span> <span id="s1776">Okay.</span> <span id="s1777">This is where we lived for a year and a half, until my wife got totally mad at me, and say, what are we doing here?</span> <span id="s1778">Because she was reading the paper, and you remember in ’64, the houses were 12,000 dollar, and three months free, I don’t know what happen.</span> <span id="s1779">She said, I don’t stay here with the two little baby.</span> <span id="s1780">And we began to visit places in New Jersey at the beach, but the commuting was too si -- house -- 20,000 dollar, o-on the beach, you know, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1781">We went to -- to New Jersey twice.</span> <span id="s1782">And then I had a friend, who work with me in Europe, who live in Larchmont, Westchester, and say, David, don’t look more, you come here.</span> <span id="s1783">And he lied to us because he was -- his address was Larchmont, but he was really living in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1784">Then he did access to a beach in Larchmont where he showed us.</span> <span id="s1785">Then we made one offer, two offer, and finally we bought the house for 36,000 dollar, because I didn’t want to go higher, I say it’s the double of my salary at the time was 75, so it was perfect.</span> <span id="s1786">I said -- and my wife said [indecipherable] we have to -- to -- to buy in the [indecipherable] only, on

and a half now, and in Larchmont when we sell -- sold the house because we were coming in Washington, the house sold for a lot of money, but not one million and a half.</span> <span id="s1789">That’s the story where [indecipherable] was well ready for us, where we had to -- to live through it.</span> <span id="s1790">There was no timing, everything was organized, and I was traveling so much, that

Catholic.</span> <span id="s1999">And the only thing, we took them once in a synagogue, once in a -- in -- in a church.</span> <span id="s2000">And -- and I didn’t influence them in -- in any theory, or any thing.</span> <span id="s2001">They said, do you believe in something, I say yes, but I don’t really believe in anything.</span> <span id="s2002">Then came the word -- the word that I didn’t know exist [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Fantastic, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: -- it’s all gimmicks, you know.</span> <span id="s2005">You know, either you believe, or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2006">You can say like [indecipherable] I believe in something, or creation, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2007">I -- I always remember them when I was under the -- in front of the [indecipherable] guys when we are ta -- teaching, you know.</span> <span id="s2008">One of the first thing they say, the philosophy was you know, to put an apple on the table.</span> <span id="s2009">And they say -- they told you about God, about this and that, all this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2010">Look at this apple.</span> <span id="s2011">In a few days you will see insect [indecipherable] coming from the apple.</span> <span id="s2012">Huh?</span> <span id="s2013">[indecipherable] came from -- we don’t know the answer, from the universe, and -- and these -- and you see now where they -- at that time they say [indecipherable] or we’ve got natural catastrophe, you know, you co -- you believe what happen in the old time.</span> <span id="s2014">We have the islands forming, the volcanoes and the belief we -- in God, or in the sun, etcetera [indecipherable] people who were not -- they have la -- then they say look, then -- we answer the -- you know.</span> <span id="s2015">There are many different apples, you know.</span> <span id="s2016">And so -- actually not.</span> <span id="s2017">[indecipherable] this one you just [indecipherable] and that’s it, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2018">No, it’s a -- no, it’s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the Belgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can think this because then union from the job.</span> <span id="s2019">And -- and then came this bulletin from the Diaspora, you know, you see.</span> <span id="s2020">This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let’s say to -- to France.</span> <span id="s2021">And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but until now, even under social democrat government they don’t move.</span> <span id="s2022">They have ceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history, but they don’t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest, etcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes.</span> <span id="s2023">You know, they -- the German were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named [indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know?</span> <span id="s2024">The German was using them until a certain point, you know, when, in ’43 they were losing the war, and then they -- they had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the resistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody was a resister.</span> <span id="s2025">And -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s2026">Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it’s only now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran question.</span> <span id="s2027">I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you are a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that.</span> <span id="s2028">And then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was [indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know is rising like many place in Europe.</span> <span id="s2029">Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches by the extremist right and things like that.</span> <span id="s2030">And also they are attacking the -- the -- the Belgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided between the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a Jewish foundation of things like that.</span> <span id="s2031">And I became interest because I -- I think, learning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with Eggenberger, th-that it’s not acceptable.</span> <span id="s2032">That the priorities should not be there hundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get.</span> <span id="s2033">Ah, but we were -- we -- the -- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don’t need it, but there are some people who need it, okay?</span> <span id="s2034">And -- and -- and then this is quite important.</span> <span id="s2035">Then bu -- they also -- other news about this Belgian archive.</span> <span id="s2036">Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was Jewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things like that, which I think is -- is quite important because there were so many, and answer indirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history.</span> <span id="s2037">You know, anyone is that, and what’s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my father-in-law, with my mother’s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what is the truth was not the truth, you know, in this thing.</span> <span id="s2038">Then it was very important.</span> <span id="s2039">And this led me to -- to ask about this interview.</span> <span id="s2040">You see, this is the chronology of the thing.</span> <span id="s2041">And Arnheim said yes, it’s very important that there is a second step, that all documentation is in fact, used, in a way that you have nothing extraordinary to tell, a-and I -- I know that.</span> <span id="s2042">It’s just one experience, okay, and it’s not the same experience that the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay?</span> <span id="s2043">There were some children also in the same situation.</span> <span id="s2044">And children were denounced by people and send into camp.</span> <span id="s2045">O-Or my friends sent in a convent or a monastery.</span> <span id="s2046">Then the situation is very, very, very different.</span> <span id="s2047">But -- but st -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David

you know, it’s the general knowledge of the danger of authoritarianism and dictatorship and the rise of it and the fact that in Europe, twice the United States had to come to rescue them, that they did it.</span> <span id="s2109">It’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a -- i-it’s a -- a continent who has been so much involved in internal struggles, going back to Napoleon and etcetera, and the same mistake to try to i -- to rule in the su -- these large territories of the Soviet Unions.</span> <span id="s2110">In -- in that sense we saw some parallel with the Islam, the raise of Islam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: But my point is, do you have more of a visceral reaction?</span> <span id="s2112">Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: More emotional, because your life was changed by it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: By that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Yeah, yes and no, it’s more on the political level again, because I was in charge of a program called -- the first program called Islam against the Islamists, to make the difference between the two, you see, and -- and -- and again, there’s nothing religious, it is a group of power monsters, who will do anything to access to the control of a state, uh-huh, and the -- in the Koran, everybody knows that i-i-it’s -- it’s like the Catholicism, a-and -- and the other form, built on the -- o-on an evolution, which -- which show only that with the raise of Islam, we see that they are as primitive like the Catholics were hundreds of years ago, of the Jewish, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2118">Then this is more on that kind of level, and the fact that this has to be -- has to be stopped because there are new factors, okay, meaning -- especially in western Europe, with the immigration from our country.</span> <span id="s2119">We have the problem here, we have another, the Latin American immigration, etcetera, who is different, of course, from the Jewish immigration, or the Belg -- the Belgium.</span> <span id="s2120">I found in the paper so many story where Belgium descendent, even this -- to make a joke, this D.C. Madame, you know, etcetera, she is born in -- in a place in Pennsylvania called Charleroi, who is a -- a name of a city, mean you find, more or less, and in the [indecipherable] you find, you know, that’s moving, when they say, he was in the Battle of the Bulge, you see, or before a -- y -- many, many, many things when -- went to that [indecipherable] it’s full, I mean the -- in the book.</span> <span id="s2121">And many thing, many way.</span> <span id="s2122">Ah, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Do you -- you have a d -- a duel citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: I have now a double citizen.</span> <span id="s2125">Before it was not possible.</span> <span id="s2126">I mean, when I came here from Belgium, you renounce your Belgium nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: You renounced your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: But then again, the notion of citizensh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Was that painful for you to renounce it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Ma -- no.</span> <span id="s2131">That was not -- not all.</span> <span id="s2132">Because I made such a difference between a heritage and a situation.</span> <span id="s2133">And -- and -- and I never asked to go in the Belgian army to defend so-called the king, okay?</span> <span id="s2134">The king, for me, was a -- a collaborator, the first one, during the war, of course, huh?</span> <span id="s2135">Meaning that I put this all in -- in perspective.</span> <span id="s2136">And I didn’t come, mind you, American before, I was here seven years.</span> <span id="s2137">You have to wait five years, a -- two more years, and as w-we talk about the legendary Irving Brown, he say, you know, one thing done, forget your heritage, okay?</span> <span id="s2138">And -- and I -- he was more French than American anyway, live in Europe all his life.</span> <span id="s2139">I recognize from one of the best [indecipherable] in France, etcetera, then it doesn’t mean an -- really, when you have this international outlook.</span> <span id="s2140">This is when somebody say, oh you -- your daughter work in Germany.</span> <span id="s2141">I say, ah, I know -- w-w -- there’s no meaning.</span> <span id="s2142">She could have work in Italy or something else.</span> <span id="s2143">What is important with -- with all that, a-and th-the race of Islamic, you know, i-infiltration in ji -- i-i-in the labor movement, in political life and in the society, i-is ta -- to remember that Europe is still divided between many [indecipherable] and the case of Bosnia, Serogovia, the fall of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2144">I say everybody can be tomorrow a murderer if you -- if you don’t pay atten -- e-everybody can be manipulated in their thinking, in one way or the other, very easily.</span> <span id="s2145">Where people can be convinced, you know, that Clinton was a great president, or you know, it may be, maybe not, but anyway, he’s not one of the greatest in this country anyway.</span> <span id="s2146">A-And -- and the same can be said from -- from the president, who is now here.</span> <span id="s2147">It is a -- a -- a -- a state of the development of country, of nation, and of the political life.</span> <span id="s2148">What we can control, and what we cannot control.</span> <span id="s2149">What a free society means.</span> <span id="s2150">And now came all those great [indecipherable] thinker even today, in [indecipherable] etcetera.</span> <span id="s2151">He said, election is not a proof of democracy.</span> <span id="s2152">But we knew this many, many years, that you know, the fact impose, practically, an election, doesn’t mean anything in many countries of the world.</span> <span id="s2153">Either it’s still tribal and you talk about feeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-their responsibility is vis-à-vis their tribe.</span> <span id="s2154">It’s not the [indecipherable] their country.</span> <span id="s2155">And there is nothing in this concept of country, of nation.</span> <span id="s2156">They simply do not exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Well, you -- I know you talked about, you know, feeling very international, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: -- obviously traveling all over the world.</span> <span id="s2160">Do you have any particular feelings about Germany because of World War II?</span> <span id="s2161">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Are you comfortable when you’re there, when you visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: I wa -- no, I visit two or three time, I’m not comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: I think, you know -- I remember in Berlin, sitting in -- in -- in a restaurant, you know.</span> <span id="s2166">There were some very old couple.</span> <span id="s2167">I think th-th-they look at me, you know, and they may -- and I’m -- and they must have been, you know, concentration camp guards, who else, you know, and thing li -- you don’t know.</span> <span id="s2168">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s2169">Going to Germany two, three -- I went to Berlin in fir -- first time in ’56, you know, and -- and the question was not the old Germany, it was the east Germany, you know, a-and the west Germany, what we do to rebuild them, and th -- the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the acceptance of a occupation policy, who was not very wi -- wi -- all the aspect of which are not -- we cannot be very proud, because we use, you know, th-the-the police, we use -- etcetera, you -- i-is simply bring back of what the contemporary situation with Iraq, where we did not want to use the army in the [indecipherable] of Saddam.</span> <span id="s2170">And the fact that we didn’t do that was a great mistake, because we didn’t do it in Germany, but -- or in Japan, certainly not.</span> <span id="s2171">Then -- no, I feel co -- uncomfortable there.</span> <span id="s2172">But I must say I feel uncomfortable in every -- any country where I don’t know the language, or they don’t understand, you know.</span> <span id="s2173">I -- I -- I never went, because of political reason -- well, I went afterward -- to Spain or Portugal, because they were under dictatorship and we find -- that’s when I was in the young [indecipherable] I went back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: So it’s interesting, it’s because of your professional background --</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: -- and your political background, not because of your childhood experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2178">This immediately, you know, dissipated, because of -- of -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Have you met other hidden children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2181">Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: And do you feel a connection to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Oh yeah, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s2184">Either because I -- I think I refer -- we were member of the Maccabee.</span> <span id="s2185">Even though -- and Maccabee was a, as you know, mo-mostly a sports, you know, activity.</span> <span id="s2186">We had the gymnasium, and the ping pong, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2187">But they -- there were some lecture, you know, on -- on Jewish life, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2188">There were artistic group, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2189">And we knew that we choose Maccabee, not to be in the Zionist group, or not to be in the traditional Orthodox Jews, which didn’t exist anyway in Brussels, they were all in Antwerp, you see.</span> <span id="s2190">And -- and then we -- we had many debates, you see?</span> <span id="s2191">But the ones who are here were the -- the ones who -- who -- who decided to -- to move on, you know, with the briti -- with the Jewish background and -- and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2192">Many people like me went very early to Israel, and we ca -- went back -- I went back twice or three times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Do you feel a special connection to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Oh yes, sure.</span> <span id="s2195">Sure.</span> <span id="s2196">This is another issue.</span> <span id="s2197">This was the Jewish state and this was the -- let’s say an history was started much earlier, under the British empire and [indecipherable] and all that, yes.</span> <span id="s2198">And of course we will -- defended -- there’s no -- no -- when I visit the afri -- the -- the Arab countries, my boss, Irving Brown at that time, when we were in Tunis [indecipherable] the Palestinian came a-and want to talk to Irving.</span> <span id="s2199">Irving says, go to David.</span> <span id="s2200">He didn’t want to talk to them.</span> <span id="s2201">Then we sit down and I said, glad to talk to you, okay, but if you raise the question of Israel, there’s no deal, okay?</span> <span id="s2202">Can talk about anything you want.</span> <span id="s2203">At that time they didn't even want -- they were not talking about a Palestinian states or nothing.</span> <span id="s2204">They want just to be anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an imperial state.</span> <span id="s2205">I had many contact, but again, through the years he became very dangerous, you know, in terms that we were close from the -- the exile group, even from inside and outside the Tunisian of the [indecipherable] Algeria.</span> <span id="s2206">And people were -- my friend were assassinated.</span> <span id="s2207">It is another story, I can tell you where we had, for instance, the liberation movement against the French in Algeria.</span> <span id="s2208">I visited the border [indecipherable] kind from Tunisia, Morocco, all that.</span> <span id="s2209">But the people we are dealing with were eliminated by their own people after they took independence, you know, their friends had been torn out from this -- from stairways and things, oh, terrible.</span> <span id="s2210">Some were assassinated in Paris, which I knew and I was very con -- of course, concern about it.</span> <span id="s2211">But again, when you talk to a -- a guy like Irving Brown, he accepted that [indecipherable] and never talk about that.</span> <span id="s2212">His best friend die [indecipherable] never talk about that.</span> <span id="s2213">And we were involved in all kind of operation, etcetera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and children, when I was awarded, you know, commander honor of this award, national award, you know, th -- of this officer, of that, and the other, and chevalier -- knights of that.</span> <span id="s2214">Senegal and -- and Doumay, and -- Senegal, Doumay, and oh, what’s the third?</span> <span id="s2215">Togo, huh.</span> <span id="s2216">And I came back each time so proud of the men [indecipherable] that they laugh at me.</span> <span id="s2217">And the na -- the big, you know, diploma, I wanted to put this in my little [indecipherable] no, no.</span> <span id="s2218">It’s only -- it’s a true story, of course, like everything I told you, of course.</span> <span id="s2219">I brought it from the basement and I put it back, two of them.</span> <span id="s2220">One is too big in the -- in my guestroom, and the other one is too big, I -- I left in that.</span> <span id="s2221">And then people are asking me, but why did you get?</span> <span id="s2222">I say, look, this is to organize a ch -- regime change, the other was to oppose one.</span> <span id="s2223">And -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s2224">But that’s another aspect, and I think it’s very well describe in -- in several books.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s2227">We were all in favor of it, and I think my wife wants nothing to do with all that -- with [indecipherable] conservative says, why a trial?</span> <span id="s2228">Kill him [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s2229">It’s like what she said things about the -- the unfortunately situation with the killings in school, etcetera [indecipherable] I say, why do you go thr -- they go all through that, you know?</span> <span id="s2230">Each time somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Well, I was wondering, did it make you think of the loss of your mother, the loss of your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Oh yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Did it -- did it bring you right back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: -- th-the -- oh no, the -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: That’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: Yeah, the whole tragedy o-of that period, of course.</span> <span id="s2237">And when there is -- I don’t know whether before, I was going some movie a-about, you know, Eichmann arrest, or about the -- the thing, but you know, in the book on the Belgium deportation that there is upst-upstairs [indecipherable] that I have it at home, you know, with the list of the convoy, etcetera, there is, at the end, the trial in Kohn, Germany of the mi -- the one who did all that in Belgium, okay?</span> <span id="s2238">H-he went free after five years.</span> <span id="s2239">Then, for me it’s another a-aspect, it’s a -- it’s really showing that -- that the society evolves, that this thing of remembrance, it’s -- i-i-i-it’s something personal, but when you are involve in all those acts, there is no justice, you know, only for the few.</span> <span id="s2240">[indecipherable] Nuremberg and all that, it’s only a few, what, 20 people, or 50 people.</span> <span id="s2241">Of course, what we did with denazification in Germany was excellent, of course, excellent.</span> <span id="s2242">And th-there became, like in Italy, etcetera, recognition that people have to live with the regime that they have, you know, and as I mentioned before, the populace, the people are -- are subject to so much more [indecipherable] that today’s -- even an election in a s-so-called civilized country has different meaning for different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: What is your feeling coming into the Holocaust Museum building?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: The first time?</span> <span id="s2245">I went there three times.</span> <span id="s2246">I went here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: No, I’m talking about this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: Yeah, yeah, I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: -- th-this one in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: -- three time.</span> <span id="s2251">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2252">I decided --</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: Do you have any emotional reaction when you come to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: No, I have more -- better illustration of some of the -- th-the situation.</span> <span id="s2255">I went to -- in the [indecipherable] where you can follow the deportation on the screen, you know?</span> <span id="s2256">Then I look at Belgium and I say, that’s not enough, it’s not even very -- it’s quickly done.</span> <span id="s2257">I don’t think that they show any -- you cannot s -- have any remor -- or any comment, you know.</span> <span id="s2258">I-I went back because they have something of a list, my aunt who ca -- before she fa -- came here and then before she died -- you know, there is -- her name is on it, but her husband name is not on it, you know.</span> <span id="s2259">Certainly mine is not on it, because I never put it, nobody ask, you see?</span> <span id="s2260">The best place is the reflection, you know, pool there, with the wall, that’s important.</span> <span id="s2261">But to go through a place with all the photos of -- of people deport -- I’ve seen that, I-I -- you know, it has no -- you know, I’ve -- this I know about Belgium, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2262">This I know.</span> <span id="s2263">And to have a little [indecipherable] around Belgium doesn’t mean, you know, anything.</span> <span id="s2264">Because they concentrate on Poland, on the big countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Do you belong to any hidden children organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Yeah, well, to -- no, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: I mean, here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: Oh, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: That’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: I tried to contact one, I saw somebody testify in front -- before the Congress.</span> <span id="s2271">Some guy who -- who supposed to have a group to defend the survi -- the children of the survivors, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2272">I look on the Web, and I couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s2273">But no, I am -- I was really, lately, interested in that, and it’s only because I -- I was on the -- with this Belgium, you know, all these thing that they put on, and -- and that I pursue [indecipherable] this thing, but I would not be member of anything.</span> <span id="s2274">I’m never ask anything, ju -- this thing really, has been practically through in my head, but -- and I accepted it, voluntary.</span> <span id="s2275">I would not have accepted 50 years ago, I never accepted it.</span> <span id="s2276">And while on the basis of all those things, you are [indecipherable] you are not accepted if you have receive compensation from the German claim.</span> <span id="s2277">You know, you cannot have both.</span> <span id="s2278">And now I know that some people got German ca -- oh yes, a lot of them, but they cannot get this [indecipherable] etcetera, because you are -- which is totally incomplete.</span> <span id="s2279">I don’t know if I have to say that.</span> <span id="s2280">You ge -- you put the wrong address, you don’t take that.</span> <span id="s2281">And with this whole business of the non-payment of an insurance premium was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: -- a criminal kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2284">Either you say if your -- you ha -- you had one or not.</span> <span id="s2285">Because if you had one, it must have been a very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: Is -- is there -- is there anything else you wanted to add to the interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: No, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: -- or do you feel you’ve expressed your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: -- no, I am pleased to -- on this opportunity, for what it may be worth, and I think it’s a kind of a -- of a normal, let’s say duty in terms that I know more because of this research being done, okay?</span> <span id="s2290">Maybe with the money, and I didn’t find anything there, I didn’t find anything in the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2291">Of course, I went to Israel each time on the [indecipherable] and in passing through the alley of the -- the -- the [indecipherable] of the hide people, th -- you know, th-the -- the ones who save, I say, the people I went -- were hidden from will never be there, because I will never, even they save my life, suggest that they should be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: Because they did it for money, okay?</span> <span id="s2294">The people who are there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: I see, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: -- most of them, you know, took them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2298">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: -- a great risk -- they had the risk too --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: -- that’s no -- no -- no problem with that, but th-that’s part of my re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: -- reaction to it -- to -- to the events were taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Well, thank you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span
