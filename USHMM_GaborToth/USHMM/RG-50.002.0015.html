1923 to a middle class family.</span> <span id="s16">Her father owned two fur stores.</span> <span id="s17">She had two older sisters and a younger brother.</span> <span id="s18">Her father and her sister survived.</span> <span id="s19">When the Russians occupied their town in 1939, wealthy families were sent off to Siberia, but they hid successfully.</span> <span id="s20">Before the Germans came, Jews from the south warned her family of the atrocities being committed.</span> <span id="s21">She says, "We felt something was coming, but we couldn't help ourselves."</span> <span id="s22">When the Germans came, a ghetto was established in a suburb of Novogrudok, Poland.</span> <span id="s23">By 1943, only 350 Jews remained in the ghetto, out of a pre-war population of 30,000.</span> <span id="s24">These survivors decided to escape.</span> <span id="s25">They spent every night for three months digging an escape tunnel.</span> <span id="s26">One young man did not want them to try it, certain he was a spy, some of the boys who dug the tunnel choked him to death.</span> <span id="s27">After the escape, Rae, her sister, and her father spent nine months in the woods.</span> <span id="s28">Her brother escaped through the tunnel, but they were never able to find him.</span> <span id="s29">They joined a partisan group led by Tuvia Bielski.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">At war's end they smuggled themselves into Czechoslovakia, Austria, and then Hungary.</span> <span id="s31">Rae met and married her husband in Hungary.</span> <span id="s32">They later again crossed the Italian border.</span> <span id="s33">While in Italy they lived in several displaced persons camps.</span> <span id="s34">Rae and her husband came to the United States in 1949.</span> <span id="s35">She wonders why so many countries shut their doors to Jewish immigration before and during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s36">She says, "Our children live a little bit of our lives.</span> <span id="s37">I don't know if it is so healthy for them.</span> <span id="s38">We live our lost youth through our children.</span> <span id="s39">We had no youth, our early years were spent hiding.</span> <span id="s40">Our middle years were spent rebuilding."</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Transcript of the Interview with Rae Kushner</span></p> <p><span id="s42">1982</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q:My name is Dr. Sidney Langer and I am the Director of the Oral History Project of the Holocaust Center at Kean College of New Jersey.</span> <span id="s44">I'm very pleased that Mrs. Rae Kushner has consented to come to Kean College today to discuss with me some of her insights and memories into the years of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s45">Mrs. Kushner thanks you very much for coming here.</span> <span id="s46">Could you tell me a little bit about when you were born, the town that you were born in Europe and a little bit about the nature of life in the town that you came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A:I was born in North Poland, Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s48">We had a population of about 25,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q:Total Population?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A:Total.</span> <span id="s51">Six Thousand were Jews.</span> <span id="s52">We lived a comfortable life, a quiet life.</span> <span id="s53">Most of the Jews were religious.</span> <span id="s54">When it was the Shabbat, we all used to close the stores, we used to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s55">We had private schools to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s56">We had a couple of Yeshivas.</span> <span id="s57">We had a nice cultural life.</span> <span id="s58">After the war broke out the Germans brought in 24,000 Jews from the other small towns and put them in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q:What year were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A:I was born in 1923.</span> <span id="s61">We had orphanages.</span> <span id="s62">We had hospitals, a Jewish home for the aged.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q:How large was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Our family was our father, Naum, my mother, Hinda, and four kids, three daughters, Esther, Lisa, and me, and one son, Chonon.</span> <span id="s65">The whole family was maybe 200 people.</span> <span id="s66">My father had seven sisters, one brother, my mother was one of four children.</span> <span id="s67">Unfortunately, no one but my father and sister survived.</span> <span id="s68">I had just two cousins left after the war.</span> <span id="s69">We felt Anti-Semitism before the war.</span> <span id="s70">The Polish were jealous, because the Jews were mostly the storekeepers.</span> <span id="s71">We dealt with the middle class people.</span> <span id="s72">We were not wealthy.</span> <span id="s73">The Jewish people had a little store, like a grocery, a fur store, a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s74">The Jews used to sell pots and all kinds of things, but they were just in connection with the middle class, not with the high society.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q:What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A:My father had two fur stores and he used to sell hats, men's hats.</span> <span id="s77">We lived comfortably.</span> <span id="s78">The kids went to school, to private schools.</span> <span id="s79">I had a an older sister, Esther, who finished college, like university here.</span> <span id="s80">I was too young to start college, but I went to a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q:Your sister went to university in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A:They sent her out of town.</span> <span id="s83">Later they sent me to a different town when I got older, to Kracow, to Bais Yaakov Seminary.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q:Did you have a Bais Yaakov Seminary in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A:No, we didn't have a Bais Yaakov Seminary.</span> <span id="s86">We had a Tarbut, this is an elementary Hebrew school and we had a couple of Yeshivas.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q:So Tarbut was for girls only?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A:For children until the 12th grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q:From kindergarten through 12th grade.</span> <span id="s90">For girls only?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A:No, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s92">After the 12th grade some people went to college and some went out of town to different schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q:You say your brother went to a Yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A:My brother no.</span> <span id="s95">He was younger.</span> <span id="s96">He was young.</span> <span id="s97">My older sister went to college when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s98">I had an only brother.</span> <span id="s99">He was younger than me.</span> <span id="s100">He was then about 15 when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s101">And he was going to a local cheder and later he went to Tarbut.</span> <span id="s102">It was a coed school for Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q:How many children were in the school, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A:The school I think had about 200 children.</span> <span id="s105">The whole problem started in 1939.</span> <span id="s106">The war broke out and Russia came to us.</span> <span id="s107">We were not too happy, because the Russians took away everything.</span> <span id="s108">They nationalized all of the stores and took the richer people to Siberia.</span> <span id="s109">This was a tragedy at the time, everybody was afraid to go to Siberia.</span> <span id="s110">Luckily, the people that they took away to Siberia were still alive after the war.</span> <span id="s111">They came back.</span> <span id="s112">We were considered wealthy and they wanted to take us away but someone told my mother that one Saturday night the Russians were going to come for us.</span> <span id="s113">My mother took all of the four children and she hid us in different houses of poor people so that the Russians should not get us.</span> <span id="s114">No one was home on Saturday night.</span> <span id="s115">The Russians took the people and put them in wagons.</span> <span id="s116">Then they put them on cattle trains and sent them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s117">They took only the wealthy, the poor people they left in town.</span> <span id="s118">Now I wish that the Russians had taken us too.</span> <span id="s119">After the agony, the whole war, the people who were taken away were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s120">But who knew what there was going to come from Germany?</span> <span id="s121">Who knew that the Germans were going to kill us?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q:Now, how old were you in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A:In 1939 I was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q:Were you aware of what was happening in Europe and Germany prior to 1939 when Hitler rose to power, before the actual beginning of the invasion of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A:We didn't know so much.</span> <span id="s126">Later, we found out.</span> <span id="s127">We knew that there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s128">There used to come a holiday, the Polish people used to say Jews go to Palestine, you don't have a place here, but we didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s129">This was a small element of people.</span> <span id="s130">May the 3rd was a Polish holiday.</span> <span id="s131">So the Polish came and said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s132">Go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s133">It's not your country."</span> <span id="s134">But nobody paid attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q:When did that start?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A:This was in 1935, 1936, and 1937.</span> <span id="s137">A few Jews, friends of my father's who had stores left everything and went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s138">They said to my father and mother, "Sell everything and run."</span> <span id="s139">But we had a problem.</span> <span id="s140">We didn't know where to run.</span> <span id="s141">There was no Israel like there is today.</span> <span id="s142">There was no place that you could legally go to.</span> <span id="s143">It was very hard to get a visa to the United States; it would take years and years.</span> <span id="s144">For a family with small kids to pick themselves up and go it was very hard.</span> <span id="s145">But a few families left to Palestine and they stayed alive.</span> <span id="s146">One man's wife just died.</span> <span id="s147">She was 95.</span> <span id="s148">They went through very hard times in Palestine too.</span> <span id="s149">She was shot once; he was shot.</span> <span id="s150">It was not Israel today.</span> <span id="s151">We felt the Anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s152">We felt something was coming, but we couldn't help ourselves.</span> <span id="s153">The doors of the world were closed to us.</span> <span id="s154">You know how hard it was to get to Israel?</span> <span id="s155">Boys and girls used to sit in a camp for three or four years before they could go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s156">To go to America was harder.</span> <span id="s157">You sent your papers and you waited for years before you could get a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q:So your father was making attempts in 1935, 1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s160">My father remained a unmarried and stayed with his sister here in the United States.</span> <span id="s161">Her name was Leah Gross.</span> <span id="s162">We felt threatened but we couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s163">Some people came into our town from South Poland.</span> <span id="s164">The Germans were in South Poland in 1939.</span> <span id="s165">They told us stories.</span> <span id="s166">They told us, "they're killing Jews."</span> <span id="s167">We didn't believe them.</span> <span id="s168">We said, "What kind of people would do that."</span> <span id="s169">They told us a story that Jews had to open up a grave and later the Germans put the Jews who dug the grave into the grave alive and killed them.</span> <span id="s170">People were confused and they wanted to run to Russia, but by that time you could not run anywhere.</span> <span id="s171">In 1941, the German came into our town and took us over.</span> <span id="s172">On the Shabbat the Germans came with airplanes, the bombs started to fall, the war against Russia had started and the city was on fire.</span> <span id="s173">We saw dead people lying on fallen electrical wires and everyone started to the suburb of the town.</span> <span id="s174">We were sitting with Polish farmers listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s175">The bombs stopped and an announcement came over the radio that all Jews should come back to town.</span> <span id="s176">The Germans told us, "Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s177">You're going to be safe and we will be good to you."</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q:This was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A:1941.</span> <span id="s180">The Germans told us to go home and to go back to work.</span> <span id="s181">All the Jews went back to their homes.</span> <span id="s182">Many homes were destroyed by the bombs so those that did not have a home moved in with someone else.</span> <span id="s183">We settled down.</span> <span id="s184">After four or five weeks the Germans announced that we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s185">So we put it on and they gave us orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q:You were 17 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A:Eighteen then.</span> <span id="s188">The Germans gave us orders to put on the yellow star to show that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s189">We were not allowed to go on the sidewalk; we had to go in the middle of street.</span> <span id="s190">It didn't bother us that much because except for that, things were normal.</span> <span id="s191">We had our homes; we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q:Was there any discussion in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A:There were discussions.</span> <span id="s194">We couldn't go any place.</span> <span id="s195">People running to Russian were being killed.</span> <span id="s196">My brother, Chonon, took his bike and wanted to run away to Russia.</span> <span id="s197">My mother started to cry.</span> <span id="s198">She heard that a friend's son was killed on the way to Russia.</span> <span id="s199">She didn't let him run away.</span> <span id="s200">We were confused.</span> <span id="s201">You know what the problem was?</span> <span id="s202">The people remembered the Germans from the first war.</span> <span id="s203">The Germans were good to the Jews then.</span> <span id="s204">The Jews made a living and the Germans had left us alone.</span> <span id="s205">Who could understand and who could think that such a thing would happen to us?</span> <span id="s206">Nobody imagined that people would do such things to other people.</span> <span id="s207">When we came back from the suburbs our house was still standing.</span> <span id="s208">But, we moved into another house.</span> <span id="s209">Maybe my parents thought we could hide that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q:Your family was together for the entire time when you were in the suburbs?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A:All together, yes.</span> <span id="s212">A month after went back to our houses, the Germans told the Jews to gather in one place.</span> <span id="s213">It was on Saturday.</span> <span id="s214">We were told to take only what we could carry and to leave all our other belonging in the house.</span> <span id="s215">That Friday night my mother lit Shabbat candles and I remember she was crying.</span> <span id="s216">One candle went out.</span> <span id="s217">She said, "Oh, God!</span> <span id="s218">That's a bad sign."</span> <span id="s219">The next morning the Jews were told to leave their houses.</span> <span id="s220">Saturday morning we packed and went to the gathering place with other Jews.</span> <span id="s221">Then the Germans brought in Jews from the surrounding small towns.</span> <span id="s222">Ten miles away from us was a little town, Koralicze, where my husband Joe, was born.</span> <span id="s223">Twenty miles away was Dvoritz, Mir, and Jettel.</span> <span id="s224">Six thousand Jews from out town were gathered with twenty-four thousand Jews from other small towns.</span> <span id="s225">We became thirty thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s226">The Germans gathered us in one suburb where farming families used to live.</span> <span id="s227">The Germans announced.</span> <span id="s228">"You will settled in this place."</span> <span id="s229">The ghetto.</span> <span id="s230">The Germans made some of the Jewish people the leaders.</span> <span id="s231">The Jewish leader had to tell the other Jews what to do.</span> <span id="s232">We organized ourselves, We lived twenty families in one house; one on top of another.</span> <span id="s233">But, we were happy that we were alive.</span> <span id="s234">We couldn't realize what was going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q:When you say that there were a number of leaders in the town, are you talking about the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A:Yes, the Germans made some of the Jewish people leaders.</span> <span id="s237">Nobody wanted to belong, but they didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s238">The Judenrat had a tough job.</span> <span id="s239">Whenever the Germans gave them new orders they needed to make sure they were obeyed.</span> <span id="s240">One Saturday, the Germans came asked for 50 nice looking girls, young girls.</span> <span id="s241">They needed 50 girls to work.</span> <span id="s242">I was among the girls.</span> <span id="s243">All the mothers started to cry.</span> <span id="s244">They didn't want to let the girls go because they knew there was some danger involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q:Do you remember the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A:This was 1941, right after the Germans invaded.</span> <span id="s247">The Germans took the 50 girls to the town square.</span> <span id="s248">Every town had a square where the people used to take walk, usually on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s249">On saturdays all of the Jewish people would walk in the square.</span> <span id="s250">The Germans took us to the square and there was music playing, a whole orchestra.</span> <span id="s251">The Germans had gathered all of the intelligent people together.</span> <span id="s252">There where maybe 100 or 150 doctors, lawyers, professors, and teacher together.</span> <span id="s253">The German shot them as the music was playing.</span> <span id="s254">The blood was running on the square on the stones.</span> <span id="s255">We, the 50 girls, were supposed to wash the blood from the stones.</span> <span id="s256">We put the dead bodies on a wagon.</span> <span id="s257">The heads of the people were hanging off the back of the wagon.</span> <span id="s258">We knew these people.</span> <span id="s259">The music continued to play and we washed the blood off the stones of the square.</span> <span id="s260">The Germans had a ball in the square.</span> <span id="s261">They were dancing in the square.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q:In the selection of these intelligent individuals that you identified, was the Judenrat involved in that selection process?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A:The Germans called out the names.</span> <span id="s264">They said, "Mr. Gurewitz, I want Mr. Gurewitz today."</span> <span id="s265">They knew who the people were.</span> <span id="s266">The Germans had come to them and asked for ten doctors, for twenty lawyers, for teachers.</span> <span id="s267">The Germans gave them an order.</span> <span id="s268">What could they do?</span> <span id="s269">And nobody expected them to be shot.</span> <span id="s270">The Judenrat thought that maybe the Germans were going to give them jobs.</span> <span id="s271">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s272">When the people found out what the Germans did, they got very scared and confused.</span> <span id="s273">Everyday the Germans took us, the young people, out of the ghetto to work.</span> <span id="s274">The Germans gave us bread they gave us food.</span> <span id="s275">Sometimes we could smuggle some food back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s276">We lived like animals but we were alive.</span> <span id="s277">On New Year's Eve, the Germans came to the Judenrat and asked for twenty young, handsome boys.</span> <span id="s278">Among the boys chosen was my brother, my only brother Chonon.</span> <span id="s279">In our ghetto, the water pipes would sometimes freeze.</span> <span id="s280">The Germans were having a ball in the Governors's Mansion that night and they wanted the Jewish boys to keep a fire going under the pipes so that would not freeze and so that they would have water and heat for the party.</span> <span id="s281">The Germans were dancing, eating, and drinking.</span> <span id="s282">Some of them got drunk.</span> <span id="s283">One of the German said, "Let's kill the twenty Jews that are here."</span> <span id="s284">So they went down to where the Jewish boys were and started to shoot at the boys.</span> <span id="s285">The boys fell into the fire.</span> <span id="s286">We found out that the boys were shot right away.</span> <span id="s287">News in the ghetto traveled very fast.</span> <span id="s288">The next day as the Germans were taking us to work my mother ran out of the group to find out if someone was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:Do you remember who came back and told you that this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A:We knew.</span> <span id="s291">Everyone knew that the boys would not come back.</span> <span id="s292">That's why there was crying from the mothers and fathers when the boys were taken.</span> <span id="s293">They cried, "Don't take my son.</span> <span id="s294">He will never come back."</span> <span id="s295">They had a feeling that the boys would not come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q:Did anyone try to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A:Hide?</span> <span id="s298">You could not hide.</span> <span id="s299">The Germans would kill all of the Jews.</span> <span id="s300">It was risky.</span> <span id="s301">If you did not give the Germans what they wanted, they would kill everyone with machine guns.</span> <span id="s302">Would that have been better?</span> <span id="s303">My mother ran out of the ghetto with my father they ran to the Governor's Mansion.</span> <span id="s304">Surrounding the Governor's Mansion were empty houses that had been bombed.</span> <span id="s305">They ran around the back of the houses.</span> <span id="s306">The met a gentile woman who told them, "Don't go.</span> <span id="s307">All the Jewish boys are dead."</span> <span id="s308">But, my mother went in anyway to search.</span> <span id="s309">All of a sudden, my mother heard a cry and screaming, "Oi, oi," and begging for help.</span> <span id="s310">My mother went over and there lying was my brother, burned from the fire, but he was alive.</span> <span id="s311">My mother went running to the Jewish leaders in the ghetto to get help.</span> <span id="s312">They told my mother to get the things that she needed to go to work with.</span> <span id="s313">The Jewish leader that she went to for help wanted to Germans to think that they were on their way back to work.</span> <span id="s314">They then snuck away to the empty house and wrapped my brother in straw and paper and brought him into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s315">He was in terrible pain; we hid him in the attic.</span> <span id="s316">Two days later, the Germans counted the bodies of the boys that had been shot.</span> <span id="s317">One was missing, so they came to the ghetto and said, "Where is the Jew that is missing."</span> <span id="s318">No one answered.</span> <span id="s319">Anyway, without doctors and without medicine my brother became healthy.</span> <span id="s320">He suffered for 6 months but he was alive and healthy and he went back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q:Were there any doctors who could have helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A:Maybe there was one doctor in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s323">The doctors, lawyers, and teachers were murdered in the beginning.</span> <span id="s324">The Germans were afraid that the intellectuals would organize a rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q:When the Germans came and they said one Jew was missing ---</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A:They were looking around the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q:They were looking around?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A:Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s329">The Germans told the Jews in the ghetto that they were going to do something if they did not find the missing boy.</span> <span id="s330">The Germans scared the people, but the Jews were strong and they said, "We don't know where he is."</span> <span id="s331">They looked around in all of the houses, but they would not find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:Was the Judenrat afraid that if they didn't turn in, for example, you brother that ---</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A:They were scared.</span> <span id="s334">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s335">We were all afraid but we took the responsibility.</span> <span id="s336">We said what's going to happen to us is going to happen.</span> <span id="s337">My brother was alive and we went back to work, cleaning the bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q:Inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A:No.</span> <span id="s340">Out of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s341">The German used to come to pick us up.</span> <span id="s342">They only took the young people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s343">We used to go to the bombed house and we had to re-cement the brick, put the glass together, and clean up everything that the fires destroyed.</span> <span id="s344">One morning, when everyone was sleeping the Germans surrounded the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s345">They surrounded us from all sides and they took out four thousand people; mostly the old and sick and those that thought would cause trouble.</span> <span id="s346">They took them three miles from the town to Skredlewo and told the people to dig a grave.</span> <span id="s347">The Germans then killed them, they killed with machine guns.</span> <span id="s348">Four thousand people were gone.</span> <span id="s349">The people left in the ghetto became panicky.</span> <span id="s350">What was going to happen to us?</span> <span id="s351">The Germans were smart.</span> <span id="s352">They knew how to make it so that we would not panic or cause trouble.</span> <span id="s353">The next morning, they gathered the people that were left in the ghetto and said, "We killed the old people, the people that cannot work.</span> <span id="s354">But, you are young so you are going to be protected.</span> <span id="s355">We need you to work, and we're going to give you everything because you are talented people."</span> <span id="s356">Some older people were also left because they had a trade.</span> <span id="s357">My father was left because he was a furrier.</span> <span id="s358">Carpenters were left.</span> <span id="s359">The intelligent people were the first ones that the Germans killed because they were afraid that would form a resistance group.</span> <span id="s360">The Germans said, "We are going to move you from here.</span> <span id="s361">The people who are talented and the people that are capable to work, we have a place for you.</span> <span id="s362">You will get double portions of bread.</span> <span id="s363">You will be treated better.</span> <span id="s364">Everything will be fine.</span> <span id="s365">"We felt happier."</span> <span id="s366">The Germans took us and moved us to a big courthouse (in Polish, it's "the Sud"), like the courthouse in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s367">It was very big, built before the war.</span> <span id="s368">They told us that this was our new town.</span> <span id="s369">They then gathered us in the square near the courthouse and shoved us into a building on the side of the square.</span> <span id="s370">People started to choke.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q:How many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A:It must have been about twelve thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q:Were you together with your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s375">I was together with my whole family -- my father, my mother, my two sisters and my brother.</span> <span id="s376">The Germans came into the building and surrounded us.</span> <span id="s377">They stood there with their white gloves, dresses handsome in their Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s378">They came into the building and said, "You go to the right and you go to the left."</span> <span id="s379">The right as to die and the left was to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q:Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A:We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s382">When the Germans said, "you to the left, you to the right."</span> <span id="s383">I was standing with my father and the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s384">People were crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s385">A German said to us, "You all go to the right."</span> <span id="s386">My mother started to screaming, crying.</span> <span id="s387">I went over to the German and said, "I'm young I want to live.</span> <span id="s388">I want to work.</span> <span id="s389">Leave us on the other side."</span> <span id="s390">He kicked me in the behind with this boot and walked away.</span> <span id="s391">I fell down the stairs of the building.</span> <span id="s392">We could see there ten trucks in the square loaded with people.</span> <span id="s393">The Germans finished leading the people inside and drove them away about two miles from the square.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q:Let me interrupt you just for a second.</span> <span id="s395">When you said they were taking people to the right and to the left.</span> <span id="s396">Was there any pattern that you observed in the selection and in who was going to the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A:He looked at you.</span> <span id="s398">If the German looked at you and liked you, he told you to the left.</span> <span id="s399">If he didn't like you, he told you to the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q:So it was clear to you that going to the right --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A:To the right was going to die and to the left was to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q:That was clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A:People knew.</span> <span id="s404">People in the building were crying.</span> <span id="s405">We saw the trucks and heard the screaming on the trucks.</span> <span id="s406">My father, my mother, my sister, my brother and I were sent into the square.</span> <span id="s407">Before we went, the Germans asked us for our belongings.</span> <span id="s408">There was a pot that you threw everything into.</span> <span id="s409">Rings, jewelry, money.</span> <span id="s410">When we went into the square -- this is unbelievable to understand -- rabbi, young women holding their babies by their breasts, old men and women were all screaming and praying to God.</span> <span id="s411">They were screaming Shema Yisrael and all kinds of prayers.</span> <span id="s412">They knew that the trucks were taking them to their graves.</span> <span id="s413">The Germans took them all and killed them.</span> <span id="s414">My family was next in line to go on the trucks.</span> <span id="s415">It took time to load up the trucks.</span> <span id="s416">There was so much screaming.</span> <span id="s417">A German came over to one of the heads of the Judenrat, he lives now in Israel, and said, "I need 40 furriers.</span> <span id="s418">Give me their families."</span> <span id="s419">The Judenrat started to pick the people who were standing in front of the trucks.</span> <span id="s420">He didn't care if they were furriers or not.</span> <span id="s421">We did not know what he was picking people, so as this was happening, my mother, who was a very smart woman, said: "Kids, run.</span> <span id="s422">You don't have a choice.</span> <span id="s423">It is better to be shot here than to dig your own grave.</span> <span id="s424">Run or we will all be killed.</span> <span id="s425">Run that way, maybe one of us is going to be alive."</span> <span id="s426">My older sister, Esther, ran to the building where the people were.</span> <span id="s427">As we were being rescued, a Polish boy, who was a poor farm boy before the Germans took over, saw my sister run into the building.</span> <span id="s428">He went after her and dragged her out of the building.</span> <span id="s429">We saw her walking to the trucks.</span> <span id="s430">We saw her going to die as we were walking away to live.</span> <span id="s431">She was killed at that time.</span> <span id="s432">It was December, about the 24th, 1941.</span> <span id="s433">It was the first shechitah.</span> <span id="s434">The Germans took away at that time about four thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s435">Small babies, young people, old people, rabbis; everyone went.</span> <span id="s436">I had a friend who had a twin brother.</span> <span id="s437">The Germans told her to stay on the left but she said she wanted to stay with her brother.</span> <span id="s438">So they sent them both to the right.</span> <span id="s439">Most people wanted to go as a family.</span> <span id="s440">The Germans did not care.</span> <span id="s441">They took whole families.</span> <span id="s442">The Germans put us back to work.</span> <span id="s443">They told us that now that all of the bad Jews were away, we were going to get more food and that we would live.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q:Do you have any idea how many Jews were left in the town after that particular day?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A:It was not a town, it was a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q:In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A:In the ghetto, there were maybe two or three thousand Jews left.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q:Out of a total population of approximately thirty thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A:Thirty thousand.</span> <span id="s450">The three thousand Jews that were left were all out to work.</span> <span id="s451">We sewed hats and furs.</span> <span id="s452">The Germans gave us break and we cooked potatoes, so we had food.</span> <span id="s453">We thought we would be all right.</span> <span id="s454">Then they came again.</span> <span id="s455">The Germans surrounded us again.</span> <span id="s456">This time they wanted the small children.</span> <span id="s457">There were about three thousand children, so there must have been a total of about six thousand Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s458">The Germans came at 4:00 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s459">Everyone was sleeping.</span> <span id="s460">They woke us up and said that they were going to take the small children to a kindergarten; a special school just for them.</span> <span id="s461">We knew the children were would not come back.</span> <span id="s462">I can never forget the picture of the mothers and father kneeling on their hands and knees begging the Germans to leave their children alone.</span> <span id="s463">One German stood with his white gloves on and pulled a child away from his mother.</span> <span id="s464">The mother would not let go of his hand.</span> <span id="s465">The Germans shoved her and told her that she could go with her child.</span> <span id="s466">I had an uncle, Chaim Leibowitz, who had two children.</span> <span id="s467">We knew what was going to happen to the children.</span> <span id="s468">We had a storage place that was filled with newspapers.</span> <span id="s469">We took his two children and eight others and hid them, in the back of the papers.</span> <span id="s470">We told the children to be quiet and we kept them hidden for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s471">The Germans took away the other children but those ten behind the newspapers were saved.</span> <span id="s472">The Germans were not satisfied.</span> <span id="s473">They were not happy that maybe some children survived; that the Jews tricked them.</span> <span id="s474">They came back three days later and surrounded the ghetto again.</span> <span id="s475">The brought in big dogs, Germans Shepherds.</span> <span id="s476">The sniffed around until they found the children.</span> <span id="s477">They even found some children that were hidden by their parents in an attic.</span> <span id="s478">The Germans gathered the few children that were left and took them about a mile away.</span> <span id="s479">The Germans did use bullets to kill them because bullets were expensive.</span> <span id="s480">They choke them with some kind of white powder.</span> <span id="s481">The parents cried and screamed.</span> <span id="s482">Can you imagine the crying and screaming of parents?</span> <span id="s483">This was the end of the Jewish children in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s484">My uncle has two children.</span> <span id="s485">A son, 10 years old, and a daughter about eight years old.</span> <span id="s486">He stood with his wife and watched as the Germans killed them.</span> <span id="s487">After the Germans killed the children, the rest of the people in the ghetto started to think about running away.</span> <span id="s488">Some of the people had poison.</span> <span id="s489">One druggist that I knew had poison prepared for him and his wife.</span> <span id="s490">He did not want to wait for a bullet.</span> <span id="s491">Some people ran away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s492">It was not easy because the ghetto was surrounded with wires, high wires and the wires were electric.</span> <span id="s493">If you touched the wire, you were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q:There's only one entrance to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A:There was only once entrance.</span> <span id="s496">The German army stood right in front of it.</span> <span id="s497">We had some contact with the gentile people.</span> <span id="s498">The gentiles came into the ghetto to pick up the things we sewed -- the hate, furs, and shoes.</span> <span id="s499">We would bribe them with some money and they used to bring us back some bread, an onion or potatoes.</span> <span id="s500">A friend of mine, who new lives in Saddle River, New Jersey, had a beautiful sister.</span> <span id="s501">This girl was so beautiful, a Miss America, and so smart.</span> <span id="s502">She ran out of the ghetto with a gentile.</span> <span id="s503">the Germans caught her right away.</span> <span id="s504">the brought her back to the ghetto and they hung he on a tree.</span> <span id="s505">They cut off her breasts.</span> <span id="s506">They pushed in a stick, I can't tell you where, but you know where.</span> <span id="s507">We were all so scared, we could not move.</span> <span id="s508">No one tried to leave the ghetto for a long time after that.</span> <span id="s509">They caught another girl after that.</span> <span id="s510">They killed her too.</span> <span id="s511">I just saw her sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s512">We knew that the Germans were going to kill us all.</span> <span id="s513">We lived day by day.</span> <span id="s514">One day we got together and thought about just opening the ghetto door and running.</span> <span id="s515">Whoever would live would live, and whoever would die would die.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q:Do you remember what date that was?</span> <span id="s517">Not the exact date, but the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A:It was the end of 1942, the beginning of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q:Was somebody in charge of getting everybody together?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A:Yes, there were a couple of boys from the Judenrat who organized things.</span> <span id="s521">One of the mothers, whose son was one of the organizers, started to cry, "What?</span> <span id="s522">You're going to open the doors?</span> <span id="s523">They are going to kill you for organizing this."</span> <span id="s524">The boy was killed anyway.</span> <span id="s525">I don't know if someone told the Germans what was happening or not because one morning they came and arrested all of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s526">Maybe a Jew told them.</span> <span id="s527">Maybe they thought that if they told, they could save themselves.</span> <span id="s528">You can't blame anyone.</span> <span id="s529">It was not a normal time of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q:I'm just going to interrupt.</span> <span id="s531">You said there was a gathering of people that came together to discuss escaping from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A:Not everybody, just the top leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q:Were you there or anybody from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A:My brother was there.</span> <span id="s535">The young leaders felt that we were going to die anyway and that maybe we should try to kill the Germans and run.</span> <span id="s536">It was better to die running than to dig your own grave.</span> <span id="s537">The mother of the boy who was the organizer kept crying and screaming, "I'm going to go to the Germans and I'll tell them you're going to try to escape."</span> <span id="s538">Some families in the ghetto tried to build a hiding place.</span> <span id="s539">We lived in a room with ten other families.</span> <span id="s540">We dug a hole under the floor.</span> <span id="s541">We could not put the dirt outside, so we built a double wall to put the dirt into.</span> <span id="s542">We knew that when the Germans came again, they would take our parents, so we thought that we would hide our parents in the hole under the floor.</span> <span id="s543">We were afraid for our parents.</span> <span id="s544">We knew that the Germans needed workers, so we knew that they would not kill the young ones first.</span> <span id="s545">But you never knew what would happen.</span> <span id="s546">You know why?</span> <span id="s547">The Germans came all of sudden.</span> <span id="s548">They came at 4 o'clock, when everyone was sleeping.</span> <span id="s549">They surrounded us an started yelling.</span> <span id="s550">"Everyone out."</span> <span id="s551">They came into the rooms with dogs and guns and chased us all outside in the backyard.</span> <span id="s552">A girl who now lives in the United States ran into the courthouse and hid inside the toilet.</span> <span id="s553">She sat like that for two or three days.</span> <span id="s554">The Germans started to say you to the right and you to the left.</span> <span id="s555">They loaded the trucks.</span> <span id="s556">Out of thirty thousand Jews, maybe three hundred were caught and shot.</span> <span id="s557">The Germans had plenty of help from our Polish "friends."</span> <span id="s558">They killed us too.</span> <span id="s559">If a Pole found a Jew in the woods, he turned him over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s560">If the Poles had helped us, a lot of Jews would be alive today.</span> <span id="s561">Some Polish people took in Jews, if they could get paid.</span> <span id="s562">But how many of us had money?</span> <span id="s563">My husband, Joe, had run away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s564">He dug a hole in the woods for himself, his sisters, and his brother.</span> <span id="s565">They lived in the hole for two or three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q:When did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A:He did this in 1942.</span> <span id="s568">He dug a hole in the forest.</span> <span id="s569">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s570">He lived like an animal.</span> <span id="s571">During the day he lived in this hole, a grave, and at night, he went out with a gun to get food from the Poles.</span> <span id="s572">We had the hiding place for my parents ready.</span> <span id="s573">The Germans came at 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s574">The older people got confused and didn't have time to go down into the hole we had dug for them.</span> <span id="s575">They took my mother outside.</span> <span id="s576">Again, the Germans said, "Right, left, right left."</span> <span id="s577">They stood there giving their orders with white gloves on.</span> <span id="s578">They were very polite.</span> <span id="s579">These were intelligent learned people.</span> <span id="s580">Before they took my mother outside, she told us, "children, hold on Maybe one of you will be alive.</span> <span id="s581">Maybe one of you will be left.</span> <span id="s582">Hold on together."</span> <span id="s583">My father, brother, sister (Lisa) and I watched through the window of the building as they took my mother away.</span> <span id="s584">They took her.</span> <span id="s585">They took my uncle's wife, my cousin's mother.</span> <span id="s586">We couldn't hide anyone.</span> <span id="s587">There was no time.</span> <span id="s588">We never knew when the Germans would come.</span> <span id="s589">My mother was killed in front of us.</span> <span id="s590">The Germans threw the bodies into a grave that was a half mile from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s591">We saw it with our own eyes.</span> <span id="s592">We screamed and cried.</span> <span id="s593">The Germans shot at us.</span> <span id="s594">This was 1943.</span> <span id="s595">It was the fourth or fifth time that the Germans came to kill us.</span> <span id="s596">They did a good job cleaning us out.</span> <span id="s597">Out of thirty thousand Jews there were now three hundred or three hundred and fifty Jews left in the ghetto of Novogrudok.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q:Before you were talking about the fact that you essentially had experienced five different killings and the last one involved your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s600">They killed my mother and about 2000 other people at that time.</span> <span id="s601">The Germans surrounded us and told us to stay in line because they were to give us bread.</span> <span id="s602">And then again they started, you to the right and you to the left.</span> <span id="s603">It was the same thing over again.</span> <span id="s604">They took away my mother and my aunt.</span> <span id="s605">My uncle, Chaim, started to screaming and crying.</span> <span id="s606">The Germans took him outside and order two Jews to hit him with sticks and they did.</span> <span id="s607">My uncle could not take it anymore.</span> <span id="s608">They Germans had already killed his children and now they were going to kill his wife.</span> <span id="s609">How much can a person take?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q:They were not the Jewish policeman were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A:No, just two Jews.</span> <span id="s612">The Germans stood on either side of the men and watched how they hit my uncle.</span> <span id="s613">Who would think that a Jew would hit another Jew?</span> <span id="s614">Every day someone was punished.</span> <span id="s615">The Germans took everyone out into the courtyard and they selected someone to be beaten.</span> <span id="s616">The rest of us had to stand and watch the beatings.</span> <span id="s617">We watched and cried.</span> <span id="s618">This was the German's way of showing us what would happen if we did not behave.</span> <span id="s619">It was worse if you tried to escape from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s620">My sister-in-law (Yussel) who now lives in Australia went with her husband to the gates of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s621">It was the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s622">They were supposed to meet a Polish man who was going to help them escape.</span> <span id="s623">She got out but her husband was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q:Did they have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A:No not then.</span> <span id="s626">They had two children after the war.</span> <span id="s627">A son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s628">They have four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s629">They were a young couple at the time.</span> <span id="s630">If the Germans caught someone leaving the ghetto, they brought the person back into the ghetto and either shot them or hung them on a tree.</span> <span id="s631">They did this in front of all of us as lesson so that we would behave.</span> <span id="s632">I knew a few people who tried to get out of the ghetto during the day.</span> <span id="s633">The gentiles came into the ghetto every day to bring us work to do.</span> <span id="s634">The Jews tried to sneak out as the gentiles were coming in.</span> <span id="s635">Very few escaped that way.</span> <span id="s636">They were usually caught by either the Germans or the Poles.</span> <span id="s637">Anyone who was caught was brought back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s638">The rest of their family was then called out.</span> <span id="s639">The Germans either shot or hung them, in front of their family or else they killed the whole family in front the of person who tired to escape.</span> <span id="s640">The whole family was punished, if one member of family tried to escape.</span> <span id="s641">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s642">You were responsible for other human beings, because if the Germans caught you, they often killed others too.</span> <span id="s643">So we were locked in.</span> <span id="s644">Two hundred and fifty of us were left in a the ghetto of 30,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q:So you were with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A:I was with my father, sister, and brother.</span> <span id="s647">My mother, Hinda, and my older sister, Esther, had been killed.</span> <span id="s648">Out of thirty thousand Jews, maybe a thousand had escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s649">Some ran into the woods, other were hidden by Poles.</span> <span id="s650">A few of the Polish farmers would hide Jews for money.</span> <span id="s651">But, who had money?</span> <span id="s652">In our neighborhood not too many Poles felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s653">But sometimes, if they knew you and you could convince them, they helped you out by hiding you overnight.</span> <span id="s654">We heard that Jews who were in the woods were not starving and that they were getting along.</span> <span id="s655">We could not imagine how you could live thought the winter in the woods with the snow and the cold and the wet weather, but we decided that anything was better than staying here waiting for a bullet.</span> <span id="s656">So we organized a group and decided to build a tunnel.</span> <span id="s657">There were 70 young boys left in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s658">There were also three or four elderly people left and the rest of us were young girls, like me.</span> <span id="s659">My father was one of the elderly people left.</span> <span id="s660">He was about 50 or 55 years old at the time and he just died last year.</span> <span id="s661">Anyway, the 70 young boys started to dig a tunnel and everyone helped them as much as they could.</span> <span id="s662">We did know what to do with the dirt, so we piled it up between the walls and under our beds.</span> <span id="s663">We dug this tunnel for three months.</span> <span id="s664">It was very small and you had to crawl on your hands and knees to get though it.</span> <span id="s665">One night we decided it was time to get out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q:All the digging was done during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A:During the night.</span> <span id="s668">In the daytime, we went to work.</span> <span id="s669">The Germans used the Jews to scrub the floors, to make shoes, to make clothing.</span> <span id="s670">It was like a factory.</span> <span id="s671">The Germans brought the work into the ghetto in the morning and then they used to pick it up at night.</span> <span id="s672">The Germans were always around us, so we could not do any digging during the day.</span> <span id="s673">It was decided that the elderly people would be the last one out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s674">We were afraid that if one of them had a heart attack or got sick in the middle of tunnel, everyone else would get stuck inside.</span> <span id="s675">The seventy young boys would go out first.</span> <span id="s676">My brother, Chonon, was one of them.</span> <span id="s677">We found out that a Jewish boy who was from my husband's town, Koralicze, didn't like the idea of us leaving the ghetto.</span> <span id="s678">He started to say, "Why are you doing this.</span> <span id="s679">It is going to be worse if you run away.</span> <span id="s680">They are going to catch you and kill us all."</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q:How old was this boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A:He was young.</span> <span id="s683">Some of the boys who dug the tunnel choked him to death because they were afraid he was going to tell the Germans what was going on in the ghetto so that they would let him live.</span> <span id="s684">The Germans would have killed him anyway.</span> <span id="s685">The instinct to live made people do anything and everything.</span> <span id="s686">The boys took him into the tunnel and choked him</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q:How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A:He was about 17 or 18, maybe 19.</span> <span id="s689">The Germans were suspicious.</span> <span id="s690">They knew something was going on.</span> <span id="s691">They often convinced other Jews to tell them what was going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s692">They promised them all sorts of things for information.</span> <span id="s693">We could not risk anybody asking questions.</span> <span id="s694">To get out of this tunnel, you needed to be very careful.</span> <span id="s695">The Germans were around us all of the time.</span> <span id="s696">After the boy was killed we decided it was time to escape.</span> <span id="s697">We waited for an evening when there would be thunder and heavy rain.</span> <span id="s698">One of the boys went up to the room of the house where we all were and pulled some tin off the roof so that there would be a banging noise.</span> <span id="s699">We wanted noise so that the Germans could not hear us as we crawled into the tunnel.</span> <span id="s700">The boys had asked me and my sister to go out of the tunnel with them.</span> <span id="s701">We were young and healthy, we had helped build the tunnel and they wanted us to be one of the first ones out.</span> <span id="s702">But we decided to stay with our father in the back of the line.</span> <span id="s703">We wanted to stay with him.</span> <span id="s704">We felt that whatever happened to my father, would also happen to us.</span> <span id="s705">It was risky.</span> <span id="s706">If the first ones got out of the tunnel and the Germans found out that they escaped, they would come into the tunnel and shoot the rest of us.</span> <span id="s707">We were prepared to die.</span> <span id="s708">It was thundering.</span> <span id="s709">It was pouring so hard, you not see in front of you.</span> <span id="s710">We had a long rope that each of us held on to and we lined up to go out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s711">We hoped the rope would keep us all together.</span> <span id="s712">We were in groups and in each group there was a person who knew which way to run when we got out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s713">We thought we would all be together in the forest.</span> <span id="s714">But the willpower to live is so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q:Was there one particular person who was the leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A:We all helped, the boys and the girls.</span> <span id="s717">The 70 boys were supposed to go out of the tunnel first and rest of us were supposed to follow them.</span> <span id="s718">But oh what happened to us!</span> <span id="s719">It was dark.</span> <span id="s720">It was pouring and thundering.</span> <span id="s721">The boys got out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s722">They became confused and started to run in different directions.</span> <span id="s723">Maybe it was the excitement of freedom or the instinct of survival that made them run off instead of staying together.</span> <span id="s724">They lost one another.</span> <span id="s725">When my father, sister, and I got out of the tunnel, we did not know where to go.</span> <span id="s726">We followed a Jewish farmer boy who knew the way to the farms in the area.</span> <span id="s727">He also knew a lot of the gentiles who owned the farms.</span> <span id="s728">He was our angel.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q:The original plan was for everybody to hold onto the rope when you came out?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s731">But what happened was that once you got out of the tunnel, you could not think and you lost control of your senses.</span> <span id="s732">Nobody was thinking about what was going to happen next.</span> <span id="s733">They were happy to be out.</span> <span id="s734">Everybody just wanted to run to safety.</span> <span id="s735">A cousin of mine (Shaul Gorodinski) who died last year of a heart attack, escaped with the group of 70 boys.</span> <span id="s736">We heard that when the Germans came into the ghetto the next day, and realized that the Jews had escaped, they brought in an army and threw bombs on the house and into the tunnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q:Do you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A:It was the fall of 1943.</span> <span id="s739">I was in the woods for nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q:How did you know what happened in town when the Germans came to the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A:The Poles told us later on.</span> <span id="s742">The 70 boys who built the tunnel were wandering around the forest near town.</span> <span id="s743">They did not know where to go, they were lost.</span> <span id="s744">The next day the Germans caught them all and killed them in the square of the town.</span> <span id="s745">They never were rescued.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q:So the only people who actually got out of the tunnel were the 70 boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A:No, we all got out.</span> <span id="s748">All 250 of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q:Everybody got out of the tunnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A:Everybody got out.</span> <span id="s751">The Germans caught and killed almost all of the 70 boys who built the tunnel.</span> <span id="s752">Maybe two or three survived.</span> <span id="s753">The Germans were mad that they Jews had outsmarted them.</span> <span id="s754">An army came to the ghetto and bombed it.</span> <span id="s755">They were afraid to go into the tunnel so they bombed that too.</span> <span id="s756">Everyone ran out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s757">All 250 people.</span> <span id="s758">It was dark and raining.</span> <span id="s759">We picked such a night on purpose.</span> <span id="s760">We all got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q:That night was spent outside in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A:That night we ran and ran.</span> <span id="s763">We ran in different directions into the woods.</span> <span id="s764">No one stayed in the town.</span> <span id="s765">The plan was that we would all be together.</span> <span id="s766">But what happened was that once people got out of the tunnel and they saw freedom they became panicky and ran.</span> <span id="s767">They did not wait for the rest of us to come out.</span> <span id="s768">Whoever got out let go of the rope and ran.</span> <span id="s769">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s770">In front of my father, sister, and me was a farmer boy.</span> <span id="s771">He also started to run, but I grabbed his pants and I said, "You're not going without us.</span> <span id="s772">We will live together or we will die together."</span> <span id="s773">He started to cry.</span> <span id="s774">"What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s775">I have a gentile woman who wants to take me in.</span> <span id="s776">If she sees us all, she'll call the Germans and we'll all die."</span> <span id="s777">I said, "She'll call the Germans and we'll die together."</span> <span id="s778">He was a good boy and he took pity on us.</span> <span id="s779">It is on account of him that I am here today.</span> <span id="s780">I wish I knew where he went after the war.</span> <span id="s781">I would help him in any way I could.</span> <span id="s782">He was young and scared but be took us with him.</span> <span id="s783">As I was holding on to him, my father started to scream.</span> <span id="s784">"I cannot breathe."</span> <span id="s785">I took some water from a puddle and gave it to him to drink.</span> <span id="s786">I put one hand on the farm boy.</span> <span id="s787">My sister Lisa, took my father under one arm and I took his other arm and the four of walked and walked until we reached a Polish house.</span> <span id="s788">the woman opened the door and recognized us immediately.</span> <span id="s789">"Ah, Kushner, you had the fur stores.</span> <span id="s790">I'll give you some bread, water, and onions, but you cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s791">You must go."</span> <span id="s792">She was scared the Germans would kill her if she hid Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q:How far was this from town?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A:This was maybe five miles from town.</span> <span id="s795">That night we dragged my father for five miles.</span> <span id="s796">He kept on fainting, we kept on walking.</span> <span id="s797">The Polish woman gave us an onion and some water and we moved on.</span> <span id="s798">The next day we hear that the Germans came to this woman's house and found some of the Jews that she had hidden.</span> <span id="s799">They killed her, her husband, and the Jews.</span> <span id="s800">She had hidden seven or eight Jews.</span> <span id="s801">Everyone was killed.</span> <span id="s802">After we left the Polish wan, we started to walk slowly into the woods.</span> <span id="s803">We hid in the bushes for ten days.</span> <span id="s804">From Rosh Hashana to Yom Kippur we sat under bushes in the woods.</span> <span id="s805">The farmer boy was with us the whole time.</span> <span id="s806">He never left us.</span> <span id="s807">For ten days we sat under the bushes.</span> <span id="s808">There was a pouring rain the whole time.</span> <span id="s809">It was as if God was crying for us.</span> <span id="s810">We were soaked.</span> <span id="s811">We were wet.</span> <span id="s812">We had no food.</span> <span id="s813">Through the bushes we could see Polish boys feeding the cows.</span> <span id="s814">We could see people walking around free, while we say like animals in the bushes.</span> <span id="s815">My younger sister, Lisa, was about 15 at the time.</span> <span id="s816">She said, "What kind of life is this?</span> <span id="s817">Let them kill us already.</span> <span id="s818">How long can we sit like this?"</span> <span id="s819">We saw a light on in a farm house.</span> <span id="s820">We left my father sitting in the bushes, and my sister, the farm boy and I went in the middle of the night to the farm.</span> <span id="s821">We wanted to ask for a piece of bread to eat.</span> <span id="s822">We knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s823">The big farmer saw us.</span> <span id="s824">He came out carrying a big stick and by his die were two big dogs.</span> <span id="s825">The dogs and the farmer started to run after us.</span> <span id="s826">I ran away.</span> <span id="s827">The farm boy ran away.</span> <span id="s828">But, he caught my sister.</span> <span id="s829">The farmer knocked her over her head and shoulders with the stick.</span> <span id="s830">We grabbed her and ran back into the bushes.</span> <span id="s831">We could not live in the bushes forever.</span> <span id="s832">We were already there for ten days--from Rosh Hashana to Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s833">Se we went to another little farm.</span> <span id="s834">The woman there knew the farm boy.</span> <span id="s835">She was a nice woman.</span> <span id="s836">She gave us something to eat and let us sleep in the barn for two nights.</span> <span id="s837">She brought us potatoes and buttermilk.</span> <span id="s838">She was afraid to keep us longer.</span> <span id="s839">We left there and headed further to find other farmers who would maybe help us.</span> <span id="s840">We knew that Jews were hiding in the woods and we knew that their leader was a man named Tuvia Bielski.</span> <span id="s841">Tuvia had a gathering of Jewish people in the woods.</span> <span id="s842">He had heard that people had run away from the ghetto, and he sent some of his men to search for any survivors.</span> <span id="s843">His mean had guns and ammunition had they went from farm to farm searching for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q:You mentioned before that the Germans had caught most of the boys who had gone out through the tunnel.</span> <span id="s845">Did you get that information then at the time or you found this out later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A:No.</span> <span id="s847">We looked for the boys after we got out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s848">We couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s849">Everybody had run in different directions.</span> <span id="s850">Later we found out from some Polish people that the boys had been caught.</span> <span id="s851">Two went to Israel.</span> <span id="s852">One was killed in the 1956 Israeli war and the other, my cousin Shaul, died later years at the age of 54 from a heart attack.</span> <span id="s853">My cousin was supposed to stay with my brother after they out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s854">They got separated.</span> <span id="s855">Anyway, we stayed with the Polish woman for two days.</span> <span id="s856">We left and went on to another bunch of farms.</span> <span id="s857">Houses were two or three miles apart from one another.</span> <span id="s858">Went to a gentile who we knew form before the war.</span> <span id="s859">He recognized us and said, "Listen, I'll do everything I can for you, but you cannot stay with me."</span> <span id="s860">He was already hiding other Jews.</span> <span id="s861">Somehow Bielski's men knew that there were Jews at this farm because the wagons with the Jewish men came for us.</span> <span id="s862">We saw the wagons and at first got scared.</span> <span id="s863">We thought the Germans had found us.</span> <span id="s864">We cried tears of joy when we realized that the men were Jews.</span> <span id="s865">The men loaded us and the other Jews that the farmer had hid and took us into the woods.</span> <span id="s866">In the woods, it looked like graves.</span> <span id="s867">The Jews had dug themselves pits underground to live in.</span> <span id="s868">The boys would go out at night and bring back food.</span> <span id="s869">They did this by going to Gentile farms and threatening them with guns.</span> <span id="s870">The boys would bring back some meat, potatoes, onions, and bread.</span> <span id="s871">We had enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q:How many people were living together in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A:There were about 1000 or 1100 people in the woods.</span> <span id="s874">We settled down.</span> <span id="s875">Some people collected woods for the fire, while others did other jobs.</span> <span id="s876">Mostly, we watched the grounds.</span> <span id="s877">Some young boys would patrol the area on horses.</span> <span id="s878">They would watch out for other Germans and the Poles.</span> <span id="s879">We were afraid if the Germans did not kill us the Polish would.</span> <span id="s880">We were in the woods for about nine months.</span> <span id="s881">Some people were there for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q:Your sister was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A:My sister Lisa and my father.</span> <span id="s884">My brother was lost.</span> <span id="s885">We did not know if he was dead or alive.</span> <span id="s886">We could not fund him after we escaped from the tunnel.</span> <span id="s887">After the war, we went back to out town to look for him, but we never found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q:Do you remember the dates that you were in the woods together with these others?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A:We went in 1943.</span> <span id="s890">This was in the fall and we went home nine moths later in May.</span> <span id="s891">Even in the woods we lived in fear.</span> <span id="s892">The Germans knew Jewish people were hiding in the woods, and they sent airplanes to bombs us.</span> <span id="s893">We moved around a lot.</span> <span id="s894">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s895">But, it was better than the ghetto and we survived.</span> <span id="s896">In 1944, in May , Tuvia Bielski brought us out of the woods.</span> <span id="s897">He brought out 1100 Jews.</span> <span id="s898">When the Germans started to lose the war, the woods became an even more dangerous place to be.</span> <span id="s899">The Germans started to hide in the woods.</span> <span id="s900">They were trying to hide from the Russians.</span> <span id="s901">The German soldiers ran away from the army and, even without orders from the SS, they still tried to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s902">They killed eleven Jews moments before were liberated.</span> <span id="s903">Some of the boys caught three Germans and killed them.</span> <span id="s904">They beat them to death.</span> <span id="s905">They could no longer hold in their anger and it was as if they went mad.</span> <span id="s906">Later, the Russians came and occupied us.</span> <span id="s907">The Russians took all of the sick and elderly and out them in wagons and took them back to the town where we had lived.</span> <span id="s908">We met some Polish gentiles, they were surprised we were alive.</span> <span id="s909">A few even put out their hands and said, "Thank God you are alive."</span> <span id="s910">One asked my father about my mother.</span> <span id="s911">We came back to our town.</span> <span id="s912">We were very heart broken.</span> <span id="s913">We were crying.</span> <span id="s914">How many of us were left?</span> <span id="s915">From 30,000 Jews brought to the ghetto in Novogrudok, maybe 1000 or 1,100 were left.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q:Did you actually feel that you were liberated, that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A:The war was over, but we were not liberated.</span> <span id="s918">The Russians occupied our little town and started to mobilize the Jewish boys for their army.</span> <span id="s919">We want through the concentration camps, we went through the Holocaust, we suffered so much and now Russians started to mobilize Jewish boys to fight against Germany.</span> <span id="s920">And what happened?</span> <span id="s921">The Russians became our bosses.</span> <span id="s922">Some of boys who did not want to go to the army said that they wanted to become Rabbis but the Russians did not let them go so easily because they did not trust the Jews.</span> <span id="s923">Some of the men became fireman and others worked in the jail so that they would have to go into the army.</span> <span id="s924">However, some of the boys did want to fight the German.</span> <span id="s925">They wanted to fight for their dead mothers, father, sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s926">Maybe 200 boys willing went to the army.</span> <span id="s927">Tuvia's brother went to the army and he was killed.</span> <span id="s928">Many of Jewish boys were killed.</span> <span id="s929">About 750 Jewish people remained in our town.</span> <span id="s930">We started to go on with our lives.</span> <span id="s931">The first thing we did was to tend the graves.</span> <span id="s932">You cannot imagine what it felt like to go over to the grave where my mother was buried, to the other grave where 4,000 innocent men, women and children were buried.</span> <span id="s933">All killed just because they were Jewish I fainted twice.</span> <span id="s934">To see this, I cannot tell you what I felt.</span> <span id="s935">We all wanted run away.</span> <span id="s936">We wanted to run any place but Russia was in charge now and we were afraid.</span> <span id="s937">We could not go anywhere without a passport.</span> <span id="s938">Some people forged passports and ran away.</span> <span id="s939">But there really was nowhere to run.</span> <span id="s940">Nobody wanted to take us in.</span> <span id="s941">A group of us organized a committee that was going to try to get paper to get us in Palestine.</span> <span id="s942">We went to an underground organization that had helped other Jews smuggle out to Palestine.</span> <span id="s943">They sent two men to help us plan our escape.</span> <span id="s944">After 9 months of planning, everyone except for three people went to the train station.</span> <span id="s945">We told the Russian soldiers that we were boarding the train to Czechoslovakia because we wanted to go to fight in the Russian army against the Germans.</span> <span id="s946">They let us get on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q:These two people who came were from an agency you said?</span> <span id="s948">Do you know which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A:I think it was from Israel.</span> <span id="s950">I think it was organized by some of the Jewish leaders, but I am not really sure.</span> <span id="s951">It was well organized.</span> <span id="s952">They told us to go to the trains and not to say they we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s953">We were to say were Greeks or Italians going to fight the war.</span> <span id="s954">The Russians believed us and we left to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q:You were in town for approximately a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A:Yes, for about a year.</span> <span id="s957">We had troubles there too.</span> <span id="s958">The Russians would arrest Jews for trying to do some business.</span> <span id="s959">Many were given a jail sentence of seven years because they tired to buy sugar and salt.</span> <span id="s960">These people were later rescued.</span> <span id="s961">We were so broken.</span> <span id="s962">The Germans tried to kill us all and then Russians did not let us live either.</span> <span id="s963">The was our liberation.</span> <span id="s964">It wasn't until we settled in Italy that we really felt some sort of peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q:And how did you come to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A:We got off the train in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s967">The borders were all closed to us.</span> <span id="s968">So we got off the train and hid until it was dark.</span> <span id="s969">We then walked into the hills and smuggled through the borders.</span> <span id="s970">We would walk all night long and rest during the day.</span> <span id="s971">We walked from Czechoslovakia to Austria and then to Hungary.</span> <span id="s972">I met my husband in Hungary and we got married.</span> <span id="s973">We then crossed the border again to Italy.</span> <span id="s974">We did this all on foot, all in the middle of the night so that no one would see us.</span> <span id="s975">We came to Italy where there were two Displaced Persons camps.</span> <span id="s976">One was in Cremona and the other one was in Ladispoll.</span> <span id="s977">We were put up in Cremona where we waited for three and a half years before getting papers for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q:You were with your sister and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A:With my sister, father, and husband.</span> <span id="s980">I got married on the way.</span> <span id="s981">I knew my husband, Joe, before the war.</span> <span id="s982">He had lived in a small town near mine.</span> <span id="s983">When we met again we decided to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q:You know him before?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes, We got married in a shul in Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span id="s986">The rabbi married twenty couples at the same time.</span> <span id="s987">Single boys and girls wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s988">We were all lost.</span> <span id="s989">We did not know where we were going or what we were going to do.</span> <span id="s990">The war left most of us alone.</span> <span id="s991">From my town, not one family was left intact.</span> <span id="s992">Everyone of us had lost someone.</span> <span id="s993">The largest family that survived was a mother, father, and three children.</span> <span id="s994">But they also had a daughter who was killed.</span> <span id="s995">The day after got married, we smuggled ourselves over the border into Italy.</span> <span id="s996">This was our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s997">In Italy we sat in a Displaced Persons camp.</span> <span id="s998">It was like being in the ghetto again.</span> <span id="s999">We were three for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s1000">My oldest daughter, Linda, was born there .</span> <span id="s1001">she is now 46 and us married.</span> <span id="s1002">She has four children.</span> <span id="s1003">We wanted to go to Africa, to Australia, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1004">We would go anywhere where we could live in freedom but nobody wanted us.</span> <span id="s1005">Nobody opened their doors to us.</span> <span id="s1006">Nobody wanted to take us in.</span> <span id="s1007">So for three and a half years, we waited until we finally got a visa to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1008">We had family here; my father had a sister, Leah Gross and a cousin, Max Haberman, who sponsored us.</span> <span id="s1009">They were fine people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q:How many people were this Displaced Persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A:There were a few a Displaced Persons camps.</span> <span id="s1012">In ours there were about 600 people.</span> <span id="s1013">We were in Cremona, but in Ladispoll where there was another camp, it was different.</span> <span id="s1014">Our camp had three or four families living together in one room and we all shared on kitchen.</span> <span id="s1015">We lived like this for three and half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q:Once you got married were you separated from your father and from your sister</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A:No.</span> <span id="s1018">We went together.</span> <span id="s1019">We were never separated.</span> <span id="s1020">But we never found our brother.</span> <span id="s1021">Never.</span> <span id="s1022">We never really knew for sure if he was dead, so we kept on looking for him, hoping that he somehow survived after he got out of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1023">We thought that maybe he had been caught by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1024">We came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q:How did you finally come to the United States?</span> <span id="s1026">You were in the Displaced Persons camp until what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A:In 1949 we came to the United States and we came because cousins of our sent us papers.</span> <span id="s1028">the HIAS helped us a lot in the Displaced Persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q:How did they help you in the Displaced Persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A:In the camps they brought us food.</span> <span id="s1031">We couldn't work there because we were not citizens.</span> <span id="s1032">You could sell and buy things.</span> <span id="s1033">But, you could not work to make money, so how much could we buy or sell?</span> <span id="s1034">In 1949, we got papers, then the visa came for us to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1035">The HIAS organization asked us if we wanted to go though them or by ourselves.</span> <span id="s1036">We did not need their help, but they offered.</span> <span id="s1037">We didn't really need our cousins' help either.</span> <span id="s1038">We were young and able to work.</span> <span id="s1039">My husband was 26, I was 24.</span> <span id="s1040">My father was 55 and my sister was 20.</span> <span id="s1041">We all planned to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q:You came to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A:New York.</span> <span id="s1044">We rented a furnished room and we moved in there.</span> <span id="s1045">I watched my daughter, cooked and cleaned.</span> <span id="s1046">My husband, father, and sister went to work.</span> <span id="s1047">Later, we got an apartment in Brooklyn on St. John's Place, near Eastern Parkway.</span> <span id="s1048">Our cousins helped us in the beginning to get settled, but once everyone went to work we stood on our own two feet.</span> <span id="s1049">Our second child, a son, Murray was born.</span> <span id="s1050">We then had two more children, another son, Charles, and daughter, Esther.</span> <span id="s1051">Linda is named after my mother, Hinda, and my husband's mother, Chana.</span> <span id="s1052">Murray is named after my husband's father, Moishe.</span> <span id="s1053">Charles is named after my brother, Chonon, and Esther is named after my sister Esther.</span> <span id="s1054">They are all educated.</span> <span id="s1055">They all finished college and the boys finished law school.</span> <span id="s1056">My husband started his business thirty years ago.</span> <span id="s1057">Thank God we were successful and could provide for ourselves and our children.</span> <span id="s1058">American was very good to us.</span> <span id="s1059">We love America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q:How did you happen to come to New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A:Well, my husband worked in New Jersey and he used to travel from New York, so we decided to move.</span> <span id="s1062">We brought up our children in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1063">We gave our hearts and soul to the children.</span> <span id="s1064">We shared all our sorrow with them.</span> <span id="s1065">We shared all our happiness with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q:Did you talk to your children while they were growing up about what had happened to you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A:Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1068">They knew everything and they tell their children also.</span> <span id="s1069">My granddaughter who is now at N.Y.U. has read many books on the Holocaust an she is active in some organizations.</span> <span id="s1070">I just want to say that maybe of we had the State of Israel, so many people would not have been killed.</span> <span id="s1071">Maybe they could have saved a million or two million people.</span> <span id="s1072">Maybe the while madness would not have happened if we had a place to go.</span> <span id="s1073">The Ukrainians had a place to go; the Polacks had a place to go.</span> <span id="s1074">How many Polacks and Germans escaped after the war to Brazil, the United States, Australia, and Argentina?</span> <span id="s1075">For the Jews, the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s1076">We never understood that.</span> <span id="s1077">Even President Roosevelt kept the doors closed.</span> <span id="s1078">Why?</span> <span id="s1079">The boat, St. Louis, was turned back.</span> <span id="s1080">What was the world afraid of?</span> <span id="s1081">I don't understand.</span> <span id="s1082">Thank God, now we live normal lives with our family and friends.</span> <span id="s1083">But, this question always stays on my mind.</span> <span id="s1084">At a party, the Europeans always drift to one another.</span> <span id="s1085">We always ask one another, where were you, where did you live, how did you get out?</span> <span id="s1086">Somehow the conversation always leads to the concentration camps and the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1087">Our children lived a little bit of our lives.</span> <span id="s1088">I don't know if it is so healthy for them, because our kids are more serious than American children.</span> <span id="s1089">It unbelievable that we had the strength to survive such a fire.</span> <span id="s1090">Nobody believed that we ever get married, have children, and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1091">When a European has a simcha, we all rejoice.</span> <span id="s1092">We live our lost youth though our children.</span> <span id="s1093">We had no youth, our early years were spent hiding.</span> <span id="s1094">Our middle years were spent rebuilding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q:What were your feelings when you came to the United States?</span> <span id="s1096">All of a sudden you're in the United States.</span> <span id="s1097">How long was the trip to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A:We came on a boat, a Polish boat.</span> <span id="s1099">It took three or four weeks to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q:Did you feel secure at that time?</span> <span id="s1101">Did you feel that in fact your life was not in danger anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A:We felt relief.</span> <span id="s1103">We were depressed in the Displaced Persons camp.</span> <span id="s1104">After going through what we did we thought that the world would greet us with open hands.</span> <span id="s1105">Instead, we were put in another ghetto.</span> <span id="s1106">Going to America was the start of a new life.</span> <span id="s1107">We did not feel secure because we did not know what was ahead of is.</span> <span id="s1108">But, it has to be a better than what we came from.</span> <span id="s1109">All I can tell you is that we as Jews must do all we can for the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s1110">We must have a country of our own, a homeland for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q:Have you ever gone back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A:I will never go there.</span> <span id="s1113">A friend of mine from Saddle River went back to our town.</span> <span id="s1114">She brought back pictures of the graves.</span> <span id="s1115">What is left to see?</span> <span id="s1116">Broken grave markers and two Jews who take care of the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q:Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1118">We were talking about this a little before.</span> <span id="s1119">Many of the survivors are beginning to tell the stories, to recount their experiences.</span> <span id="s1120">Fifteen years ago, ten years ago, people were not talking about their experiences.</span> <span id="s1121">Can you explain why there is more of a desire now to relate the experiences that people went through in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A:We couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s1123">We were choked.</span> <span id="s1124">We could not think about this.</span> <span id="s1125">We tried not to think about it.</span> <span id="s1126">We came to a new country, we were raising our children and worrying about how to make a living.</span> <span id="s1127">We wanted to establish normal lives and leave the horrors behind us.</span> <span id="s1128">Now, we are ready to talk and we realize that if we don't tell our story and establish something to commemorate what happened it will be lost.</span> <span id="s1129">There is a society meeting from my town once a year and every year that I go there are fewer people there.</span> <span id="s1130">We are slowly dying out and it is our obligation that our stories be told.</span> <span id="s1131">History should record what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1132">People should know what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1133">If we don't tell the story now, who knows what people will say in twenty years.</span> <span id="s1134">Maybe they will say it never happened.</span> <span id="s1135">Now that we still have the strength and we have the power, we have to make sure that the world does not forget.</span> <span id="s1136">Governments have to make sure that another Hitler does not rise to power.</span> <span id="s1137">Protestants, Catholics, and even Polacks and Germans should not be killed because of their religion.</span> <span id="s1138">Blacks should not be killed because of the color of their skin.</span> <span id="s1139">We are all people.</span> <span id="s1140">I tell my children this.</span> <span id="s1141">It hurts when I see Nazis marching with swastikas in front of the White House or see the Ku Klux Klan parade.</span> <span id="s1142">It is scary and it is painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q:Do you ever think about where the Jewish community was in the United States?</span> <span id="s1144">Whether the Jewish community could have done more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A:We felt that they did not do enough.</span> <span id="s1146">Maybe they couldn't do more.</span> <span id="s1147">I know there were delegations to the president.</span> <span id="s1148">If Americans had bombed the gas chambers, it could have been better.</span> <span id="s1149">That way even some Jews were killed, maybe others would have been saved.</span> <span id="s1150">Awhile ago I went to a show in New York With my husband.</span> <span id="s1151">Someone tapped him on the back and said, "are you Joe?"</span> <span id="s1152">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1153">The man asked my husband if he recognized him.</span> <span id="s1154">My husband said, "No."</span> <span id="s1155">The man then reminded my husband that he was the first person he saw when he got out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1156">He weighed 60 pounds at the time and was shivering.</span> <span id="s1157">My husband gave him a zloty and told him to shave and buy a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1158">He never forgot my husband.</span> <span id="s1159">He now lives in Long Island, has a son and two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1160">Our life is a miracle.</span> <span id="s1161">We survived the camps, the ghettos, and the woods.</span> <span id="s1162">It is a miracle that we lived to became normal people.</span> <span id="s1163">Our lives are miracles, our children and grandchildren are miracles.</span> <span id="s1164">We never dreamed that out of the ashes and rubble, we would survive to lead normal lives and see and build the next generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">USHMM Archives RG-50.002*0015 page \* arabic1</span></p></body></html>
