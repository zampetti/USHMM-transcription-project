id="s2">JF: Can you please tell me where you were born, and when, and a little bit about your family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">HG: My maiden name was Henia Flint.</span> <span id="s4">I was born in the city of Lodz in Poland, which had 600,000 population; 300,000 Jews; 200,000 Poles, and 100,000 Germans.</span> <span id="s5">The Jews consisted of basically three classes: the very assimilated class of doctors, lawyers, professionals who did not want to have much to do with the Jewish culture or Jewish language; they were highly assimilated and very seldom mingled with the other two classes.</span> <span id="s6">The second class consisted of merchants, apartment house owners, well-to-do people, middle class people, mostly a large group of Orthodox Jewry which had their own laws, and a rabbi, and like a community center which ruled their lives.</span> <span id="s7">They experienced great antisemitism in the form, sometimes of a pogrom.</span> <span id="s8">In the little town of Przytyk was a very famous pogrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">JF: Can you spell that for me please?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">HG: P-R-Z-Y-T-Y-K.</span> <span id="s11">The third class was the most tragic class.</span> <span id="s12">They were called the working class, and also called chalupnik [home manufacturing].</span> <span id="s13">Chalupnik is a family, sometimes wife, husband, five to six children in one room with a little bench for shoemaking or a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s14">The wages of these families were, in comparison with today, would be about $15 a week or less.</span> <span id="s15">I had visited this part of our town at a young age, 15-16, not just for curiosity, but I was always involved in studying social problems, and I have seen a family living in that one room where for dinner a pot of carrots was served, and if one child dared to take one of those carrots, he got a spanking.</span> <span id="s16">But, what impressed me the most, this was on Friday night, as poor as they were, the mother washed these kids, put on a patched-up little dress, made them nice little braids with a piece of ribbon, and sent them off to the synagogue with their father.</span> <span id="s17">There was no case of juvenile delinquency between these most poor people.</span> <span id="s18">No Medicare, no Medicaid, no Social Security, no welfare--many of them died quietly.</span> <span id="s19">Many children died from hunger, disease.</span> <span id="s20">That picture stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s21">I did blame some of the more wealthier Jews that there was very little charity in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">JF: Was there a kehillah?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">HG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: That governed all three of the groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s26">But they were sort of helpless in a country which was basically antisemitic from both sides.</span> <span id="s27">Now, there are two kinds of antisemitism: one which comes from the top from the government with orders, and the other one which is deeply imbedded in ignorant people who are taught by the Catholic church and their schools that the Jews have killed their God.</span> <span id="s28">I came across that antisemitism at a very very early age.</span> <span id="s29">Because I was very musical, I liked to go at Easter to the Church, and there was sitting a woman with a seven-year old daughter, and I was sitting next to her and I heard her say to the child, "You see over there our God lying.</span> <span id="s30">The Jews have killed him and don't you forget that."</span> <span id="s31">I turned around to her and I said, "You should be ashamed of yourself because that is not what Jesus Christ has taught."</span> <span id="s32">And she said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s33">And I went out.</span> <span id="s34">That means that I was exposed to the antisemitism at a very early age.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">JF: Which group was your family a part of, of the three that you described?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">HG: Poor Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s37">My father was employed by the kehillah.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">JF: In what capacity?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">HG: He took care of the kashrut, of the ritual killing of the animals; in other words, he was an Orthodox Jew, but very enlightened.</span> <span id="s40">I must admit I have experienced a very unusual fact that the Orthodox Jewry, since my father was a member of the kehillah, did not permit him to buy me a piano.</span> <span id="s41">Because I was very talented and at an early age, my father recognized that I should take piano lessons, but the Orthodox Jews felt that if I will have a piano I will have boys and girls coming in, sing and dance, and my father, as poor as he was, we had to rent a room to put in the piano.</span> <span id="s42">And I had to go for many years, before I got the piano, to practice to other people.</span> <span id="s43">My father could never attend a concert.</span> <span id="s44">And that made me apprehensive and not favorable to the Orthodox Jewry, I must admit.</span> <span id="s45">At a very early age, at the age of 12, I dared to tell my father that I don't believe in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">JF: What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">HG: My mother came from a very aristocratic Jewish family in Lodz.</span> <span id="s48">They were the first settlers in the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s49">One of them, by the name Zeltsman [phonetic], was a fighter for Jewish rights, which is recorded in the Encyclopedia Judaica.</span> <span id="s50">So maybe my fighting spirit comes from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JF: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">HG: I had a brother from my father's previous marriage.</span> <span id="s53">I had a brother and a sister from my mother's previous marriage.</span> <span id="s54">I was the only one from their marriage.</span> <span id="s55">And, as I said, I have shown a talent for music at a very early age.</span> <span id="s56">And since my parents were poor, they could not afford, practically, to give me piano lessons, so there was a cousin in the family who started me off.</span> <span id="s57">But I had the great ambition to continue these studies, and I conceived the idea that after I am finished with school, I will go to Warsaw to live with my sister, my older sister, and I'll stay with her and I will enter the Warsaw Conservatory as a non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JF: While you were still in Lodz, can you tell me about your schooling, whether or not you had any kind of Jewish education whether your family belonged to a synagogue, and anything more about antisemitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">HG: Since my father was an Orthodox Jew, he did not belong to a synagogue, but they had various little congregations in which he performed sometimes as a cantor; he had a beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s60">And I went to public school, elementary school that was free up to the 6th grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">JF: This was a Polish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">HG: Polish.</span> <span id="s63">I did not go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s64">As a matter of fact, I only heard about Jewish history from my uncles, who told me the great beautiful stories.</span> <span id="s65">I listened to my father teaching my brother the Talmud.</span> <span id="s66">That was the only exposure, but I personally went to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s67">There were Jewish children there, but there was no objects of Jewish history or Hebrew or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JF: Was there any experience of antisemitism in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">HG: Not in the elementary school.</span> <span id="s70">I don't recall any of that.</span> <span id="s71">But going to high school, that was not free.</span> <span id="s72">There were no free high schools in Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s73">I still didn't want to give up that education.</span> <span id="s74">And, since I happened to have been bright, that's what they used to tell me, I applied for a scholarship and I won.</span> <span id="s75">I went to a private school, high school, which was owned by a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s76">It was a very well-known high school, but they did not teach any religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">JF: This was a Jewish private school or a..</span> <span id="s78">.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">HG: It is not exactly for Jewish children, but the majority of children were from Jewish rich families.</span> <span id="s80">I got this scholarship because I passed various tests, and I was so determined to get this education that the owner of this school, who was an aristocratic Jewish lady, she must have had some pity on me, because I cried and I said that I will not give up this, that I will steal hours, that I will sneak into the school, if she doesn't let me come.</span> <span id="s81">But I have had a few wonderful years of education, and I was able to perform with a music teacher there, and I also wrote poetry.</span> <span id="s82">I wrote, in Polish, the poetry to the music of Chopin.</span> <span id="s83">And I proved to the principal that I was worthy of the scholarship.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JF: You said that once you were in high school, that some problems began.</span> <span id="s85">Could you describe those for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">HG: The problems began, that I realized that I will not be able to continue my piano studies, being Jewish.</span> <span id="s87">And that was a very painful thought, that I am a citizen of a country which does not permit me to continue and to study, having talent.</span> <span id="s88">I must say that in the high school, I became very idealistic.</span> <span id="s89">I believed that people are good.</span> <span id="s90">I became a little bit of the socialistic side, aware of the injustices of the Polish government and of the poverty of not only Jews, Poles, too.</span> <span id="s91">And I favored communism.</span> <span id="s92">At that time, it was the age of 15 or 16.</span> <span id="s93">I even joined the Communist Party, which was legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">JF: This was around what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">HG: That was the year - '31.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">JF: Was your family involved with non-Jews in the community at all?</span> <span id="s97">Did you have any interchange during your--these years with your communistic...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">HG: I never went out with a non-Jew on a date, we stayed away...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JF: Any friends were non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">HG: No, practically none.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">JF: Your associations then with Communism...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">HG: The first time that I joined this Communist cell which was primarily Jewish, and there came the great disappointment, because in one of the demonstrations, I noticed that the leaders from our cell never went out to be beaten up or to be arrested.</span> <span id="s103">They always sent us, and many of the girls have suffered a great deal.</span> <span id="s104">Thank God, I was not caught at that time and I told them that I do not approve, and I went out.</span> <span id="s105">That was the end of my experience as a Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JF: Did anybody in your family, that you know of, serve in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HG: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">JF: Can you tell me a little bit about the years, during the 30's, as Hitler came into power in Germany?</span> <span id="s109">What was the feeling in Poland at that time?</span> <span id="s110">What was your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">HG: Shall I tell you first about the study as a non-Jew?</span> <span id="s112">And then I will go in, with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">JF: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">HG: At that period, I was accepted because my name was Flint, and I had big blue eyes and light hair and excellent Polish language, without an accent.</span> <span id="s115">So I was accepted...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">JF: They knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HG: No, they did not.</span> <span id="s118">I studied there as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s119">The application, my father could never appear there.</span> <span id="s120">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s121">My parents never heard me at any of the recitals or at the graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">JF: Did they accept you on your word, or did you have to have some kind of proof?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">HG: No, no.</span> <span id="s124">I was examined.</span> <span id="s125">I played for them, and that Professor Joseph Tutinsky was a very famous piano professor.</span> <span id="s126">He liked me and he accepted me; and occasionally he used to make a remark to me when I played Chopin, in whom I identified mostly because of the melancholy, of the suffering in this music, and he used to tell me sometimes with a little smile, "You know the way you play Chopin I think you must be Jewish."</span> <span id="s127">And I looked at him and I said, "Well, I suffered a lot and maybe that is why I feel Chopin so deeply."</span> <span id="s128">He let it go at that.</span> <span id="s129">After the graduation, at which I played with an orchestra the second movement of the Chopin Concerto, my sister was only present, my father could not come, I still did not want to reveal until I really graduated and had that diploma in my pocket.</span> <span id="s130">I walked over to my professor and I said, "You know you were right.</span> <span id="s131">I do play Chopin like a Jew.</span> <span id="s132">I am one."</span> <span id="s133">He said, "Yes?</span> <span id="s134">But you are a nice girl anyway."</span> <span id="s135">That was the end of my career studying as a non-Jew, which was extremely painful for a girl of ideals.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">JF: This was what school?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">HG: The Warsaw Conservatory.</span> <span id="s138">In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JF: In what year, then, did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">HG: I graduated, it was the year 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">JF: Did you know of any other Jews who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">HG: No.</span> <span id="s143">I did not identify myself and maybe they didn't identify themselves, so we didn't know about each other.</span> <span id="s144">But it was very, very difficult to study, and as a young girl, one could not understand why this should happen.</span> <span id="s145">Why is it so bad, or such a crime, to be a Jew?</span> <span id="s146">Now that started the first thinking.</span> <span id="s147">Why?</span> <span id="s148">What are the real roots of antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: Did you experience any antisemitism living in Warsaw with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">HG: Since I did not socialize with non-Jews, the Jews, at that time, even before Hitler, already lived in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s151">They did not socialize too much with the Poles, except for the very assimilated Jews who very often did not identify themselves as Jews.</span> <span id="s152">But I had never known too many, or practically none of non-Jewish families, but I knew there was antisemitism since I myself was already a victim of it by studying as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s153">But the idea was for me - Why?</span> <span id="s154">Then I realized that there are two kinds of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s155">The one which comes from the top, the Jews are doomed right from the start.</span> <span id="s156">The one which comes from the people is ignorance, and they can do a lot of harm; but when the two get together, then there is no hope.</span> <span id="s157">And that goes for countries even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JF: Did you have any association with the kehilla in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">HG: No.</span> <span id="s160">I lived with my sister, and some of my father's family were well-to-do people--I used to go there for dinner sometimes.</span> <span id="s161">But that was about all.</span> <span id="s162">I had to practice five, six hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JF: So you were not involved in the Jewish community very much there?</span> <span id="s164">When do you first remember hearing about Hitler, and how?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">HG: In 1933, during the summer vacation which I spent in the mountains, I came across a German young man, a German Jew young man, who one day got a telegram from Germany: "Come back immediately; they are burning your store."</span> <span id="s166">Then I had a little conversation with him, "Who is burning your store?"</span> <span id="s167">And he told me that there is a new Nazi party in Germany, and they are destroying the Jewish stores and other businesses.</span> <span id="s168">He left and he said to me, "I am afraid I shall never see you again."</span> <span id="s169">That was the first time that I heard that there is a powerful party coming up, and when I went back to my town, I told this to some Jewish influential people, what I heard and what I experienced.</span> <span id="s170">They said, "Ah, come on.</span> <span id="s171">There is nothing to worry about here.</span> <span id="s172">They will never come here."</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JF: When did you first start thinking they might come?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">HG: That must have been around 1935.</span> <span id="s175">I heard Hitler speak on the radio.</span> <span id="s176">This devil had such a power and almost mesmerized his masses when he spoke.</span> <span id="s177">And I heard him say, "Mr. Rosenfeld," this is how he pronounced President Roosevelt, "You can have your Jews, I'll let them go naked.</span> <span id="s178">You can have them."</span> <span id="s179">I heard Hitler's voice, and he was the most powerful speaker.</span> <span id="s180">He promised the German nation to return their dignity as a nation, to make them wealthy, to make them again the most powerful nation in Europe.</span> <span id="s181">And I got frightened inside me, that he mentioned already the Jews, not the extreme form, but just addressing President Roosevelt that he can have that, because apparently nobody wanted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">JF: Tell me about 1939 in Poland before the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">HG: The situation was very electrified with the meeting of Ribbentrop with the Russians, in which they plotted already the division.</span> <span id="s184">Then the provocation in Czechoslovakia, first when he went in.</span> <span id="s185">And each time he took over Austria and Sudetenland, and each time he said that he has no more territorial desires or designs.</span> <span id="s186">And this is how he lulled all of the war.</span> <span id="s187">There was not a way, what he is preparing for.</span> <span id="s188">Of course, the Jewish question did not come up right away.</span> <span id="s189">After he took over the regime in Germany, in which many people say that it cannot happen here because it is a democracy, but Germany also had a democracy before Herr Stresemann1 and many great men.</span> <span id="s190">Germany was a wonderful country in which the Jews grew and developed, and it was the most cultured nation in Europe.</span> <span id="s191">I studied German, I was raised in the German culture.</span> <span id="s192">That was a shocking thing that today you hear very often that it cannot happen.</span> <span id="s193">But he started out with ten people, and then it did happen.</span> <span id="s194">May I say why I think it did happen?</span> <span id="s195">I would like to emphasize since I have studied the history of the German Reich, and in my opinion and in many people's opinion, the humiliation of the German nation after 1914 war, the taking a nation of 60 million and leave them ruined and leave them without means, there was a good background for Hitler to come to power and to promise them so much, which he actually in one area he couldn't keep.</span> <span id="s196">The economy was so bad that, after all his promises which he couldn't keep, he conceived the idea that the best scapegoat would be the Jews.</span> <span id="s197">The German Jews were wealthy, the German Jews had a lot of properties, which he could just take over, and he started it immediately after he got into power.</span> <span id="s198">And then he saw that this is a very easy thing to do.</span> <span id="s199">Nobody protested it.</span> <span id="s200">The Jews did not fight back; they were never raised to fight back.</span> <span id="s201">They didn't have any weapons, and that is how he gave to the German nation by taking away and throwing out from apartments and throwing out from the stores and taking every conceivable thing the Jews owned, he gave to them.</span> <span id="s202">And to perform that, he opens the prisons and let out all criminals in Germany to perform these tasks, because, after all the German nation, a cultured nation, not all of them wanted to dirty their hands with such a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Tape 1, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s204">JF: Can you tell me what happened to you and your family during the weeks following the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">HG: The German invasion took only a few days to conquer all of Poland.</span> <span id="s206">The resistance was very low.</span> <span id="s207">When they entered our town, they immediately took care of the Jewish intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s208">In other words, the most prominent people either were shot or taken into prison.</span> <span id="s209">In other words, their plan was to cut off the heads, to cut off the leaders, so the Jews panicked, but they still stayed in their apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: Did you have any thought of trying to leave Poland at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">HG: Well, I entertained that thought, but my parents were already older and sick people, and I couldn't leave them.</span> <span id="s212">I had opportunities to go to Russia, but then, many people started from our city of Lodz to escape to Warsaw, which was a very foolish move.</span> <span id="s213">My father told me there is no escape; they are everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JF: Were you in Lodz at the time of the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">HG: Lodz, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JF: You and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">HG: No, my sister lived in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JF: You had been living with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">HG: Me, my mother and father and my brother, one of the brothers.</span> <span id="s220">The other brother was married with three children, also in Lodz.</span> <span id="s221">And my father told me there is no escape.</span> <span id="s222">But the interesting part of it is, that the very wealthy Jews could have left and they still did not believe what might happen to them.</span> <span id="s223">I asked them, "Why with having so much money, why don't you run away?</span> <span id="s224">I have no money.</span> <span id="s225">I cannot even move."</span> <span id="s226">And they said, "How can we leave our homes, our factories, our families.</span> <span id="s227">There is no use to go away."</span> <span id="s228">Second, there came even to Poland before the invasion, I must mention, a great Jewish leader by the name Jabotinsky.</span> <span id="s229">He was one of the foremost orators of our time and a great Zionist who begged the rich Jews to finance to take out a million children to safety.</span> <span id="s230">Apparently this man knew more than we.</span> <span id="s231">Nobody--they laughed, nobody believed that such atrocities can take place.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">JF: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">HG: The year was 19, well, he talked about that, that was 1937, '38; but in '39 they started to throw out the Jews from the apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">JF: This was true in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">HG: My town, which had 300,000 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">JF: What happened to your family in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">HG: Well, again, my music came in handy.</span> <span id="s238">I was playing Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" on my piano, and the door opens and a tall, handsome German officer comes in and gives many people 10, 15 minutes to get out into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">They were already creating the ghetto.</span> <span id="s240">And he heard me play, and he stood in the door, and he looked at me and said, "Oh, you play so beautiful!</span> <span id="s241">What a shame that you are a Jewish girl."</span> <span id="s242">I say, "It is also a shame that you are a Nazi 'cause you seem to be very nice, too."</span> <span id="s243">That was our conversation.</span> <span id="s244">I don't know if I should put that in, but it saved me that he left me in the apartment, so that I could gather together my father and mother during this period of time when others were thrown out within 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s245">And I tried to take some things with me into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s246">And surprisingly, I came across another antisemitist from the local Poles: our janitor didn't let me take out anything.</span> <span id="s247">He said, "Now everything belongs to me, and I am taking over your apartment."</span> <span id="s248">I was wrapping the music, of course, the music sheets.</span> <span id="s249">I thought in the ghetto I would have a piano too, and my parents and my brother, we all went into the ghetto into one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JF: Could you take anything out of your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">HG: I could have, but he didn't let me.</span> <span id="s252">The Polish janitor didn't let me, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">JF: You couldn't take...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">HG: So I take a couple pots and pans and a pillow, some sheets, and the rest had to stay.</span> <span id="s255">He examined everything I took out.</span> <span id="s256">He was standing there at the big opening, the door, and he didn't let me take out anything.</span> <span id="s257">So we arrived at that ghetto and we had one room with a little stove.</span> <span id="s258">My mother, father, my brother and me, four adults in one room.</span> <span id="s259">And immediately--very meager rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">JF: Do you remember how much?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">HG: The Lodz ghetto has been described in some of the books--the shock of leaving your apartment into such quarters, and the hunger, seeing your parents suffer, and, of course, we were identified by the Jewish star and a yellow arm band.</span> <span id="s262">I conceived the idea one day of sneaking out from the ghetto to get some meat, pulled up my hair, put on glasses, and I spoke an excellent German already.</span> <span id="s263">I went through an opening somewhere far away, because the ghetto was surrounded already with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s264">I found an opening without a guard and I went out.</span> <span id="s265">I went with the trolley and I had a newspaper in front of me, and I was envying these people sitting around me.</span> <span id="s266">Why, why can they be free and I am so scared?</span> <span id="s267">I finally got a piece of meat and I got back; my father made me promise that I will never do that again, because you could have been shot.</span> <span id="s268">Then I had a friend who was an electronics engineer at that time.</span> <span id="s269">He created a little radio in a soup dish which you carry around.</span> <span id="s270">What is this called?</span> <span id="s271">A metal dish.</span> <span id="s272">He carried around with him this radio, and he always let me know what is happening in the world, because we were immediately cut off from all the news and--the Lodz ghetto was a little bit unique than other ghettos.</span> <span id="s273">We had a head which collaborated with the Germans, and his idea was to save as many as he could by collaborating with the German government.</span> <span id="s274">They set up their own money, which I have some mementoes from that time.</span> <span id="s275">I worked as a cashier in a certain store which distributed these rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">JF: Were the rest of your family employed also?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">HG: No, not my father and mother.</span> <span id="s278">As a matter of fact, I have experienced shocking, the most painful feelings what happened to my father in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s279">We were poor people and he got caught by a, they were not called the Gestapo in our ghetto, they were called the Kripo, Kriminalpolizei, it was abbreviated as Kripo.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JF: These were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">HG: Germans, who caught him and tortured him, that he should give up his diamonds, his jewelry, his money.</span> <span id="s282">He said, "I don't have anything."</span> <span id="s283">"Yes, yes, you are a Jew, you lived in a big city, you must have something hid."</span> <span id="s284">And they beat him to such an extent that he lost his mind.</span> <span id="s285">I took him back and I never saw him sane again.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">JF: This was in the beginning of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">HG: In the beginning of the ghetto, in 19--maybe, no between 1941-1942.</span> <span id="s288">We went into the ghetto 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JF: You were how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">HG: I was born in 1913.</span> <span id="s291">How old was I?</span> <span id="s292">Twenty-four or twenty-five, something around 25, 26.</span> <span id="s293">That pain is not to describe when I saw my father deteriorate to such a degree that he had to be given away to a hospital.</span> <span id="s294">These hospitals were doomed the next week to be taken away.</span> <span id="s295">They took care of all the mentally ill people immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">JF: And where was this hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">HG: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s298">The ghetto had everything.</span> <span id="s299">But I had an influential friend who told me a night before that this will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">JF: Told you what...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">HG: That they will take away the sick people, and I begged him.</span> <span id="s302">And we put on a tape on my father's mouth, and at night we smuggled him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">JF: You smuggled him out of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">HG: Back into my one room.</span> <span id="s305">But I had to keep the tape on his mouth because he was yelling against Hitler, and it would have endangered the whole, all the people there.</span> <span id="s306">Then he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">JF: In your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">HG: Yes, and I was able.</span> <span id="s309">to bury him in the Lodz cemetery, Jewish burial, whatever that means.</span> <span id="s310">I was already left with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">JF: Your brother was not...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">HG: My brother got married in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">JF: So it was at that point that you and your mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">HG: I begged my sister-in-law not to have any babies in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s315">I had many offers for marriage, but I refused.</span> <span id="s316">I said in such circumstances, one should not have a family.</span> <span id="s317">I knew that there is a place like Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">JF: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">HG: From an influential friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">JF: And what did you hear about Auschwitz?'</span></p> <p><span id="s321">HG: They are burning people, that there are ovens, I knew.</span> <span id="s322">But nobody believed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">JF: You told people?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s325">The tragedy started in the Lodzer ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">They packed in 70,000 people into that area which could hold the most 10,000.</span> <span id="s327">And they started to eliminate, gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">HG: They had a Jewish police for that.</span> <span id="s330">They did not do it themselves--that is the most tragic thing, that they took Jewish men into a Sonderkommando, a special command, and they made these people take away the children from their mothers by telling them a lie, that the children are going to a better place.</span> <span id="s331">Yes, they went to a better place, to heaven.</span> <span id="s332">And the mothers, willingly, because they suffered hunger and disease, they willingly gave away those children and babies to these policeman.</span> <span id="s333">That was a double tragedy, that the Jews had to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">JF: Did you have any contact with Poles any time you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">HG: None.</span> <span id="s336">They have not helped.</span> <span id="s337">They have not done anything in our city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s338">In Warsaw, maybe, some parts.</span> <span id="s339">But in Lodz, it was completely isolated.</span> <span id="s340">And workshops for the Germans.</span> <span id="s341">That kept us alive with these little meager rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">JF: Workshops inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">HG: Inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s344">We had nothing to do with the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">JF: In line with your comment before about your landlord, were there any other instances you knew of cooperation and help that the Poles gave the Germans in setting up the ghetto and enforcing...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">HG: That was not the landlord, pardon me, that was my janitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">JF: Your janitor, I'm sorry, your janitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">HG: There was great cooperation.</span> <span id="s349">There was even a little song which they sang which cannot be translated, that now the streets are yours and the homes are ours and before, it was the other way around.</span> <span id="s350">The Poles sang, the Poles cooperated fully with the Germans to exterminate the Jews, with maybe a few exceptional families who have tried to hide the Jews.</span> <span id="s351">But you know there is always an antisemite who will say, I have one Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s352">That is a famous saying.</span> <span id="s353">The years in the ghetto are a specific chapter in my life, because I even fell in love in the ghetto, and I knew I will never marry that man.</span> <span id="s354">He was sent away to Warsaw and committed suicide by not being able to be with me together.</span> <span id="s355">That was another tragic experience.</span> <span id="s356">Then these--they used to call down the people to the street and take out a few away.</span> <span id="s357">I begged my sister-in-law not to have a baby, but she was not young, she was in a hurry, so she had a baby.</span> <span id="s358">The baby was six weeks old when they told everybody to come down.</span> <span id="s359">She hid the baby in the bed and put a big pillow on top of it.</span> <span id="s360">When she came back, the baby was dead.</span> <span id="s361">I begged her not to have any more children, but she didn't listen.</span> <span id="s362">She lost another one, too, that way.</span> <span id="s363">In a different way, but she lost it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">HG: Well, her food was poisoned.</span> <span id="s366">Her breasts, she couldn't feed the baby; the baby died of hunger.</span> <span id="s367">Then another tragic experience.</span> <span id="s368">One mother kept a dead baby for two weeks in her bed in order to get the bread ration.</span> <span id="s369">I knew about all these things, and I said I shall never marry under such circumstances.</span> <span id="s370">The children who were taken away--imagine the tragedy of mothers where a transport comes back with children's clothes and little shoes, and one of the mothers recognized her child's shoes.</span> <span id="s371">Why they send that back, it will never be understandable to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">JF: They sent back the clothes of the children...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">HG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">With the shoes, the little shoes, after they had killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">JF: And where did the mothers see this?</span> <span id="s376">How...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">HG: They had to sort them out.</span> <span id="s378">Then the most tragic thing which is indelible on my memory.</span> <span id="s379">There were orphans in the ghetto, a group of orphans, age three, four, five, six.</span> <span id="s380">One day, they made a circle out of these orphans, gave them chocolate to eat, told them to sing the song, and to the middle came an assassin, with a machine gun, and just mowed them down in that circle, and I saw it.</span> <span id="s381">So they can never tell, this was not recorded.</span> <span id="s382">So now, I would like to pay tribute to the media of today who goes in to the most dangerous places and sometimes give their lives to record to the world in their living rooms atrocities which happened in Viet Nam, which happened in Korea, which happens in many places today, so that the people in their living rooms can see and react; but we had no media.</span> <span id="s383">This scene was never recorded.</span> <span id="s384">President Roosevelt, with all due respect of his genius and his contribution to America, told Rabbi Stephen Wise, "Don't tell me that they are burning your people in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s385">You just wish to make me upset."</span> <span id="s386">He couldn't have told that if there would had been a media, like the communications today.</span> <span id="s387">And maybe, if there would have been, maybe so many wouldn't have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">JF: Was there any effort at defense, self-defense, or resistance within the ghetto that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">HG: No.</span> <span id="s390">None.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">JF: Was there any kind of educational programs for the children, any kind of effort to keep...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">HG: Everything was forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">JF: Everything was forbidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">HG: The only thing I found was a piano in a basement.</span> <span id="s395">And I asked them to take it out and I gave a concert with a violinist together.</span> <span id="s396">And still, people could not conceive the idea of total extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JF: You said you had access to this radio.</span> <span id="s398">Could you hear anything on it that indicated what was happening in the outside world?</span> <span id="s399">Or did you have any word from any other ghettos...</span></p> <p><span id="s400">HG: Well, I knew that the Germans are now at war with Russia, and I told my friends that's the beginning of the end.</span> <span id="s401">He has not learned history of the Napoleonic wars.</span> <span id="s402">That will probably be the beginning of it.</span> <span id="s403">I knew certain things, I must admit.</span> <span id="s404">I tried to tell many of my friends and, still, people did not believe that there can be such a thing as a solution, what Hitler conceived, of the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s405">Another tragic scene when a transport arrived with German Jews to the Lodzer ghetto, I was assigned to help them since I spoke such a good German.</span> <span id="s406">I spoke with many of them.</span> <span id="s407">I was shocked by what they told me.</span> <span id="s408">They said, "You know, if tomorrow the war ends, we will go back and kiss the German soil."</span> <span id="s409">But, of course, they were shocked by what they saw in the Lodzer ghetto.</span> <span id="s410">It wasn't a nice place to live.</span> <span id="s411">But that was the attitude of the German Jews.</span> <span id="s412">They must have been the most shocked because they were more German than Jewish, all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">JF: Was there any interaction between the German Jews and the Polish Jews who were in the ghetto, or did they keep separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">HG: Separate.</span> <span id="s415">Because the German Jew always considered himself on a higher level and looked down at us.</span> <span id="s416">That is still the case, even today.</span> <span id="s417">The German Jew is a different kind of a Jew.</span> <span id="s418">He thinks that the Ostjuden, that means the Jews from the east--Polish Jews, Russian Jews--they are not on the same cultural level.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">JF: Were they treated any differently by the authorities?</span> <span id="s420">Were their rations any different?</span> <span id="s421">Were their jobs any different?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">HG: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s423">Once they arrived in the Lodzer ghetto they were treated equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">JF: Was there any success in outside people smuggling food or any kind of support into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">HG: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">JF: Could you have any contact with people in other ghettos?</span> <span id="s427">Did you have family members in other ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">HG: I had my sister in Warsaw, with whom I had lost complete contact.</span> <span id="s429">There was no mail unless somebody smuggled in a letter or a word.</span> <span id="s430">I lost contact with my dear sister, who also perished.</span> <span id="s431">As a matter of fact, my whole family perished.</span> <span id="s432">I am the only survivor of about 40 people.</span> <span id="s433">My brother survived for a very short time, then he died here.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">JF: He died here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">HG: Right after the arrival.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">JF: Any other thoughts about the years in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">HG: There was an interesting study of cancer in the ghetto by my friends, doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">JF: Their names...</span></p> <p><span id="s439">HG: Well, they all died.</span> <span id="s440">That's why it is so tragic.</span> <span id="s441">They had made a study of the fact that there was no cancer during the four years in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s442">And apparently has to do with malnutrition, because there was plenty of other diseases, TB and other diseases connected with malnutrition.</span> <span id="s443">But these doctors had a very interesting study which, of course, perished together with them, about cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JF: There is no record of this study?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">HG: No.</span> <span id="s446">Unfortunately, I was subject for them.</span> <span id="s447">I told this to many doctors who also said since the body is so emaciated and so hungry, the cancer has nothing to feed on.</span> <span id="s448">So apparently there is a chemical process which has to do with malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">JF: Did these doctors die in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">HG: They, no.</span> <span id="s451">The last year of the ghetto there were already rumors that they are liquidating the ghetto and sending all the people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s452">I have tried to the last minute to avoid the trip to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s453">I have tried very hard.</span> <span id="s454">Some of them did hide underground and waited for the Russian army to liberate them which they were liberated by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s455">The Russian army came into Lodz before other people were liberated, but I was taken away and my mother with me.</span> <span id="s456">My brother and my sister-in-law went with another transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">JF: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">HG: 1944, already.</span> <span id="s459">August 1944.</span> <span id="s460">That's when the Lodzer ghetto was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">JF: Can you tell me about how you found out that you were being called for the transport, and your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">HG: Well, they just emptied everybody, everybody had to come down.</span> <span id="s463">And I went with my mother.</span> <span id="s464">And, it is funny, I again took the music of Chopin with me under my arm, and my mother under the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">JF: And that is all you were able to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">HG: When I arrived at Auschwitz with my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">JF: Can you tell me about the transport before you get to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">HG: That was my only transport.</span> <span id="s469">This was cattle cars, tightly shut, without water, without food.</span> <span id="s470">I clung to my mother, she clung to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s472">JF: This is tape 2, side 1, of an interview with Helene Goodman, Josey Fisher interviewing on February 23, 1981.</span> <span id="s473">Can you tell us what happened when you arrived at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">HG: An orchestra played in Auschwitz and I said to my mother, "You see how good that I took the music with me.</span> <span id="s475">It will come in handy."</span> <span id="s476">To describe Auschwitz, there are no words in the human language to describe that hell, because in comparison probably with the real hell, this would have been--the real hell in heaven might have been a paradise in comparison with Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s477">You are immediately surrounded by people who drag you, shave your head, take everything away from you, undress you, take out from under your tongue a little golden heart which you have as a memento; and then give you clothes which are transparent, doesn't fit.</span> <span id="s478">And then comes the selection, and you go on a long road, and you come across a very handsome man with penetrating deep eyes.2 I shall never forget his face.</span> <span id="s479">I came across him with my mother under my arm, and he looks at me and points to the left, takes my mother away from me and points her to the right, and says to me, "You are too beautiful and young.</span> <span id="s480">We can still use you."</span> <span id="s481">And I never saw my mother again.</span> <span id="s482">She probably died the same day.</span> <span id="s483">I will never forget her eyes, that she knew we should never see each other again.</span> <span id="s484">After that I was so numb, I noticed my sister-in-law somewhere in another group, and I exchanged with somebody and went over to her, to be with her together.</span> <span id="s485">Then, they put us into a barrack with no floor, just has in the middle a stove; with a long row of people being beaten up...</span></p> <p><span id="s486">JF: Inside the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s488">And they gave you a pot of soup and you had to stand in a row of ten.</span> <span id="s489">Somehow I was always at the end--it was almost empty when it came to me.</span> <span id="s490">So I asked my sister-in-law, "How long do you think it takes to die here?"</span> <span id="s491">She said, "Not long, not long, just maybe a day or two."</span> <span id="s492">And I was so glad that she told me that; but that was not the end.</span> <span id="s493">That same evening, a Jewish supervisor came in who was there already for about two years; she was real mean and tough, and she called out, "Who plays the piano here?"</span> <span id="s494">I didn't answer.</span> <span id="s495">My sister-in-law put up my hand and she said, "She does."</span> <span id="s496">She thought I am going to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s497">And she comes over to me and she says, "You have to come with me.</span> <span id="s498">Tonight is the Obersturmführer's birthday and you have to play 'Happy Birthday' for him."</span> <span id="s499">I looked at her; I said, "How do you expect me to play 'Happy Birthday' for somebody who just killed my mother?"</span> <span id="s500">She said, "Don't talk.</span> <span id="s501">You just go with me; you have nothing to say; just sit down and play."</span> <span id="s502">I had to go.</span> <span id="s503">When I came into that place, never in my life, of course, have I ever seen such an orgy.</span> <span id="s504">Dogs with young undressed women.</span> <span id="s505">I became so numb and so that I could hardly see.</span> <span id="s506">I was full of grief.</span> <span id="s507">When she set me down at the piano and he came over to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">JF: Who came over to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">HG: The birthday child, the assassin.</span> <span id="s510">She said to me, "Now, play now."</span> <span id="s511">And I don't know what happened to me, I became paralyzed.</span> <span id="s512">I could not move one single finger.</span> <span id="s513">I put my hands on the piano but I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s514">And he stabbed me in my breast and in the back, twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">JF: He stabbed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">HG: I started bleeding and somehow this Jewish kapo, or whatever you call them, she dragged me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">JF: He stabbed you with what?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">HG: Well, he had a sword.</span> <span id="s519">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s520">I lost consciousness; she dragged me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">JF: This is the first night you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">HG: She dragged me out and she stuffed newspapers into my wound, so it became infected.</span> <span id="s523">And she dragged me back to the barracks, and I thanked my sister-in-law for putting up my hand.</span> <span id="s524">She felt so guilty before me.</span> <span id="s525">And I didn't know, but on the way she was talking to me, she felt something for me.</span> <span id="s526">She said, "You know, I like you.</span> <span id="s527">I am going to save you."</span></p> <p><span id="s528">JF: This is the kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s530">"I am going to save you.</span> <span id="s531">I put you through that."</span> <span id="s532">Next night, at dawn, you will come with me.</span> <span id="s533">I'll get you out from here."</span> <span id="s534">I said, "Not me by myself.</span> <span id="s535">I must take my sister-in-law, my girlfriend."</span> <span id="s536">She said, "Must you?"</span> <span id="s537">I said, "Yes, I won't go."</span> <span id="s538">And she said, "O.K." Four o'clock in the morning she put us out in the field to a transport, which went deep into Germany to work in an ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">JF: So you were actually in Auschwitz two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">HG: That's right.</span> <span id="s541">Thanks to that episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">JF: Your sister-in-law and your...</span></p> <p><span id="s543">HG: Came with me and my girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">JF: This girlfriend is somewhere...</span></p> <p><span id="s545">HG: Is now in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">JF: That you knew from Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s548">We went together to school.</span> <span id="s549">And she saved them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">JF: Was this also a cattle car you went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">HG: Oh, a horror.</span> <span id="s552">I was bleeding, and we were packed in there to go to work into Germany, and this was considered a lifesaver, because Auschwitz was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s553">Nobody survives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">JF: Where was this camp, the ammunitions factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">HG: Hainichen, Sachsen, near Chemnitz.</span> <span id="s556">Chemnitz is a big city, so they know Chemnitz.</span> <span id="s557">H-A-I-N-I-C-H-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">JF: Hainichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">HG: I must say, the Wehrmacht, which is the soldiers, not the SS men, they were a little bit different to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">HG: This man who was in charge of our transport--you know we were packed into cattle trains--now each train had various attachments to it, and he was with us, sitting in the front of the door so we wouldn't escape.</span> <span id="s562">Then we stopped and they gave us something to drink, because we were already valuable cargo to go to work.</span> <span id="s563">And he saw me holding on my hand on my breast, so he said, "What are you doing there?"</span> <span id="s564">I say, "I have a wound."</span> <span id="s565">He said, "Come over here, I'll take care of you."</span></p> <p><span id="s566">JF: This is a Wehrmacht officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">HG: Yes, and I spoke in excellent German, so he immediately he made me in charge of distributing the coffee.</span> <span id="s568">And he spoke to me.</span> <span id="s569">We discussed it.</span> <span id="s570">I told him what happened.</span> <span id="s571">And he said, "I am ashamed to be a German, what you tell me."</span> <span id="s572">As a matter of fact, I do have a suspicion that some part of the German population did not know all the atrocities.</span> <span id="s573">This I must admit.</span> <span id="s574">Now starts a new chapter.</span> <span id="s575">Arriving at the camp, also a concentration camp, in which we are separated from the Hungarian girls--500 Hungarian girls, a few hundred Polish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">JF: The name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">HG: Hainichen in Sachsen.</span> <span id="s578">Sachsen is like Pennsylvania, you know, a state.</span> <span id="s579">There was a famous SS woman, Gertruda Becker was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">JF: B-E...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">HG: B-E-C-K-E-R.</span> <span id="s582">Gertrude Becker, an ex-prostitute.</span> <span id="s583">She was the cruelest thing I ever came across as a woman in my life.</span> <span id="s584">When we finally went to the ammunition factory, she made us stand up each time she passed by.</span> <span id="s585">So one of my friends had her hand in the big machine and lost five fingers, because she had to stand up at attention when this SS woman was passing by.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">JF: You lived in the camp and then you...</span></p> <p><span id="s587">HG: And then you went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">JF: Where was the factory in comparison to the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">HG: Oh, it might have been about two or three miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">JF: And you walked every morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s591">HG: Of course, we walked.</span> <span id="s592">I made myself a paper suit to keep warm.</span> <span id="s593">No stockings.</span> <span id="s594">And the German women, standing at the corners, with the fresh rolls which tear your appetite...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">JF: This was the town you went through in order to get to the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">HG: The factory by the name was Framowerke.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">JF: Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">HG: F-R-A-M-0-W-E-R-K-E.</span> <span id="s599">That was the ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">JF: Were you wearing uniforms in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">HG: No, just stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">JF: And what were your rations like in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">HG: Two slices of bread and the soup a day.</span> <span id="s604">No meat.</span> <span id="s605">Night work mostly.</span> <span id="s606">Two shifts, one during the day, and one during the night.</span> <span id="s607">In charge of us was the SS, not the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">JF: The SS were in charge at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">HG: Of us.</span> <span id="s610">Yes, of us, they called us the Häftlinge, by the way.</span> <span id="s611">You know a Häftlinge is a criminal.</span> <span id="s612">So the German women were standing at the corner and looked at us, shaven heads, stripes; she said, "So young and already criminals?"</span> <span id="s613">They did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">JF: They didn't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s615">HG: They didn't know who we are, but they saw us and they thought that we are criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">JF: Was this a camp with both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">HG: Only girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">JF: Do you have any idea about how many women were in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">HG: We were about 900 girls, 500 of Hungarian girls on the upper floor, and about 400 of us, three, four hundred, I didn't count.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">JF: And about how many people were in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">HG: That was one barrack, which went to that factory.</span> <span id="s622">In that town, it was a small town, Hainichen, it couldn't hold any more.</span> <span id="s623">But the SS was in charge of us and their greatest torture to us, one of the tortures was that they would pass us by in the morning with those trays of bacon and eggs and fresh rolls, and we were starving, gradually, to such a point that I started to hypnotize myself that I am eating.</span> <span id="s624">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s625">I swallowed, I swallowed, I fantasized that I am eating scrambled eggs and a fresh roll.</span> <span id="s626">That was the dream.</span> <span id="s627">You know you are deprived of your human feelings, and then it is, like getting easier.</span> <span id="s628">You don't feel so much the hunger pains.</span> <span id="s629">You sort of evaporate gradually.</span> <span id="s630">Gradually you get weaker and weaker, and you don't feel the hunger anymore.</span> <span id="s631">That must have been the feeling for many people who starved themselves to death.</span> <span id="s632">But the important part of this Framowerke, of this place of work, is that they put me in charge of a very complicated sophisticated Schleifmaschine [polishing or grinding machine] which it is a machine which is very precise, that they use in the apparatus, photographic apparatus.</span> <span id="s633">And also before that, I worked at the big bore machine which makes holes for the bolts to fit in the machine guns.</span> <span id="s634">So I made those holes a little bigger.</span> <span id="s635">That was my way of sabotage, which is a very dangerous thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">JF: Was this commonly done?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">HG: No, I did this myself.</span> <span id="s638">Nobody should know.</span> <span id="s639">But I had to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">JF: The Wehrmacht were in charge of you at the munitions factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">HG: No, no, no, only SS.</span> <span id="s642">Occasionally a general came in with his entourage and looked at us, those young girls with the shaved heads--he thought I don't understand German, but I understood what he said to his companions.</span> <span id="s643">He said, "With this we want to win a war.</span> <span id="s644">Look at that.</span> <span id="s645">This will make us win the war?"</span> <span id="s646">And I understood, and I smiled a little.</span> <span id="s647">So he called over the SS woman and he said that she should watch me.</span> <span id="s648">He thinks that I understand German.</span> <span id="s649">I say, "Yes, I do."</span> <span id="s650">So they didn't talk anymore.</span> <span id="s651">You could not go to a bathroom, only at certain times.</span> <span id="s652">And since your diet was saltless--the Germans didn't even have salt.</span> <span id="s653">Don't forget this is already 1944, and the Russians took over already half of Poland.</span> <span id="s654">You know you couldn't hold it that long, excuse me for my expression; but the--my friends were doing it right there, whatever, standing and working.</span> <span id="s655">So they didn't like that mess.</span> <span id="s656">They also didn't like the idea that women have a monthly menstrual cycle.</span> <span id="s657">So they put some medications in those soups that we should lose that.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">JF: Up until that time, the women were having their regular cycles?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s660">Many of my friends cannot have children.</span> <span id="s661">But my supervisor, with whom I worked at that big machine, the Schleifmaschine, the next machine; we were sort like in an enclosure.</span> <span id="s662">He was a very nice old man.</span> <span id="s663">He shared with me his breakfast, and he said, "Don't eat that soup.</span> <span id="s664">I heard some rumors about that soup."</span></p> <p><span id="s665">JF: This is the soup that was given to you at the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s667">And he also used to put into my hand, little pieces of rolled up paper where the Russians are moving--so that was hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">JF: So you avoided eating this soup that this medication had been put into.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">HG: I did.</span> <span id="s670">I told others, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">JF: Was your system then regular?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">HG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">JF: It was no problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">HG: But you have to hide with it as much as you could.</span> <span id="s675">But this old man, I shall also never forget.</span> <span id="s676">He was a German.</span> <span id="s677">He held up my hopes.</span> <span id="s678">When I asked him, "How long do you think it will take me to learn that machine?"</span> <span id="s679">"Oh," he says, "in another year or two, you will be O.K." And at that moment, a bomb comes into the factory, and we all run out.</span> <span id="s680">And I did see the American pilots.</span> <span id="s681">They waved to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">JF: An American plane bombed...</span></p> <p><span id="s683">HG: An American plane bombed in Germany our factory.</span> <span id="s684">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s685">They put us on that death march to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s686">Why they didn't kill us also escapes me.</span> <span id="s687">But that was it.</span> <span id="s688">I saw an American pilot!</span> <span id="s689">They flew so low that they practically waved to us.</span> <span id="s690">But somehow we all ran out in time into the field, and then we were taken back to our quarters and put on death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">JF: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">HG: '44 - nine months.</span> <span id="s693">About nine months there, and then the death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">JF: And this was what month and what year that the death march occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">HG: The beginning, the end of April, it is already 1945.</span> <span id="s696">April 1945, between April and May.</span> <span id="s697">I was liberated the 9th of May.</span> <span id="s698">Well, we made about 20 miles a day on foot.</span> <span id="s699">Many fell on the wayside.</span> <span id="s700">The grass didn't exist anymore there; we ate all the grass that was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">JF: They didn't give you any food on the march?</span> <span id="s702">Who was guarding the march?</span> <span id="s703">Were these SS officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">HG: Yes, the woman and that Obersturmführer with his assistants.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">JF: His name, again?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">HG: Her name, Gertrude Becker.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">JF: And the Obersturmführer?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">HG: I don't remember his name, but he wasn't so bad as she.</span> <span id="s709">I must say, she was more cruel.</span> <span id="s710">She administered some beatings to my sister-in-law's head, and she wanted me to look at that, in my presence, knowing that this is my sister-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">JF: Your sister-in-law was also on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s713">We dragged each other, and my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s714">Many fell at the wayside, they couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s715">I don't know where the power comes from, but there is such a thing as an inner power and desire to survive, and here, I must tell this, that I nursed the idea, should I ever survive that hell, I don't wish to be Jewish anymore.</span> <span id="s716">I somehow knew I don't have a family anymore.</span> <span id="s717">And I am all alone, and should I ever survive and have a family, I don't wish them to go through what I did.</span> <span id="s718">And I nursed the idea quietly in me alone, that I shall convert after, if I should be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">JF: Did any other kinds of thoughts sustain you during that time that you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">HG: The only thoughts which could sustain you was to believe that this is the end of Hitler, that he will be punished, and the great desire to survive and to see him being punished.</span> <span id="s721">That was the mental stage, and in the physical stage, you had to keep yourself somehow clean, to sneak out at night to cold water to wash yourself, to make yourself a paper suit underneath...</span></p> <p><span id="s722">JF: You stuffed paper in between the lining of the uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">HG: No, no, actually put it together somehow.</span> <span id="s724">We found some needle and thread in the factory, we--you know, we put it together.</span> <span id="s725">I was lucky that one of the SS women in the factory took a liking to me because of my German and she brought me a pair of stockings.</span> <span id="s726">But how can you wear stockings if everybody else is naked!</span> <span id="s727">It's not a pleasant thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">JF: Were you aware of any religious services going on while you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">HG: No, there was none.</span> <span id="s730">No.</span> <span id="s731">I only sang Kol Nidre for some of the girls, which still some survivors remember that I tried to lift up their spirits.</span> <span id="s732">And I remember the holiday of Yom Kippur...</span></p> <p><span id="s733">JF: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">HG: After we arrived in that camp--because you must not forget that this was August, and the Jewish holiday comes out, in that period, the beginning of September, the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s735">So I gathered them together and we sang Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s736">Then the Obersturmführer comes in and says, "What are you singing there?"</span> <span id="s737">I say, "Oh, we are singing a song of dreaming of freedom."</span> <span id="s738">And he looked at us and he said, "Well, it might be near."</span> <span id="s739">He knew.</span> <span id="s740">When he finally dragged us into Theresienstadt...</span></p> <p><span id="s741">JF: How long was this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">HG: Oh, about a week.</span> <span id="s743">A week.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">JF: How many do you think survived the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">HG: 15 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">JF: Survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">HG: No more.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">JF: And when people fell by the road...</span></p> <p><span id="s749">HG: They just shot them.</span> <span id="s750">If they were still moving, they shot them.</span> <span id="s751">But when you arrived in Theresienstadt, this Obersturmführer walked over to me and he said, "You're going to be free soon and I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s752">He said, "Would you testify for me that I was good to you?"</span> <span id="s753">I said, "No, because you work in the uniform of an assassin.</span> <span id="s754">You didn't have to do that."</span> <span id="s755">And you know what they did?</span> <span id="s756">They took off the uniforms and ran away.</span> <span id="s757">Many didn't get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">JF: And this was at what point?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">HG: This was already 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">JF: The end of April?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">HG: Yes, the end of April.</span> <span id="s762">The 9th of May, I was already liberated.</span> <span id="s763">But arriving there, and, I noticed a big truck with a big red cross on it, coming in, and they told me that there is a commission from Geneva, because one of the SS men called up Geneva.</span> <span id="s764">They had graves, big graves dug up, and wanted to eliminate us all as we arrived in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s765">It was all set up, and I noticed the big truck from Geneva, and they stopped that.</span> <span id="s766">I never told you that there was a showcase of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">JF: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">HG: In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s769">They had about five to ten children left alive, which they showed to the Red Cross people, that they are so good to children, that they never killed children.</span> <span id="s770">It was so perfectly organized that it is hard to conceive that a nation at war could have a department which dealt with the "Final Solution."</span></p> <p><span id="s771">JF: How were these children shown?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">HG: Oh, they were in nice quarters.</span> <span id="s773">They had enough to eat, and they showed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">JF: Did you see the children when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">HG: No, I knew that they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">JF: What were your impressions of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">HG: Well, we were all in one room again.</span> <span id="s778">I was always sitting at a window, somehow dreaming that I would see something.</span> <span id="s779">And I was always sitting at a window, and one day, the 9th of May, 1945, through that window, I saw a Russian soldier chasing a German soldier.</span> <span id="s780">And I said to the girls, "You are free!</span> <span id="s781">I saw a Russian soldier!"</span> <span id="s782">And they shook their heads and thought I had lost my mind.</span> <span id="s783">Nobody could conceive that you can be liberated.</span> <span id="s784">And ten minutes later, the gates opened, the big Russian tanks came in, with women on the top...</span></p> <p><span id="s785">JF: What kind of women?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">HG: Women, Russian women on the top of a tank, and a little girl, a young girl...</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Tape 2, side 2: This is tape 2, side 2, of an interview with Helene Goodman on February 23, 1981.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">JF: When the Russian officers came in, you were telling me...</span></p> <p><span id="s789">HG: One of them was Jewish, and I spoke to him and he revealed to me that he would defect because there is antisemitism in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s790">He wanted me even to go with him, but I was too sick and I said, "Oh, no, I am not able even to move."</span> <span id="s791">And then, two days, they gave us free to go around and to take everything we can from the Russian homes, in the German homes, pardon me, because the Russians had practically nothing to give us to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">JF: This is in the town of Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">HG: Yes, at the liberation.</span> <span id="s794">And they had very little food, they had the wrong food for people who have been starved.</span> <span id="s795">One of the girls ate a whole fresh bread and died.</span> <span id="s796">Then typhoid came, then dysentery came.</span> <span id="s797">I must admit, I have to pay tribute to these Russian women doctors who carried us on their backs, and tried to save us, but they didn't have anything to save us with.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">JF: The doctors who came in with the Russian troops were primarily women?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">HG: Yes, primarily women.</span> <span id="s800">The rest was still Army, fighting, they were still fighting.</span> <span id="s801">And they gave us this free, so I remember I got a dress from a trunk from a Russian soldier, and we went around and we took bread.</span> <span id="s802">I came across a very big safe with probably two million marks in it, open.</span> <span id="s803">The farm was open, and I came in with my girlfriends and I said, "I remembered my mother told me that after the First World War the money was worthless," and I said, "Let's make a dinner from it."</span> <span id="s804">And I took the two millions and we made a nice dinner.</span> <span id="s805">We made a fire."</span></p> <p><span id="s806">JF: You burned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s808">Then I was sorry because it was good money.</span> <span id="s809">Well, I have to put that in as a note.</span> <span id="s810">Well, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s811">What is next?</span> <span id="s812">Where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s813">Many said they are going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s814">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s815">I cannot go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s816">That is a graveyard to me."</span> <span id="s817">My sister-in-law said, "I am going to find my husband."</span> <span id="s818">(My brother.)</span> <span id="s819">She did find him.</span> <span id="s820">She went, and she did find him in one of the hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">JF: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">HG: On the border of Poland and Germany.</span> <span id="s823">They came later to join me.</span> <span id="s824">After the liberation, a man came around, an older man, who said that he is from the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s825">"Where do we wish to go, now?"</span> <span id="s826">I said, "I want to go to Palestine."</span> <span id="s827">And he signed me up, and all of a sudden, I said to my friends.</span> <span id="s828">"We have to go away from the Russians."</span> <span id="s829">I heard that the American Army is not far from here, because the Americans were pulling back and the Russians were going forward.</span> <span id="s830">At Pilsen, that is a famous town of beer in Czechoslovakia, and I said to my sister-in-law and my girlfriend, "Let's go," and we walked and walked until we find the Americans.</span> <span id="s831">That was the first piece of chocolate I have eaten in five whole years.</span> <span id="s832">And they were so happy to see us, and we looked so horrible.</span> <span id="s833">And I was with the Americans.</span> <span id="s834">But, then, I found myself back in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">JF: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">HG: They took us back, to a quarantine.</span> <span id="s837">A camp, quarantine, Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s838">That is the place where Hitler was in prison and wrote Mein Kampf, that little town.</span> <span id="s839">All of a sudden I found myself, again, in a camp, with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s840">I couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s841">And a Negro tried to take me down from a truck, and I started screaming because I never before in my life was in the arms of a black man.</span> <span id="s842">And he tried to pacify me, and I was so ashamed later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">JF: These were the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">HG: American soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">JF: And the camp was...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">HG: Landsberg am Lech.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">JF: Which was a detention camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">HG: No, sort of a quarantine to get us all together, and then the UNRRA started to send in packages, and to rebuild us a little bit.</span> <span id="s849">And, it started a search for relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">JF: How long did it take you to recuperate physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">HG: I was very sick, very sick, physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s852">As a matter of fact, I must have had a breakdown, because everybody was rejoicing and I was always crying and sitting alone, and not talking to any--especially the tragedy--I couldn't play the piano.</span> <span id="s853">My fingers couldn't move anymore.</span> <span id="s854">I thought this is it.</span> <span id="s855">And there was very little medical help at that time.</span> <span id="s856">It was not organized.</span> <span id="s857">It was just the beginning of the end, and I was very sick with an illness which is called furunculosis.</span> <span id="s858">That's big boils all over your body from dirt, from malnutrition, and each one had to be operated on actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">HG: To open them, to lance.</span> <span id="s861">Everybody took a poke at me, and I couldn't lie down.</span> <span id="s862">I couldn't sit down so I was standing for 36 hours at a window because I couldn't lie down.</span> <span id="s863">I had those boils all over my body.</span> <span id="s864">I needed some kind of medical help, some kind of--so one gave me--an American soldier gave me a penicillin--at that time, already, the first time penicillin which would have saved me, I exchanged it with a German for a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s865">I didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s866">You know, we were cut off from news for four years.</span> <span id="s867">Shall I go on, after the liberation, or shall I stop right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">JF: How long were you in this quarantine?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">HG: Until one day they had an excursion to Berchtesgaden to see Hitler's summer bunker.</span> <span id="s870">It was in an eagle's nest on top of a mountain.</span> <span id="s871">I went there, and I met on the ship my future husband, whom I knew from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">JF: You knew him from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">I didn't know he survived.</span> <span id="s875">He didn't believe that I survived, and six weeks later we were married.</span> <span id="s876">And he took me--he was the president of the Jewish communities, very prominent man by the name of Jacob Gottlieb.</span> <span id="s877">His nephew is now the first ambassador to Egypt, Ben Eleazar; and I married this man and we had a beautiful son, Eli, who is today a doctor of medicine in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">JF: Where did you marry him?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">HG: In Germany, in Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">JF: And you lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">HG: Yes.</span> <span id="s882">Well, with him, it started life, a slow recovery.</span> <span id="s883">He had a big piano, he had a beautiful apartment from a German general, and we were very happy together.</span> <span id="s884">My husband was a Zionist, and he wanted to go to Israel, to Palestine, at that time.</span> <span id="s885">He was very active with Begin at that time.</span> <span id="s886">They were friends, and ammunition was stored under my bed in Germany in the '48 War, and I refused to go to Palestine because I said I am too sick, and I don't want my child to get into a war again.</span> <span id="s887">I just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s888">I said I wish to go to America.</span> <span id="s889">And he went with me.</span> <span id="s890">I arrived...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">JF: Excuse me one minute, what was it like being in Germany after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">HG: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s893">My baby was two months old, and you put them out in a carriage into the garden, and there lived a German family on the first floor, and all of a sudden I hear a scream, and there is a ten year old boy standing over my baby with a big needle sticking into his hand.</span> <span id="s894">I run down and say, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s895">He said, "My mother told me it is a Jewish child."</span> <span id="s896">And that was after the war--so poisoned were the minds of the German people.</span> <span id="s897">Of course, my husband took care of her.</span> <span id="s898">They had to move.</span> <span id="s899">He was active with the American government, the governors, American authorities.</span> <span id="s900">They respected him.</span> <span id="s901">He organized the Jewish life after the war with Judge Leventhal from Philadelphia; and I decided that we should come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">JF: When you say that you were still sick, in what way were you still sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">HG: They still performed operations on me until a professor in Germany, by name Professor Fulk, made a vaccine for me from my own, and saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">JF: The operations...?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">HG: Took place in Regensburg, after my marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">JF: And this had to do with the disease of the boils that you talked about before.</span> <span id="s907">Did you ever have any repercussions from the stab wounds that got infected?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">HG: No, they didn't heal right.</span> <span id="s909">I still have very big marks of it.</span> <span id="s910">And I still was under--I needed care, I was depressed all the time.</span> <span id="s911">I could not shake off these tragic events of my personal life, my family, the catastrophe of the Jewish people, the atrocities, the thought that man can do this to man.</span> <span id="s912">And I made up my mind and promised myself that should I survive that hell, I would go around wherever they ask me and I shall tell.</span> <span id="s913">And I would like to go back to that thought that I thought I will change my religion, but this also changed in me, that I said, "Why shouldn't the ones who are guilty be ashamed?"</span> <span id="s914">I felt like a coward and I said, "No."</span> <span id="s915">I shall become a fighter.</span> <span id="s916">I shall fight for human rights.</span> <span id="s917">I shall fight that the Jews should have a state of their own, that they should not be running around like a collarless dog, and that they should be protected by their own state in case they need to be protected.</span> <span id="s918">And I promised myself that I will make my contribution to tell the world to beware, and to be aware of movements which are dangerous, of people, of dictators, and to guard democracy, to fight for democracy, and to fight for the survival of the State of Israel.</span> <span id="s919">And I made this my life's work.</span> <span id="s920">And I became more Jewish than I ever was before.</span> <span id="s921">But not the kind of Jew who hates other nations, because the Holocaust was a holocaust of the human spirit for all nations.</span> <span id="s922">The people have forgotten humanities.</span> <span id="s923">They studied too much technology.</span> <span id="s924">Even today, I wish that we would go back to humanities, and how to respect another human being.</span> <span id="s925">The greatest shock and disappointment was for a young woman to realize that the homosapiens is not what it should be, and that the human being has so much more to learn, to change, to become a real human being.</span> <span id="s926">And it is my hope and wish that the world has learned a great lesson in Hitler's atrocities.</span> <span id="s927">The tragedy of the German nation is that they almost believed that what they are doing is right, and that they will save the world from Jews, who are the cause of all their troubles.</span> <span id="s928">Little did they realize that the Holocaust is also their problem.</span> <span id="s929">Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s930">It is a problem of the non-Jewish world, who have to learn and to change, and my greatest wish is that this should happen in the near future and that there will never, never again be such atrocities.</span> <span id="s931">And when the Jews say "Never again," they mean it today.</span> <span id="s932">With a strong Israel this should never happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">(Long pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s934">JF: You would like to make an addition now?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">HG: I would like to say how grateful I am to the country of America, who accepted me, where I was able to rebuild my life and have such a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s936">My second husband taught me, Jacob Goodman, not to live in the past, not to forget the past, but not to keep on living in the past, and to wallow in the sorrow forever.</span> <span id="s937">I have also a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s938">My son is a doctor, my daughter is a pianist-composer who is very much involved in the study of the Holocaust and the effect which it had on the children of survivors.</span> <span id="s939">She just composed the music to the Diary of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s940">I am very proud that my children grew up without prejudice, without hatred towards other nations.</span> <span id="s941">I have never told them until they grew up.</span> <span id="s942">I did not wish, in the formative years, to poison their minds and their hearts with revenge.</span> <span id="s943">And I am sure that they, in turn, will make their contribution to people.</span> <span id="s944">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
