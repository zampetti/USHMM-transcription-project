But somehow, they postponed, I don’t know who interviewed but it was postponed.</span> <span id="s45">The young mens were taken to clean.</span> <span id="s46">And our town was one of the biggest...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">LF: Industries, one of the biggest...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">GK: What they have now in Camden?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">LF: Housing projects in Camden?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">GK: Umm...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">LF: We can think about it.</span> <span id="s52">I know, a prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">GK: A prison.</span> <span id="s54">Isn’t that something that my mind gets blank!</span> <span id="s55">It was one of the biggest prisons in Poland.</span> <span id="s56">So the military ordered in there in this prison, and the Jewish boys were taken to clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s57">I’m ashamed to say that they had to clean the toilets with bare hands.</span> <span id="s58">No brushes were used, and it wasn’t toilets like it is here to flush with water, but it was different.</span> <span id="s59">And then every day they caught boys and girls to work in the prison, for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s60">They killed chickens, the girls did clean the chickens, and packed, and they sent to Germany, to the families, or I don’t know what they did with them.</span> <span id="s61">Then came, after a few weeks didn’t take long, we have to give up all the furs.</span> <span id="s62">It wasn’t a rich town like I said, but everyone had the fur coat; it was the style.</span> <span id="s63">Women had diamond engagement rings, had a golden chain in a watch on the neck and so, first we had to give up the furs.</span> <span id="s64">Then, a week later, we had to give up all the silver what we had.</span> <span id="s65">Of course, some Jewish people did hide in bunkers.</span> <span id="s66">For example, by us in the house, my father made a bunker, and he did hide candlesticks, flatware, kiddush cups.</span> <span id="s67">Every poor family had some silver from wedding gifts, because it wasn’t this hard to give money to the wedding; whoever came to the wedding they gave a gift, a kiddush cup, a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">So he made a bunker to hide this because we thought maybe the war was going to be over.</span> <span id="s69">As a matter of fact, my father was hiding there with three other people in this bunker until he was killed.</span> <span id="s70">Then, when was to give up all the silver, and the gold, and the diamonds, and every possession, whatever somebody had, you have to give it away.</span> <span id="s71">A year...this took place, almost a year, a year, because this was like the ghetto place from Krakow, when was made the ghetto in Plaszow, so a lot of Jewish people came to Wisnicz to hide, because Wisnicz was the whole town the ghetto, and all the Jews from around wherever it was judenrein.</span> <span id="s72">This mean free from Jews.</span> <span id="s73">So the ghetto in Wisnicz, we had yet what to eat and what to drink, because it was a big problem, food, during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">LF: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">GK: And when he gathered all the Jews in Wisnicz, they made Wisnicz judenrein.</span> <span id="s76">Without anything, it was said that the next day in the morning everybody should come to the Appellplatz for roll call in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s77">It was such a big place.</span> <span id="s78">But my father hide himself in the bunker.</span> <span id="s79">My mother went in the woods, nearby little village, and my two sisters went with the transport.</span> <span id="s80">They said that the young people they will take to work.</span> <span id="s81">As a matter of fact, my oldest sister had the children by a Christian family.</span> <span id="s82">She gave everything from her possession, whatever she had, that they should keep the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">LF: How many children did she have?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">GK: Three children.</span> <span id="s85">And when we were standing on the roll call, she came with the children.</span> <span id="s86">So, of course, the children were in a terrible way.</span> <span id="s87">You wouldn’t even believe that this could happen.</span> <span id="s88">A little baby, she was six months old, a soldier took her and hit her with two feet in head, and then with this little angel head, he knocked on a tree.</span> <span id="s89">This picture I always had before my eyes, because people wouldn’t believe that such an intelligent nation like the German, they could do such a terrible thing to innocent children.</span> <span id="s90">Then they went, me and my younger sister escaped from this place.</span> <span id="s91">I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s92">I don’t know where I got this ambition, but like somebody would pull me away, we two, the two of us, we went in the neighborhood village.</span> <span id="s93">We was hidden there for eight days.</span> <span id="s94">We were laying on the ebbek [perhaps, attic] from a house.</span> <span id="s95">It was, I knew her from before.</span> <span id="s96">So laying there straight, and at night, she used to bring us a little bit food and drink.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, I paid her very, very well for it.</span> <span id="s98">And when it came after a week, she said she can’t hold us any more, we have to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s99">In the meantime, Wisnicz was judenrein, and everybody moved to Bochnia.</span> <span id="s100">This is a neighborhood city.</span> <span id="s101">And in Bochnia was a ghetto, too.</span> <span id="s102">So we moved all in this ghetto and we start a new life.</span> <span id="s103">A new life...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">LF: Do you want to stop a few minutes...?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">GK: Before it was judenrein, when it was announced the next day all the Jews has to stay to the Appellplatz, this means to the roll call, we had a lot of Torahs and whatever, from all the synagogues.</span> <span id="s106">So all the Jews gathered the Torahs, and they buried on the Jewish cemetery, and it was looking just like a big funeral.</span> <span id="s107">All the Jews from the whole city gathered together and to cry how we buried the holy scrolls.</span> <span id="s108">The next day was the roll call and was judenrein.</span> <span id="s109">So the younger people was chosen to go to work, and to cut woods in [not clear].</span> <span id="s110">This was a little wood, a forest, called [unclear], and there my brother-in-law was working, and the other brother-in-law was working there, but there sisters went to a transport, and we didn’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s111">They never came back, of course.</span> <span id="s112">Neither my mother came back to Bochnia to the ghetto, because the Polish people saw her and they told her, “If you don’t go right away from here, we will tell the German that a Jude is here.”</span> <span id="s113">How come that so many Jews went because of the Polish people.</span> <span id="s114">They didn’t help.</span> <span id="s115">The little boys, they learned one word, “Jude, Jude,” because the German didn’t recognize.</span> <span id="s116">The Jewish people in Europe looked very much alike the German women, and they did not recognize which woman is Jewish and which not.</span> <span id="s117">But the little, the boys and girls, point with the finger, “Jude, Jude.”</span> <span id="s118">When they said, “Jude,” so they had their share.</span> <span id="s119">So they told my mother, “If you don’t go right away, if you don’t leave this place, we will call the police, and we will tell that you are here.</span> <span id="s120">So my mother came to Bochnia, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s121">I did not recognize her.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">LF: How long hadn’t you seen her?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">GK: A short time, but the way she looked...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">LF: Just a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">GK: Maybe two months she was hidden in the forest.</span> <span id="s126">She looked so skinny.</span> <span id="s127">She lost probably half of her weight.</span> <span id="s128">I don’t know because at home we didn’t weigh, we didn’t care about the figures but she was so skinny in her face, it got so changed, so black from not eating, not sleeping, not washing, and not changing.</span> <span id="s129">So, we were, my younger sister, my mother, and me were in Bochnia in ghetto.</span> <span id="s130">Through somebody who I knew from before, he tried that I should work in a factory where they make the soldiers the Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">LF: Uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">GK: Uniforms.</span> <span id="s133">This factory was called...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">LF: Well, it doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">GK: I worked there, my younger sister, and my mother.</span> <span id="s136">We were in Bochnia, in ghetto, for a year.</span> <span id="s137">It was a terrible time, because one time they came around that we couldn’t cook, special when come Friday.</span> <span id="s138">We didn’t have gas stoves but coal stoves, so the chimney, through the chimney came the smoke...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">LF: Smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">GK: So they saw that here in this house is somebody cooking.</span> <span id="s141">We weren’t allowed to cook.</span> <span id="s142">We weren’t allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s143">Once we weren’t allowed all different things.</span> <span id="s144">They wanted to mutche out [torment], you know, to drop dead without use a bullet.</span> <span id="s145">After a year, my mother again tried to hide in a bunker, but the bunker was recovered.</span> <span id="s146">So she, we was told everybody should came again in Bochnia, to the roll call.</span> <span id="s147">So the elderly people, they made one line, the middle aged, they made another line, and the young people another line.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">LF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">GK: And I was lucky enough to be with my younger sister in one line.</span> <span id="s150">So we were chosen to go to Szebnie.</span> <span id="s151">Szebnie is called a Durchgangslager.</span> <span id="s152">[transit camp] Nobody all the thirty years talked about Szebnie.</span> <span id="s153">Szebnie was a small camp, and not too many Jewish people were there, but I will tell you what happened there.</span> <span id="s154">That is why the people should know what they did.</span> <span id="s155">My mother was chosen with all the elderly people, elderly, my mother was 52 years, she wasn’t elderly but...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">LF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">GK: But by them it was elderly.</span> <span id="s158">So I wanted to go together with my mother, because we all knew we will had the execution; we waited for the execution because everybody had to go, one thing we knew.</span> <span id="s159">We didn’t have anything to fight with.</span> <span id="s160">So when I want to go to my mother, they were standing with a big dog, and a dog jumped at me, and he caught a piece of my leg.</span> <span id="s161">But it didn’t matter, and he pushed me back that I should go to my row, where I belong.</span> <span id="s162">From there this was...Next month is going to be the memorial, what we are keeping on Bochnia, on the Bochnia evacuation.</span> <span id="s163">We came to Szebnie.</span> <span id="s164">It was a roll call in the morning, and there was...the Lagerführer was Zhimik, his name was Zhimik.</span> <span id="s165">He probably was a Volksdeutsche [of German origin] because the name Zhimik is not a real German name.</span> <span id="s166">So, like usually, with the finger point, “Right, left, right, left,” and my little sister was chosen “Left.”</span> <span id="s167">We didn’t know, because this was the first time what we saw with the “Right, left,” because until Szebnie, we didn’t know what this means.</span> <span id="s168">A day...At this time, this people who was chosen “Left” was barracked in a different barrack, and we were in a different barrack.</span> <span id="s169">But at night I went to my sister and I hugged her and I said, “Oh, dear God, thank God that you are here.”</span> <span id="s170">So she said to me, “Listen, we are all here for counted days.</span> <span id="s171">We know what is waiting for us.”</span> <span id="s172">And the men start to pile a big pile of woods, and we didn’t know yet for what.</span> <span id="s173">Next morning, early in the morning, came an open Auto with...I don’t know a mistake or not, I think, 200 or 400 people, Jewish people...young, beautiful, from Tarnow.</span> <span id="s174">This was not far from Szebnie.</span> <span id="s175">Szebnie is a little town near Jasno.</span> <span id="s176">So these people who was chosen in Szebnie together with the other people from Tarnow was taken.</span> <span id="s177">And it was made a very big fire, and alive they was throwing in this fire.</span> <span id="s178">And nobody could hear even this crying, the pain, what they went through, because we were like paralyzed.</span> <span id="s179">I did write in Jewish a little about Szebnie.</span> <span id="s180">It was published in our bulletin from the New Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">LF: Do you have a copy of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">GK: I have it, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">LF: Would you give it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">GK: I have the book.</span> <span id="s185">It is in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">LF: Before I leave could I have a copy of it?</span> <span id="s187">Would you like to read it into this?</span> <span id="s188">Do you want to read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">GK: [Yiddish spoken here].</span></p> <p><span id="s190">In Undenk mine

this?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">GK: 1974.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">LF: In 1974.</span> <span id="s220">I think it’s important that you recited that into this, and, if you will, I’d love to have a copy so we could put it along with what we need to put it along with.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">GK: So in Szebnie, we were only for three months.</span> <span id="s222">After three months...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">LF: Did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">GK: Yes, I worked in a sewing factory.</span> <span id="s225">But I didn’t do any sewing.</span> <span

most of the community work that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">GK: This was no community; it was just a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">LF: Just a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">GK: There was no civil people.</span> <span id="s233">And most of the people were working in the uniform-sewing factory, and some was in the cleaning department.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">LF: How many people would you say were in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">GK: In the camp was about between 2,000 and 2,500.</span> <span id="s236">And from there after three months, we stood again at the roll call...always with these roll calls...and Zhimik, he said, “Ich bin euer Vater.</span> <span id="s237">Ich geh mit wie ihr geht, geh ich mit euch.”</span> <span id="s238">[I am your father.</span> <span id="s239">I go with you.</span> <span id="s240">As you go, I go with you.]</span> <span id="s241">This was true.</span> <span id="s242">He went with us but we went to Auschwitz,

ready to talk a little bit more.</span> <span id="s247">You ended where?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">GK: From Szebnie we went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">LF: Let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s250">When you were in your town, was there a Jewish Council, a Judenrat, in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">GK: Not in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">LF: Not in your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">GK: In Bochnia was a Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">LF: So there was none in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">GK: No, in our town there was, until was judenrein, was more or less free, in the Polish magistrate...took care.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">LF: Was there any communication between the outside world by the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">GK: None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">LF: None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">GK: No, no, we had a newspaper, Nowy Dziennik [New Daily] it was called, but we did not receive as soon as the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s260">We were completely shut out of the outside world.</span> <span id="s261">The only thing what we knew, when the people came in from different cities where it was more dangerous than by us, so they came in, so they told, “The Germans is doing this, the Germans is doing that.”</span> <span id="s262">One told a story, the Germans came in his house and he had a beautiful daughter.</span> <span id="s263">They told her she should undress completely and stand on the table, and they made with her all different exercises, and he said it was terrible for him to see.</span> <span id="s264">So, all different stories what...we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">LF: What you were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">GK: Yeah, what we were just told.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">LF: Well, tell me, was there any underground in the ghetto that you knew about?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">GK: Not in our town.</span> <span id="s269">It was underground, but not in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">LF: Not in your town.</span> <span id="s271">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">GK: It was a little farther than other states, in other...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">LF: Did the Poles help the Nazis to prosecute the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">GK: Yes, that’s what I told.</span> <span id="s275">They learned to say “Jude.”</span> <span id="s276">This was their thing, “Jude.”</span> <span id="s277">My mother would survive, my father would survive, because my mother spoke a very beautiful Polish, and they really would not recognize that she is Jewish, only that she was wearing a wig.</span> <span id="s278">All the Jewish women that was religious they was wearing a sheitel [wig].</span> <span id="s279">Of the Poles...my mother went and my father was discovered from the bunker.</span> <span id="s280">My father was, I forgot to tell you, my father and six other Jews were in the bunker, and they took them out, and they were shot in middle of...before the city hall.</span> <span id="s281">They were lined up, they were all shot, and two children.</span> <span id="s282">The Poles then told me, and they were all buried in one hole.</span> <span id="s283">Not even a grave, in one hole.</span> <span id="s284">They were put in tar.</span> <span id="s285">You know what this is?</span> <span id="s286">This is the black on the roofs.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">LF: Yes, tar.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">GK: Yeah, they put in this hole, tar, and they make a fire, and they were dancing and laughing, “This is what happens to Jews who want to do bad things to the Germans.”</span> <span id="s289">The Jews going to fight against the Germans with their bare hands...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">LF: And then, then it was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">GK: Now we are...I forgot where I am.</span> <span id="s292">Now I am in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">LF: Now tell about how you got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">GK: When we, from Szebnie, Zhimik went with us...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">LF: The leader, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">GK: The leader, and coming there was the same, “Left, right, left, right.”</span> <span id="s297">We didn’t know we were in wagons, that even cows have better wagons, because at least they have a window.</span> <span id="s298">We were completely dark, a little bit straw on the floor, and nothing to wear, just the one dress that you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">LF: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">GK: This was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">LF: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">GK: Yes, then was judenfrei Szebnie.</span> <span id="s303">They cleaned up, they cleaned up already Wisnicz where I was, they cleaned out [unclear] because before I was in [unclear] and then they cleaned up Bochnia, and now they cleaned up Szbenie.</span> <span id="s304">So from Szebnie we went in the wagons.</span> <span id="s305">A lot of people fainted, some died, and we didn’t have no water to drink, and from eating, forget about it.</span> <span id="s306">And no sleeping, only one on each other; we had to go in the bathroom, we just made.</span> <span id="s307">Excuse me for my expression, but this was the truth.</span> <span id="s308">You wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s309">Sometimes I ask myself, how could I go through all this, and still be a human being and still want to live, and to have everything what my eyes can see that I can afford.</span> <span id="s310">I mean I don’t want things, but how can I..</span> <span id="s311">.</span> <span id="s312">it’s impossible to believe.</span> <span id="s313">We were sitting, and we were making, one and two, like where we were sitting, and we didn’t have no paper, no nothing.</span> <span id="s314">Worse than cows or horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">LF: This was...you were with your mother...?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">GK: No.</span> <span id="s317">Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">LF: No, your mother had already...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">GK: Nobody, my mother was taken already in Bochnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">LF: And you didn’t see her any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">GK: If somebody was taken, it was good-bye.</span> <span id="s322">You never saw again, and my sister was taken in Szebnie.</span> <span id="s323">So I was by myself, survival, which I expect that my end is going to be in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s324">But somehow when he turned left and right, I was in a row to go to the camp, and the others went straight to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s325">My cousin was there, my friends...and they went right to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s326">Coming to Birkenau...this is Auschwitz, but near...so we went to the sauna.</span> <span id="s327">The sauna is the shower.</span> <span id="s328">First, there, they cut completely the hair, like I had beautiful long, curly red hair, and my curls fell on the floor and I start to cry, and the girl who cut my hair, she said, “What you crying?</span> <span id="s329">The hair is nothing.</span> <span id="s330">You see, everything goes to the oven.”</span> <span id="s331">I don’t...cry.</span> <span id="s332">Then we went to the sauna, take a shower.</span> <span id="s333">They gave us five minutes cold water and during the five minutes you couldn’t even wash up.</span> <span id="s334">Then they put us on the uniform, long dresses in stripes, gray and blue, and on the head a handkerchief, a kerchief, and they gave us one pot, one pint pot.</span> <span id="s335">This is for our dishes and our furniture and...out in the row, to stay in line.</span> <span id="s336">I stood in line and I asked what is next to me, I said, “Who are you?</span> <span id="s337">Who are all these old women?”</span> <span id="s338">So she said, “Genia, don’t you recognize me?</span> <span id="s339">I am Velsa.”</span> <span id="s340">My girlfriend, what we were together in home.</span> <span id="s341">We went to school together and we were in the camp together.</span> <span id="s342">We were in the ghetto together, we were in Auschwitz together...But...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">LF: She had changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">GK: Taken off the hair and put on this uniform we didn’t look like women, we looked like witches.</span> <span id="s345">Worse than a witch, even.</span> <span id="s346">Not like human beings.</span> <span id="s347">Then we went in the camp.</span> <span id="s348">We had six weeks quarantine.</span> <span id="s349">Quarantined, that means not to go to work, not to go to the oven to wait.</span> <span id="s350">What did we wait?</span> <span id="s351">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s352">Till Mashiach [Messiah] will come and he will liberate us?</span> <span id="s353">Nobody will listen to us, nobody looked for us, nobody wanted to liberate us.</span> <span id="s354">And the six weeks was terrible.</span> <span id="s355">Everyone of us, we were all young girls, had Durchfall [diarrhea].</span> <span id="s356">I’m getting very nervous here; we all had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s357">And to have diarrhea in Auschwitz was completely like a dead person, because it was no toilet, excuse me for expression, no anything to clean up, excuse me, for I express myself, and a toilet was outside, a room, maybe twenty holes, and we went in and we did and that’s all.</span> <span id="s358">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s359">We didn’t have any water to wash up.</span> <span id="s360">So we were sleeping four in a Koye [wooden bunk].</span> <span id="s361">The Koye was as big as this table, so the four was laying on one side, one next to each other.</span> <span id="s362">If somebody want to turn, all four had to turn because it wasn’t place that one should lay on the bed or on the belly.</span> <span id="s363">Everyone had to lay only on the right side or on the left side, and on the Koye it wasn’t so beautiful too, because nothing to clean up, so we made up between each other, every morning we would take the tea, what we getting, and one portion of tea we would divide between the four of us, and three portions of tea we would wash our shirt, our...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">LF: Clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">GK: Not the clothing, our undershirt.</span> <span id="s366">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s367">Pants we didn’t wear, underpants, just the undershirt.</span> <span id="s368">And so this went on for six weeks.</span> <span id="s369">After six weeks, I was chosen to go to a factory to work.</span> <span id="s370">This was ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s371">We did make Einsatzstücke zu Zündbomben [probably, inserts for incendiary bombs] for a German firm.</span> <span id="s372">During the time, when I was working, I was working next to a Pulverraum [powder storage room] where...so the girls smuggled out Pulver, how you say in English, this powder, this powder to the mens...and the mens did...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">LF: Was it gun powder?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">GK: Gun powder, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">LF: And they smuggled it to the men’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">GK: They smuggled it to the men’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">LF: Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">GK: Also the...workers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">LF: Workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">GK: Workers there, and they were in...[pause] girls smuggled out the gun powder to the mens, and the mens tried to blow out one crematorium.</span> <span id="s381">Unfortunately, it wasn’t 100 per cent done like they was planning to do, but they were caught, and the four girls were hanged in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s382">This was very short before we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">LF: How long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">GK: Almost two years, not quite.</span> <span id="s385">Not quite.</span> <span id="s386">During...when I was in Auschwitz, three times I was chosen to go to the crematorium, but somehow a good angel always pushed me away and I escape.</span> <span id="s387">I want to tell you one incident, it’s a shame to even talk what they did, not to listen, but even to talk...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">LF: It’s important that you talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">GK: In January, it was in the month of January, I think it was 1943 or 1944, I don’t recall exactly, anyhow, they wanted make Entlausung [delousing], general cleaning.</span> <span id="s390">So everything we had to take off, naked like we were born, and we went out, outside, and in Poland January outside is not like here.</span> <span id="s391">There is snow at least four or five inches high, and completely naked without shoes, without stockings, the whole Block was then standing.</span> <span id="s392">Who was inside, so they warmed up, one to each other, the back to the front.</span> <span id="s393">And who was outside, around, so you made a round to stay close to each other, that we should warm up.</span> <span id="s394">And these soldiers were standing a little bit farther, and laughing, and they were shooting from the thing, not to us, they were shooting, just so, to make, scare us, that they going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s395">And, I don’t know how they could do this.</span> <span id="s396">Now you would ask somebody to go out, you don’t know what mean winter, because here is no winter compared to the winter in Europe.</span> <span id="s397">And to go out naked and to stay for an hour...that we weren’t frozen stiff, frozen, with this food, the nourishment what we had, only what we had, maybe, the foundation what we had at home.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t know, it’s a miracle.</span> <span id="s399">It’s just a miracle.</span> <span id="s400">Like all other miracles that they said with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s401">Once, I had swollen feet because of the [unclear], probably, and my feet got swollen.</span> <span id="s402">And so I came to work, so the Kapo told me that I limp a little bit.</span> <span id="s403">She said, “What you limping.”</span> <span id="s404">So I showed her I had here something, so she said, “O.K., come into the doctor.”</span> <span id="s405">I went into the doctor because this Kommando protect the company, protect where we worked, protect the Häftlingers [prisoners].</span> <span id="s406">So he protect us.</span> <span id="s407">So in there, there was a doctor.</span> <span id="s408">So we can imagine he made the operation, from here to here, without freezing, without any anesthesia, without nothing, just to cut in the [unclear].</span> <span id="s409">Going home I limped because my feet hurt more than before yet, so, of course, that’s when they told me “Left.”</span> <span id="s410">I have to go in another barracks, so tomorrow is going to be a transport to another crematorium, so I go with them.</span> <span id="s411">So the whole night I didn’t sleep, I didn’t cry that I should survive.</span> <span id="s412">I prayed to God that I shouldn’t suffer too long, that the death should come in one second, that I shouldn’t suffer this thing because some...we were in the Block where the chimneys were burning and the fire we see, day and night we did see the fire.</span> <span id="s413">And the smell of the bones and on the flesh, it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s414">But, somehow, in the morning I didn’t ask nobody nothing and I got up, and I went in the line, and I went to work.</span> <span id="s415">And so nobody remembered me, even.</span> <span id="s416">There is so many things what I went through in this Auschwitz that is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s417">When...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">LF: Do you still dream, do you still dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">GK: Now, since my husband died, it’s a year ago, I start to dream and the camp...I dream every night about my husband, but till then I dreamed every single night, and especially now in this time, this time of the year, every year was a different episode.</span> <span id="s420">So we went through different tortures.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">LF: You relived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">GK: Yes, so this time of the year is the worst time of the year.</span> <span id="s423">When in 1945 in January, we closed the camp, Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">LF: You say, “We closed.”</span> <span id="s425">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">GK: All the Häftlinger, all the Jews who was still alive, because the Russian came in.</span> <span id="s427">In 1945, they were already in Krakow, and this came to our knowledge.</span> <span id="s428">I mean the girls around.</span> <span id="s429">We were very close with each other.</span> <span id="s430">As a matter of fact, when we were sitting at work, so what we was talking?</span> <span id="s431">About food, nothing but food.</span> <span id="s432">Oh, when we will be liberated!</span> <span id="s433">So the only wish was mine...Everyone said that we have a small table in a small room and a whole bread on the table and a piece of butter and a coffee.</span> <span id="s434">And when we going to make a party, so we will cook, potatoes with meatballs and borscht.</span> <span id="s435">This was a Polish dish.</span> <span id="s436">And our wish was only to have a whole bread.</span> <span id="s437">In Auschwitz I took sick.</span> <span id="s438">I had typhus.</span> <span id="s439">I had high fever, I didn’t know how high, but I didn’t know what’s going on with me, so I couldn’t eat for two days.</span> <span id="s440">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">LF: Were you hospitalized, did you have medical care?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">GK: What else?</span> <span id="s443">What you think, I was in paradise?</span> <span id="s444">I was in Auschwitz!</span></p> <p><span id="s445">LF: There was no doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">GK: No, God forbid, I would go to the hospital, they would put me in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s447">So I was laying on this bed, so-called, and didn’t eat for two days nothing, so the girls who were sleeping with me, they took my bread and my soup and whatever we had there, and one of the girls said, “I will give you something.”</span> <span id="s448">So she give me half of her carrot.</span> <span id="s449">Not washed, not scrubbed, with all the dirt.</span> <span id="s450">I ate it, and this brought me to life.</span> <span id="s451">To this day, whenever I am sick, I’m taking a carrot, but, of course, all different style, to eat it.</span> <span id="s452">When I was sick, I couldn’t go to work, so the oldest from the Block, she said, “If you don’t go to work, you know you’re going to be sent, you know where.”</span> <span id="s453">So I said, “O.K., I will go tomorrow to work.”</span> <span id="s454">I couldn’t go to work, but I went.</span> <span id="s455">We were sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">I go now back to the end of Auschwitz when, when these girls were hanged, so we were in the first line.</span> <span id="s457">We, this means the girls, because we were working in the next room from the gun powder.</span> <span id="s458">So the oldest said, “You see the girls now are hanging because they wanted to blow the crematorium.</span> <span id="s459">Next, you are coming.”</span> <span id="s460">They mean, us, that we are coming.</span> <span id="s461">So all of us, the girls, we were twenty girls around this table what we was working, so said, “Oh, now it is our time, thank God that we wait so long, that tomorrow is going to be our day.”</span> <span id="s462">But, in the meantime, the Russian was rushing too much, and they came in January to Krakow...so they moved the camp from Auschwitz to deep Germany.</span> <span id="s463">I don’t know what for they needed us, what for they made so much fuss with us.</span> <span id="s464">But, anyhow...and this.</span> <span id="s465">And this was called death march of Auschwitz, because it was in the winter time, January 18, 1945.</span> <span id="s466">I have written...you want me to read this...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">LF: Yes, I do, and I would like to change the tape on this so that we will be sure to get the whole thing on.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Perhaps “intervened” is meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Association of Jewish New Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">GENIA KLAPHOLZ [1-1- PAGE 1] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive GENIA KLAPHOLZ [1-2- PAGE 15] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s472">LF: This is an interview with Mrs. Genia Klapholz, K-L-A-P-H-O-L-Z.</span> <span id="s473">You were saying that you find it so hard to believe...and you were talking about...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">GK: I am a believer.</span> <span id="s475">I believe in God, I believe in miracles, because I am born and raised in a very religious home.</span> <span id="s476">My father and my mother was righteous people, I could say.</span> <span id="s477">They were learned in Jewish and they gave this to their children.</span> <span id="s478">Every Friday night in the winter time, especially, when the nights was long.</span> <span id="s479">We didn’t have any television, God forbid, if we had, we wouldn’t watch it on Shabbas.</span> <span id="s480">And after my father came from the synagogue, he would sing “Sholem Alechem,” “Ayshes Hayil,” all the Jewish songs, and then was the Kiddush and the meal, and after the meal, he used to sit and always tell stories from the Rabbi, from this Rabbi, from that Rabbi, from all the Rabbis, the stories.</span> <span id="s481">And Saturday night was the same thing, after Havdalah.</span> <span id="s482">So we used to make a meal, this was called in Jewish the melaveh malka.</span> <span id="s483">This means a meal for the queen, to end, because the entering of Shabbas is like the queen entering the house... And we have to...welcome.</span> <span id="s484">So my father told me once a story, not to me, to the family.</span> <span id="s485">How do I translate this in English?</span> <span id="s486">That the light of King David will never go out, that will go on forever.</span> <span id="s487">God will punish the Jewish people, but, he will never destroy the nation.</span> <span id="s488">Even once, he told a story that in a little town, it was a very stormy day and everything went, the houses and the trees, and nothing was left over after this storm.</span> <span id="s489">But they saw one little tree was, and from this little tree grew the whole forest and again they rebuilt this city.</span> <span id="s490">I had to make very short.</span> <span id="s491">But this is all this in my mind, even it is so many years, because I practice this in my life.</span> <span id="s492">I remember when Daddy said that God will never...</span></p> <p><span id="s493">LF: Forget, abandon?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">GK: Anyhow, my whole family went.</span> <span id="s495">I was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s496">Why did I survive?</span> <span id="s497">Why didn’t I go?</span> <span id="s498">My sister was better than I.</span> <span id="s499">She was more religious than I was.</span> <span id="s500">My mother, for sure was a better woman, a woman of the valley [GK must mean “woman of valor”], like they say, “ayshes hayil.”</span> <span id="s501">My sisters were all very religious and very fine people.</span> <span id="s502">Why did I survive?</span> <span id="s503">So then, it reminds me the story of my father, I survive that from me should be another generation.</span> <span id="s504">I thought I will never be married.</span> <span id="s505">I will go to Israel, and I will work on the kibbutz, and this is going to be my life.</span> <span id="s506">But, then, I said, “No, my father said different.</span> <span id="s507">My father said when one branch remains, from this branch has to be a tree, and from the tree has to be another tree, and another tree and it will come a forest.”</span> <span id="s508">So I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">LF: So let’s get back to the death march from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s510">You say you wrote this little poem?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">GK: Yes, I wrote this.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">LF: You

us?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Over field and snow covered ways, we go from Auschwitz by the last breath of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">It sounds like music in the ears.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">As bullets fly from the guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Falls a brother, falls a child, A last cry is carried by the wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Who will carry them to a Jewish grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Who will say kaddish for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Dear God, only You alone See the Jewish suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Open Your eyes and look down upon Your tents And see how the Germans have murdered Your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">I beg You, God, You shall not silent be To take revenge of murderers, do not avoid it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">The Death March from Auschwitz (in Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s538">By Genia Klapholz</span></p> <p><span id="s539">GK: On the march, so this, wasn’t, already, the soldier by themself, they killed whoever, they just look at somebody and if he didn’t see something, maybe he smiled, maybe he didn’t look the look he wanted him to look, kill him, kill him.</span> <span id="s540">And the snow was red from blood.</span> <span id="s541">We were the last Kommando, the last from the Auschwitz, so that’s why we did see the what had happened before.</span> <span id="s542">So we saw, the first thing when we came, and we saw the snow is red, so I asked my next one I said, “What has happened here?</span> <span id="s543">Do they take us here to kill us here on the snow?</span> <span id="s544">Under the bare sky?</span> <span id="s545">And people is going to see what they’re doing.</span> <span id="s546">Will they do this?”</span> <span id="s547">So she said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s548">It seems to be like, so take a look.</span> <span id="s549">He’s a dead one, here’s a dead one, here is the snow red.”</span> <span id="s550">And so we walked, we walked from Thursday night until Saturday night.</span> <span id="s551">Saturday night, we came to point called Raciborz.</span> <span id="s552">And there came the train, and suppose to pick us up and take us to deep Germany.</span> <span id="s553">And I was fed up already with everything.</span> <span id="s554">I said, “I am not going anymore.</span> <span id="s555">Let them kill me here, I stay here.”</span> <span id="s556">And I escaped from this march.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">LF: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">GK: How I did?</span> <span id="s559">It wasn’t so simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">LF: By yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">GK: No, me and two other girls was waiting to hide some place behind this barn.</span> <span id="s562">It was a barn, there where we were waiting for the train.</span> <span id="s563">And waiting behind this barn, and looking all over where we can hide.</span> <span id="s564">It was Saturday night, because it was winter, so the day was short.</span> <span id="s565">4:00 or 5:00, it was night already.</span> <span id="s566">So I said to her, “Listen, the barn is full, and we don’t have place where to go in.”</span> <span id="s567">So we went to this Aufseher, and we said, “Maybe we will go some place to sleep?”</span> <span id="s568">And so he said, “Yes, I’m going with you.”</span> <span id="s569">So ten girls went, this was on top of the hill, went down the hill, down the hill was a village, a Polish village, and we slept there.</span> <span id="s570">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s571">She gave us a bed with white blanket covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">LF: Who was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">GK: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">LF: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">GK: But she didn’t know who we are in the beginning.</span> <span id="s576">Then she knew we are from, escapers from the transport.</span> <span id="s577">And this was a bakery, so they brought beautiful rolls in the middle of the night, by 1:00 or 2:00, and we ate, and in the morning we begged her, “Keep us, keep us for two days.”</span> <span id="s578">She didn’t want to keep us.</span> <span id="s579">She said, “No you have to go back to the transport, and if you’re not going back, right here is the police, I will go on the police and I will tell them you are escape from the transport.”</span> <span id="s580">So we didn’t have any other choice.</span> <span id="s581">We went from there and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s582">LF: Did you feel she wanted to help you, but was afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">GK: No, she didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s584">She could help us.</span> <span id="s585">She could because this was the border from Germany and Poland, not the border, the real border, but where were fighting.</span> <span id="s586">The Russians were on this side in Rydmy and this was the other side, Raciborz.</span> <span id="s587">The other side was Raciborz, and Raciborz was in the middle, so she could tell we are from Rydmy.</span> <span id="s588">She didn’t want to help us.</span> <span id="s589">So, the rest of the girls went some place, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s590">And I said, “I am not going no place.</span> <span id="s591">They will kill me here, or I will stay here.”</span> <span id="s592">So me, and two other girls went into...it start to get daylight.</span> <span id="s593">I said, “Listen, it is Sunday morning and they are going to the church.</span> <span id="s594">Maybe we will go to the church.”</span> <span id="s595">But I didn’t have any clothes.</span> <span id="s596">I had the red stripe in the back, so they knew that I am from camp, and with the number on my hand and so, surely, where could I go there?</span> <span id="s597">Then we decide, we talk to each other, and said, “There is no time to talk and to decide.</span> <span id="s598">Let’s go in the first house.”</span> <span id="s599">We knocked on the door, and she let us in.</span> <span id="s600">I said, “Please, let us in your barn.”</span> <span id="s601">So she opened the barn.</span> <span id="s602">We went in and we went deep in the hay, and was laying there the whole day not talk a word, not do anything but quiet, in the hay.</span> <span id="s603">At night, she called us in the kitchen, and she asked us, “What nationality are you?”</span> <span id="s604">So I was afraid that the other girls would start so I said, “Jewish.”</span> <span id="s605">So she said, “Also people.”</span> <span id="s606">I heard, “Also people,” so she gave us water to wash up.</span> <span id="s607">This was the first thing what we needed, and she gave us something to eat, and we went back into the barn.</span> <span id="s608">So it went on for a week.</span> <span id="s609">Every night we came in the house to eat and the whole day we was in the barn.</span> <span id="s610">Later, they made the office in her house because the Germans moved, moved, every time a little bit farther, farther.</span> <span id="s611">It was full Germans around, and I was there for three months.</span> <span id="s612">And the three months was just as bad as the time in any other camp.</span> <span id="s613">I wouldn’t compare with Auschwitz, but with any other camp, like Szebnie, Bochnia and Wisnicz, and...and all other cities with the ghettos.</span> <span id="s614">Because I was afraid that they will recognize that I am from Auschwitz and I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s615">First of all, I was wearing a long sleeve shirt.</span> <span id="s616">She gave me a shirt with long sleeves, and I had there plenty, plenty during this time to be there.</span> <span id="s617">So, when we were hidden in the hay for a week, and after a week they make the office, and they need the barn for the horses.</span> <span id="s618">So it was for us a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s619">What we shall do now?</span> <span id="s620">We are in this, this woman took us in, and she said she was going to, she was very, very nice somehow...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">LF: A Polish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">GK: Yeah, a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s623">She didn’t know us.</span> <span id="s624">I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s625">I didn’t have nothing to give her, and I didn’t have nothing to promise her.</span> <span id="s626">But somehow she was good.</span> <span id="s627">Maybe it was from God-sent that I should survive, and this way I should be liberated.</span> <span id="s628">She divide us, to one brother and to one sister, because we were three girls.</span> <span id="s629">So one girl went to her brother, and another girl she gave to her sister, and I remained in her house.</span> <span id="s630">Somehow she start to like me.</span> <span id="s631">She said, “You going to stay in my house.”</span> <span id="s632">I asked her if she had something to fix, because in Poland they used to make patches on everything, on pants, on dresses, on blouses, on linens.</span> <span id="s633">“Oh,” she said, “you know how to sew.”</span> <span id="s634">I said, “Yes, I’m a wonderful seamstress.</span> <span id="s635">Give me something to fix.”</span> <span id="s636">So she brought in a full basket, and this was for me like the best medicine, because I went in a separate room, and I had the sewing machine, and a full basket of things to fix, and then she brought me new material to make something, which I didn’t know how, but I made it.</span> <span id="s637">It was good.</span> <span id="s638">And when the soldiers came in that I should shorten...</span></p> <p><span id="s639">LF: Trousers.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">GK: Coats, the coats.</span> <span id="s641">So I said, “I’m sorry, this machine doesn’t sew heavy things,” and I didn’t do nothing for them because I was afraid that maybe my Polish is not like their Polish.</span> <span id="s642">Because this was from Schlesien [Silesia] from on the border, and I spoke a different Polish, but very good Polish, with Polish accent, but it was different than theirs, so where do I come to be there?</span> <span id="s643">Conversation, conversation, I didn’t want to start nothing.</span> <span id="s644">One day came in her husband, and he said, “Listen, I can’t keep you here any longer.</span> <span id="s645">I don’t have any food.</span> <span id="s646">You have to go on the police and ask for ration card, and this way, we will have more food, so you can stay here.</span> <span id="s647">I begged him, and I said, “I’m not going to eat nothing.</span> <span id="s648">I’m going to drink just water.</span> <span id="s649">I don’t want to go to the police,” because I knew if I go to the police, that’s it.</span> <span id="s650">But, somehow, he got a little softer, and he kept me.</span> <span id="s651">One day the bombs, you know the American planes came...</span></p> <p><span id="s652">LF: Bombers.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">GK: Yeah the bombers came there, so we went all in the basement.</span> <span id="s654">We went to the basement, and she was also very religious and she started to pray, to pray with the beads, and then she said to me, “Genia, pray in your own way.”</span> <span id="s655">So I prayed.</span> <span id="s656">In the middle of the bombs, it was fire and she said to me, “Genia, [phrase in Polish]...It is sure that the Jews killed our Jesus, our God.”</span> <span id="s657">You know, if I translate this: “It is sure that the Jews killed our God, Jesus.”</span> <span id="s658">What could I say?</span> <span id="s659">I make believe that I didn’t hear what she said.</span> <span id="s660">Because I depend on her, I’m in her hands, I’m in her house, and all surrounded with the German soldiers, I didn’t have no place where to go.</span> <span id="s661">I didn’t have nobody to call to help me, I didn’t know who’s alive and who not.</span> <span id="s662">But...it was late in March, it was March 28, 1948, I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">LF: How were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">GK: The Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">LF: The Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">GK: So because the war was to end in May 1945, but I was liberated March 28, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">LF: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">GK: I didn’t have any money, and I didn’t have shoes, so I begged her, “Borrow to me a pair of shoes, and I will repay for them.”</span> <span id="s669">So she gave me a pair of shoes, and she gave me a pair of stockings, and she gave me and the other two girls, too, because they came back to her, and it was a full party that the war is over, the war is over.</span> <span id="s670">It wasn’t over, but for them it was over.</span> <span id="s671">And we all went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s672">I went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s673">And I was looking there was a Jewish organization in Krakow, and I was looking, maybe somebody survive from my family.</span> <span id="s674">If I could survive Auschwitz, because Auschwitz everybody knew, they didn’t know what kind of a death, how the Jews were dying, but they know that to Auschwitz is only one door to go in, but no door to go out.</span> <span id="s675">And if I could go out from this kind of a death camp, because this was called the death camp, so maybe somebody from my family survived.</span> <span id="s676">I was running around in Poland, all different cities, but I didn’t find nobody, from my own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">LF: And then where did you recuperate?</span> <span id="s678">Where did you get yourself together?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">GK: I was in Krakow.</span> <span id="s680">I remained in Krakow, because this was a very known city for me.</span> <span id="s681">I used to be in Krakow very, very often.</span> <span id="s682">And I find there a family from Berlin, but they were during the war in Wisnicz, and they knew my parents.</span> <span id="s683">So they helped me.</span> <span id="s684">They took me in their apartment, and she lent...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">LF: A Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">GK: A Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">LF: And they survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">GK: They survived, yeah, they are, in 1936, I think all the Jews, the Polish Jews were sent out from Germany to Zbonszyn, and this was a family from Zbonszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">LF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">GK: They was running, Jews run.</span> <span id="s691">Jews don’t sit in one place.</span> <span id="s692">So they came to Krakow, from Krakow when was judenrein, they came to Wisnicz, and from Wisnicz, everybody know each other, because we didn’t have work to do.</span> <span id="s693">We didn’t do any business, any work, nothing.</span> <span id="s694">We was talking to each other.</span> <span id="s695">There was no television, no radio, no papers, but everybody told stories and stories, and this how we survived.</span> <span id="s696">And whatever we had, we shared with each other.</span> <span id="s697">The whole city was like one family.</span> <span id="s698">Whatever one family had, the other family had.</span> <span id="s699">When my mother used to bake challes [Sabbath bread] for Shabbes she gave to this a little bit, to them a little bit.</span> <span id="s700">We shared with everybody.</span> <span id="s701">And so, I came there, and I heard, I came to Krakow and I heard that he’s there, the name was Lieblich, two brothers Lieblich.</span> <span id="s702">I will never forget the two brothers.</span> <span id="s703">I have them on the picture.</span> <span id="s704">So they were very happy to see me, and they took me to their apartment, and they lent to me a sewing machine, and I start to sew, and I make the first hundred zlotys.</span> <span id="s705">This was like that much cost one pair of stockings.</span> <span id="s706">But somehow I was dressed.</span> <span id="s707">I had one skirt and one white blouse.</span> <span id="s708">For three months I was wearing the gray skirt and the white blouse.</span> <span id="s709">And every single night I washed the white blouse.</span> <span id="s710">In the morning I iron, and nobody knew if I had ten blouses or one blouse.</span> <span id="s711">Then, in Krakow, in the Jewish quarter, is a very nice synagogue.</span> <span id="s712">Saturday, when the Jews came to pray, so the Polish boys threw stones through the window.</span> <span id="s713">So I said, “No, I don’t remain on this bloody ground.</span> <span id="s714">Just we went through so much.</span> <span id="s715">Didn’t the Poles have enough that they killed so many Jews?</span> <span id="s716">If remained a few Jews came back from Russia, came back from the hidden places, from the woods, from the escape different places, and they gather together in Krakow, they going Saturday to the synagogue, isn’t that enough?”</span> <span id="s717">So I went to Germany.</span> <span id="s718">From Germany, I supposed to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">LF: Where in Germany did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">GK: Einring.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">LF: Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">GK: This is in Bayern.</span> <span id="s723">[Bavaria] There was a camp, and in this camp that sent the Jewish people, smuggled, not sent, smuggled the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s724">It was the B’richa and the B’richa [flight, escape] smuggled the Jewish people, whoever wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s725">And I registered, but in the meantime...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">LF: Were you still with your two friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">GK: No, we separated.</span> <span id="s728">I went to Krakow, and they went to Bendin.</span> <span id="s729">They was from Bendin.</span> <span id="s730">[also, Bendzin] This was close to the German border.</span> <span id="s731">Where am I now?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">LF: You’re going to try to get to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">GK: Yeah, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s734">And there is a whole story.</span> <span id="s735">I can’t make short this story, so I will skip it.</span> <span id="s736">I met there somebody, and we got very friendly, and then he proposed, and I said, “I am not going to get married.</span> <span id="s737">I am finished my life.”</span> <span id="s738">I see the beautiful world, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s739">And then I said to him, “I will bring you a wife, my cousin.”</span> <span id="s740">Then I went, I smuggled, I can’t say went, because the borders weren’t open.</span> <span id="s741">I smuggled back to Poland and then I took this cousin...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">LF: You found a cousin there?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">GK: I know that she is alive.</span> <span id="s744">But still today I don’t know how I knew her address.</span> <span id="s745">She was here.</span> <span id="s746">She is now in Israel, and I ask her and she said, “I don’t know, I don’t know how I found her address,” and we smuggled back to Germany, and I introduced her, and we all moved from Einring to Regensburg.</span> <span id="s747">And then she asked me to go with her to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s748">There was another camp.</span> <span id="s749">She had there a cousin, and going to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s750">I heard that my cousin is there.</span> <span id="s751">In Landsberg, I married my cousin.</span> <span id="s752">He was my first cousin.</span> <span id="s753">Through her, I met my cousin, and when he heard that I am alive, so, of course, we didn’t separate, and we got married after six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">LF: Let me change this tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Tape one, side two: Other voice: This is tape two, side two, continuing an interview with Mrs. Genia Klapholz, K-L-A-P-H-O-L-Z.</span> <span id="s756">It will be a very, very long gap on the tape, but eventually you will hear the rest of Mrs. Klapholz’ testimony.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">LF: You married your first cousin.</span> <span id="s758">So you met your husband, who was your first cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">GK: Yeah, we came to Landsberg, you know, to the camps.</span> <span id="s760">Nobody had a kitchen at home, we had to go to community kitchen to eat.</span> <span id="s761">So we went there to eat.</span> <span id="s762">It was on a Friday, lunch time.</span> <span id="s763">So I met there two girls, two sisters, by the name Klapholz.</span> <span id="s764">And Klapholz was my family.</span> <span id="s765">My mother was from home a Klapholz.</span> <span id="s766">So I said, “Klapholz?</span> <span id="s767">Are you related to us?”</span> <span id="s768">She said, “I don’t know; we never spoke at home about relationship from far away, but here is one man, a Klapholz from Tarnow.”</span> <span id="s769">So I said, “Klapholz from Tarnow is my cousin.”</span> <span id="s770">But I knew, because two brothers were living in Tarnow, and I said, “The older brother, I know when he went with the transport, and the younger brother went to L’vov, so I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s771">So my cousin and me went here to this apartment where he’s supposed to live.</span> <span id="s772">It was Friday night, and this man said, “Yeah, here lives a Klapholz, but he went to the Rabbi.”</span> <span id="s773">Friday night, usually, the religious people, they go for, not services, but Oneg Shabbat, to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s774">So I said I thought that Henry is alive, but Henry is not that religious to go Friday night to the service, to the Oneg Shabbat.</span> <span id="s775">Anyhow, if this is, tell him please that Genia Flaks is here, and if he’s my cousin so he will probably come to visit.</span> <span id="s776">If not, I’m happy that another member from the family Klapholz is survived and is alive.</span> <span id="s777">To make the story short, Saturday we going there for lunch, and somebody grabbed me by the hand.</span> <span id="s778">And I take a look, it was Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">LF: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">GK: And right away, he hand me a pack of chocolate, because he knew that I am a big nosher [nibbler].</span> <span id="s781">I like chocolate.</span> <span id="s782">So you can imagine this happiness, what was to me.</span> <span id="s783">I came in to the dining room and with such alarm!</span> <span id="s784">“I found my cousin!</span> <span id="s785">I found my cousin!</span> <span id="s786">I have a cousin!”</span> <span id="s787">It was something that it was happened that I found a million dollars, I found my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">LF: Someone from your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">GK: Yes, because I didn’t have nobody.</span> <span id="s790">I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">LF: You never found anyone of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">GK: No, and right away I took the pack chocolate, and I divide among us, and we were eating, and he didn’t let me go anymore back to Regensburg, because he was living in Munich.</span> <span id="s793">Then he said to me, “Listen, if you promise me that you gonna go with me to find another cousin...” He knew from two cousins.</span> <span id="s794">“And I will tell you who’s alive.”</span> <span id="s795">I said, “I promise.</span> <span id="s796">I promise.”</span> <span id="s797">So he told me Max Blonder is alive, and Max Klapholz is alive.</span> <span id="s798">Oh!</span> <span id="s799">This was to me like I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s800">I started to laugh, I started to cry.</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t know how should I be happy, should I be sad...</span></p> <p><span id="s802">LF: These were all first cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">GK: Yeah, all first cousins.</span> <span id="s804">On Sunday, make sure we went to Poecking and we met first Max Klapholz.</span> <span id="s805">Oh, was this something!</span> <span id="s806">Then we went to Hof, also in Bayern, in Germany and there we met Max Blonder.</span> <span id="s807">I came home to Regensburg, “Oh,” I told everybody, “I have now a family again.</span> <span id="s808">You see why I was a survival.</span> <span id="s809">You see, why, because I have the family again.”</span> <span id="s810">And for the next Saturday, everybody came to me, and I invite everybody.</span> <span id="s811">I have a letter, what I wrote to Henry, when he went back to Munich.</span> <span id="s812">And then Henry said, “Listen, Genia, you are alone, I am alone, you go to Munich, I go to Regensburg, then we going to Hof...why should we be so separate?</span> <span id="s813">Let’s get married.”</span> <span id="s814">And sure enough, I didn’t wait even five minutes.</span> <span id="s815">I said, “O.K., when?”</span> <span id="s816">I said, “All right, we will make arrangements.”</span> <span id="s817">It didn’t take long.</span> <span id="s818">Six weeks later we got married.</span> <span id="s819">I said, “Listen, Henry, I want to go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s820">He said, “All right, that’s fine with me.</span> <span id="s821">We’ll go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s822">So we registered to the United States and to Palestine.</span> <span id="s823">And my Henry said, “Which papers will come earlier, there we’ll go.</span> <span id="s824">We will go to United States or to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s825">In the meantime I got pregnant with my older son.</span> <span id="s826">This was a miracle, too.</span> <span id="s827">Because I didn’t know, we didn’t know that we going to have any children.</span> <span id="s828">For two-and-a-half years, I didn’t have any period, and how, everything, our whole life is a miracle-life.</span> <span id="s829">Everything is a miracle.</span> <span id="s830">So we was waiting, and I said, “I’m not going like this to the States.</span> <span id="s831">Let’s wait until the baby is going to be born.”</span> <span id="s832">So the baby was born, it was a boy, and we got the papers to go to the American Consulate, to go to the United States, and he said, “O.K., the papers from America came before Palestine, so we go to America.”</span> <span id="s833">The baby was four weeks old, so I said, “Maybe we can wait until the baby is going to be a little bit older.”</span> <span id="s834">So we had an extension for a year.</span> <span id="s835">And after a year, the baby was just a year old in Bremenhafen [Bremerhaven] when we had to go on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">LF: You came to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">GK: We came to New York.</span> <span id="s838">New York, on February 28, 1948, on Saturday night, 10:00, we arrived New York.</span> <span id="s839">So they took us to the HIAS.</span> <span id="s840">We didn’t have nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s841">And Sunday morning, I go to the lobby, I was always a big mouth, I always talk when I shouldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s842">I heard somebody talks German, so I go over and I ask them from where they are, and they said from Munich.</span> <span id="s843">I said, “From Munich, I have there an uncle and an aunt.</span> <span id="s844">The name is Abraham Strom.”</span> <span id="s845">“What, Abraham Strom?</span> <span id="s846">He is my best friend.”</span> <span id="s847">She goes to the phone and she tells some relatives came here.</span> <span id="s848">So, she never met us, because they were born and raised in Munich and we were born and raised in Poland.</span> <span id="s849">So I introduce myself, who I am, and sure enough, it didn’t take more than maybe two hours, my uncle came to the HIAS.</span> <span id="s850">And I met him for the first time, and after a long talk, I don’t know if you know Jewish.</span> <span id="s851">He said to me, “Hob nisht kein moyre.”</span> <span id="s852">[Don’t be afraid].</span> <span id="s853">“Vet zein voyle au Amerke.</span> <span id="s854">Dein man vet machen a leben.</span> <span id="s855">Un du est ausgang...” So, I said, “Uncle, vos zogst du?</span> <span id="s856">Ich vul ausgang?”</span> <span id="s857">By us ausgang, that mean that I am dead, that I die.</span> <span id="s858">And Henry mach a leben, that mean that he will go out with other girls and I will sit home and die.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">LF: But he didn’t mean that.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">GK: No, he meant like they said in America.</span> <span id="s861">And he went home, Monday morning, he’s coming back and he said, “I have for you a job.”</span> <span id="s862">I said, “What mean, ‘you have a job.’</span> <span id="s863">I don’t know the streets in New York.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t know English.</span> <span id="s865">I don’t know nothing.”</span> <span id="s866">“Don’t worry, I will come for you, and I will take you there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s867">LF: Who would take care of the baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">GK: My husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">LF: Your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">GK: So I went to a corset factory and I worked for a week.</span> <span id="s871">In the meantime we had a furnished room in New York on the East Side, and then I work maybe four, five weeks and my husband got a job, too.</span> <span id="s872">He made $30 a week then, and I made over $50, and he said, “You are not going to go to work.”</span> <span id="s873">The baby would get to a nursery, I paid this time $10 a week, but the baby was crying in the morning and at night.</span> <span id="s874">He don’t understand English; we talk to him Jewish, and all of a sudden he’s in a strange country, in strange hands, in a strange house, in a strange language, he didn’t know, so he cried, all day he cried.</span> <span id="s875">So my husband said, “I didn’t marry you to go to work, and to give the baby in a nursery school.</span> <span id="s876">You’re going to stay home, and whatever I will make you will have enough.”</span> <span id="s877">So I stopped working, and then somebody came in, and they talk about the farm in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s878">And I fell in love with the farm.</span> <span id="s879">I said, “Oh, to have my own house and garden and chickens, it would be wonderful.”</span> <span id="s880">So sure enough my cousin Max Blonder, and my husband, they went to New Jersey and they bought a farm, and you will ask where they got money.</span> <span id="s881">Don’t ask, they didn’t have, but they bought a farm.</span> <span id="s882">And we were very, very happy, very happy.</span> <span id="s883">The baby was growing and growing, and the baby was three years of age, and then this family lived in Mays Landing, between Mays Landing and Egg Harbor, then we separate because it was too small for two families.</span> <span id="s884">We knew already that we need $50 a week to spend for food, we knew already that we need some clothes, that we need to pay for electric, for gas...</span></p> <p><span id="s885">LF: How did you get to Philadelphia, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">GK: After.</span> <span id="s887">In 1960, we came to Philadelphia, and so we bought, we moved to Vineland, and my cousin remained in Egg Harbor on this farm, and we bought another farm in Vineland, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s888">We were in Vineland, New Jersey, for ten years, and this I can tell you was our happiest ten years in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">LF: What did you have, a chicken farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">GK: We have a chicken farm, and we organized a Jewish day school in Vineland, and I worked very hard for the Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s891">Everything what I didn’t did.</span> <span id="s892">My husband took the car, he spent more money for gasoline than I made...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">LF: And what brought you to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">GK: In 1955 was very, very bad on the farm.</span> <span id="s895">We couldn’t make a living.</span> <span id="s896">To produce a dozen eggs was 32 cents and we sold a dozen eggs for 29 cents, wholesale.</span> <span id="s897">So my husband, he saw that this is impossible to stay this way on the farm, so he went, and he looked for some business.</span> <span id="s898">I want him to go to New York, actually, because in New York my whole family is in the diamond business, in 47th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">LF: When you say your whole family...</span></p> <p><span id="s900">GK: My cousins and his son, and his son-in-law, and his brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s901">LF: But he decided to come to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">GK: But my husband said in New York maybe he will make $50 a week, and maybe $100 a week, and he don’t know... “I have to support...” In the meantime, I had the other baby, “I have to support a family, a wife and two children, so I have to find something where I can get, where I can made bread.”</span> <span id="s903">So we came to Philadelphia to a broker, and the broker told us about this grocery we bought on 54th Street, a grocery delicatessen.</span> <span id="s904">We were there for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">LF: 54th and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">GK: In Montgomery.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">LF: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">GK: And we worked five years, seven days a week, very hard work.</span> <span id="s909">We suppose to close up Sunday noon, but wintertime it was night time, the summer time we close 1:00 or 2:00.</span> <span id="s910">After then we moved from there because of the Shvartses [Blacks, African-Americans] there.</span> <span id="s911">We moved to Gainor Road.</span> <span id="s912">But we were very happy in the United States, and we work a lot for Israel.</span> <span id="s913">And we did, I wouldn’t say that we did our share, but is not enough whatever we do, but we went to Israel every second year, beginning in 1966.</span> <span id="s914">Every year we couldn’t afford, couldn’t afford, but every second, every third year, we went to Israel, and we visited the whole country from Sharm-el-Sheikh to Metulla...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">LF: How many of your relatives do you feel have survived, do you know, have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">GK: From my family, only I am a survivor, I mean, the cousins, four.</span> <span id="s917">My husband was the fifth.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">LF: Your husband was the fifth?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">GK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">LF: And how many are in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">GK: This is not first cousins, this is all second cousins.</span> <span id="s922">And some are adopted cousins.</span> <span id="s923">I have an adopted family.</span> <span id="s924">I adopted in Vineland a sister, I adopted a brother-in-law, I..</span> <span id="s925">.</span> <span id="s926">and they adopted me.</span> <span id="s927">I have a whole adopted family.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">LF: You’re a very warm, wonderful person.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">GK: Thank you.</span> <span id="s930">I had here for two months, she came before Pesach and stood after the unveiling for my husband, a cousin, she’s not my cousin, she’s an adopted cousin.</span> <span id="s931">I had an adopted cousin who passed away just recently.</span> <span id="s932">I adopted a large family, and this and everybody in Israel is my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">LF: You’re not bitter from what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">GK: Now I am very bitter because a half of my life is gone.</span> <span id="s935">Me and my husband was one life.</span> <span id="s936">God put us together, and I thought nothing could part us, only death.</span> <span id="s937">And the death came too early.</span> <span id="s938">My husband was the most healthiest man.</span> <span id="s939">He was never sick.</span> <span id="s940">I was the sick one.</span> <span id="s941">I am on medication since I was liberated, for the last thirty-some years, and I was always the sick one, and he was the healthy one, and I could bet on my everything that my husband will outlive me.</span> <span id="s942">And when this came, they poisoned him, it’s a bitter shock to me.</span> <span id="s943">God part us early.</span> <span id="s944">He was the most wonderful husband, a devoted father, and a very good grandfather, but he didn’t live to see the younger grandchild.</span> <span id="s945">She was born in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">LF: Well, thank you very, very much, Mrs. Klapholz.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">GK: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s948">I didn’t tell you not even I would say half, not even ten percent, because I couldn’t bring out everything to make so short.</span> <span id="s949">I want to make short and to the point, and I think I didn’t come to the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">LF: You did come to the point.</span> <span id="s951">You did come to the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">GK: Because I think left out so many things during the war, what we went through in the ghettoes, the Entlausings [delousings], and the roll calls, and all the things what happened, that my mind got blank, because I want to always skip, skip, skip.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">LF: So some time, if you want to talk again, I’ll give you my phone number and you can give me a call, and maybe we can do another tape that will kind of complement this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">GK: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">This was typical Friday night observance in a traditional home.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">G.K. must mean 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">October 28, 1938, Jews of Polish nationality were deported from Germany to Zbonszyn (also spelled Zbaszyn).</span></p> <p><span id="s958">B’richa, also transliterated as Beriha, was the
