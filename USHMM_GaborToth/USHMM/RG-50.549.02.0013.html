Let us begin with your name -- your birth name and your name now and also when you were born and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Answer: All right.</span> <span id="s17">Well, my name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, L-a-k-s.</span> <span id="s18">I am also known as Renia, R-e-n-i-a.</span> <span id="s19">So you could refer to me as Renia and Regina, but -- but for all practical -- for all official purposes, I really am Regina, so you can only find me under that, but everybody else knows me also as Renia.</span> <span id="s20">Gelb, obviously is my married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: When you were born --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Oh yes, I was born in Starachowice and I’ll spell that for you because it’s a very long name.</span> <span id="s23">S-t-a-r-a-c-h-o-w-i-c-e.</span> <span id="s24">That was, at the time of my birth, also known as Wierzbnik, W-i-e-r-z-b-n-i-k.</span> <span id="s25">I was born on December 16, 1929.</span> <span id="s26">I just want to add that at time of my birth, I was really born in Wierzbnik, but Wierzbnik was combined with Starachowice into one town and now you would never probably -- you will not find Wierzbnik on the map, but you will find Starachowice.</span> <span id="s27">So, I sort of refer to the fact that I was born in Starachowice because if you want to look me up, you will not find me otherwise, except in Starachowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Whereabouts is Starachowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">Starachowice is in central Poland, about two and a half hours by car from Warsaw, directly south.</span> <span id="s31">It is an industrial town and it was -- if we go a li-little back in history, Poland, as you know, was divided up to 1918, between Russia, Prussia and Hungary.</span> <span id="s32">We were -- I was born in the very heart of Poland, which was called in those days, Congress Poland, because when Napoleon went through Poland, he carved up a piece of free Poland and that was the -- the core of the -- the core -- the -- the center of Poland, where Starachowice is located.</span> <span id="s33">Now, th-the town, as I a-am fond of remembering -- reminding everybody -- the fact that the town was an -- an industrial town played a great part in my surviving the war.</span> <span id="s34">The reason being that after the first war, when Poland became independent in 1918, the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of the Polish government -- it was decided that Poland has to arm itself, so they carved up a -- an industrial complex within the heart of Poland and they started -- there was ore to be smelted and big factories went up.</span> <span id="s35">How this historic fact relates to my survival is probably a bit farfetched, but it isn’t, for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory in our town, which prior to the war, smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all kinds of locomotives and -- and meat grinders, from the big to the smallest, was converted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out.</span> <span id="s36">By virtue of which, the Germans decided that the entire area, which contained these different factories, which were converted into munitions factories, would need le -- slave labor.</span> <span id="s37">Therefore, people who were living within that area, were first used as slave labor.</span> <span id="s38">Of course, in due time they would die out and they would be shipped, whatever.</span> <span id="s39">The numbers would always be supplemented by new people, who were either shipped out of towns or caught or whichever way.</span> <span id="s40">The number --eventually the number of slave labor people working for the -- in that factory, was constant, even though people were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s41">But of course we’re -- are getting ahead of our story here, because this is only the beginning.</span> <span id="s42">I just meant to make the connection that Starachowice, the factory was -- before the war, the factory was in Starachowice proper.</span> <span id="s43">The bedroom of Starachowice proper was Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s44">That was basically a town where everything took place, commerce and so on and it was a very sizable Jewish community, about one third of the people living in Wierzbnik were Jews.</span> <span id="s45">And they were generally, as they always were -- they were merchants and they were cobblers and carpenters and so on and they -- there also was such a thing as the Jewish intelligencia in those days.</span> <span id="s46">Of which my parents were part.</span> <span id="s47">But that was the town and -- and Starachowice did not have Jews living in -- in it, because the Jews were not allowed to work in the factory, strange as it might seem.</span> <span id="s48">Before the war, the Jews were not allowed to live or work in the factory.</span> <span id="s49">In -- and, as I said, eventually the two were combined so by then you couldn’t do -- have these restrictions but that was the fact, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: I just have one follow-up question on that story --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: -- before I would like to go to your -- your childhood and your family, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What were the reasons?</span> <span id="s55">Were they anti-Semitic reasons or were they different reasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I could not tell you.</span> <span id="s57">You know, there are certain things which to this day remain a mystery to me, because I was a child.</span> <span id="s58">I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the fact -- in the plant and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there.</span> <span id="s59">And I’ll tell you, actually why -- I’ll tell you, I -- I almost know now, because I’ve read some -- some books on the subjects about Starachowice that were written actually the last 20 years.</span> <span id="s60">Starachowice was at one time, built in colonies for people directly involved with the factory.</span> <span id="s61">In other words, after 1918, when that factory went up, they started building colonies, one was called Roboneetcha, which is for the workers and another one was for the -- for the, I guess for the administration over there.</span> <span id="s62">But they had these colonies, they were what you call now, you know in America, you have a lot of these developments.</span> <span id="s63">You know, you have houses and the -- the -- but the -- the basic commerce was still in Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s64">The reason Jews did not live in Starachowice, because to qualify, you had to work in the factory, you see?</span> <span id="s65">Yeah.</span> <span id="s66">And that was true up to the very war.</span> <span id="s67">And when the war broke out, obviously things got totally changed because the resettlement of Jews came into being and all this, but this is a story that we’ll probably continue later.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So maybe if you can tell us a little bit about your family now.</span> <span id="s69">About your early upbringing, your daily life?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: All right.</span> <span id="s71">Well, first of all, we were a family of five -- father, mother and the three of us.</span> <span id="s72">My oldest sister, Anna, who is also called Hanya.</span> <span id="s73">Her last name now is Wilson and she’s a Canadian.</span> <span id="s74">My sec -- my middle sister, Krisha, who’s also called Kris, but her true name is Rosalia Kristina Lehrman.</span> <span id="s75">And we call her Krisha for short.</span> <span id="s76">And my name, Regina, which also is Renia.</span> <span id="s77">We were a secular type of family.</span> <span id="s78">The town was very Jewish in the sense that it had a very sizable Orthodox Jewish community.</span> <span id="s79">But my parents, of course were part of the Jewish community, but we were not Orthodox, we were not -- we were secular.</span> <span id="s80">And my parents were very much oriented to Zionism.</span> <span id="s81">But before we proceed that, let me just explain to you the other background.</span> <span id="s82">The fact that we spoke Polish at home, we were brought up in the Polish language.</span> <span id="s83">Both my parents spoke Polish beautifully, even though my father’s background was really German.</span> <span id="s84">He came from Solsnoviets, which is western Poland, which -- Salesia, in Salesia.</span> <span id="s85">And he was brought up in the German language, because obviously he went to school -- he was an educated man -- he went to school pri -- prior to the f -- end of the first war, prior to 1918, which means that, depending on which sphere of influence you lived in, that was the language in which you were taught.</span> <span id="s86">Well, my pa -- my father was a German, in that sense, because he -- he spoke German beautifully.</span> <span id="s87">To this day I talk about his encyclopedia because that played a big part in the war, also.</span> <span id="s88">He had his encyclopedia in German, he -- he was subscribing to magazines and other things and he spoke German beautifully, but of course his Polish was wonderful.</span> <span id="s89">Mother, on the other ha -- hand, came from the so-called Russian part of Poland, so she spoke Russian in addition to her Polish.</span> <span id="s90">But we were brought up at home in the Polish language.</span> <span id="s91">My parents knew Yiddish and spoke to each other only if they didn’t want the kids to understand.</span> <span id="s92">Now my father was an engineer in the forestry business.</span> <span id="s93">That was a very big business in Poland.</span> <span id="s94">They employed people who had good education, a good scientific, what’s that to say?</span> <span id="s95">Science background, which my father had from his German education.</span> <span id="s96">Assessing forestry for lumber and such.</span> <span id="s97">And there was a big sawmill in Starachowice -- in -- in Wierzbnik, Starachowice -- belonged to Jewish people, I think they were Austrians.</span> <span id="s98">And they were -- that was their ownership.</span> <span id="s99">And they employed -- it -- it was a sizable type of operation because th-the lumber was -- the -- the forests that were cut elsewhere, brought in, were -- were turned into lumber.</span> <span id="s100">And mother was -- as it was true in Poland, she was not what you call a working woman, not until 1938 or so and I -- I’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s101">And we had a very good life.</span> <span id="s102">Of course we had a maid, as everybody else did and when I tell people how it was when -- we had a -- a seamstress come to the house, you know and people used to buy goods and they used to sew it for you, the -- you know, the seamstress would come and she would sew the sheets and she would sew the skirts for the kids and the blouses and all that.</span> <span id="s103">And this was of course another totally other way of life.</span> <span id="s104">And then you had the laundress, she came and she did the big laundry and -- and she took it to the mangle and I told somebody about the mangle and said, “What is that?”</span> <span id="s105">Well, the sheets were mangled.</span> <span id="s106">And there is such a thing and I know the machine.</span> <span id="s107">I could even describe it.</span> <span id="s108">But anyhow, we had a very good life, until the late 30’s.</span> <span id="s109">We had a wonderful life, as you -- I’ll show you some pictures in my albums.</span> <span id="s110">My mother has arthri -- had arthritis, so she went for a cure to a place called Busco -- Busco’s druey, which had sulfur baths and she went regularly, ev -- every summer for six weeks.</span> <span id="s111">And after that, of course, we used to come -- she used to come back and we used to go so-called country, somewhere in the -- on the farm to -- to recover.</span> <span id="s112">But sh -- this was a strenuous kind of treatment and she used to take us with her to Busco.</span> <span id="s113">Not all three at one time, but two, sometimes one and I remember -- I have even a picture from Busco with my mother and my sister has a picture from Busco that -- mother did that in the summertime, but other than that she was very involved with the Zionist movement in Poland.</span> <span id="s114">And she was instrumental in ope -- in opening a Hebrew school called Tarbud, which was specifically designed for children like ourselves, who came from secular homes, where Polish was spoken, for them to have the Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s115">We used to go after regular school.</span> <span id="s116">After the Polish -- regular Polish school, we used to go to Tarbud, it was called Tarbud.</span> <span id="s117">And Tarbud, they taught us Hebrew and they taught us Jewish history and the Bible and such.</span> <span id="s118">But basically, we were too young to know Hebrew well enough to study the Bible, so that was in Polish and the language, to an extent to which a child could manage at that age.</span> <span id="s119">And mother was also very instrumental -- first of all, she was president of Viso the women’s international Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s120">Whether she was president of -- of the area, or whatever the area encompassed, I couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s121">Whether it was a county, or -- or southern Poland or central Poland or -- I don’t know, but she was president of Viso.</span> <span id="s122">And these wom-women Zionist movements supported very much the pioneering -- the preparation of young Jews for Palestine.</span> <span id="s123">The pioneers for Palestine.</span> <span id="s124">And they used to be called Hag Sharah.</span> <span id="s125">And Hag Sharah was the kind of a training center which was established even in Starachowice -- in Starachowice, Wierzbnik where these young fellows, that was mostly young men or very young women who were not married and had no children.</span> <span id="s126">Young people who wanted to go to Palestine and be pioneers.</span> <span id="s127">And they were trained in farm work and in communal living and all that.</span> <span id="s128">And the women Zionist movement, of which my mother was president, not just -- didn’t just support it, but was running that Hag Sharah.</span> <span id="s129">Father was also quite involved with it, but of course he had to earn a living.</span> <span id="s130">But mother, this was her full-time job.</span> <span id="s131">All this changed about 1938 because the Jewish people who owned the fac -- the sawmill in the town, sold it to Christians.</span> <span id="s132">And -- I think they were Austrian Jews, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s133">Anyhow, after they have given up the -- the operation -- the plant, every single Jew was fired.</span> <span id="s134">From the top to the bottom.</span> <span id="s135">Whether he was an engineer or whether he was whatever.</span> <span id="s136">Pushed the tr -- the -- the -- the barrels or collected the -- whatever it was.</span> <span id="s137">It was completely staffed by Polish Christians.</span> <span id="s138">And that was also the very hard time, there was lots of boycotting done of Jewish stores and Jewish enterprises.</span> <span id="s139">And of course, studying history, I know that this didn’t come of itself, it was germane, but at the same time, the influences coming out of Germany were also very much involved in this very open -- very open antagonism.</span> <span id="s140">You see, they wouldn’t beat you, but they -- they, if you had a store, they would march around and they would say -- they would march and they would yell, “Don’t buy from Jews,” and don’t buy from Jews and such.</span> <span id="s141">Now, my father was without a job now -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Be-Before we really move into that time, I would like --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: -- one more time go back to your -- to your family.</span> <span id="s145">Tell us a little bit more about your relationship to your sisters for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Were you close?</span> <span id="s148">Did you know your grandfathers other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s150">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s151">Yes, this is very, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: [indecipherable] home life.</span> <span id="s153">What do you remember of -- of home?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s155">Well, we had a very wonderful life.</span> <span id="s156">That is not just in retrospect or nostalgic or in any way but to describe it, we really had a wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s157">The parents were, as I told you, very progressive minded.</span> <span id="s158">And we were very, very close-knit, especially with my mother’s side of the family, because they lived only within 20 miles or so of the -- or 20 kilometers, I don’t know which, but very short distance from Starachowice.</span> <span id="s159">And personally, I never knew either grandfather.</span> <span id="s160">My father, as I told you, came from Solsnoviets and that’s western Poland.</span> <span id="s161">I never knew that grandfather, he died before I was born.</span> <span id="s162">And I never knew my other grandfather.</span> <span id="s163">My mother’s maiden name was Tannenblume, so I did not know my Tannenblume grandfather and I didn’t know my Laks grandfather.</span> <span id="s164">However, I knew my grandmothers very well, both of them.</span> <span id="s165">The -- grandmother Laks used to come for -- you know like you, in the old days they used to come for a visit, was an extended visit, let’s say for six weeks, so she lived with us.</span> <span id="s166">And then she would go to visit her other son, Alexander, in Radom.</span> <span id="s167">And then she would make the rounds and then she would -- she lived in Solsnoviets, but she would make these very lovely, extended trips.</span> <span id="s168">But that was the time when I saw her, but the other grandmother, we called Babcha, is a grandmother for -- in Polish.</span> <span id="s169">The other grandmother, I really -- not just adored, she had great influence over me and I remember her dearly and I’ll never forget her because of my childhood, my orientation to the importance of things.</span> <span id="s170">For example, she was the owner of a printing shop.</span> <span id="s171">I never tire of talking about it because she was -- she owned a printing shop with her two daughters.</span> <span id="s172">There were two daughters, unmarried daughters living with her.</span> <span id="s173">One of them was Regina, that’s mother’s sister, Regina Tannenblume and the other was Anja.</span> <span id="s174">Anja Tannenblume.</span> <span id="s175">Babcha was Sara Tannenblume.</span> <span id="s176">Babcha was officially, so to say, the owner of the printing shop because it belonged to my grandfather, but the three of them -- actually the -- th-the daughters were running it.</span> <span id="s177">And I would be invited -- grandmother was fond of inviting one child at a time.</span> <span id="s178">She was religious and she was kosher and she did not think my mother was doing the kind of job with the secular education, that we really needed this other something -- this other background.</span> <span id="s179">So I would go by myself on the -- it was a train, I think, or on the bus.</span> <span id="s180">And she would wait for me.</span> <span id="s181">You know, it was a very short ride, I mean really short.</span> <span id="s182">My mother wouldn’t trust me to somebody there thasay Babcha’s going to be waiting.</span> <span id="s183">Then she did.</span> <span id="s184">And my total fascination with the printing shop -- I fell in love with that place, totally.</span> <span id="s185">Not just that the man in the back, you know, that was a hand operated printing machine.</span> <span id="s186">They allowed me to touch it and go with them.</span> <span id="s187">And then they would cut -- they would cut the material, the lets -- they used to do for movie houses, they used to do posters.</span> <span id="s188">And then they had these big cutting machine and they would cut the edges to be -- to be straight.</span> <span id="s189">Well, imagine a child -- seven, eight year old child having a bag of these cuttings.</span> <span id="s190">I mean, you know, you co -- th-this was paradise.</span> <span id="s191">Then, they used to make ledgers, you know, like ledgers for -- ledgers and they would punch these holes, they had a punching machine.</span> <span id="s192">So you had the confetti.</span> <span id="s193">So I had another bag of confetti.</span> <span id="s194">I even remember, they used to make stickers.</span> <span id="s195">You know, in Poland, there was a sticker on the bread.</span> <span id="s196">You know, when you bought a loaf of bread, there was a little, as big as a postage stamp.</span> <span id="s197">I forgot why it was there, I think it named the bread, whatever.</span> <span id="s198">Anyhow, to punch the holes for the stickers, that was another confetti, much smaller, sort of like a powder.</span> <span id="s199">Anyhow, my attachment to Babcha, of course, the grandmother Tannenblume started with this fascination of the printing shop.</span> <span id="s200">And of course, she treated me wonderfully.</span> <span id="s201">She took me to the park for concerts and such, which there was a big park there for that.</span> <span id="s202">But basically she wanted me to learn the -- the prayers.</span> <span id="s203">So I would say the prayer before breakfast and I would say the prayer before bedtime and I would say all these prayers and she also was ve -- very religious and I distinctly remember she had two sinks in the room and a stove with a -- she had like a metal partition and she would put a metal partition because one part that was for the meat wouldn’t part -- touch the other part.</span> <span id="s204">In other words, with all her love and -- and -- and attention to me, she really got this -- this idea of -- th -- her idea of -- of getting something to the grandchildren that they weren’t getting at home, very well.</span> <span id="s205">She got it across very well, because I never forgot it and of course we are very much -- we’re very much -- not that we feel Jewish, we are Jewish to the core.</span> <span id="s206">W -- Just never became religious in the sense that Babcha wanted me to be religious.</span> <span id="s207">But Judaism is -- is part -- not of the persona, but of the being, to the very core.</span> <span id="s208">Some of it, of course comes from -- 90 percent comes from the house, because that was the -- the identity with Judaism was so very, very strong.</span> <span id="s209">But Babcha’s identity with Judaism was the other part that I didn’t get.</span> <span id="s210">And she was very intelligent and very well educated for a woman of those days.</span> <span id="s211">She was -- she spoke and wrote French fluently.</span> <span id="s212">She knew German very well.</span> <span id="s213">She came from a very fine family.</span> <span id="s214">In fi -- in fact I remember her cousin had the bank -- the bank in Austrovietz belonged to her cousin, they came from Sundomiesh, a town south of Austrovietz.</span> <span id="s215">Babcha lived in Austrovietz, where the printing shop was, Austrovietz, which was very near to us.</span> <span id="s216">Sundomiesh was a little further south, both of Starachowice and Austrovietz.</span> <span id="s217">Old, medieval city.</span> <span id="s218">That’s where Babcha was born and -- and this is where the -- her extended family was.</span> <span id="s219">The importance here of talking about the family is this, Babcha gave -- she was pr -- gave birth 13 times, but nine children survived.</span> <span id="s220">Nine of the 13.</span> <span id="s221">My mother was one of them.</span> <span id="s222">It was a very -- when I came on the scene -- it was a very extended family because all these sons and daughters got married.</span> <span id="s223">Out of nine, you can probably visualize how many grandchildren there were and how many -- you see?</span> <span id="s224">The point of it is this, that from that family, aside from the sons who came to America, everybody else perished from that family.</span> <span id="s225">The oldest daughter -- my -- my mother’s oldest sister, who -- her name was Kronenberg, she had two sons who studied in Belgium, they were engineers.</span> <span id="s226">And I think they perished in the Holocaust in Belgium.</span> <span id="s227">We never found about -- out about them.</span> <span id="s228">Babcha and her daughters that were not married yet, the two that lived -- no, one of them got married during the war, so she was already married during the war, but Babcha and the two daughter thers and the son-in-law from Austrovietz, they went.</span> <span id="s229">They went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s230">And -- and my other aunt, who lived in Danzig with her husband -- nobody from that family survived, from my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s231">Of course my parents perished.</span> <span id="s232">But in those days, the -- during the -- before the war, Babcha came to the house very often to us.</span> <span id="s233">But most of it, my major recollection of Babcha was that she was getting one child at a time and adoring it and spoiling it and teaching it to be religious.</span> <span id="s234">And she was a very progressive woman.</span> <span id="s235">I have a picture where sh -- you could see a family picture and she’s wearing -- she’s wearing a wig.</span> <span id="s236">She was religious, but the combination of her religiosity and her progressiveness and being so well educated is -- is a little hard to understand for a woman who must have -- I don’t know how old she was.</span> <span id="s237">Well, she was born in the 19th century for sure.</span> <span id="s238">She was a 19th century woman.</span> <span id="s239">So I -- all these aunts and the cousins, I just absolutely adored.</span> <span id="s240">Now, nobody from that family survived.</span> <span id="s241">And one of my mother’s sisters, the youngest one, who was also single, became a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s242">She studied pharmacy before the war and her first job was in 1939, in the summer.</span> <span id="s243">And she went to a place called Wamsha, which is northeast Poland, around Biawastock -- around there.</span> <span id="s244">We never found out what happened to her.</span> <span id="s245">You know, we know what happened to the others because people from Austrovietz who survived, told us what happened to the people from Austrovietz.</span> <span id="s246">Like I could tell you what peop -- what happened to people from Starachowice who didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s247">They went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s248">Austrovietz was the same.</span> <span id="s249">People -- some people who survive who knew when Babcha went and Regina and all the aunts.</span> <span id="s250">This youngest sister of my mother’s, whose name was Roosia, we never found out -- of course Wamsha was decimated as badly as any other city, as far as the Jewish population, so -- but we never -- I’m saying it for the reason that as much as we know who perished where, we have no idea where this one aunt perished.</span> <span id="s251">Now Babcha the other one, Babcha Laks, from Solsnoviets, she perished together with her family there.</span> <span id="s252">She had two daughters who were married and had children.</span> <span id="s253">The only person that survived from Babcha -- who lived with Babcha, was one of her granddaughters, Annjapatashnik, she lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s254">We see her and we keep in touch.</span> <span id="s255">Other than that, her son Alexander, who was my unc -- my brother -- my father’s brother, Alexander Laks, with his family, they survived.</span> <span id="s256">So from the Tannenblume side, nobody survived except the three of us, the three sisters.</span> <span id="s257">From the Laks side of the family, only Uncle Alexander with his wife and the two sons who were in Russia and Anja, my cousin Anja.</span> <span id="s258">And we’re talking about, if you add the numbers of these two families, it’s an unbelievable number, like 200 people or maybe even more.</span> <span id="s259">You see, so tho -- this is the immediate family, not counting other cousins, you know, that were distant cousins and -- and my mother’s cousins and such.</span> <span id="s260">We’re just talking about the immediate family.</span> <span id="s261">Grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins.</span> <span id="s262">And everybody perished, except as I told you, for the three of us.</span> <span id="s263">The three sisters, Uncle Alexander with his wife and the two sons.</span> <span id="s264">Of course they didn’t go through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s265">Uncle and aunt did, the sons went to Russia and they came out of Russia with unders army, with the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: We will talk about Uncle Alexander and --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Later, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Maybe you could just give us a little clearer understanding of the relationship between the three of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: The three of us, right.</span> <span id="s270">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: [indecipherable] your sist -- your two sisters and you.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: All right.</span> <span id="s273">We were very close.</span> <span id="s274">First of all, as I told you, we all went to Polish schools.</span> <span id="s275">When the time came for my oldest sister to go to high school, she was always very brilliant, she was the brain of the family, the genius.</span> <span id="s276">And to this day, we -- we -- we treat her that way.</span> <span id="s277">She was not to be bothered with daily things.</span> <span id="s278">When she came in and she had to be served and she -- because she was a genius.</span> <span id="s279">Anyhow, she went -- she took a test in Radom.</span> <span id="s280">Radom is a town not far from us, where they had a -- a special high school gimnasium where Jews were not allowed, except the very smart Jews.</span> <span id="s281">It was a school and -- what was the name of that high school?</span> <span id="s282">I forgot, it probably come to me.</span> <span id="s283">Anyhow, she went to -- from Starachowice, with my mother, she took the test and then you had to go and find your name, she made it.</span> <span id="s284">There were 500 girls in that school and there were five Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s285">She was one of them and she was from out of town.</span> <span id="s286">So now it gives you an idea how bright she was and how -- how really sharp she was to be edout.</span> <span id="s287">So she -- she lived in Radom, before -- right before the war.</span> <span id="s288">She lived in Radom, went to gimnasium in Radom, had her Radom friends there.</span> <span id="s289">And she -- the tutoring, she was supplementing her income always with tutoring.</span> <span id="s290">She was tutoring French and she was tutoring Latin.</span> <span id="s291">And this is very important for my later part of the story.</span> <span id="s292">Because she was a tutor to others and she always kept all these books and she was just -- she was the oldest and she had the most academic knowledge.</span> <span id="s293">That came in very handy later on during the war.</span> <span id="s294">But now we’re talking about before the war.</span> <span id="s295">So she lived in Radom and came home for vacations.</span> <span id="s296">She was not to be bothered.</span> <span id="s297">My father knew nothing in the kitchen, he couldn’t even set himself a ca -- top -- glass of tea, as they called it, glass of tea.</span> <span id="s298">When sh -- when Hanya came home, father served her a gl -- a cu -- a glass of tea, because you could not bother geniuses with things like that, you see.</span> <span id="s299">Now Krisha, the sen -- the -- the middle child, Lehrman, Krislerman -- she was always very beautiful.</span> <span id="s300">She was an exceptional beauty.</span> <span id="s301">And I’m not just saying she was pretty.</span> <span id="s302">She was a striking beauty.</span> <span id="s303">She still is, but in those days she really was a strikingly beautiful child.</span> <span id="s304">And she -- also she went to Polish schools, yes, I think I mentioned it, that Hanya first went to elementary school which was Polish.</span> <span id="s305">Th-This is the town school.</span> <span id="s306">And then she went to Radom to the gimnasium.</span> <span id="s307">Krisha also started the gimnasium in Starachowice.</span> <span id="s308">Mother’s only problem about Krisha was, that because she’s so beautiful, she will not be as smart as my other dau -- sister.</span> <span id="s309">So if they would pass in the street and somebody said, “Oh, she’s so beautiful.”</span> <span id="s310">So my mother said, “You shouldn’t say that.”</span> <span id="s311">People were always reprimanded to remark that she was -- my mother used to say, “She will never grow up to be anything, because everybody’s going to tell her she’s so beautiful and --”, but she was.</span> <span id="s312">“She will think life is just nothing, I mean, she don’t have to make the effort.”</span> <span id="s313">But of course she was very, very smart and very practical.</span> <span id="s314">Krisha was always very practical.</span> <span id="s315">Hanya, the oldest one, was always on another, you know, somewhere else in the -- in -- in -- in the clouds, head in the clouds.</span> <span id="s316">But Krisha was down to earth, she was smart, she was industrious, as of course life proved later on.</span> <span id="s317">In true life, she was the smartest, you know.</span> <span id="s318">And she did in school, she --very well.</span> <span id="s319">She did very, very good school work.</span> <span id="s320">And of course, then I was at th-th-th-the tail end, of course.</span> <span id="s321">I -- I wasn’t what you call a ver -- I was sort of an ugly duckling type of kid, you know.</span> <span id="s322">I didn’t eat much, but I -- I was sort of very curious about things, you know I -- they used to call me th-the -- the -- the information agency, because I used to go out and find this happen and you know this.</span> <span id="s323">There was a band playing fair and this -- I always was very curious about everything.</span> <span id="s324">I was extremely curious and I was very good in school.</span> <span id="s325">That is the one thing that -- from the minute I hit school, that was my life and I really had all th-th-the -- five was the -- the -- the -- like an A, you know, in America it’s A, B you get in col -- in school.</span> <span id="s326">Well, I had fives, always fives, everything was five.</span> <span id="s327">And mother used to say the same thing, “You shouldn’t talk in the front of the child about that she’s so good in school.</span> <span id="s328">Doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s329">She’s going to get an idea, she’s --”, this was the whole.</span> <span id="s330">And you know, the upbringing in those days -- yo-you -- you should never praise your child for being smart.</span> <span id="s331">Today, I say to my grandson, “Oh, I think you’re the smartest child in the world.”</span> <span id="s332">I always tell -- say to him, I say, “You know, I think you’re so smart.”</span> <span id="s333">Which he is.</span> <span id="s334">He’s very intelligent.</span> <span id="s335">Max is now nine years old.</span> <span id="s336">And I keep telling him, I say, “I think you’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s337">I think you’re so smart.”</span> <span id="s338">My parents always told us we’re wonderful and everything, but every attribute that was outstanding was not to be praised.</span> <span id="s339">Like Krisha’s beauty was taboo, you shouldn’t say it in front of her because she’s not going to grow up to be anything.</span> <span id="s340">You should not -- Hanya you shouldn’t touch because she is -- she’s a genius, so she can’t -- and as far as Renia’s concerned -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s342">This is tape number one, side B. And so you were just talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes, no, I was just saying that -- that -- as -- as a -- as a -- what you call a child who did well in school, I wasn’t supposed to be praised too much because that would get in my head.</span> <span id="s344">But anyhow, we did have a very fine life, because as I already said, we had grandmothers visiting with us.</span> <span id="s345">We had a grand -- where we’re going to visit with the grandparents.</span> <span id="s346">We went to Busco every summer.</span> <span id="s347">Then we went on -- as I said, on a farm somewhere for a week or two because mother needed to recover from the treatment.</span> <span id="s348">We went to Hebrew school in the afternoon after school and we also participated in the Polish -- in life of the Polish community.</span> <span id="s349">There were parades -- third of May, you know, is a national holiday like July fourth, this day of -- Constitution day.</span> <span id="s350">Or 11th of November, which is Armistice Day here, but over there it was Poland was liberated 1918, on the 11th.</span> <span id="s351">That was the end of the first war, that was a big holiday in Poland.</span> <span id="s352">So we would go and there were all kinds of things in school going on where you know, had the little -- the -- the speeches in the school and -- and speeches outside and we would recite poetry and then everybody would go -- you know, to -- to -- even to the church for whatever called -- some kind of a celebration.</span> <span id="s353">And we would go in.</span> <span id="s354">We wouldn’t -- you know, we wouldn’t pray or anything, but we went into the church just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s355">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So what was your relationship to your -- to your Polish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Very fr-friendly.</span> <span id="s358">Very.</span> <span id="s359">We were part of the Polish neighbor -- of the Polish community, but we were part of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s360">It’s just that we did not live the same type of life as the Hasidim did, you see.</span> <span id="s361">Because as I said, we went to Polish schools and that made all the difference.</span> <span id="s362">Be -- we spoke Polish at home.</span> <span id="s363">That made all the difference, you see?</span> <span id="s364">And the fact was that my parents were better educated and -- and more, I use a vernacular -- plugged in to the bigger world.</span> <span id="s365">You see, the Hasidic world was very insular.</span> <span id="s366">It isn’t that they didn’t -- they hated the Poles or they loved the Poles, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s367">They lived their own lives.</span> <span id="s368">They were parallel to the lives of the Polish community, but they didn’t mingle, you know.</span> <span id="s369">We were being invited for Christmas celebrations to other people’s -- the Christian homes.</span> <span id="s370">Our -- my mother’s dear, dear friends came for Passover Seder sometimes, for Jewish holidays, for whatever.</span> <span id="s371">To eat the Jewish foods, however it was.</span> <span id="s372">So ours was a sort of part of the overall community, whereas the Hasidim lived their own life, very much along the -- the religious lines.</span> <span id="s373">And they were not plugged in to the larger community and this was true throughout Poland.</span> <span id="s374">Starachowice was not in any way different, you see, from the prevailing -- not conditions, the -- the -- the prevailing living standards, you know?</span> <span id="s375">This was one community that sw -- we were sort of in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: How did you become aware of the -- or did you become aware of the rising power of the Nazis?</span> <span id="s377">Since your parents were plugged in to the larger world --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: How did it filter into the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s381">This is the one thing about which I know nothing.</span> <span id="s382">As I told you, my parents wouldn’t allow us to be praised for -- they always wanted to protect us along the lines that they thought were proper -- not proper, but important to bring up children.</span> <span id="s383">I personally am the youngest -- that I knew nothing about anything.</span> <span id="s384">I didn’t know about -- I knew that there was Nazi movement -- that there was some bad men in -- in Germany, but that the German Jews were being sent out of Germany, but this was -- this was far, Germany was God knows where and -- and it had nothing to do with me personally.</span> <span id="s385">My parents never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s386">As a matter of fact, in later years, way later, when we were already in -- in the ghetto, they never told us anything.</span> <span id="s387">And I am quite sure they knew a lot.</span> <span id="s388">So, to this day, I question.</span> <span id="s389">Did they know and didn’t tell us or didn -- maybe they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s390">But it’s not possible that people like this wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s391">And when I reflect on my background, how we were always so protected.</span> <span id="s392">You know, you shouldn’t tal -- you shouldn’t tell her she’s smart and you shouldn’t tell her she’s beautiful, you know, because it’s not goi -- well, why should you tell children those horrible things, if they were true?</span> <span id="s393">Maybe people didn’t believe yet -- that what was happening was true.</span> <span id="s394">So coming back to pre-war and the Nazi rise to power and how it affected my life, maybe it emboldened the Poles to open boycott, because I do remember distinctly -- to this day we have an anecdote, the family anecdote.</span> <span id="s395">My father was coming home and there was a store, a Jewish store in -- in -- up front on -- in the street level where we lived, we lived in the back.</span> <span id="s396">And he came and there was this whole group of Poles walking around and saying, “Beat the Jew, beat the Jew, beat the Jew.”</span> <span id="s397">They were walking -- picketing that store and my father came up on it and one of the men was a very good friend.</span> <span id="s398">And when my father passed by, he said, “Beat the Jew, economically.”</span> <span id="s399">So to this day when th-the issue of Polish anti-Semitism is descri -- dis -- discussed, I say I do remember when my father came home laughing, he said, “In the last minute when he saw me, he says, “Be jer da economeetchnia.”</span> <span id="s400">He kept saying, “Be jer da, be jer da,” he saw me and he said, “Be jer da economeetchnia.</span> <span id="s401">”” You see?</span> <span id="s402">And this was open.</span> <span id="s403">Now there were other things that went on prior to that, that were maybe a little more subtle, a little more hidden.</span> <span id="s404">But when I -- I remembered the boycotts, only because my father is relating that incident.</span> <span id="s405">The last minute -- he says be jer da, he stops, economeetchnia.</span> <span id="s406">He saw my father passing by.</span> <span id="s407">You see?</span> <span id="s408">And that was a true economic boycott, which really didn’t get anywhere, in the sense that the -- the Jews were very good traders and they good stuff and -- and the Poles still shop, so they shop sort of quietly, through the back door or whatever.</span> <span id="s409">But -- Jewish population was being squeezed, no question about that, you know, no question about it.</span> <span id="s410">In the -- just before the war, they were getting the -- squeezed constantly, worse and worse.</span> <span id="s411">That’s before the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: When -- when were you yourself, personally more aware of -- that something was changing?</span> <span id="s413">How did it manifest itself?</span> <span id="s414">There was the anecdote from your father, but did you see something, did you hear something yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, I really have one recollection and that was around Passover.</span> <span id="s416">What year that was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s417">Could have been ‘38 or maybe ‘39.</span> <span id="s418">A new family moved in -- into the neighborhood and there was this little girl, Kiya.</span> <span id="s419">A very lovely, blonde, little girl.</span> <span id="s420">And she was placed in the same grade as I was, so we became instant friends.</span> <span id="s421">She was my friend, not the other -- not Krisha’s and not Hanya’s friend.</span> <span id="s422">And then was Passover -- Passover rolled around, could have been right before the war and I told her to come in -- no, she used to come all the time to play with me, we did homework together, you know, we read poetry, such.</span> <span id="s423">And I told her to come and -- to come to the house.</span> <span id="s424">And she says no, now she won’t come.</span> <span id="s425">I said, “How come?”</span> <span id="s426">She says no, she is not going to come for a little while, like a week or two.</span> <span id="s427">And I said, “Why is that?”</span> <span id="s428">She says because it’s Passover and the Jews grab children for -- that they take blood from the children for matzahs.</span> <span id="s429">That was my first shock.</span> <span id="s430">I did not hear it from the children, my -- from the town, but I did hear it from that child.</span> <span id="s431">And she never came during Passover.</span> <span id="s432">And then I think eventually the war came.</span> <span id="s433">So it had to be 1939, you know, in the spring, yeah, I’m sure that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s434">And she says no, she wouldn’t come and she didn’t come.</span> <span id="s435">And I think my mother said sh -- that I don’t need such friends anyhow.</span> <span id="s436">So, whatever it was, that was the end of the relationship.</span> <span id="s437">I think the war just came, then the summer came around and then summers we went -- you know with we’re here and we were there, we went to Babcha.</span> <span id="s438">By the time September came, I never went to school again.</span> <span id="s439">You know, 1939, the war broke out the first of September, so -- she was in my class so that was -- that was the end of the relationship.</span> <span id="s440">So that was one that I never, never forgot.</span> <span id="s441">And another one was in school, it happened to me and I -- I always look back on it and think to myself, what motivated this man to say that?</span> <span id="s442">I had a new teacher and he -- was first day of school and again, could have been 1938 -- yes it had to be 1938 because I didn’t go to school any more in ‘39.</span> <span id="s443">And he says, “Could every child please stand up and say his name?”</span> <span id="s444">So everybody got up and then I got up and I said, “Regina Laks.”</span> <span id="s445">So he -- and I sat down and so he tells me to get up, he says, “No, your name is not Regina.</span> <span id="s446">You are Jewish, right?”</span> <span id="s447">I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s448">“Your name is not Regina.”</span> <span id="s449">I said, “Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s450">I can prove it, I can show it.</span> <span id="s451">I mean I -- I am surely Regina.”</span> <span id="s452">“No, you go back to your mother and tell her that your name is Rifka.”</span> <span id="s453">And I went home and I cried and my mother said not to bother about it, because we can prove that my name is Regina.</span> <span id="s454">It’s on the papers, it’s on my birth certificate and if he doesn’t like it, that’s how he doesn’t like it, but my name is not Rifka.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: When he said that, what did it mean to you?</span> <span id="s456">Did -- how did you interpret that?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I interpreted by the fact that he did not like Jews.</span> <span id="s458">He absolutely had it in him to -- to -- to belittle me.</span> <span id="s459">I mean, you know how it is in front of a class, to be -- I mean you are a seven, eight or nine year old child and somebody says something like this to you in front of the class.</span> <span id="s460">And of course you know they -- the -- in the -- in the child is exposed to all kinds of other antagonisms and not necessarily out of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s461">When I was a kid, th-th-th-the Christian boys used to beat up the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s462">But that isn’t what you call anti-Semitism in the true sense.</span> <span id="s463">This is just, well they’re Jews, we don’t have to bother with them and you can beat them up.</span> <span id="s464">So, however it was, I was afraid as a girl, of these Christian boys, but some of them were friendly and others us-used to beat us up coming from school, so we used to go home in a group.</span> <span id="s465">But this was very specific, this calling me out in the class, very specific and even as a child, I could feel that he wanted to belittle me, that he wanted -- one way or another to belittle me in front of the class.</span> <span id="s466">You see?</span> <span id="s467">Because when I was beaten up by a Christian boy, that was just part of the way things were.</span> <span id="s468">You know, you beat up -- the boys were rambunctious and well anyway.</span> <span id="s469">But this was different.</span> <span id="s470">So that incident -- that I never forgot.</span> <span id="s471">Never, never, never.</span> <span id="s472">Like my father’s anecdote about Be jer da economeetchnia, I didn’t forget that and I didn’t forget the fact that -- that my name is not Regina, but Rifka, which of course wasn’t the case.</span> <span id="s473">So th-this -- to answer your question, this was about the extent of my awareness.</span> <span id="s474">You see -- the extent of my personal awareness of things around me.</span> <span id="s475">As far as the larger picture, I don’t know what my parents knew.</span> <span id="s476">My father had to know.</span> <span id="s477">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s478">There was an -- a magazine or something called, Ost une vest.</span> <span id="s479">Something like that.</span> <span id="s480">There we -- he used to -- he used to subscribe to -- used to come.</span> <span id="s481">I don’t know where it came from, whether it came from Salesia or from Germany, but he used to subscribe to that.</span> <span id="s482">That had to have something in it that would give them an idea what’s going on.</span> <span id="s483">But I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s484">I only knew that as far as the preparation of the -- the young pioneers for Israel, did not have to do with anti-Semitism, you see, because that was strictly establishing a Jewish homeland type of thing, with no connection.</span> <span id="s485">That’s the way I understood it, with no connection to other things that were going on.</span> <span id="s486">That was a program and there was a whole thing of collecting money and doing this and the other thing and training and shipping and there were kinds of Jewish leaders who used to come to our hometown and give speeches and so on.</span> <span id="s487">But that had nothing to do with the official recognition or condemnation or -- or anything.</span> <span id="s488">Anti-Semitism as such, no.</span> <span id="s489">That was another aspect of -- of Jewish life in Poland.</span> <span id="s490">In the 30’s, as I understand it now, a lot of young Jews, pioneers, went to Europe -- to Palestine, settled there.</span> <span id="s491">You know, I translated Kolchuk, Yanoush Kolchuk and I did a lot of work on him -- about him.</span> <span id="s492">He -- his children -- so-called children, who got to be 16 and -- and -- and left the orphanage, resettled in Palestine as did his own assistant, Vincheeska, Stefania Vincheeska.</span> <span id="s493">And Kolchuk was -- absolutely begged -- begged to come to Palestine.</span> <span id="s494">He went to Palestine in 1936.</span> <span id="s495">I mean, I know it now from history and from the research and the translations that I do.</span> <span id="s496">He went to Israel.</span> <span id="s497">It was not for him.</span> <span id="s498">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s499">He was totally -- he was a writer.</span> <span id="s500">He could not fit into a framework of another language.</span> <span id="s501">And he came back.</span> <span id="s502">And he was -- he was dismissed from the Polish radio in 1938.</span> <span id="s503">You know, he was the -- the -- the famous old doctor who gave advice, like Dr. Spock here, gave advice on child rearing to everybody.</span> <span id="s504">He was removed from the Polish radio in 1938, yet he didn’t go back to Palestine, you see?</span> <span id="s505">And in my -- I used to hear Kolchuk read children’s stories -- you know, I used to -- in school we had the books, Kolchuk’s.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe not in school, at home.</span> <span id="s507">But the point is that -- coming back to how aware was I. I was aware in my small, little world, but absolutely not in connection to anything on a larger scale.</span> <span id="s508">And my sister in Radom, Hanya, who was in the Polish gimnasium -- I don’t know that she suffered much anti-Semitism, for the reason -- or maybe she did -- for the reason that she was so smart, you see?</span> <span id="s509">So you -- you couldn’t attack somebody who was just top -- tops -- tops, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: But -- but then the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And living conditions changed somehow [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Very.</span> <span id="s514">Yes.</span> <span id="s515">The -- it’s very important to say -- again you see how the factory -- the plant, the -- how that fits into the -- into the progression.</span> <span id="s516">In -- on how much my life is tied up with it, even though I really, frankly, I mean I had no connection to it, but how -- what a big part of my life that factory was.</span> <span id="s517">And it wasn’t -- and it wasn’t part of my life, but how it influenced my life.</span> <span id="s518">When the war broke out and there were -- the bombings started and they -- they started digging dren -- trenches, you know, for anti-aircraft, my father became the captain, you know, they -- like they designated.</span> <span id="s519">We lived on the street -- the main street, it was called Putsaskago -- connected Wierzbnik and Starachowice.</span> <span id="s520">It was the nicest street.</span> <span id="s521">Less commercial -- least commercial.</span> <span id="s522">Not where the -- all the stores and so on.</span> <span id="s523">My father was designated the captain, you know, for the anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s524">And -- so the factory was in Starachowice.</span> <span id="s525">The Wierzbnik town was on the other side and the -- in between was the s -- the street Putsaskago that connected.</span> <span id="s526">So my father came, he -- there was a briefing, he was called in to the headquarters there, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s527">And my father came and said, “The town is being evacuated, everybody has to get out.”</span> <span id="s528">“Why?”</span> <span id="s529">“Because the factory is going to be blown to pieces.</span> <span id="s530">Just like in the first war.”</span> <span id="s531">The first thing they attacked was the factory -- the factories that produced metal things and such.</span> <span id="s532">So, immediately we all go out and we -- we -- there were forest not far from us and the whole town was evacuated.</span> <span id="s533">The closer we got to the forest, the more there were people with cows, you know, the farmers and the -- the Jews and the religious Jews and the non-rel -- and the Christians and the farmers and the cows and the dogs and everybody going into -- into the forest because this -- the factory is going to be blown up and this town is going to be blown away, so that’s how it’s going to be, right?</span> <span id="s534">Because you learned from experience, that’s what happened, okay.</span> <span id="s535">We got caught in the crossfire of the worst kind.</span> <span id="s536">Because we were in a valley and on the two hills -- one was the German artillery and the other was the Polish.</span> <span id="s537">They were shooting at each other, we were in the middle and the German planes would come down with reflectors at night and shoot with machine guns at the people on the ground.</span> <span id="s538">Anyhow, then a few days later, after this horrend -- there was one horrendous night during -- where we were caught in the crossfire -- that there was -- I thought nobody would come out.</span> <span id="s539">This was my first thing, I didn’t yet know who was who and who was Germans and who wasn’t, I just couldn’t imagine what people look like, to do -- to do things like this.</span> <span id="s540">Anyhow, then it got quiet and everybody said, “Now we’re going back.”</span> <span id="s541">We went back.</span> <span id="s542">The factory was not even touched.</span> <span id="s543">There wasn’t a b -- one bomb fell somewhere in town, but nothing was damaged.</span> <span id="s544">Nothing was damaged.</span> <span id="s545">The factory was immediately -- they must have had spies in there or something.</span> <span id="s546">The factory, within one week was operational for war production.</span> <span id="s547">Okay?</span> <span id="s548">So now, we all came back and we started seeing Germans in the street.</span> <span id="s549">And they all -- they all started -- we came back to our own apartment and everybody came back.</span> <span id="s550">Our apartment wasn’t damaged.</span> <span id="s551">In fact, I remember we were eating quickly and we left the dishes and everything and by the time we came back three or four days later, there are flies around it and everything, because was so hot.</span> <span id="s552">Was a tremendously, terribly hot September, you know, when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s553">However, we dragged ourselves back and the town was not damaged.</span> <span id="s554">The factory was not touched and the Germans were marking -- marching in formation and singing.</span> <span id="s555">They were always singing, marching in the street.</span> <span id="s556">They wore boots -- high leather boots and they were marching and -- and my parents, you know, my father, being a German himself, you know, he -- he wasn’t German, but you -- as I explained, he spoke German and he identified with German culture.</span> <span id="s557">He thought th-th-that’s nothing, you know, nothing.</span> <span id="s558">Well, before we knew it, they started coming around with dogs and catching people in the street -- the Germans, and they caught my father, my father was passing and he went and he wasn’t coming back for hours.</span> <span id="s559">My mother got very -- my mother got very worried.</span> <span id="s560">They kept them somewhere cleaning something.</span> <span id="s561">So she went -- somebody said, “Oh, they took all these Jews, they took them to the railroad station to clean up.”</span> <span id="s562">So my mother went over to the railroad station, there was this German guard.</span> <span id="s563">And she said to hi -- she spoke German too, she said to the German soldier, she said, “Vasin th-the herren.”</span> <span id="s564">And he said, “These -- these aren’t herren.</span> <span id="s565">These are the yuden.”</span> <span id="s566">And he kicked her.</span> <span id="s567">And this was maybe second day after they arrived.</span> <span id="s568">Th-That was -- nothing happened yet.</span> <span id="s569">This was already -- they took -- they made them clean with toothbrushes, you know, they made the Jews with the beards, they had to clean st-steps with beards and -- the most -- and this -- and -- and nothing was yet happening on a larger scale, only those small things.</span> <span id="s570">Then they started coming around the how -- homes.</span> <span id="s571">They would come with a big dog.</span> <span id="s572">I told you my father had an encyclopedia that was -- now I know it was very valuable, because it was leather bound, with gold lettering.</span> <span id="s573">I mean, I say it’s very valuable in terms of antique possessions, but in those day, this was my life, because it was all handpainted, like butterflies and birds was all handpaint.</span> <span id="s574">When I used to read -- not read, I couldn’t read German, but I used to look at the pictures, I had to wash my hands.</span> <span id="s575">I had to have -- my father expec -- inspected my hands to see that I didn’t leave a stain.</span> <span id="s576">The most beautiful butterfly pictures, the most beautiful bird pictures, flowers, it was all handpainted.</span> <span id="s577">Was very valuable encyclopedia.</span> <span id="s578">Well, the first thing, I don’t know, maybe three days after the war started, very early.</span> <span id="s579">As I said, before anything bigger was happening, they came into the house and the German looked at that encyclopedia.</span> <span id="s580">My father had it in a, you know, like a breakfront with glass doors, th -- because they were under a key.</span> <span id="s581">God forbid, you couldn’t touch the stuff, you know, it was sacred.</span> <span id="s582">So it was always under lock and key.</span> <span id="s583">He said to open this.</span> <span id="s584">He opened, then he kicked my father, he said to give him boxes.</span> <span id="s585">They didn’t have boxes, I don’t know how they came back with boxes.</span> <span id="s586">They load it in the boxes and they took it away.</span> <span id="s587">That was the first insult.</span> <span id="s588">Between the fir -- time that my father was taken to clean the station, where he wasn’t herren, he was just a yuden and this act of vandalism that hit to the core.</span> <span id="s589">Of course later on, when -- with the gas chambers, who would even know that person would take such an insult so personally?</span> <span id="s590">This taking away of the encyclopedia was such a blow to the family, to him.</span> <span id="s591">Was no questions asked, you know.</span> <span id="s592">They burst in, “Where’s the key?”</span> <span id="s593">Put it out and they took it.</span> <span id="s594">And they went around looking for something, they would take a bayonet and s -- and shove it in the car -- in the -- in the couch or something.</span> <span id="s595">Just for the fun of it.</span> <span id="s596">Those were personal insults for which nobody was yet prepared.</span> <span id="s597">They were terrific blows.</span> <span id="s598">And we’re talking -- in retrospect, you’re talking about nothing.</span> <span id="s599">If you consider Auschwitz and all the other things, for heaven’s sake.</span> <span id="s600">And -- and the Holocaust and the genocide and here I’m talking -- but at that time, even I as a child felt that insult when my mother came and cried because he -- th-that man, that soldier said these were not men, they -- gentlemen, they herren, you know.</span> <span id="s601">He -- these were just Jews.</span> <span id="s602">That was the one insult and then the encyclopedia was the other insult.</span> <span id="s603">And who even know -- knew that this was -- on the scale of things, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s604">You know, but this was a tremendously sh -- a shake-up of the -- this was the first blow.</span> <span id="s605">Very severe first blow.</span> <span id="s606">Anybody who would listen to me now, talking about the Holocaust, would say, what nonsense is that?</span> <span id="s607">This is how it was, you see?</span> <span id="s608">Right away we were -- there was no food, they wouldn’t allow us to buy food, we had to -- oh, no -- I -- I am really yet getting ahead of myself, because this is right after we came back.</span> <span id="s609">And very soon -- this was a daily occurrence, that the Gestapo would come around with dogs, so you couldn’t be outside, you couldn’t go -- you couldn’t because if th -- you were of age, like my father, they would take you to labor somewhere or just to -- to maltreat you.</span> <span id="s610">And if you were a child, they would sic the dog on you or something.</span> <span id="s611">So immediately we had to be very, very aware of -- of -- they were very brutal, that was Gestapo.</span> <span id="s612">And there was especially one man -- what was his -- Altov I think was his name.</span> <span id="s613">I think it was Altov.</span> <span id="s614">He came around with the dogs and the children were petrified.</span> <span id="s615">Anyhow, my parents found a way to have us stay home.</span> <span id="s616">Now, you understand, this is now September, we’re not allowed to go to school, because this Polish school, you’re not allowed -- it was very hard.</span> <span id="s617">We used to swim in the river -- was a river there, Kamiena -- can’t swim in the river, can’t go outside because God only knows.</span> <span id="s618">At least if you’re around the house, you can run in when he comes around with the dog.</span> <span id="s619">So what happened was that my sister decided -- Hanya the genius, she had all the books, she was a tutor anyhow, she said she’s going to teach us at home, that will keep us busy.</span> <span id="s620">So she opened a little school.</span> <span id="s621">I was in her -- in one class with my friends, there were four of us.</span> <span id="s622">She was a very strict taskmaster.</span> <span id="s623">We had French, we had Latin.</span> <span id="s624">I didn’t even finish elementary school and we started on a much higher level, because first we finished the books that were home and then she proceeded -- that’s, by the way, through the ghetto -- what I’m starting telling you now is still as the war broke out and we’re facing the new reality.</span> <span id="s625">So this is how to keep the children out of trouble with -- I studied with my sister and whatever it was -- was a regular class and very strict and there was homework.</span> <span id="s626">And she always kept telling me that I -- she expects from me more than from the others, because she knows I can do it.</span> <span id="s627">And I was very resentful because I had to really -- I mean she lived in the same house and she saw that I had to do the homework.</span> <span id="s628">Little did I know that my basic education really came -- that was th-the -- the -- the building stone of my f -- later, you know, higher education.</span> <span id="s629">But anyhow, so life became very hard.</span> <span id="s630">First of all, we were now very impoverished in the sense that we had -- we started selling things, you see.</span> <span id="s631">Whatever you could sell, there wa -- first of all, my father did not have a job and we started selling things to suppor -- to su -- not we, I mean I -- you know, I -- I had very little to do with that.</span> <span id="s632">I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s633">I -- you know, I wasn’t much, but I’m just telling you how things were.</span> <span id="s634">Mother was an excellent cook, so she started doing things like baking cookies with white beets, sugar beets, which she never did before, she learned that, she -- she cooked th -- she put together whatever was possible, but life was basically now -- after the first trauma of the -- of the -- of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the encyclopedia and th-this -- the little things, so called.</span> <span id="s635">What -- what set in was hunger and fear, you see.</span> <span id="s636">It was so -- everything was permeated with fear.</span> <span id="s637">If father had to go somewhere, even to exchange something or sell something.</span> <span id="s638">To -- to -- to -- to dispose of some possessions, silver or crystals or whatever.</span> <span id="s639">You never knew if he was coming back.</span> <span id="s640">If -- if mother had to go buy some food somewhere, you never -- the fear was a gripping kind of fear.</span> <span id="s641">This is why the children, we were at home, just locked in -- no-not like prisoners, because life was wonderful and you read books, you -- I read Tolstoy.</span> <span id="s642">I mean, I was 10 years old, I was reading Tolstoy.</span> <span id="s643">Not that I -- I probably understood some, but I read War and Peace when I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s644">Because all the books were, you know, whatever was home, I read it.</span> <span id="s645">Was in Polish, obviously.</span> <span id="s646">The thing is that the fear was probably the most crippling until we got -- we didn’t get used to it -- until we learned how to call -- to -- to fit it into -- into th-the-the -- the life, you see.</span> <span id="s647">Of course I don’t have to tell you, they were -- they were shooting people right and left.</span> <span id="s648">Then they started -- the factory was already going, still Christians only.</span> <span id="s649">They started picking Jews -- able, you know, able Jews, send them in the factory and very soon it became apparent that they have some plan.</span> <span id="s650">Now, nobody knew what plan, but people said, “If you can have a job, you’ll be safe.”</span> <span id="s651">Safe from what, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s652">We were thrown out of that apartment, the street was cleared of Jews, because that was the main street.</span> <span id="s653">Probably in 1940, early in 1940.</span> <span id="s654">So we lived a few more months in the apartment, but we were already very poor and -- anyhow, then we got moved further into Wierzbnik, you see, I told you we were between Starachowice and Wierzbnik on the main thi -- on the main street.</span> <span id="s655">We got pushed into Wierzbnik.</span> <span id="s656">There was no ghetto or anything like that yet.</span> <span id="s657">It’s just that this was the number one street to be cleared of Jews.</span> <span id="s658">And the Jews lived wherever, but they lived further down.</span> <span id="s659">And by which time my parents had to sell some pieces because I’ll -- the apartment we moved in wasn’t the same size, so that was, in a way, better that they -- you know, they could get some money and we could live on that.</span> <span id="s660">And as the word got out that people were -- able bodied men might be of use.</span> <span id="s661">And they started taking Jews into the factory there, you see?</span> <span id="s662">This is the first time that any Jew ever worked.</span> <span id="s663">But by now this was a munitions plant.</span> <span id="s664">They were producing shells -- cannon shells.</span> <span id="s665">You see, they discontinued -- I understand you can convert such plants.</span> <span id="s666">They discontinued all that pre-war, consumer kind of goods into warm -- war production.</span> <span id="s667">And of course there was a Jewish council set up.</span> <span id="s668">My father was not part of it.</span> <span id="s669">We were not part of any -- anything like that.</span> <span id="s670">Not that this was bad, good or in between, my father just wasn’t.</span> <span id="s671">He was basically a guy who -- who -- he was not a merchant and he, you know, he -- he was not rich by then, because by 1938, we really, I mean we lived such fantastic lives and then everything started changing when he was booted out of the job.</span> <span id="s672">Anyhow, during that period, from the time that we were eli-eliminated -- expelled from that main street, until such time as they formed -- the Germans -- the Nazis formed a specific area for a ghetto, we changed apartments three times.</span> <span id="s673">Every time we got into this apartment, then this was off-limits.</span> <span id="s674">So then we were in another apartment and that was off-limits.</span> <span id="s675">And finally -- there was never -- this is a very important distinction to make.</span> <span id="s676">In Starachowice -- by the way, the -- the ghetto was in Wierzbnik, you see.</span> <span id="s677">In Wierzbnik or Starachowice -- I should really refer to it as Starachowice, there was never a ghetto like a Warsaw ghetto or like a Lódz ghetto with a -- with -- with a gate -- with the fences, no.</span> <span id="s678">The Jews were being cleared constantly, from this area -- as I told you, we had to go three times from one apartment to the next, to the next.</span> <span id="s679">From this area here and then from this area, until they picked an area where the Jews could live, but no other area.</span> <span id="s680">In other w -- we couldn’t live on Putsaskago any more, you see?</span> <span id="s681">We could only -- we now lived on the street called Yuzhetska.</span> <span id="s682">But the Christians, who lived there prior -- before us, also lived there.</span> <span id="s683">You see?</span> <span id="s684">So I remembered there was in Starachowice, Wierzbnik had this -- two cemeteries, the old cemetery and the new cemetery.</span> <span id="s685">After -- past the old cemetery was a little house -- a teamster, a man with a horse and -- and -- he -- he had a wagon and a horse, he was a teamster, had a little house with two room -- two, like two apartments, back to back.</span> <span id="s686">So he rented this one apartment to us, was a kitchen with a big room.</span> <span id="s687">And they lived in the similar -- in this -- this, and he was Christian.</span> <span id="s688">This is our last -- this was our last apartment.</span> <span id="s689">And it was within the confines of the ghetto, but the ghetto was not separated or segregated.</span> <span id="s690">People went from the ghetto to work in the factory and back.</span> <span id="s691">From the work and back.</span> <span id="s692">At that time, as I was telling you, my sister was my best teacher.</span> <span id="s693">Not my best -- we were continuing.</span> <span id="s694">As we moved, we were continuing, cause the kids that were studying with me, were also --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: [indecipherable] still for one minute while we change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s697">Okay.</span> <span id="s698">Good time for me -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s700">This is tape number two, side A. And you can take up where you --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah, I -- I do remember that when we dropped off -- that when the tape ended, that I did want to specify the dates, to more or less put it within a framework.</span> <span id="s702">The first phase of the occupation was the time when we lived on the main street, I -- up to the point at which we were thrown out of there.</span> <span id="s703">Meaning September 30, 1939 is the war started.</span> <span id="s704">By early 1940, it -- we were cleared -- we were thrown out of the -- our own apartment.</span> <span id="s705">While we lived in that -- at that -- that stretch of time during the war, as I was saying before, we -- children, of course had to watch out because of the dogs and the Nazis and such, we were terrified of them.</span> <span id="s706">I think I spend at least 10 hours a day studying.</span> <span id="s707">Absolutely didn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s708">And when we were rees -- when we resettled, within the confines of an area, which was designated as a future ghetto, we had three more apartments before we ended up in the last one, which was our last home in Starachowice, before the alseelung, before the town was cleared of the Jews.</span> <span id="s709">What I meant to say is that that entire period -- that entire ghetto period, no matter where we lived, in the stretch of these resettlements, the object was to keep the children ins -- indoors.</span> <span id="s710">We were kept -- I was kept indoors.</span> <span id="s711">My sisters were kept indoors because they were my teachers.</span> <span id="s712">The oldest one, Hanya was -- was conducting the class and so on.</span> <span id="s713">That lasted up to the minute when the town was cleared of Jews, no matter where we lived.</span> <span id="s714">Life was still -- my parents tried to keep it very -- as -- as normal as possible, which was totally impossible to -- to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s715">But to protect us the best way they could.</span> <span id="s716">To have us continue studying and -- and reading and -- and feeling that there is this other world, with which we don’t have for the time being, but eventually we’ll still have it, type of attitude.</span> <span id="s717">I also mentioned in the previous tape that some people decided that they would sign up for the work in the factory, because the word got around that this might be a good thing to do.</span> <span id="s718">My two sisters, very late -- I don’t know whether it was -- could have been early 1942 or late in 1941, signed up -- they went and were signed up and they were -- they were sent to a brick factory, also in our hometown, not in the major -- the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s719">So they went to -- there were three shifts and I think they rotated, however it was.</span> <span id="s720">The point of it all is this -- that when the town was to be cleared -- when the town was cleared in 1942, in October, my two sisters were on the night shift in that brick factory.</span> <span id="s721">They were not released, as none of the workers were allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s722">They were kept back.</span> <span id="s723">Whether it was the munitions factory or the brick factory, the workers were kept back, because meanwhile there was a round-up in what has now become -- is very small area of a ghetto, still not surrounded by wire or anything like the other ghettos that -- we know about Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s724">So that, by this time, there were only a few streets where the Jews were allowed to live and those Poles, Christian Poles who still lived there, lived there, but other than that, there were very few Poles.</span> <span id="s725">We were all squeezed in, I can’t tell you how many people to a room, but it was crowded, it was crowded.</span> <span id="s726">Meanwhile, there were shipments coming in from Lódz -- from the Lódz ghetto, people were shipped in and from other areas and -- and we were all being crowded in and crowded in until the day of October 27, 1942.</span> <span id="s727">As I said, my sisters were in the mun -- in the brick factory and five o’clock in the morning, maybe six, I don’t remember -- early in the morning, we heard the knock on the door, eiler rouse and we weren’t allowed to take anything, just to get out.</span> <span id="s728">And -- as fast as we could and the -- the Nazis were there with the rifles and the guns and the dogs and with -- they had sort of like a -- you know the type of thing that you hit a horse with?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: A whip, yes -- with the whips.</span> <span id="s731">And I -- I was used to the whips because whenever they marched by themselves, whenever they walked the -- the streets in the town, they always carried a whip.</span> <span id="s732">They always had guns, but they also carried whips.</span> <span id="s733">And we were ordered out very quickly -- out of the house and point -- said we have to walk to the main square.</span> <span id="s734">Of course, we meaning -- was my father, my mother and myself, because my two sisters were kept back and we absolutely had no idea what was happening.</span> <span id="s735">I certainly didn’t.</span> <span id="s736">Maybe my parents did, but they didn’t say and we didn’t know what the people in the factories are going to be doing.</span> <span id="s737">Meanwhile or later, with -- anyhow, when we came to the main square -- the distance between the house and the main square was maybe about three quarter miles, maybe a mile at the most.</span> <span id="s738">But the sights between the house and the main square were the most horrendous.</span> <span id="s739">That was the real brutal -- naked brutality, as I was forced to -- to -- to see en masse, the first time.</span> <span id="s740">Because, you know, I saw shooting here and a shoot -- beating there and all kinds of things I did see, but I didn’t see so many acts of brutality up to that point.</span> <span id="s741">We’re talking now about 1942 in October.</span> <span id="s742">I have never seen such brutality with -- in the -- the numbers involved.</span> <span id="s743">The infants thrown against the walls and -- and the old people beaten and kicked and shot as they couldn’t walk, or if they could walk.</span> <span id="s744">The whole scene, between the house, which we had to leave and the square where we had to line up, was one horrendous bloodbath.</span> <span id="s745">The most brutal sight I have ever seen up to that point and of course, I’ve seen plenty.</span> <span id="s746">I’ve seen all kinds of cruelty prior to that, but nothing in such concentrated form.</span> <span id="s747">And we -- on the way we picked up -- my mother had to -- my mother didn’t have to, we were walking, they were -- my parents were holding me by the hand and -- I was a skinny child.</span> <span id="s748">My mother padded me up with all kinds of rags, to make me look like I was developed, which I was nothing.</span> <span id="s749">She put rougema on my cheeks, so I would look more grown.</span> <span id="s750">I was tall, so I could sort of make myself look older if I tried.</span> <span id="s751">And on the way, mother noticed a friend of hers, an elderly lady, Miss -- Mrs. Kazimerzka, who couldn’t move and so m-mother took her by the -- under the arm, like and my father took me by the hand and the four of us walked together to the square.</span> <span id="s752">And of course when we came to the square, the acts of brutality has only -- had only in-intensified, because it was a real -- like a butchery.</span> <span id="s753">You know, it was the killing and the kicking and the -- and the -- th-this was already after the walk toward the center.</span> <span id="s754">The center was you had to line up and not everybody knew how to line up and where to line up and people were frantic and people were crying and people were praying and the Germans wouldn’t stand for any of that, they would kick and they would said, “You move fast.”</span> <span id="s755">And then you didn’t move fast, whatever it was, it was a terrifying scene and as we were approaching it, they pointed people to different directions.</span> <span id="s756">There were groups all around.</span> <span id="s757">Well, I was pointed in one direction, my father was pointed in another direction and mother, with Mrs. Kazimerzka, who -- Mother was holding Mrs. Kazimerzka, to another group.</span> <span id="s758">No-Nobody knew which group is which or which group was going where.</span> <span id="s759">We had no idea, by then, that there were trains already waiting on -- at the siding, because as I said, we were in the ghetto, meaning we were not allowed outside of that area.</span> <span id="s760">And the railroad station was outside of that area.</span> <span id="s761">So very soon -- it was also very hot, I remember this was very hot.</span> <span id="s762">My group was driven one way and I noticed that we were driven toward th-th-the -- toward Starachowice area, where the factory was.</span> <span id="s763">And I found myself in the -- in a place called Shellneetsa, which translated means fir-firing range.</span> <span id="s764">This was at one time a firing range and now there were barracks built there.</span> <span id="s765">I’ve never heard of the place, I’ve never seen the place, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s766">I knew I was still in Starachowice because it wasn’t far from the -- the -- the plant, from the factory.</span> <span id="s767">Well, when we found ourselves there, I realized that my sisters weren’t there, my mother wasn’t there and my father wasn’t there, not the way I saw it, but later on it turned out that he was, but I didn’t know it yet, be-because he was with a group of men who were lined up and brought to Shellneetsa and -- and put -- their group was pointed to another place where I couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s768">Anyhow, I was absolutely petrified, I was -- I -- I was out of my mind with fear, with total -- I always compare the feeling of fear for the duration of the war and I think the fear most acute was that fear, that time when I found myself alone.</span> <span id="s769">I was so alone and I absolutely didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s770">And people were always very kind to me and these were people from my hometown, say, “No, don’t cry, we’re going to get together with everybody eventually and everything will be fine.”</span> <span id="s771">Anyhow, I did find out father was in the same unit -- the same Shellneetsa camp and what transpired -- what we found out, the extent to which I found out about these things that I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s772">That some people -- among who my mother was -- were put on trains and sent somewhere.</span> <span id="s773">Resettled was -- was the euphemism, resettled.</span> <span id="s774">Didn’t mean anything -- but didn’t know any -- I didn’t know direction east, west, south or north, somewhere resettled.</span> <span id="s775">Father was in the Shellneetsa camp.</span> <span id="s776">He became a scribe.</span> <span id="s777">He always kept books and typewrite -- you know, typing and all this, so he did that and the two sisters, I -- we understood, were now in another camp that was called Mioufka and that camp housed the people from the brick factory, because it was closer to the brick factory.</span> <span id="s778">Shellneetsa was very close to the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s779">Well, I cannot remember the dates when the -- the date when the two camps were combined, but they were combined and we lived -- I met my sisters and the camp became my ufecach.</span> <span id="s780">Shellneetsa was empty, because Shellneetsa itself, I -- I -- I never know the reasons why things were happening, I just know that life in Shellneetsa was dreadful, everybody had typhus.</span> <span id="s781">I worked in the laundry, in the camp laundry.</span> <span id="s782">I had typhus.</span> <span id="s783">I had what they called a mild case, because I said, they say if you are a child, you have a milder case.</span> <span id="s784">Because my sister had typhus, the oldest one, Hanya, she was stricken by the severest case of typhus.</span> <span id="s785">She had hallucinations, she was out of her head, she was burning out with fever and she was talking out of -- out of proportion to anything that -- that -- that would mean anything.</span> <span id="s786">And, you know, the -- the -- the camp guards made selections while the f -- the epidemic was going on, so you had to come out and line up and however you stood up, they could see that you are another case to be disposed of.</span> <span id="s787">So one way or another, Hanya was propped up and -- and -- and he-held up and she didn’t talk and -- and so you couldn’t see that she was out of her mind completely.</span> <span id="s788">I went into the laundry room and there were these older ladies who took pity on me and they opened the big cauldrons with the steam and I stood behind -- this -- this was not the same time as Hanya was sick, because this was in -- you know, whatever the -- th-the -- the -- however it was one was sick.</span> <span id="s789">Now, three weeks later, or for whatever.</span> <span id="s790">But when my time came to have typhus, and there was another -- course the selections were always going on.</span> <span id="s791">Didn’t only have to do with typhus, let me just finish this about the cauldron.</span> <span id="s792">I stood behind the cauldron with the steam, so that you saw me all burning up, but of course I could have been burning up from the steam from the cauldron, from the laundry and this is how I -- I -- I survived typhus selection.</span> <span id="s793">But basically, the -- the slave labor camp in my hometown had selections all the time, typhus or not, because they were using these Jews, able bodied Jews, as long as they could.</span> <span id="s794">And once people got sick -- and of course there was no medication, there were no doctors and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s795">One people -- once people got sick, you had to dispose of them, you see?</span> <span id="s796">So in Shellneetsa, they d-dug a pit in the forest and they shot the people over the pit.</span> <span id="s797">In Mioufka the same.</span> <span id="s798">So it really -- you didn’t have to have typhus to fear being eliminated.</span> <span id="s799">Because if you had to line up before the barrack and they didn’t like the way you looked, one way or another, typhus or not, you could be shot there -- right there on the spot, anyhow.</span> <span id="s800">And they still needed an operational number -- number of people to do the jobs, because this was a factory that was around the clock, 24 hours, with three shifts and so they were shipping in new people all the time.</span> <span id="s801">Wherever they got these people, we don’t know, but they were getting these people, shipping them in, to supplement those numbers that were needed for the factory work.</span> <span id="s802">And I don’t know whether I mentioned it before, but the -- probably not -- that the administration of the camps was -- the highest echelon were the Germans, the SS, I think and the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s803">And everything u-under them were the Ukrainians and they wore German uniforms.</span> <span id="s804">The -- wasn’t the same color as the German, but it was a German uniform with Germany insignia.</span> <span id="s805">Now, they were the primary overseers.</span> <span id="s806">They mow -- they manned the towers -- the watchtowers, because you know, these camps were now surrounded by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s807">And of course you had to walk still, from the camp to the factory and back.</span> <span id="s808">And that was three shifts a day.</span> <span id="s809">So they were the ones who counted the people going and marched them out of the gate and marched them back.</span> <span id="s810">They were the ones who were lining people up for the ind -- inside selections, which were conducted by the Nazis, the German Nazis.</span> <span id="s811">With -- as I told you, the selections did not wait for typhus to -- to -- to be rampant, they just had selections, at any time of the day or night, if they please like it -- if they pleased, if they felt like it.</span> <span id="s812">They chased you out and they -- this -- here and here and there and pointed you this way and before you knew it, you ended up in the woods being shot.</span> <span id="s813">So the Ukrainians were very brutal.</span> <span id="s814">Sometimes I felt they were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s815">They probably tried to prove themselves, or whichever it was, they were horrendously cruel.</span> <span id="s816">There was cruelty be -- above and beyond the call of duty, you know, the type of cruelty, the spitting, the kicking, the -- they used to use rifle butts to hit you over the head if you didn’t line up exactly right.</span> <span id="s817">Anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Was there sexual cruelty against the women, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s820">Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s821">We were separated from the men, you know.</span> <span id="s822">The women lived in women’s barracks, the men in the men.</span> <span id="s823">But for the line up for the factory -- in fact, at one time, I also went to work in the factory and I don’t remember how long I worked there.</span> <span id="s824">I think before the two camps combined, while I was still in Shellneetsa, I think they were short or something like that.</span> <span id="s825">They put me up to working in the factory and I actually worked on one of the machinery, on the machines.</span> <span id="s826">The job was -- you know, I was already a 13 - 14 year old girl and it wasn’t a job that a 14 year couldn’t handle.</span> <span id="s827">Because what it meant is that the -- the artillery shells, you had to put it on the machine and put a type of knife to it, that was part of the machine and the knife scraped the first layer of the -- of the -- of the -- no, not cannon, the shell -- the shell, cannon shell.</span> <span id="s828">And then you took it off and you put it on the one end and then you reached for the other.</span> <span id="s829">Of course you were being watched all the time and you had to deliver a num -- a certain number of these shells had to be peeled.</span> <span id="s830">Peeled is the w -- it’s not the word, but if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s831">That outer shell had to be peeled and that was the job.</span> <span id="s832">And I worked for a time -- that was brutal work and I saw the men -- th-the Jewish men work at the open ovens, you know, where the -- the smelting was done and where -- that was in-incredible -- that was just incredible.</span> <span id="s833">And when they were shaping these cannons and they were taking them out from the hot oven with the -- like big pincers, you know, and putting them down.</span> <span id="s834">Anyhow, I worked there for a very short time, because when the camps were finally combined -- and I -- I can’t give the year, but was between October 1942 and end of July 1944.</span> <span id="s835">So I don’t remember exactly how long I lived on Shellneetsa and how many months I worked in the factory, but I do know that when we were transferred, the two camps were combined and we all lived on Mioufka.</span> <span id="s836">I went back to the laundry again.</span> <span id="s837">So here we were able, again, to see my father, but we never talk -- couldn’t -- you know, here and there, we could maybe say something as we were passing, but we knew he was there, he knew we were there and the men’s barracks were on the other side, but we still, there was a way of waving or seeing or -- not touching or whatever, but he knew we were there and -- and most families that ended up in the camp could one way or another communicate.</span> <span id="s838">The life was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s839">Very, very hard.</span> <span id="s840">We -- you know it’s so hard to come back to talk about the hunger, because hunger was as present as -- as -- as the blood runs in your -- in your -- in your veins, you know?</span> <span id="s841">From the day the war broke out, we knew nothing but hunger.</span> <span id="s842">But there was always a way of scraping together -- of -- of selling some things and getting money and getting some food, but when you finally ended up in the camps, unless you really had big money, there was no way that you could survive on what was given to you.</span> <span id="s843">We were very lucky, because we had -- my mother -- my parents had very dear Christian friends and before we were thrown out of the original apartment, Mother begged them to take s -- to take -- to -- to -- to save for us, some of the more personal things like little silver Passover drinking cups -- I’ll show you, I have one.</span> <span id="s844">The candlesticks, some crystal, some other things that were inscribed, my parents wedding gifts and silver that had inscriptions and such.</span> <span id="s845">So they took all of that, those -- sh -- they absolutely wouldn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s846">Th-they -- they said, “What do you mean, you don’t give it to us.”</span> <span id="s847">Mother says, “I’m not giving it to you, I -- I’m asking you to just keep it for us.”</span> <span id="s848">Well, it so happens that husband of -- this was my parent’s friends, there were a few sisters, married.</span> <span id="s849">One of the husbands worked in the munitions factory, Christian.</span> <span id="s850">And he was able -- they were -- started selling -- they started selling -- because w-we send word that we need money desperately -- they started selling some of the things they had, valuable things.</span> <span id="s851">He would bring us and he would buy stuff and bring it to the factory and he would send it through people who worked in the factory, so that -- in the Shellneetsa camp and even in the Mioufka camp, we still lived on stuff and money that they would -- they would send in the money or some bread or whatever.</span> <span id="s852">And we could not have probably survived without that.</span> <span id="s853">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Where -- where could you buy those things?</span> <span id="s855">In -- in -- in the camp, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yes, there was -- there was always barter, because people -- you see, in the factory, the Jews mixed with the Poles, you see?</span> <span id="s857">The Jews were slave labor, but the Poles were the workers that -- the Jews, obviously were not the only ones working there.</span> <span id="s858">The local Poles worked in the factory, so some of these Jews who -- who had a way of mixing with the people in the factory, had a way of bartering and sending, or -- you know.</span> <span id="s859">So this is how we were able to really not die of hunger in -- in that -- in Starachowice labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: I’m sorry, can I just ask you one question?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: What was the -- the daily -- tell us a little bit more about the daily routine.</span> <span id="s863">How -- what -- what did you do every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s865">Well, specifically, the people who went to work, went on an eight hours shift.</span> <span id="s866">They were taken there by the Ukrainians, they were brought back.</span> <span id="s867">There was soup being doled out for them.</span> <span id="s868">After that, you had to stay in your bunk, because there was no place to go and you were absolutely petrified to go outside, because if you showed yourself, the Ukrainian or the -- the -- the Nazi German could kill you or decide to -- he wanted you to -- to do some other job.</span> <span id="s869">The worst way was to hide.</span> <span id="s870">So the labor in the factory was very hard.</span> <span id="s871">When you don’t eat and you work so hard, all you can do when you come home is just drop and you just stay until they call you again.</span> <span id="s872">I personally worked in the laundry, where it -- everybody brought in the stuff that they wore, that was full of lice and everything, put it in the cauldron and we would push it with sticks and cook -- boil it.</span> <span id="s873">And then, after it dried, everybody would come and -- and be handed out.</span> <span id="s874">I mean, if you were size 12, you got size 95.</span> <span id="s875">If you were size 14, you got size six, whatever th -- you know, so what you had, you had and what you didn’t have, you didn’t have next time or you did -- anyhow, this is how things were.</span> <span id="s876">The camp itself was, as I said, with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s877">It had th-th-th tower guards.</span> <span id="s878">There was no mixing of -- of men and women.</span> <span id="s879">Father was a scribe again and he -- we saw him.</span> <span id="s880">We saw him because he worked in a little office, like a place.</span> <span id="s881">So sometimes if there was business to go in that barrack where the office was, we saw him.</span> <span id="s882">And people who went to work, as I told you, were absolutely ex -- exhausted beyond words when they would come back.</span> <span id="s883">There was no way of staying clean, you see.</span> <span id="s884">That was the bad part.</span> <span id="s885">In the Shellneetsa camp, there was a little brook running through, so people would go and wash themselves, even in the winter.</span> <span id="s886">Men would undress and wash their bodies in the win -- but in Mioufka, there was -- you have to scrounge to get a -- a basin of water and everybody would wash up at the same time, you know.</span> <span id="s887">It was -- lice -- lice were -- i-i-it w -- it was a plague of lice that was even maybe not as bad as in Auschwitz, but it was very bad.</span> <span id="s888">Those were the two major things, hunger and lice.</span> <span id="s889">Of course, sickness too, but you didn’t know, because once you got sick, you -- that was the end of you anyhow.</span> <span id="s890">No matter how -- and I’m not talking big sicknesses, typhus, but even an infection, if you -- if infection went an-any higher than an arm and got you into a body infection, forget it.</span> <span id="s891">So th-they said they didn’t have doctors.</span> <span id="s892">They had little infirmary, I remember, where was that?</span> <span id="s893">In Mioufka, I think.</span> <span id="s894">That was -- I think for show, because nobody who was really sick ever made it anywhere, except a gun to his head, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: How did -- how did your sisters or women deal with menstruation or other kind of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Well this, I really -- you see, I think some women stopped menstruating.</span> <span id="s897">I personally never started.</span> <span id="s898">Of course I was too young.</span> <span id="s899">I never started.</span> <span id="s900">I wasn’t developed, I was flat like a board and I never menstruated, not til the -- two years after the war.</span> <span id="s901">This -- I don’t know, they used to say -- I’m sort of getting ahead of myself, but you asked me the question.</span> <span id="s902">Wom -- I heard it said in Auschwitz that they put something in the -- in the food.</span> <span id="s903">They used to call it brum -- brum.</span> <span id="s904">I really don’t know if that’s what it wa -- whatever it was.</span> <span id="s905">That they -- women in Auschwitz didn’t menstruate as far as I know, because they said that that was brum that was in the food.</span> <span id="s906">This is -- could be he-hearsay and could be -- might not be in any way part of the truth.</span> <span id="s907">I’m just saying that this is what I remembered because everybody was saying that I had nothing to worry about, since I never started, I wouldn’t start it in Auschwitz for sure, because there was brum in the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Who was it -- who put that in, according to what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I don’t know who could -- whoever -- the -- the food was cooked -- in Auschwitz, this was community cooking, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s910">The same was here.</span> <span id="s911">This was community cooking, you see?</span> <span id="s912">And people here, in the camp, in Mioufka camp or Shellneetsa camp, still had that little piece of bread from here or there, from the town Polish people, who -- who bought stuff and brought in and wa -- that.</span> <span id="s913">But, no, those were the two major problems.</span> <span id="s914">Not -- not two major problems and only a million others when you feared for your life every second, but the daily hunger and the lice, that was like a -- something never left you, never for a second.</span> <span id="s915">And still living -- living in Starachowice camp with local women and some -- really newcomers, but it really was still a homogenous type of group, you see?</span> <span id="s916">It wasn’t like later on in Auschwitz when you were mixed with the world, nobody knew who you were then, couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s917">I personally owe my survival very much to people who -- who looked after me.</span> <span id="s918">Not just my sisters, you know, which they did.</span> <span id="s919">They are responsible for my survival, but other people because there was always the connection, they remember me as that skinny kid or whatever.</span> <span id="s920">They took pity on me.</span> <span id="s921">They always helped me, people always helped me.</span> <span id="s922">Always.</span> <span id="s923">I don’t know why, I must have been a sorry sight.</span> <span id="s924">I must have been, you know, an undernourished, skinny kid looks like a devil probably, like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s925">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s926">But this was still a homogenous group that made you feel that you are still attached to some kind of life that was your own.</span> <span id="s927">You know, at that t -- before this life, because in Auschwitz, you already doubted yourself, that you came from another life, because how could that be?</span> <span id="s928">You were a million years away from something that was normal.</span> <span id="s929">And here there wasn’t anybody who even knew that you -- who you were or whatever, you see?</span> <span id="s930">So life in Starachowice labor camps -- I said camps because you know, the two -- was still very much normal.</span> <span id="s931">And this lasted til 1944, where the camp was loaded onto trains into tr -- into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s932">That was end of July or early August.</span> <span id="s933">And we didn’t know why, because obviously we never knew why anything was happening, nobody told us and they certainly kept it from us on purpose.</span> <span id="s934">But a rumor was that the Russian front was nearing from the east and of course later on, we found out in Auschwitz that all these labor camps that were situated in this heart of Poland, that did war production for the Germans were liquidated about the time we were.</span> <span id="s935">And so we’re talking now about 1944, end of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Be-Before we move on to that --</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Just maybe one [indecipherable] question.</span> <span id="s939">How did you keep your strength in all of this?</span> <span id="s940">Yes -- yes, you were close with your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Wha-What was -- what did you think about to keep you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, well, would you believe it, we were singing.</span> <span id="s944">We sang songs, we remember a lot of poetry, Polish poetry, it’s true.</span> <span id="s945">To this day I remember Polish poetry.</span> <span id="s946">Not just Polish, I remember Shakespeare in Polish.</span> <span id="s947">“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” I remember.</span> <span id="s948">“Diz bed biedna sheetem shezak nie.”</span> <span id="s949">You know, I remember these hard pieces to this day, a million years later.</span> <span id="s950">Well, anyhow, no, we were -- we knew mother did not get resettled.</span> <span id="s951">That was finally brought back to us one way or another.</span> <span id="s952">That the train that left Starachowice during the ulseedlung, during the vished lenya, or whatever, clearing of the Jews, did not get resettled, it got sent straight into Treblinka.</span> <span id="s953">So mother perished and we knew it.</span> <span id="s954">I mean we -- that much we -- because everybody knew that nobody from that -- from our home people survived, that went on that train.</span> <span id="s955">My sisters and I were very, very, very close.</span> <span id="s956">We told the -- talked about old times, we recited poetry, we sung, we were hungry, we were terribly, terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s957">We saw father every now and then.</span> <span id="s958">He got very aged or very old looking.</span> <span id="s959">He wasn’t an old man.</span> <span id="s960">He broke -- his spirit was broken, you could see that.</span> <span id="s961">He was gray and he -- he was a cigarette smoker and now he coughed constantly, you know.</span> <span id="s962">He had this bad cough and -- but the fact that we were around and he saw all these other people, you know.</span> <span id="s963">We were, after all -- probably 80 percent of that camp was still people from our hometown.</span> <span id="s964">So that more or less kept his spirit up, in that sense that people were trying to think back to good things and -- and -- and -- and -- and rehash and rehash.</span> <span id="s965">I used to dream, there and in Auschwitz, about the way the table -- my mother set the table.</span> <span id="s966">I don’t know, I -- I must have had the hang up about -- hang up about cooking or whatever, serving.</span> <span id="s967">I remembered the beautiful way the table was set.</span> <span id="s968">So I used to dream about it, you know.</span> <span id="s969">She had that artistic touch of setting the table.</span> <span id="s970">And I s -- we talked about it and we -- we talked about it 50 times, all the time of the same kind of this con-conversation.</span> <span id="s971">And of course father was around, that was a great consolation and when we came to Auschwitz, that was the last time we saw our father.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: We take a break and just change the cassette now.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: This is a conintin -- continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s975">This is tape number two, side B. And we just talked about --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: We talked about the liquidation of the camp in Starachowice, when we were loaded up on the train and on the way to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s977">Now, there is a very important point here I wanted to bring up.</span> <span id="s978">You know, people say, well why didn’t anybody do this and they didn’t rebel and peoples went like sheep to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s979">When the two camps were combined, Shellneetsa and s -- and Mioufka and people were still employed by the factories, living was sort of made to -- to -- generally speaking, people should be able to sleep and -- and -- and have a place and because they had to work next day.</span> <span id="s980">Just before -- toward the end of July, just before we were sent to Auschwitz, we were moved out of the last camp, which was Mioufka, into something that was sort of like a camp, but it wasn’t, because it was people just shoved into some kind of barracks and there was m-many more guards with towers.</span> <span id="s981">And this particular enclosure was very near the siding -- the railroad siding, because you know, a factory that operates, has to have a railroad siding.</span> <span id="s982">Well, that was a siding that was right adjacent to that third place, which was a camp, but wasn’t a camp.</span> <span id="s983">It was like -- I can’t quite describe it to you.</span> <span id="s984">Well, what happened is, somehow the word got around that this is the end -- this is the end.</span> <span id="s985">Now when we’re getting shipped, we’re really going to go like the people originally went -- wherever it was they went -- we’re not being resettled, this is for sure.</span> <span id="s986">We’re just going to be killed.</span> <span id="s987">So the same night, some young fellows and strong young women, tried to break out.</span> <span id="s988">The ca -- that place -- I’ll call it camp again, but it was a place, a -- like a -- a pen -- type of a pen, you know -- had a wooden fence and behind it, wire -- on top of it wire.</span> <span id="s989">No, barbed wire.</span> <span id="s990">That night bef, -- the day -- th-the night before we were actually shipped to Auschwitz, some people decided to run away and they pulled out a few of the planks from the wooden fence and as soon as that happened, whoever felt this was the opportunity, started running that way.</span> <span id="s991">The German guards were shooting out of -- no, th-these were Ukrainians, probably.</span> <span id="s992">Ukrainian guards started shooting right into this -- th-the moving bodies, the reflectors, you know, they started sending them.</span> <span id="s993">Before you knew it there were dogs, there were -- all the Germans were out.</span> <span id="s994">Some people made it out, the rest didn’t and there was a heap of bodies right at that opening.</span> <span id="s995">Whether everybody there was already dead, or whether he was just d-dying, only a few people made it out.</span> <span id="s996">And one of them was my brother-in-law and he made it out, the Canadian brother-in-law, he made it out.</span> <span id="s997">But the others, I don’t know how many people made ou -- made it out of that -- thr -- because th-the hole was very narrow and by the time they got going, it was already too late.</span> <span id="s998">And there was a woman that was shot in the legs.</span> <span id="s999">She -- they let her die all night long, in the middle of the -- of that area and her agonies -- cries of agony went on all night long.</span> <span id="s1000">They did -- they -- obviously they weren’t going to shoot her to kill her, because they wanted that to teach other people a lesson.</span> <span id="s1001">And she was begging to be killed.</span> <span id="s1002">She was in -- in terrible agony.</span> <span id="s1003">She kept yelling that her legs were shot off, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1004">Because she was laying in the middle and we heard her.</span> <span id="s1005">Well, next morning, we were put on the trains, there wasn’t -- probably not even any marching to do because the train was right there.</span> <span id="s1006">We were put on the train.</span> <span id="s1007">Again, we had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s1008">Women in separate cars and the men in other cars.</span> <span id="s1009">And it so happens that the last car where the men were, had my father in it.</span> <span id="s1010">And the first car where the women were, had us in it.</span> <span id="s1011">So that when we arrived in Auschwitz -- and we had no idea where we were going and we were unloaded on the platform, we saw my father in the group with the men.</span> <span id="s1012">Because they were, this was the tail end of the men th -- contingent.</span> <span id="s1013">And we were first in the women’s contingent, so we still saw him, he saw us.</span> <span id="s1014">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s1015">We never, ever saw him again.</span> <span id="s1016">People from my hometown who did survive Auschwitz told us that after he arrived in Auschwitz, he totally gave up.</span> <span id="s1017">He was -- he was a man that was lost to the world.</span> <span id="s1018">He got very sick, his legs were swollen and of course he was killed and cremate -- I mean he was -- he went out like everybody else, through the chimney.</span> <span id="s1019">And we were told this was in October.</span> <span id="s1020">You see, we arrived in August in Auschwitz, early August.</span> <span id="s1021">So he lived maybe not quite two months.</span> <span id="s1022">He still lived, but of course we never saw him.</span> <span id="s1023">But we were told what happened, that he was -- h-he -- I think his spirit was gone and th -- everything just went after that and he -- he gave up.</span> <span id="s1024">I don’t really, truly know what was his work assignment so to say, because you know labor in -- in -- in Auschwitz was not labor, it was just work to make you -- to exhaust you, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Did he see you too, when you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yes, on the platform, yes.</span> <span id="s1027">He saw us, we knew he saw us, because you know, we sort of communicated.</span> <span id="s1028">And -- you couldn’t wave, obviously, but he saw us, because he was at the tail end of that group, that -- from which we were separated.</span> <span id="s1029">So he knew that the three of us were together and that was the last we saw him.</span> <span id="s1030">So, you see, my mother was -- my mother went to Treblinka in October ‘42 and my father just lived two more years and -- if you call that life -- so he perished in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: What -- what happened when you arrived there?</span> <span id="s1032">What -- what went forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Well, the first thing obviously was to be tattooed.</span> <span id="s1034">You know, they wouldn’t let you anywhere without being tattooed.</span> <span id="s1035">So we decided that we were going to line up one next to the other, because we knew by then that, you know, numbers are in sequence and if you have numbers in sequence, you have a chance to -- to -- to be within that number -- group number.</span> <span id="s1036">So my oldest sister Hanya, Anna had the first num -- whatever the number was.</span> <span id="s1037">Kris, Krisha, the second, had the second number and I had the third.</span> <span id="s1038">So we had a sequence of numbers.</span> <span id="s1039">And it proved to be lifesaving because at Auschwitz, as you know, there were no names any more, there were just numbers.</span> <span id="s1040">If they needed a contingent of people, they would call numbers, let say from 15 to 95.</span> <span id="s1041">You see?</span> <span id="s1042">So -- it so happens, whenever we were sent somewhere, we were called by that -- we were lucky enough -- of course sometimes you can be cut off at the num -- end of the number too, but it so happens that our numbers were always in that nu -- group number.</span> <span id="s1043">And after we were tattooed, we were told to disrobe and go into what was called showers.</span> <span id="s1044">Nobody knew what that was and there was one chimney going, you could see fire coming out.</span> <span id="s1045">One crematorium, because by then, you know, this -- this is 1944, August and the war isn’t going so well for the Germans, so I understand that they have destroyed some of the crematories.</span> <span id="s1046">One was still belching fire when we came.</span> <span id="s1047">The smell was incredible, incredible.</span> <span id="s1048">And of course, at night, you could see the fire against the sky.</span> <span id="s1049">And I don’t know, I must have rationalized that fire somehow.</span> <span id="s1050">You know why?</span> <span id="s1051">Because in my hometown, when they used to melt the ore -- smelt the ore, they used to -- my hometowns was sort of hilly.</span> <span id="s1052">They used to bring the lorries with the hot s -- the leftover from the -- from the ve -- the ore that was smelted out of it.</span> <span id="s1053">The leftover was called jujer, lighting it’s cauks or whatever it was called.</span> <span id="s1054">They used to pour it out from those lorries, over the -- over the embankment of the hills, so that you saw a -- like a long -- now what?</span> <span id="s1055">Like a belt, you know?</span> <span id="s1056">Pass, what is the word?</span> <span id="s1057">Just escaped me.</span> <span id="s1058">Anyhow, when you saw the -- the -- the -- this -- this -- this lava type of a fire pouring down and I knew this was just melting -- this was fire.</span> <span id="s1059">It looked like fire at night, you see, if you ever saw it.</span> <span id="s1060">When I was in Auschwitz, maybe I -- I always thought of it.</span> <span id="s1061">Maybe I rationalized.</span> <span id="s1062">When I saw that flame going out of the chimney -- they said to me, “You know they’re burning people in there.”</span> <span id="s1063">But I said to myself, “Maybe that’s -- what is there is that what I saw as a child when I saw that flame in the dark.</span> <span id="s1064">The stuff that poured out of the lorries, you know -- of the -- of the -- the byproduct of the smelting.”</span> <span id="s1065">But of course was a big -- as they say a pipe dream, because this was the true burning flesh, which you could smell.</span> <span id="s1066">You could almost touch it, that’s how pervasive it was.</span> <span id="s1067">And we -- I don’t know how much I knew, if anything, that the -- Auschwitz, the name or the -- the -- the whole -- what it was all about.</span> <span id="s1068">Except that now, having been shifted so many times, you know, from the ghetto to a camp, to another camp, to another holding place, you know, this was just another place, you know.</span> <span id="s1069">And when we came in, we were held on what was called quarantine.</span> <span id="s1070">The situation in Auschwitz was different too, you see, because by now, the -- some of the crematories were -- were gone, but they were still burning and they were still eliminating people as fast as they could, but I don’t know what the projection of time was with them, how they were going to do it all.</span> <span id="s1071">They put us on the -- what you -- what is called quarantine, which meant nothing.</span> <span id="s1072">It meant they give us wo-work to do that was meaningless.</span> <span id="s1073">There was a pile of rocks here on one end and there was a pile of rocks on the other end of the camp.</span> <span id="s1074">You had to -- very heavy -- you carried the rocks from this end to the e-end, to the other.</span> <span id="s1075">And then you went over to the other side and carried them back.</span> <span id="s1076">In fact, in one of those rock carrying ex-expeditions, we saw my aunt, Uncle Alexander’s wife with the Radom group.</span> <span id="s1077">They were -- the Radom ghetto was eli -- of course, as I told you before, all -- with the Russian offensive coming from the east, all these camps w -- and ghettos and whatever, were being shipped westward.</span> <span id="s1078">We didn’t know that Uncle Alexander survived.</span> <span id="s1079">We just knew that his two sons ran away to Russia at the beginning of the war, but we didn’t know about Uncle or -- or his wife.</span> <span id="s1080">Sure enough, there we saw her, in Auschwitz, going the other way with the rocks, and we were going this way.</span> <span id="s1081">We lived in a barracks, nine people to a bunk, nine women.</span> <span id="s1082">We slept head to -- head to foot, because nine women is totally impossible to fit into this kind of an area.</span> <span id="s1083">It was just wooden bunks.</span> <span id="s1084">As you know, Auschwitz stories -- we had to -- we were counted.</span> <span id="s1085">We had to line up for role call every morning.</span> <span id="s1086">During the quarantine, we had to do it more than twice a day.</span> <span id="s1087">Later on, when we worked outside, we had to once.</span> <span id="s1088">In the morning once, in the evening, but during quarantine, whenever you went indoors, they called you out again and you had to line up.</span> <span id="s1089">And if they didn’t like the way you stood, or whatever, they could just shoot you, which they did.</span> <span id="s1090">And we were still very much with the original group.</span> <span id="s1091">Now, when we first arrived and we were -- you know, everybody’s hair was cut -- I don’t mean cut, you know, they grabbed alil hair and chopped it off.</span> <span id="s1092">My oldest sister Hanya spoke back to the women who was cutting her hair, who was a Czechoslovak woman.</span> <span id="s1093">For that, the Czechoslovak woman called her, “You Polish pig,” and she shaved her head to zero.</span> <span id="s1094">Totally zero.</span> <span id="s1095">And they gave us clothes that of course didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s1096">I don’t have to tell you because they were throwing it at you as you were passing out of the -- where the -- where your head was -- where your head was cut.</span> <span id="s1097">And you just took it, whatever, big, small or in between.</span> <span id="s1098">Whether it fit or not, you had to change with other people to fit you.</span> <span id="s1099">And wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1100">And the barracks, that was another thing.</span> <span id="s1101">I mean, lice -- when we talked about lice in Starachowice, that’s one thing, when you talk about lice in Auschwitz, that was already beyond description.</span> <span id="s1102">There was a l-latrine behind the building.</span> <span id="s1103">You had to wait your turn.</span> <span id="s1104">Of course you had to sit with at least 20 other people.</span> <span id="s1105">They had sort of boards with holes in them -- awful.</span> <span id="s1106">We’re not talking here in any way privacy or anything, believe me.</span> <span id="s1107">At the lowest level of human existence, you probably do not encounter this type -- this type of existence.</span> <span id="s1108">This is below -- below what human mind considers as -- as human.</span> <span id="s1109">This was exhausting work and it was no work.</span> <span id="s1110">It w -- we were -- we knew we -- we knew that we were expendable, because we weren’t -- you know, in the factories you knew, “Oh, they need us.”</span> <span id="s1111">You know, “Maybe we’ll survive the war because they need us.”</span> <span id="s1112">Here they couldn’t have needed us, because what we were doing is we were taking the rocks from here to there and my aunt was bringing the same rocks when we saw her pass by with the other group, bringing the same rocks back there.</span> <span id="s1113">So they didn’t really need us.</span> <span id="s1114">You see, that much you could figure out.</span> <span id="s1115">The barracks were run by Czechoslovak women.</span> <span id="s1116">Very, very cruel -- extreme.</span> <span id="s1117">One day -- this -- this subject should really be analyzed.</span> <span id="s1118">What makes collaborators more cruel than the perpetrators?</span> <span id="s1119">This is a very important philosophical question.</span> <span id="s1120">Because my encounter with the Ukrainians and with the Czech women and with all the other collaborators or functionaries of the Nazis, actually exceeded, sometimes, the brutality and the total disregard for the person.</span> <span id="s1121">And I have an anecdote from that period, which is -- which compares to the fact when my father was first time caught to go and c -- to clean the -- the railroad station, the -- the insult that it was.</span> <span id="s1122">You know, that -- at that time, that the insult that he was called a Jew and not a gentleman and that he had to s -- clean.</span> <span id="s1123">When we were in the barracks in Auschwitz and this woman, this Czech woman -- big, hefty, strong, sort of like an animal type.</span> <span id="s1124">Aronka was her name.</span> <span id="s1125">I was going to the latrine, or coming from the latrine and she stood there, she saw me and she calls me over, she always calls me Polish pigs.</span> <span id="s1126">She always says, “Polska schvina.”</span> <span id="s1127">She -- she -- she called all the women like that.</span> <span id="s1128">And she put up her foot, she had boots, leather boots and told me to clean her -- to polish her boots and I didn’t have anything and she says to spit on it and polish it.</span> <span id="s1129">I took it as such humiliation.</span> <span id="s1130">I mean, it’s like my father’s humiliation at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1131">In the scheme of things, in this -- in thi -- in this whole picture of what was happening, why was I so upset about this?</span> <span id="s1132">I guess because it was person to person, you know?</span> <span id="s1133">And she wasn’t a German.</span> <span id="s1134">She was not supposed to be a Nazi, she was only the block altester.</span> <span id="s1135">The supervisor of the barrack.</span> <span id="s1136">So, why I should have thought that she would be more human or what -- expect -- whatever it was, it was a terrible personal insult to me and believe me, I was already beaten up in Auschwitz by an SS man by that time.</span> <span id="s1137">He hit me with a ring, had a heavy ring on the mouth and I was bleeding and I -- I was suffering from hunger and from every -- and here, out of everything, I should get upset about that.</span> <span id="s1138">I cried over that.</span> <span id="s1139">I didn’t cry over the others things.</span> <span id="s1140">And then of course she kicked me and she -- she didn’t even -- you know, when I was down she kicked me and she told me to go in or whatever.</span> <span id="s1141">So, th-the first months, that’s -- that was the first very, very disorienting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: What was the relationship between th-the prisoners?</span> <span id="s1143">Was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Very good, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Was that di-different from the camps, or was it equally [indecipherable] supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1147">It was very supportive.</span> <span id="s1148">I’ll tell you that -- as I told you, we are s -- we were traveling still with the same group.</span> <span id="s1149">We are still with the people from my hometown or even if they weren’t from my hometown, they were sent in, but they were -- they were already in that group that came from Starachowice.</span> <span id="s1150">And the relationship was family like.</span> <span id="s1151">Each one was looking out for another.</span> <span id="s1152">And then I remember, that barrack of ours received a shipment of people from Salaneeka.</span> <span id="s1153">Jew -- of course we couldn’t -- Jewish women from Greece.</span> <span id="s1154">We couldn’t speak to them.</span> <span id="s1155">I don’t know that -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1156">But we felt a kinship, I remembered -- I remember that.</span> <span id="s1157">I remember that we felt a kinship because we were a group, we were still a group, you see?</span> <span id="s1158">Even if -- if -- if you didn’t sleep with the -- the nine people, or not all the people, you know, you still were a group.</span> <span id="s1159">And I -- you know and I analyze it, I always said because they knew you when, you know.</span> <span id="s1160">These people were still a connection to your old past and you knew them as these other people, you know?</span> <span id="s1161">Because the rest didn’t seem human in any way.</span> <span id="s1162">And after this one month of quarantine, we finally were called on the job, what is called gainful employment, which was -- this could have been the end of us, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s1163">It was to cut twigs in the marshes.</span> <span id="s1164">This is now August, Sept -- something like early October.</span> <span id="s1165">We had to march out so we would be counted.</span> <span id="s1166">Now it’s strictly roll call twice a day.</span> <span id="s1167">They count us out, we had to stand -- whoever didn’t look right got shot or got send out, because you couldn’t go to work any more.</span> <span id="s1168">We would march through those gates, you know, are bike markt fry and out to the marshes, we would cut marshes.</span> <span id="s1169">We would stand in water, cut the marshes, they would bring in cauldrons of -- of soup that’s -- you know, the Auschwitz soup.</span> <span id="s1170">We were fed that and then we would come back at night, count, go to -- to -- to sleep and get up in the morning and start again.</span> <span id="s1171">And we worked there I think for a month.</span> <span id="s1172">And this is also in my mind, you know -- sa -- th -- always there is -- always say a snippet of a remembrance that -- that comes out of every horrible experience that sticks in your mind.</span> <span id="s1173">Just like Aronka with the shoes -- why I should cry over having to -- to -- to be humiliated like this, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1174">But then there was another aspect of this kind or remembrance -- this kind of remembrance, the -- you know, from the general to the particular, we were marching to the march -- to the marshes.</span> <span id="s1175">And there were these private dwellings, private homes around it -- alon-along the route.</span> <span id="s1176">And I think the German guards lived there or whoever.</span> <span id="s1177">Because it was so near Ausch -- near the camp that you couldn’t possibly have strangers.</span> <span id="s1178">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1179">Whoever lived there had to know everything that was going on.</span> <span id="s1180">So I don’t know who lived there.</span> <span id="s1181">But anyhow, those were normal houses, they had geranium boxes in the window.</span> <span id="s1182">They had pillows airing in the windows.</span> <span id="s1183">And it broke my heart to see that people were actually living a life from which we were -- we came, too, but it was nothing in any way to compare to -- how to judge our own existence.</span> <span id="s1184">You see, there was this life, these people got up in the morning, it was a beautiful day, cold or hot, was beautiful, dry.</span> <span id="s1185">You put the windows u -- put the windows open, you put the pillows in the window.</span> <span id="s1186">That’s what people did in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1187">And people had geranium boxes in the window.</span> <span id="s1188">And of course our own assessment of who we were, wer -- was -- was already far away from what we really thought we were.</span> <span id="s1189">Because we were in -- so dehumanized in the process of all these particular humiliations and the group humiliations and the murder and the -- and -- and watching.</span> <span id="s1190">Of course I -- I could go on and on forever to talk about all the -- the -- the -- the unnecessary brutality, you know?</span> <span id="s1191">Okay, sometimes you explain to yourself that you see a man si -- seeing a pair of boots and -- and running out of the line-up and grabbing the pair of boots, well -- the g -- Nazi guard ha -- says to himself, “Well, I have to do it, because this is a criminal, right?”</span> <span id="s1192">But aside from that, when you saw the brutality and the cruelty of people to other people for no reason, it dehumanized you to the point that you yours -- your own assessment of yourself was -- is that other person that you were, is that pers -- is that you or is this, that you don’t react the way you really should react to seeing those horrible things?</span> <span id="s1193">Of course when you are in it yourself, you are forever preoccupied with survival because that is a very strong instinct, you know.</span> <span id="s1194">The instinct of survival is so strong, no matter how old you are -- I don’t know how it is when you’re really older, but when you’re a young child and you haven’t lived yet and you -- and -- and then of course in the back of my mind, I always said to myself, “Gee whiz, I know my mother used to say not to say I was smart, I was good in school, but I think maybe I am, you know, maybe I really, you know, I could -- I could beat this.”</span> <span id="s1195">But then of course I realized that I was undernourished and all this and I didn’t have the physical prospects of survival because I really -- I don’t know how long it would have taken for me to -- to -- to just fall by the wayside there, because the jobs were -- the job was extremely, extremely hard.</span> <span id="s1196">And again, to talk in a historical perspective, I s-subsequently found out that there were some women who ran away from Auschwitz and that the Germans decided -- because you know, the marshes that were around the camp -- the Auschwitz - Birkenau camp, were sort of protective.</span> <span id="s1197">They didn’t show what was going on.</span> <span id="s1198">But by the same token, they could hide people.</span> <span id="s1199">So some people made it out.</span> <span id="s1200">Some people were, as a matter of fact, did run away and they were caught.</span> <span id="s1201">You know, there were executions in Auschwitz that even I remember.</span> <span id="s1202">But the point was that when we were sent to cut the -- the brush from the marshes, that was -- the reason was that the women who ran away hi-hid in there.</span> <span id="s1203">So they wanted now cleared.</span> <span id="s1204">So we had this specific idea in mind, that they really need us -- not -- not that we knew why they want to cut it, but if they wanted to cut it, that was a job and it was going to take a long time, because there was plenty of it.</span> <span id="s1205">So, by virtue of being needed, we had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1206">Now the question in my case was, wa -- did I have a chance to survive, physically?</span> <span id="s1207">Even if I outwitted myself and worked hard and ev -- would I be able to survive?</span> <span id="s1208">Well, Auschwitz -- life in -- up to that point -- it was no prospect of any kind of getting out of there.</span> <span id="s1209">We knew by then that they were burning people, because we inquired about the flesh -- the smell of the burning flesh and by then we knew.</span> <span id="s1210">There were other transports coming in.</span> <span id="s1211">The Gypsies -- lots of Gypsies were sent in.</span> <span id="s1212">The Hungarian transports.</span> <span id="s1213">This is all -- you know this is -- we’re talking now August, September.</span> <span id="s1214">And we just -- anyhow, we -- we meaning my sisters and I. I personally was thinking about all this time, but I was letting myself go with the -- with the -- with the -- the flow, you know, however I was -- I was trying to accommodate myself and of course my sisters were always protecting me.</span> <span id="s1215">Because you know, when there was a roll call and I was exhausted, I was always propped up, you know, they propped me up.</span> <span id="s1216">I was the worst case of the three of us, really, because my oldest sister Hanya, at least she was tall and she was already developed, it was a g -- nice girl, you know, but she -- Kris was good too, but I didn’t fit any picture of any kind of -- although there were kids who came from our camp in Poland, they were younger than I am.</span> <span id="s1217">There were six and five and six and seven year old children who were in Auschwitz, who came from Starachowice camp.</span> <span id="s1218">They were smuggled into the camps, in Starachowice by the parents and they were shipped with us and they lived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1219">Some of them -- a few of them survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1220">But no I -- I -- I couldn’t in any way figure out how that was going to end.</span> <span id="s1221">And of course there was -- it was a stroke of luck, we found out that they were looking for -- we didn’t find out, we were called, the numbers were called.</span> <span id="s1222">There were 30 women -- 30 women were called by num -- you know, to -- to go to another place, you know?</span> <span id="s1223">The most intelligent way of putting it -- an-another place.</span> <span id="s1224">You know, cause there was one place and there was the other, it was just one more place.</span> <span id="s1225">Well, the other place happened to be a area called Brejinka, it was called Afectencomer.</span> <span id="s1226">And there were Polish women who worked there -- only Christian Polish women.</span> <span id="s1227">And apparently they were either involved with the Polish underground, or suspected of involvement with the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1228">Whichever way, they were shipped out.</span> <span id="s1229">And they needed other people, too.</span> <span id="s1230">So the number that came out to supplement them, to -- not to supplement, to replace them, was 30 and we were in the 30 and the three of us were in it cause we had the number.</span> <span id="s1231">And this was a godsend because we now had to work indoors.</span> <span id="s1232">You see, we were packing that -- th-that stuff that was hanging there from the political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1233">We had to work indoors and do a lot of packing which was -- which was child’s play by comparison to the marshes.</span> <span id="s1234">October, November, cold water, you know.</span> <span id="s1235">And at first we used to go back to the camp to sleep, but then that was discontinued.</span> <span id="s1236">For whatever reason nobody told us.</span> <span id="s1237">So they had barracks there and we slept.</span> <span id="s1238">That was another godsend, it wasn’t nine more people.</span> <span id="s1239">It wasn’t nine any more.</span> <span id="s1240">There were facilities to wash because we were handling things so I guess -- we didn’t have so mu -- many -- I mean the lice somehow -- however we controlled it.</span> <span id="s1241">We could bathe now.</span> <span id="s1242">Of course we -- they gave us clothes, because there was so much clothes in -- in the -- you know, what was left behind.</span> <span id="s1243">So we helped ourselves to clothes, to be -- to -- to, you know, to dress to -- to size.</span> <span id="s1244">Dress to size.</span> <span id="s1245">We had -- they gave us shoes also, by measure, we could pick a pair of shoes to measure and we did not mix any more with the larger camp, because they didn’t want us mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: What was the actual work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: [indecipherable] to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: The actual work was as follows.</span> <span id="s1250">You know that Auschwitz was an extermination camp and a slave labor camp, at one time, combined.</span> <span id="s1251">The extermination camp was basically for Jews.</span> <span id="s1252">The slave labor camp was also for political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1253">Now, there were a lot of Polish political prisoners who are in the underground or whoever.</span> <span id="s1254">The Christians that were suspected of anything were called political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1255">Some of them were political but not everybody was political, but they weren’t Jews, you see?</span> <span id="s1256">So they had to be called something, they were called political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1257">When they were sent into the ca -- into Auschwitz, I understand their clothes was put in a bag.</span> <span id="s1258">Like when we came in, we just dumped our clothes on the -- on the heap and we were given whatever.</span> <span id="s1259">We never saw our clothes again.</span> <span id="s1260">These people had -- you know the German ob-obsession with -- with -- with keeping records?</span> <span id="s1261">Well, they -- their clothes was put into bags, sort of like sacks.</span> <span id="s1262">Each one had a number and it hung, it was -- you know, like in a butcher shop, with the hooks?</span> <span id="s1263">And it hu -- these sacks hang on sh -- on -- on hooks.</span> <span id="s1264">Every time a prisoner like this died, the bag of -- with the number had to be crossed out and the bag was repacked into a package and sent to the haw -- to -- sent home.</span> <span id="s1265">Or, if he was resettled, the bag went after him.</span> <span id="s1266">Of all the stuff and h -- genocide on an -- on a scale -- unprecedented scale, here you talk about shipping the little sack of leftover clothes.</span> <span id="s1267">I mean this is -- this is a macabre picture to draw, but that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1268">So this is what we did.</span> <span id="s1269">We had to repack.</span> <span id="s1270">I learned to pack there, very well.</span> <span id="s1271">We had to repack these things.</span> <span id="s1272">We had to re-hang them again by numbers, you know.</span> <span id="s1273">And heaven help you if there was ever anything missing.</span> <span id="s1274">I mean, for that you could pay with your head.</span> <span id="s1275">If you decided, while you were packing, that you were going to take a glove, or something that you thought you want to take for yourself -- well we were smarter by then, than that.</span> <span id="s1276">Besides, the Polish women that were still left there, not all of them were shipped because obviously you cannot staff a -- a -- a -- a workplace with brand new people.</span> <span id="s1277">You have to keep some of the old ones.</span> <span id="s1278">They told us they were -- they were very intelligent women there, very.</span> <span id="s1279">I -- some of them were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1280">So they told us the do’s and the don’ts and we surely minded everything they ever said.</span> <span id="s1281">Life there really brought us around.</span> <span id="s1282">Living there brought us around physically.</span> <span id="s1283">I don’t know if we slept two to a bunk or three, but it wasn’t nine and we didn’t wear the same raggedy, t-torn rags that weren’t even fitting.</span> <span id="s1284">Here, if you -- it’s sometimes found that you -- your -- your -- you tore your dress, you went over to the supervisor and she would say, you come with me, I -- you pick a dress.</span> <span id="s1285">You see?</span> <span id="s1286">So that that was also very important for later on, the fact that we were dressed properly and we had proper shoes when we went on the march later on, the -- the -- the death march.</span> <span id="s1287">But that -- I’m anticipating.</span> <span id="s1288">It -- what I was trying to say is this -- we worked in that place, which was part of the Auschwitz complex, maybe for two months or something like this.</span> <span id="s1289">Because you see, the general evacuation from Auschwitz was Jan -- about mid January, 1945.</span> <span id="s1290">January 15th or so.</span> <span id="s1291">And I would say that we worked there through Feb -- through December, surely.</span> <span id="s1292">Some of November, maybe.</span> <span id="s1293">Some of November, all of December and up to that point.</span> <span id="s1294">At which -- which gave us a very good -- our bodies a very good chance to recover from the cold and the -- we were counted here, too and everything, but it wasn’t any more like it was.</span> <span id="s1295">And by the way, we were now separated from our hometown group.</span> <span id="s1296">This was a totally different -- they -- these were people -- different people and there the -- the Christian Polish women.</span> <span id="s1297">Of course, we had a very good relationship because -- maybe it’s not nice to say, th -- in the way of bragging.</span> <span id="s1298">Our Polish was really very pure and very, very lovely.</span> <span id="s1299">So, people could sort of -- could peg you.</span> <span id="s1300">They could figure out who you were by the way your Polish sounded, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: What was the -- what -- what -- how did you talk to people before you went there?</span> <span id="s1302">I mean here, obviously you spoke Polish with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1304">No, in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Always?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Polish and we knew some German, absolute.</span> <span id="s1307">M -- Krisha studied German in high school.</span> <span id="s1308">Hanya studied -- you know, in Poland you had to study Latin.</span> <span id="s1309">They both studied Latin, but Hanya was -- Hanya’s language was French.</span> <span id="s1310">She was wonderful, that’s what she tutored in.</span> <span id="s1311">And we knew German because my father -- and during the war you heard it.</span> <span id="s1312">So, we knew German, but basically it was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s1315">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1316">So now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: So now we’re up to the general evacuation of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1318">The time is mid-January, 1945.</span> <span id="s1319">Historically, to put it in perspective, the Russian army is -- offensive is moving ever closer.</span> <span id="s1320">In fact, the part of Poland where Starachowice was -- Starachowice camp was located, was already liberated in January 1945, when we first started.</span> <span id="s1321">But they were already liberated the year -- you know, at the end of last year, so after Starachowice, when we were still going through living hell and worse, that part was liberated.</span> <span id="s1322">Meaning, you know, the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s1323">So we found ourselves in that march -- that was the so-called death march.</span> <span id="s1324">I don’t know that I need to -- to dwell on it, because it has been very well documented all around and that was a horrendous experience.</span> <span id="s1325">The camp was being evacuated en masse and people were being driven to a railroad station and people were just -- it was winter, it was snowy, snowy winter.</span> <span id="s1326">And people were just falling by the wayside because we had to walk da-day and night and people were shot and killed right along and groups were now totally -- you know, things were just getting mixed up because men and women, you know -- th -- th -- it was -- it -- people from different parts of the camp -- anyhow, the -- the most outstanding recollection for me of that period, is not what I remember, but what my sisters remember, is that I fell asleep on that march and I could not distinguish reality fr -- I was hallucinating and they were dragging me.</span> <span id="s1327">And really, if I ever was going to perish, that was the time.</span> <span id="s1328">They dragged me, they physically dragged me.</span> <span id="s1329">I was totally, completely swallowed up by the dream.</span> <span id="s1330">I just didn’t know -- I just thought I was in some house and then we were told to stop on the road and everybody was relieving himself and my sisters told me to squat down an-and I wouldn’t do it, cause I thought I was dreaming and I wasn’t going to do that.</span> <span id="s1331">Well, anyhow, that was another -- it was a horrendous experience, except I slept through it.</span> <span id="s1332">And what I know about that is what my sisters told me and the fact that I was finally awakened with a big h-hit on the head when -- when we were to move on after a night’s sleep in a barn, that I real-realized who I was and where I was.</span> <span id="s1333">And we ended up on open cars -- on open railroad cars.</span> <span id="s1334">Not covered, open cars.</span> <span id="s1335">Snow -- snow was falling and we were going somewhere.</span> <span id="s1336">Now we were sitting on the floor of these cars, all kinds of people, wi -- speaking all kinds of languages.</span> <span id="s1337">Women, again, we were not mixed with men.</span> <span id="s1338">You could hear Greek and Y-Yiddish and Polish and Russian and French and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1339">You name it, it was all one big -- we were really by ourselves on that march, the three of us.</span> <span id="s1340">I don’t know how -- this is -- we’ll all -- another subject.</span> <span id="s1341">How it was, that knock wood, that we were -- like that -- we were s -- always together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: How long did that last march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Th-Th -- I -- I think we marched maybe four or five days.</span> <span id="s1344">The march.</span> <span id="s1345">Then we came to those trains and I still don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s1346">Th -- There were -- there were -- these trains were waiting, it wasn’t a station, it was some kind of a siding or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1347">This is all -- I was going to do research into it, but w-what will it give me if I fi -- do -- do know this?</span> <span id="s1348">I don’t need to know it and -- anyhow, we came from there eventually.</span> <span id="s1349">We came at night to a place, the sign was lit uf -- lit up -- Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1350">Just like in Auschwitz, we didn’t know what it was, what -- it was another place, you know?</span> <span id="s1351">So they unloaded us and we had to stay where we were on the snow, because there was no place -- th -- just -- you know, they just said, “You just stay here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Do you have any memory of that trip, because Ravensbrück is in northwestern Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: That is a long time away from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: I tell you what it was, it was -- we had with us a little sack of sugar, which was a luxury above luxuries, when we were leaving, the afectencomer last place.</span> <span id="s1358">The snow was very -- falling very heavily.</span> <span id="s1359">We were covered with snow.</span> <span id="s1360">We ate a drop of sugar and we ate a drop of snow.</span> <span id="s1361">You see?</span> <span id="s1362">Mixed with -- everybody was eating snow.</span> <span id="s1363">They scraped their coats or whatever they were wearing and how long -- you see, that’s another thing, I don’t remember how long the march was.</span> <span id="s1364">I don’t remember how long we traveled to -- to -- to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1365">All I know is that when we came to Ravensbrück, it was worse than anything else before.</span> <span id="s1366">Now, if that is at all possible to say that, then -- that -- to say that you came out of Auschwitz to something even worse, that’s probably like a total exaggeration, which it isn’t.</span> <span id="s1367">The reason being that Ravensbrück was now a gathering point for all the camps that were being evacuated.</span> <span id="s1368">Now, in Auschwitz, they counted you, they gave you a number, you were nine to a -- a boar -- to a -- the bunk.</span> <span id="s1369">If one was missing, the rest got th-th-th -- shot or killed, for whatever.</span> <span id="s1370">You had to be accounted for and you had to do or not do exactly what you were told.</span> <span id="s1371">And you got that -- that -- that slop of the soup that was nothing, but you got it.</span> <span id="s1372">In Ravensbrück was nothing.</span> <span id="s1373">It was overflowing with people.</span> <span id="s1374">There was no room even for nine on a bunk.</span> <span id="s1375">They built tents.</span> <span id="s1376">They kept us there because there was no room.</span> <span id="s1377">They finally threw us into a tent.</span> <span id="s1378">They told us to get up off the snow and everybod -- the snow was all stained with urine, because we sat there, you know and everything and feces -- into that tent.</span> <span id="s1379">There was no room in the tents, there was like herring people next to each other.</span> <span id="s1380">You know, like laid out like sardines.</span> <span id="s1381">It was -- it was an incredible s-situation because you didn’t have food.</span> <span id="s1382">You didn’t know if you were going to get even that meager nothing, that -- that slop, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1383">A piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1384">You didn’t -- you couldn’t sleep, you couldn’t undress.</span> <span id="s1385">You -- you -- that was the end of the road.</span> <span id="s1386">It was just bodies shoved into a tent, period.</span> <span id="s1387">There was no organization.</span> <span id="s1388">There was no counting, there was -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1389">Whereas they were obsessing about having the last -- the -- the number exactly to the last digit, here they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s1390">So finally the word got around that the trucks would be coming, that there would be shipments going out.</span> <span id="s1391">That they were going to liquid -- not liquidate, they were going to reduce the number of people in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1392">So my sisters decided that anything is better than this and frankly, you know, I -- I didn’t participate much in the decisions, because really I didn’t consider myself very much aware of -- of -- of -- of -- that -- to plan it, to think it through.</span> <span id="s1393">I -- I had a certain instinct of -- of self-preservation, but I didn’t really know -- I didn’t have the life experience to -- to -- to -- to -- to do any planning type of -- you see?</span> <span id="s1394">Of -- o -- any planning of any kind.</span> <span id="s1395">Anyhow, they said, “Wherever we go is better than here.”</span> <span id="s1396">They said they were -- they need people for some other place.</span> <span id="s1397">And this could -- other place could have been another chimney, you know.</span> <span id="s1398">That was to be taken into consideration.</span> <span id="s1399">But my sisters said, “Any place is better than this place, because this place is -- is -- what’s going to be here?”</span> <span id="s1400">So we got on those trucks, the first trucks that came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: What -- how long were you staying there, roughly?</span> <span id="s1402">Because it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Maybe three weeks at the most.</span> <span id="s1404">Two weeks, maybe.</span> <span id="s1405">Two or three at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: But all this time in tents, in the cold, nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: In the tent -- in the tent -- and no, there was food here and there.</span> <span id="s1408">You know, they would come around and they would dole out some soup, but it wasn’t like in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1409">You went to the marshes, you came back, they bri -- brought you the food there or they -- they -- you -- they give you the one piece of bread in the morning for the day.</span> <span id="s1410">You knew you -- it was coming.</span> <span id="s1411">You didn’t know what was coming here, what wasn’t coming.</span> <span id="s1412">You couldn’t figure it out.</span> <span id="s1413">And -- and then when you did come with the food, who was going to get there before you, t-to -- over your head, you see?</span> <span id="s1414">Because this wasn’t anything in any way organized to -- for any number of people.</span> <span id="s1415">Certainly not for this number.</span> <span id="s1416">This -- this was thousands upon thousands more than the camp could ever absorb.</span> <span id="s1417">So when we finally got on those trucks -- and surely we didn’t know where we were going and surely we could have been going to another -- t-to be burned like they were burning the flesh in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1418">So, by now we were smarter, we were already -- we knew a lot of things now, you see, because we knew about what Auschwitz was doing before we got there and all that.</span> <span id="s1419">So we came and the place we came to was Radsoff.</span> <span id="s1420">A small camp, I think it’s in Mecklenburg, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Near Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Yes, right, exactly.</span> <span id="s1423">And we came there and this was an empty camp.</span> <span id="s1424">Small size, nothing like Auschwitz, nothing like Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1425">It was just a small -- sort of the size of a Starachowice labor camp type.</span> <span id="s1426">Apparently that camp was near an Air Force base.</span> <span id="s1427">There were aircraft around, you know, in the -- not far and there was a base and the camp had barracks and it had SS women running it.</span> <span id="s1428">In uniform.</span> <span id="s1429">And talk about women being bestial.</span> <span id="s1430">Well, as you na -- can see, the world was opening to me all the time.</span> <span id="s1431">All the assumptions I once had about how women were a little kinder than men, forget that.</span> <span id="s1432">How they collaborate as they enslaved could not be as -- as horrible -- as brutal as the originators of the -- of the -- the planners and the originate -- forget about that.</span> <span id="s1433">You see?</span> <span id="s1434">So, coming back to Radsoff -- when we arrived, I think there were only two or three trucks of us.</span> <span id="s1435">And what they wanted -- they staffed, they used us f -- to staff -- as -- as staff for this camp.</span> <span id="s1436">I ended up being a maid to one of the SS women.</span> <span id="s1437">My sister Hanya got a job cleaning her office.</span> <span id="s1438">I was personal maid.</span> <span id="s1439">Sister Hanya got a job in the office, cleaning the office and I forget what job my sister Krisha had.</span> <span id="s1440">But she reminded me and I totally forgot about that.</span> <span id="s1441">She had a bad job and one day this SS woman, she took a liking to me, even though she wouldn’t come within 10 feet of me, you know.</span> <span id="s1442">Dirty Jew, I -- you -- you know, and -- so, she asks me if everything is all right and I said fine.</span> <span id="s1443">I’m -- I me -- I was scared of -- to death of her.</span> <span id="s1444">I used to bring wood in and to her fire, you know, to heat the -- wash her laundry and iron and you know, all personal things.</span> <span id="s1445">So, she asked me if everything was all right and if I have enough to eat, I said, “Yes, all right.”</span> <span id="s1446">So she says, she left me bread -- crust -- she used to cut away the crust from the bread, but she would never give it to me, because she wouldn’t touch me, but she left it on the table.</span> <span id="s1447">So she says, “From now on, whenever you come, there’ll be crust here, so that’s yours.”</span> <span id="s1448">“Fine.”</span> <span id="s1449">And then said, “And -- and -- wh-what else?</span> <span id="s1450">Do you have anybody here?”</span> <span id="s1451">I say, “Yes, I have sisters, one who works in the office, the other one has a bad job,” I said.</span> <span id="s1452">So she said, “All right, I get her a good job.”</span> <span id="s1453">And Krisha got a job in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1454">I didn’t even remember that, but she reminded me about that.</span> <span id="s1455">And so the first transport that came out of Ravensbrück, into Radsoff and we are now talking about end of -- end of February or something like that, 1945, something like that.</span> <span id="s1456">We came into Radsoff and we were first distributed as the maids and the kitchen help and all this.</span> <span id="s1457">And then the pe -- other people were sent in -- prisoners.</span> <span id="s1458">And they had to dig ad -- anti-aircraft, because -- no -- trenches and -- and work at the air base.</span> <span id="s1459">And the fact is that we didn’t really know what was going on, but we sort of had a feeling that things are not -- as far as the war is going on, that things are not the same, things are quite different now.</span> <span id="s1460">And life there, for us personally, was not as harsh as anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1461">First of all, because we were in direct contact with the SS women -- in other words, they had to -- to -- to have us in their house to clean, we had to be clean -- not to mix with the general population.</span> <span id="s1462">So underneath the barracks was like -- like a cellar-like thing -- or under the offices, I don’t know, it -- they let us sleep in that basement type of thing.</span> <span id="s1463">Also on bunks, but we were not mingling with the population, you see?</span> <span id="s1464">But we -- it so happens we had some friends there from other places.</span> <span id="s1465">So -- so we had, again, indoor jobs.</span> <span id="s1466">I -- I don’t know if that -- how impressive that could be, but if you think about the time of the year and what we went through and -- anyhow, we had these indoor jobs and -- and they looked, the SS women, cruel as they were -- and they were really horrible types -- it was for their own benefit to stay with the people that they picked, you know.</span> <span id="s1467">And i-if you turn out that you -- they liked you, which -- she liked me, what do you mean liked, how could she have liked me when I was a nothing Jew?</span> <span id="s1468">But I did -- I washed her laundry and I ironed her laundry and I washed the -- cleaned the floor and I did the dishes and I brought in the wood and I -- I had the stove on for her and I -- you know, I did all the things that -- that -- polished her shoes and I did the best I could.</span> <span id="s1469">So one way or another she couldn’t hate me, because you know, I was doing.</span> <span id="s1470">I was doing things for her.</span> <span id="s1471">We were in that camp -- I’m trying to reconstruct, you know, I -- di-di-di-direct -- d-dates like this are hard to come by, but this has to be mid -- mid-April or so.</span> <span id="s1472">Mid- April, 1945.</span> <span id="s1473">And all of a sudden, we hear bombing.</span> <span id="s1474">The allies were bombing, you see?</span> <span id="s1475">So that was very good news, for us.</span> <span id="s1476">We heard the bombs falling and they were scared to death and we didn’t care any more, because just to see them scared -- and they were running down where we were.</span> <span id="s1477">They were also running down into that cellar where we were sleeping, you know?</span> <span id="s1478">They were petrified.</span> <span id="s1479">But to us, it was just one more.</span> <span id="s1480">Besides it -- we knew it was English.</span> <span id="s1481">The English or the Americans, we didn’t know, but we knew somebody was bombing and that’s good.</span> <span id="s1482">Because one way or another, this has to get resolved now.</span> <span id="s1483">So after some very heavy bombardment a few times, by the allies -- obviously they must have been bombing the airf -- air base, you see?</span> <span id="s1484">Because we were in the middle of nowhere, but there was an air base.</span> <span id="s1485">So after some of these bombings were over -- and again, I can’t tell you exactly, but it had to be about middle of April -- or early April, I don’t know, 1945, they told us we have to evacuate the camp and they were going, too.</span> <span id="s1486">But of course, they weren’t going to ki -- schlepp -- carry their own things.</span> <span id="s1487">So each one of the maids had to carry a rucksack.</span> <span id="s1488">A -- a backpack with her things and we were march -- we were formed in a formation and I think either the -- the -- the servants, meaning myself and the others, either were on the end or at the front, but we weren’t mixed in, we were in a place all in one group, because we were carrying that -- that -- the belongings, you know?</span> <span id="s1489">And then -- I’m sorry to say, I’m totally ignorant of the area, but I know that we found ourselves -- I know it’s in Mecklenburg, but we found ourselves on the highway -- major highway and I don’t know which it was, east -- west highway or north-south highway or whichever highway it was -- it was a major highway because it was completely covered with people.</span> <span id="s1490">You had soldiers in uniform and soldiers out of uniforms and tanks and horses and -- and cows and people and Jews from camps and Christian Poles from the neighboring farms, you know, the Christian Poles worked slave labor on farms.</span> <span id="s1491">And POW’s and all languages and -- and uniforms and not uniform.</span> <span id="s1492">And you know, we walked in formation, we had -- our clothes was marked with a big X -- with a -- like a -- you know, shiny kind of painting -- paint that was on both s -- you know, to mark us.</span> <span id="s1493">So you could tell who we were, but we were carrying these rucksacks -- these knapsacks for them and we were in a group.</span> <span id="s1494">There were 12 of us.</span> <span id="s1495">And before long, there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1496">On the side there, there was a -- there a -- the Swedish -- Swedish Red Cross was giving out -- was giving out parcels.</span> <span id="s1497">Not parcels, food rations.</span> <span id="s1498">I don’t know -- o-out of nowhere, it’s like, you know, i-i-it’s -- it’s -- it’s a total like -- it -- it -- like in a dream, you know, in a dream things do not connect.</span> <span id="s1499">One -- you dream that you are in school, but the school happens to be in the middle of the ocean or something like that, you know, it doesn’t connect.</span> <span id="s1500">In this melee of people, of -- of soldiers, of civilians, of -- of airplanes flying over, you don’t know which way you’re going, north or south or whichever.</span> <span id="s1501">You don’t know -- and then you just see rations given to you because they see that you’re a prisoner, you see?</span> <span id="s1502">Of course these German women, they grabbed all the cigarettes and everything and they stuck it in the knapsacks.</span> <span id="s1503">Finally, we had to stop, because there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1504">Nobody was moving, nothing was moving.</span> <span id="s1505">There was -- it was total traffic jam, period.</span> <span id="s1506">No place to go.</span> <span id="s1507">And there were embankments on both sides of the road and there were -- further out was like a forest and on this side -- on the other side was also an embankment and a field.</span> <span id="s1508">We were all sitting together, the -- the -- the servant girls, us with the knapsacks and one of the girls, her name was Hel-Helena, she was blonde, looked German, spoke German beautifully.</span> <span id="s1509">She had an idea that we could now make our way out of here and nobody will know the difference, because it was the commotion.</span> <span id="s1510">Not commotion, th-the mixture of everything was -- you couldn’t tell who was who and who was going where and what was happening.</span> <span id="s1511">So she says, why don’t we sit down.</span> <span id="s1512">The SS women were all together, they were hanging around where the rations were given out, because they could, you know, they could get their hands on things.</span> <span id="s1513">So we’re sitting on the embankment and Helena says like this, “You know, I can get dressed,” meaning her -- she can get dressed in one of the things that are in the knapsacks and we will move on the side and we will sit there and if later on, after everybody moves and they find us, she will say she’s minding us.</span> <span id="s1514">Which we did -- she took out a cape, a black cape out of one of the knapsacks and put the head, th-th-the -- the hat on, the German hat and we moved down the embankment, into the field and we walked very quietly.</span> <span id="s1515">There was haysa -- stacks, in the field and we hid behind the haystacks and before you knew it, everybody started moving and -- and we got left behind.</span> <span id="s1516">Nobody even knew we got left behind, because who could even know?</span> <span id="s1517">Who could even count?</span> <span id="s1518">These German women, maybe they themselves wanted to get away from us.</span> <span id="s1519">If you think about it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: How many girls were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: 12, there were 12 of us.</span> <span id="s1522">Th-The -- ma -- two sisters, myself and the others.</span> <span id="s1523">This is all from -- from the Radsoff group that we came with.</span> <span id="s1524">And I am thinking that they could not have been all that stupid to see that we weren’t together with them, but they maybe didn’t want to be together with us.</span> <span id="s1525">However, it really worked to our advantage very well, because we found ourselves behind the h-haystacks and then a Pole came -- a man came over and he spoke Polish very well and he ask who we were and we said we detached ourselves, we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1526">We were Jewish slave laborers and such and prisoners.</span> <span id="s1527">And he says, “Well, if you want to, there’s a villa not far from here, you go there, there’s a woman and you tell her to feed you.”</span> <span id="s1528">And he said there were Polish workers around, still on the fields, you see.</span> <span id="s1529">So we went over, there was really a nice villa and there was this woman and she fed us, was really just like he said.</span> <span id="s1530">And we said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s1531">We still didn’t -- we -- then we started hearing from them that the war is ending.</span> <span id="s1532">But this is the end of April now.</span> <span id="s1533">And we really didn’t know who -- who was doing what and how is it ending and where are the Germans?</span> <span id="s1534">And we just saw by the way the highway was that things weren’t so hot for them, you see?</span> <span id="s1535">That they were running away somewhere, I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1536">Anyhow, when we came to that villa and -- and we stayed overnight and lo and behold, next morning or next day, the Russians -- Russian soldiers arrived.</span> <span id="s1537">They arrived in -- like a -- a truck or something and they wanted to know who was who and we said who we were and we spoke Polish and there was a Russian woman with us too, because that was already out of Radsoff.</span> <span id="s1538">And he says, “Great.</span> <span id="s1539">He says, “You know, you are here, wonderful, because we’re going to be here and we’re going to need girls to work for us.”</span> <span id="s1540">So, he says, “We’ll be here tomorrow and then you can go with us, we’ll really make it -- and make it good -- I mean you’ll have -- you-you’ll have a better life.”</span> <span id="s1541">After they left, the Russian women said, “Don’t trust them.”</span> <span id="s1542">And the women -- Polish women said they were raped, that the Russians were raping women.</span> <span id="s1543">So we took off, before they came back, we took off and we didn’t know -- w -- the only thing -- we didn’t know what to do or where to go.</span> <span id="s1544">We didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1545">I-Is the war ended?</span> <span id="s1546">It’s not end, it’s still going on, but it was already very late April and they said th-that the war was over.</span> <span id="s1547">But we didn’t know what over means.</span> <span id="s1548">What does over mean, you know?</span> <span id="s1549">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: I -- I’m just going to have t-two quick follow-up questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Th-Th-The villa you -- the villa you went to, was that a German villa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1554">That was a German villa, w-which belonged to lan -- German landowners, who were employing slave labor -- Christian slave labor camp from Poland and Ukrainians -- Ukrainian women.</span> <span id="s1555">They worked the fields while the Germans were in the army.</span> <span id="s1556">They worked the fields.</span> <span id="s1557">So that -- that’s who it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: And the other question was, what kind of physical shape were you in, the three of you?</span> <span id="s1559">How did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Much better.</span> <span id="s1561">Much better.</span> <span id="s1562">First of all, you know, the last months and a half or two in Auschwitz were already restoring our health.</span> <span id="s1563">As I told you before we left, we were given shoes and we were given clothes to fit, warm clothes.</span> <span id="s1564">So that was already -- that saved our life in the march -- in the death march and riding into Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1565">We got out of Ravensbrück with -- a short time before we were defeated physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s1566">In Radsoff, we had an indoor job.</span> <span id="s1567">And Krisha was in the kitchen, we always had food to eat, you know?</span> <span id="s1568">She was leaving me the bread crust that I was giving out to other women because I don’t even need it -- this, any more.</span> <span id="s1569">Because you know, we had -- we still were wearing the same clothes that we came out of Auschwitz, that were fitting.</span> <span id="s1570">This is a very important point, that you have shoes to wear and it wasn’t wooden shoes like, you know, like in Auschwitz that we wear -- wore wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1571">So that if you add it all up, Radsoff being -- did I say about two months or so?</span> <span id="s1572">Something like this.</span> <span id="s1573">That restored our health.</span> <span id="s1574">So by the time we were out of Radsoff, we are still wearing Auschwitz clothes, which I told you, which were fitting.</span> <span id="s1575">Our health -- not health, but we were restored.</span> <span id="s1576">And we had the energy, we didn’t know which way we’re going to be heading, so we were -- decide to go back home to Poland, because you have to find out who remain, who -- what happened, even though we pretty much knew, you know?</span> <span id="s1577">In -- we didn’t know what happened to father, but -- but we more or less -- things were begun to fall in, because we started asking around, the people, if they knew and then nobody knew and so on.</span> <span id="s1578">We decided to go back to Poland, not so much weesaw, most of us, of the 12.</span> <span id="s1579">And we started walking, we got on the train and there were transports, so they would dump us at the next station, then we got on another train and went all the way to Bitgosh like this, on and off the train and by that time, people saw who you were.</span> <span id="s1580">First of all, you couldn’t -- you could not mistake us for anybody else, because we were marked with the -- with the X’s on the back and the front, so -- and of course we had numbers, but you didn’t have to go around showing your number.</span> <span id="s1581">Anybody who looked at you close, knew who you were, you see?</span> <span id="s1582">Didn’t have to introduce yourself.</span> <span id="s1583">So, they knew -- where you going?</span> <span id="s1584">“Well, we’re trying to go back to Poland.”</span> <span id="s1585">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s1586">So they would say, “All right, now a new transport is going to load up soldiers here.</span> <span id="s1587">You stay on this platform, next train comes, they’ll take you.”</span> <span id="s1588">You see?</span> <span id="s1589">So this is how it worked out, that eventually we were on the train, off the train, on the train, off the train.</span> <span id="s1590">Fi -- It was if we didn’t know where we’re going, but we’ll thought we’ll go back to Starachowice, you see?</span> <span id="s1591">And we were -- got on the train and finally, on our last -- we came out of Bitgosh, we were just heading to Poland, w-we didn’t know how we were heading.</span> <span id="s1592">There was a -- a Russian soldiers in -- soldier in the train, heard us speak Polish and of course he saw who we were.</span> <span id="s1593">As I told you, we didn’t have to introduce ourselves.</span> <span id="s1594">So he says, “You’re one of those camp people?”</span> <span id="s1595">So we said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1596">“Where you going?”</span> <span id="s1597">“We’re going back to Poland.”</span> <span id="s1598">“Where in Poland?”</span> <span id="s1599">We said, “Starachowice.”</span> <span id="s1600">“What kind of town is it?”</span> <span id="s1601">He spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1602">“Is it a big city, is it a town?”</span> <span id="s1603">I said, “No, it’s not a ci -- big city, it’s a town,” you know, the town had 30,000 people, so it isn’t what you call a city.</span> <span id="s1604">It was a city, but it wasn’t a big city.</span> <span id="s1605">Not like Kraków or Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1606">He said, “Don’t go back to Starachowice, if that’s where you came from.</span> <span id="s1607">It’s not safe for Jews to return to -- to small towns, because people are now -- they feel you come back for your property, they are killing people around there.</span> <span id="s1608">Don’t go.</span> <span id="s1609">You have to go to a big city.”</span> <span id="s1610">Warsaw, Kraków or Lódz.</span> <span id="s1611">He said, “Warsaw’s all bombed out.</span> <span id="s1612">Lódz has a very good Jewish agency set up.</span> <span id="s1613">Best thing for you is to go to Lódz.”</span> <span id="s1614">“Okay, we’ll go to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1615">Where are we going to go to Lódz?</span> <span id="s1616">Who do we know?”</span> <span id="s1617">He says, “I have a sister there,” he says.</span> <span id="s1618">He gave us the add -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s1620">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: The soldier whom we met in the train, coming out of Germany, I mean af -- when the war ended, who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on the train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that we’re going home to Starachowice and he asked us what size town it was.</span> <span id="s1622">Whether it was a big city, which of course it wasn’t, because the population was 30,000 and that’s no big city.</span> <span id="s1623">So when he found out, he says, “No, you should not be going back to the small town, because they will not welcome you.</span> <span id="s1624">They will think you’re coming to claim your property or whichever it is and a lot of people returning from camps are being killed now, so you are better off going to one of three places.</span> <span id="s1625">Warsaw, Kraków or Lódz.</span> <span id="s1626">Warsaw is all bombed out -- unless you have somebody there, other than that, Kraków or Lódz.”</span> <span id="s1627">And we decided, “Fine, so we’ll go to Lódz, but where do we go?”</span> <span id="s1628">And he says, “Well, I have a sister there,” and he gave us the address.</span> <span id="s1629">He says, “You go to her.</span> <span id="s1630">Ring her doorbell and tell her that I send you and there’s a Jewish agency and you can register and -- and from there on, you’ll be all right.”</span> <span id="s1631">Which is exactly how it was and this is my -- May, 1945, now.</span> <span id="s1632">We came and she had a lot of people -- lot of people sleeping on the floor, sleeping on the stairway, all over the place.</span> <span id="s1633">And next day we went to register.</span> <span id="s1634">Of course we knew where to go, because she told us.</span> <span id="s1635">The agencies, Jewish agencies that were running the place, that were running the registration were HIAS and the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1636">I think both, together or separately, however, but they were international Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1637">There was also Red Cross in Lódz, that was registering people, where we did register, but we were told that they are basically interested in the Christians.</span> <span id="s1638">And it’s exactly how it was.</span> <span id="s1639">So we -- as I said, we were -- after we registered, we had to go and check our names.</span> <span id="s1640">Not just our names, check the names of people who were returning -- whether relatives or neighbors or whoever.</span> <span id="s1641">And before long we found out that Uncle Alexander, my father’s brother arrived.</span> <span id="s1642">Alexander Laks and he was from Radom.</span> <span id="s1643">He had two sons that went to Russia when the war broke out and they eventually joined the unders army and went through to Herron and Palestine.</span> <span id="s1644">And that’s another chapter of the Holocaust, but we’ll stick with this part now.</span> <span id="s1645">Uncle Alexander and his wife, Rose - Roosia, went through camps.</span> <span id="s1646">We saw her in Auschwitz, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1647">I mentioned at the beginning when we were carrying the rocks one way and she was carrying the rocks the other way.</span> <span id="s1648">Anyhow, he did not yet know where she was, if she survived, but he was in -- in Lódz.</span> <span id="s1649">He was a man of means before the war.</span> <span id="s1650">He had real estate, a lot of real estate and property and a big business and so on.</span> <span id="s1651">So he decided he would go to Radom and see what he could claim.</span> <span id="s1652">He -- I think he had some hidden assets too, hidden.</span> <span id="s1653">The agency, the Jewish agency not only provided food rations, but they also gave us a place to live in, which wasn’t a place, it was more like a -- the post war bombed out discard, but it was a place.</span> <span id="s1654">And before we knew it, we met Adrian, my s -- Canadian sister’s husband, who was already in Lódz for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1655">He was with us in the camps -- not in the camps, he was with us in Starachowice camps, up to the point where, on the eve of being shipped to Auschwitz, he broke out with the other prisoners, most of whom did not make it.</span> <span id="s1656">He did make it.</span> <span id="s1657">He made it out and he stayed with the Polish partisans.</span> <span id="s1658">And of course, that was Au-August, 1944.</span> <span id="s1659">He fought with the partisans and then when that part of Poland was liberated, and that was way before we know of liberation, because that was almost like -- like -- like almost a year before we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1660">We first went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1661">He found his mother, who was left behind in Auschwitz, as human refuse, because she was totally on the verge of -- the crematoria didn’t work and they didn’t -- they weren’t going to take the time to kill her, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s1662">So they didn’t kill her, but she was left behind and she was liberated in January of 1945 by the Russians and somehow or other found her way to Lódz and found -- he found her and they established a household.</span> <span id="s1663">So when we were in Lódz, when we just arrived in Lódz, we found Uncle Alexander and then we found Adrian and his mother.</span> <span id="s1664">And we had a little -- a place to live in and we -- in fact we had this friend of mine from Israel, who also was the one, Hanna Tenser, who was in the gas chamber and was left behind, also.</span> <span id="s1665">She joined us, she called herself the fourth sister.</span> <span id="s1666">So she -- she joined us and we tried to organize a kind of a life.</span> <span id="s1667">Uncle Alexander was a man of means, so he was able to secure some money.</span> <span id="s1668">He had a lot of hidden assets, liquid assets, money and such, but he also had real estate.</span> <span id="s1669">And he rented a very lovely apartment -- large apartment, so now we lived in the apartment, both my sisters, Hanya - Anna and Krisha - Kris went to work and I signed up for school and I was the one to keep house.</span> <span id="s1670">And was a very interesting period of my life, because you see, I actually didn’t finish elementary school, you see?</span> <span id="s1671">But, because I was taught, right through the ghetto tie -- time, which was seven days a week, 10 hours a day, I knew French and I knew Latin and I knew grammar and I knew history and I read Tolstoy and -- and I did all these things, which I would never have done, except the books were in the house and that’s what we studied from.</span> <span id="s1672">And my sister Hanya, being the best teacher I ever had, which, it’s a fact.</span> <span id="s1673">I had this fantastic education, which I -- it wasn’t even qualif -- qua -- classified, you know?</span> <span id="s1674">If you ask me -- so I went to high school and ask me, “What grade?”</span> <span id="s1675">So there was this high school, so everybody said, “Well, you’re 15 now, 16, you have to go to high school, but,” -- so I came and say, “What do you know?”</span> <span id="s1676">And I told them I studied this and I said -- they said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s1677">They put me in the second grade of high school, you see?</span> <span id="s1678">And I was keeping house.</span> <span id="s1679">We lived very nicely because of Uncle Alexander.</span> <span id="s1680">And we can still registering, but we found out there’s nothing for us any more, to hope for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Was that a school established by a Jewish agency, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No, this was a Polish high school in Lódz, Polish high school.</span> <span id="s1683">There were a lot of kids in my situation who were -- whose education was interrupted.</span> <span id="s1684">And they had all kinds of professors who were floating around, university professors and everybody, who was willing to teach.</span> <span id="s1685">And we lived -- yes, I picked up as if not -- as if I really belonged there.</span> <span id="s1686">I really, truly fit right in.</span> <span id="s1687">I really fit right in.</span> <span id="s1688">And my two sisters worked and we lived with uncle and Kris met Miles, Miles Lehrman, her husband and very soon my older sister, Hanya was -- she got engaged to Adrian and she went to Warsaw to study diplomac-diplomacy in the school of diplom -- Polish diplomacy.</span> <span id="s1689">And she left for Warsaw and he left with her, soon after.</span> <span id="s1690">And I stayed on.</span> <span id="s1691">Kris got married.</span> <span id="s1692">I went to high school.</span> <span id="s1693">We had a very good life in -- in Lódz, in the sense that it was sort of like catching your breath, you know?</span> <span id="s1694">First of all, we really, finally were able to find out -- to make connection as to what happened, who -- we knew that the family perished, but we still didn’t know who or how or when or what or anything.</span> <span id="s1695">We found out for sure that mother went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1696">We found out for sure that father perished in October, in 1944, in Auschwitz, for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Through -- because we met people in Lódz from our hometown, who were together with my father in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1699">They even gave us October as the date, you see, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1700">October, ‘44.</span> <span id="s1701">And we tried to find out about Babcha Tannenblume and about Babcha Laks.</span> <span id="s1702">And we did not know about my cousin Anja.</span> <span id="s1703">But we know that Babcha Laks family -- her family was gone.</span> <span id="s1704">We just didn’t hear about Anja and then one day Anja showed up in -- in Lódz.</span> <span id="s1705">And she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s1706">And that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1707">And then we didn’t know about the Tannenblume side of the family, where they were.</span> <span id="s1708">As I told you, nine children.</span> <span id="s1709">So, we found out specifically that Babcha Tannenblume and her daughter Regina, with her husband whom she married during the war and the daughter Anja most definitely went to Treblinka with the Austroviets Jews, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1710">And my aunt from Danzig, who was shipped to Austroviets with her husband.</span> <span id="s1711">Rachella.</span> <span id="s1712">She and her husband were together with Babcha, they all went.</span> <span id="s1713">Now, my aunt from around Lublin, the one that had those two -- two sons, engineers, they studied in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1714">Whether or not they came home before th-th-the war, because the Belgian Jews were killed just as badly as the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1715">So the two cousins -- the two engineers, either got killed in Belgium or they got killed in Poland.</span> <span id="s1716">Either way, they didn’t survi-survive.</span> <span id="s1717">Their mother and father, Kronenburg, Aunt Fella Kronenburg and her husband.</span> <span id="s1718">They were very well-to-do, they lived on an estate around Lublin.</span> <span id="s1719">They -- they perished.</span> <span id="s1720">The only question was always that pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1721">My mother’s youngest daught -- sister.</span> <span id="s1722">The pharmacist who went to Wamsha, who got the job right before the war.</span> <span id="s1723">And that is a mystery to this day.</span> <span id="s1724">I mean, the others are also a mystery, because how can you really tell?</span> <span id="s1725">But we know that they went with the general auseedlung -- with the general shipment of Jews, so we know to place them that way.</span> <span id="s1726">But my aunt who lived, who had those two sons, whether they perished in Belgium or whatever.</span> <span id="s1727">They would have found us, or we would have found them, but nothing happened after the war.</span> <span id="s1728">And they never registered anywhere.</span> <span id="s1729">And the one from Wamsha, that pharmacist, that we never knew what happened to her, so this is what -- we made the connection, sort of to finalize it, you know.</span> <span id="s1730">Because you cannot go through life forever being surrounded by mysteries.</span> <span id="s1731">Now things were coming out in the open, about what really, truly happened.</span> <span id="s1732">And it was incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s1733">And to look for individuals, that was totally out of the question, but to look for people who were part of a group was easier because genocide was predicated on mass murder, you see?</span> <span id="s1734">So if you were in the Austroviets group, you went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1735">If you were in the Starachowice group, you went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1736">You see, if you were in another group, you went to Majdanek or Beljets.</span> <span id="s1737">Like Miles Lehrman’s family.</span> <span id="s1738">They perished in Beljets, because he comes from that part of Poland, you see?</span> <span id="s1739">Near Beljets.</span> <span id="s1740">So, you could actually bring it to -- not to resolve it, but to bring it around to a finality where it puts your soul at ease, that this is what happened, you see?</span> <span id="s1741">And so the -- the war turned out th-that of my mother’s family, the only survivors, except for the brothers that were in Canada, were the three of us.</span> <span id="s1742">Of all the cousins and the aunts and everybody else, the three of us.</span> <span id="s1743">And of my father’s side, only c-cousin Anja and Uncle Alexander and with his wife and the two sons, of c -- who of course survived, but not inside th -- inside of Poland.</span> <span id="s1744">So, but life in Lódz was very interesting, because we kept running into all kinds of people coming back.</span> <span id="s1745">And we lived -- Uncle Alexander saw to it that we lived a good life and I -- now we lived in a nice apartment and -- and we even had a maid.</span> <span id="s1746">And I still did the marketing and I still did the cooking and I went to school.</span> <span id="s1747">And Kris was working and Hanya was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1748">And Kris got herself engaged to Miles and then we had a wedding in -- in the apartment and with -- I did the catering.</span> <span id="s1749">We did the whole wedding ourselves.</span> <span id="s1750">It was good fun, I -- to this day when I talk about it, people laugh, because oh, we had all that stuff bringing in and shipping in and all kinds of -- with gild -- geese and we had the roast goose and we had the -- all these thing -- was a very, very lovely wedding.</span> <span id="s1751">That was Christmas time.</span> <span id="s1752">And right after the wedding, Uncle Alexander went to Sweden, because his wife -- while we were in Radsoff, after Auschwitz, she didn’t go our route.</span> <span id="s1753">I don’t think she went to Ravensbrück, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1754">Anyhow, she winded up in a small camp not far from Radsoff.</span> <span id="s1755">And she was so deathly ill when the war -- war ended, that the Swedish Red Cross was taking all these terribly sick people up to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1756">And she was in the hospital and when she got well, she stayed on as a -- as a nurses m -- help.</span> <span id="s1757">So, Uncle Alexander went to meet her there and they found out that the sons survived, went through Palestine.</span> <span id="s1758">My aunt -- my uncle’s wife had family in Isra -- in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1759">So, when the two sons came via Russia in the unders army.</span> <span id="s1760">And the unders army, you know, was traveling through the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1761">When they came out of -- this is also a historical framework.</span> <span id="s1762">When Stalin made the pact with Shikorski -- what year was that?</span> <span id="s1763">During the war, whatever.</span> <span id="s1764">And he agreed to let Polish military leave to -- to join the allies, the western allies.</span> <span id="s1765">The -- Jews were not alla -- left out, but some Jews did go out.</span> <span id="s1766">And they traveled through Teheran into Palestine and from there to England, you see?</span> <span id="s1767">So, my two cousins met in Palestine, because in Tel Aviv was my Aunt Rose’s sister.</span> <span id="s1768">And they met there, quite by chance.</span> <span id="s1769">And then they went to England, then they both were in British uniform, fighting for the allies, til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1770">And Uncle Alexander stayed in Sweden and we eventually, in early ‘46, left Poland for Berlin.</span> <span id="s1771">We meaning Krisha and Miles and myself.</span> <span id="s1772">Because Hanya was already engaged to Adash.</span> <span id="s1773">And she’s live -- she was waiting to finish her -- her studies.</span> <span id="s1774">And we went to Berlin and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Why to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: You see, that I cannot tell you, but Miles was now my guardian, you see?</span> <span id="s1777">He married Krisha and I said, “Well, now you have a wife and you don’t need a fifth wheel into the -- to the wagon,” you know?</span> <span id="s1778">He said, “No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1779">That’s not how the way it’s going to work.”</span> <span id="s1780">In fact when he got engaged to Krisha, he gave me a present, a fountain pen.</span> <span id="s1781">I loved plants, so he gave me a plant and to it was attached a fountain pen.</span> <span id="s1782">It was -- in fact, was my birthday and he was just engaged to Krisha, whatever, so this was my birthday present, a fountain pen with the plant.</span> <span id="s1783">He said, “No, that’s the way we’re going to work it, that until you get married, you’ll stay with us.”</span> <span id="s1784">I was trying very hard not to be a burden, you know, in any way.</span> <span id="s1785">But they were both very busy.</span> <span id="s1786">He was working, she was working.</span> <span id="s1787">Somebody had to run the house.</span> <span id="s1788">I knew nothing about cooking, but I learned.</span> <span id="s1789">So when somebody, you know, I’m supposed to be a good cook, so they say, so when they say it in front of Miles, says, “You know, Renia is a pretty good cook.”</span> <span id="s1790">He says, “Sure she’s a good cook, she learned on my stomach.”</span> <span id="s1791">To this day, he says, “Thank me, don’t thank her.</span> <span id="s1792">She learned on my stomach.”</span> <span id="s1793">Because I really don’t know any kind of cooking, much, you know.</span> <span id="s1794">So was -- was from the imagination, but I did learn to cook, because I was trying very hard.</span> <span id="s1795">I did the marketing, you know and I -- so I truly, I -- I -- it’s apropof marketing, no but that’s a sideline, [indecipherable] keep it.</span> <span id="s1796">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s1797">Well, anyhow, when we went to -- coming back to the question.</span> <span id="s1798">Miles was very much in touch with all the eng -- returning refugees, the people from the camps and friends.</span> <span id="s1799">I think he had some kind of a cousin in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1800">And somebody said, “If you go to Berlin, there’s a DP camp.”</span> <span id="s1801">He said, “Where am I going find a DP camp?”</span> <span id="s1802">They said -- he said he has a cousin.</span> <span id="s1803">“You have the address, you go to the cousin and then you --.”</span> <span id="s1804">So we did go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1805">We left Poland and that was a surreptitious kind of an operation, cause you’re not allowed.</span> <span id="s1806">Was called th-the green border.</span> <span id="s1807">Because you know, the old ernissa border was not yet established in 1945.</span> <span id="s1808">No, this early ‘46.</span> <span id="s1809">It was sort of fluid, because it wasn’t Germany, but yet it was Germany, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1810">We went from -- we went to Stettin and from Stettin to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1811">And in Berlin, we found his cousin and before long, we moved into the DP camp.</span> <span id="s1812">And of course from my viewpoint, this was just the happiest of all happenings, because here in Berlin, the DP camp was run by -- basically by the Jewish agencies again.</span> <span id="s1813">However, I think it had a big -- well, Palestine was involved a lot in this whole set-up, because we had Palestinian -- you had Jews from Palestine, from -- which is Israel in British uniform and I think they were trying to find out how reset -- how people were going to be resettled.</span> <span id="s1814">Anyhow, the school was formed very shortly before I got there.</span> <span id="s1815">I got there in March or so of 1946.</span> <span id="s1816">There was a school form -- how do you form a school when you have all ages and all backgrounds and educational backgrounds.</span> <span id="s1817">You know, there were kids 13 years old who already had a high s -- college diplo -- college equivalent and there were kids 13 years old who didn’t even finish second grade, you know?</span> <span id="s1818">This type.</span> <span id="s1819">I will have to show you the picture, because I still have a group picture from that school.</span> <span id="s1820">They went -- whoever they were, whether it was the Jewish agencies or the Palestinian who -- pal -- they -- they -- Jews from Palestine, they -- they -- whoever it was, the camp was absolutely set up to rescue the children from their experiences, you see?</span> <span id="s1821">It was about education, no question about it, but it was also about restoring childhood, you see?</span> <span id="s1822">That was the crux of the program.</span> <span id="s1823">We had our own mess hall, for bre -- for lunch.</span> <span id="s1824">We had break from school.</span> <span id="s1825">Now, let me backtrack.</span> <span id="s1826">This was a school in the Hebrew language.</span> <span id="s1827">Everything was taught in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1828">I had my little bit of a Jew -- Hebrew background from my Tarbud school as a child, but certainly not prepared to study Hebrew in -- in -- chemistry in Hebrew, you know, because this -- this is like -- I had a -- a -- a distance of a million miles.</span> <span id="s1829">But one way or another, we all fitted in.</span> <span id="s1830">They had the little kids together, little kids and I was assigned to what they called the high school group.</span> <span id="s1831">That was the oldest group.</span> <span id="s1832">And of course the little kids had special treats, but we were totally s -- treated like -- like teenagers with a life, whatever that means.</span> <span id="s1833">We had a separate mess hall.</span> <span id="s1834">Our food was much better.</span> <span id="s1835">You know, there were mess halls for the community.</span> <span id="s1836">Our food was much better.</span> <span id="s1837">We were given special rations of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1838">We were having a very, very tender, considerate supervision of life.</span> <span id="s1839">We had dances, we went to dances.</span> <span id="s1840">I have pictures to this day from dances.</span> <span id="s1841">We had excursions into Berlin proper.</span> <span id="s1842">Went to the opera.</span> <span id="s1843">We had likebaumer, we had picnics.</span> <span id="s1844">Out of the camp, we had performances, we performed and we went to performances.</span> <span id="s1845">Mayor LaGuardia -- mayor of New York, LaGuardia was the unrah.</span> <span id="s1846">This was an unrah camp also, you know.</span> <span id="s1847">Mayor LaGuardia came to visit and we were sa -- reciting poetry for him, you know, the -- all the group.</span> <span id="s1848">And I foun-formed many friendships, some of them lasting to this day, from that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Where in Berlin was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Schlackenza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: And how many children, about, in that camp?</span> <span id="s1852">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Well, I have the album.</span> <span id="s1854">When I started, the group was maybe 40, 50 people, when I -- and by the time I left, it was more like 300.</span> <span id="s1855">I’ll show you.</span> <span id="s1856">I have two pictures and this is only within one year, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1857">And after I left, there were more friends of mine that were left behind, and the school really grew.</span> <span id="s1858">And we had all kinds of -- we had th-the soccer games being played, that we were watching or playing, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s1859">Every effort was made to bring us around.</span> <span id="s1860">The other -- the grown-ups didn’t do much, but there were dances, we all went to dances.</span> <span id="s1861">And I used to do a lot of things privately with Kris and Miles Lehrman.</span> <span id="s1862">We used to go down to the opera, we used to do other things.</span> <span id="s1863">Went to see -- to the theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Wasn’t it difficult for you to go back to Germany, in a sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Well, you see, I was in Germany, but I wasn’t in Germany.</span> <span id="s1866">I was in camp.</span> <span id="s1867">I didn’t know anything about Germany.</span> <span id="s1868">You see, I -- to me the German language in Poland was the same as the German language in Radsoff or Ravensbrück or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1869">Except Starachowice was in Polish territory and Radsoff was on German territory.</span> <span id="s1870">I didn’t have any -- either access or -- or connection to the outside, except to the guards, to the SS and to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1871">And then to the women.</span> <span id="s1872">Most of the time -- most of the time my connection was all to the sold -- male.</span> <span id="s1873">But Radsoff I had th-the women.</span> <span id="s1874">But that was really dealing more with the language, you see.</span> <span id="s1875">They represented Germany, but I -- I was in Germany, but I didn’t know I was in Germany, I could have been on the moon.</span> <span id="s1876">In a camp on -- you know, a camp -- a concentration camp on the moon.</span> <span id="s1877">So that when I came to the DP camp in Germany, I was again, sort of, in but not in.</span> <span id="s1878">I was physically in the camp, but there was no connection to Berlin, except we -- I have all kinds of pictures I’ll show you, from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1879">Berlin was bombed out, we used to go out to Couferstindam.</span> <span id="s1880">I have the church, the old church in Couferstindam that was demolished, I have it in the back of my head there, when I have a picture taken, but th-that Germany was nothing in the context of what we’re talking about, cause this was post-war Germany and there were people from all over, because -- don’t forget 1946, you still have droves of people passing through.</span> <span id="s1881">The -- the -- the movement of people west and east, because everybody was dislocated.</span> <span id="s1882">So the Berlin that you talk about isn’t really Berlin, a German Berlin.</span> <span id="s1883">It -- it was German, but it wasn’t German, but as far as the camps are concerned and as far as the DP camp is concern, I wasn’t in Germany.</span> <span id="s1884">I was, but I wasn’t, really.</span> <span id="s1885">You see?</span> <span id="s1886">And then we left th -- January, we left the DP camp.</span> <span id="s1887">And I have to show you my report card, all excellents.</span> <span id="s1888">Top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1889">You know, I reread it in preparation, I wanted to show it to you.</span> <span id="s1890">I s -- I see the subjects, literature and chemistry and one is geography of Palestine -- is the entry, one entry.</span> <span id="s1891">I have excellents top to bottom and I was given that gift, here, with an inscription.</span> <span id="s1892">This says, “Speak Hebrew.”</span> <span id="s1893">And this is a silver pin I was given and it says -- inscribed with the date on the back and says, “As a souvenir from class keetadialit.”</span> <span id="s1894">And signed Berlin and the date and I keep it to this day.</span> <span id="s1895">It’s a precious gift.</span> <span id="s1896">I was given this and th-the certificate, the report card and we left for Bremenhafen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s1899">This is tape number four, side A. Before we move on, I just have one follow up question to the experience of being in the DP, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: DP camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s1902">That was sort of the first time, really, that you were together with your peers, girls and boys, or I mean -- in a relaxed -- in a normal kind of -- of interactive way.</span> <span id="s1903">Was that difficult for you to relate to boys, for instance, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1905">Because you see, I have already lived a kind of a normal life in Poland.</span> <span id="s1906">As soon as we got settled and -- and uncle was around and then Miles Lehrman came on the scene, we had a life of -- of seeing people, meeting people, going out, going -- you know, doing things th-that I -- I found myself to be a grown up, though I knew that there was a big gap left yet, to be filled.</span> <span id="s1907">But it didn’t bother me, because you see, when you live with so many people, though the circumstances of the camps, the -- the -- the shifting, the going and th-the mixing up with nationalities -- it makes you, or it made me very free with everybody, you see?</span> <span id="s1908">I wasn’t shy and I wasn’t reserved and I wasn’t suspicious and I wasn’t cynical.</span> <span id="s1909">I haven’t lived yet, I wanted to live, you know?</span> <span id="s1910">Anybody was wonderful, everybody was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1911">Everybody I met was great.</span> <span id="s1912">And -- and no matter whether it was a lady or a man or a boy or a girl and that attitude, when I came to Berlin, of course th -- in Poland already, I went to high school, but you know there, I -- probably in that high school, I was more set on the academic achievement because I really needed to place myself academically, you see?</span> <span id="s1913">To -- to -- to -- to categorize myself, to see how do I fit in academically?</span> <span id="s1914">But once I came to Berlin and everything was so mixed up and I didn’t have to prove myself academically and ev -- and they were going out of their way to -- to -- to make us feel that we’re children still, you see?</span> <span id="s1915">That really did it.</span> <span id="s1916">That really did it, because I was sort of pretending I was grown up when I was in Poland and I was accommodating myself and I was adjusting, but here I was just a child and it was perfectly fine and I got chocolate for it.</span> <span id="s1917">So, you see, that really was the so-called smoothing over.</span> <span id="s1918">And when we came to America, now then my child -- not my childhood, but my young life really started.</span> <span id="s1919">And as I told you, we -- Kris and Miles decided they were going to be my guardians until I get married.</span> <span id="s1920">So, obviously, when they had their papers made, Miles had an old aunt living in New York, who left Poland at the turn of the century, you know?</span> <span id="s1921">And she was a very old lady and she lived in -- on the lower east side.</span> <span id="s1922">So Miles secured papers for us to come to America.</span> <span id="s1923">They were going to be our sponsors, meaning this old aunt with the husband.</span> <span id="s1924">And Krisha and Miles and I went via Bremenhafen on the marine perch, which was a converted transpor -- trans -- troop transport that they used for refugees living -- leaving Europe.</span> <span id="s1925">We live -- arrived in America February 11th, 1947 and they picked us up on the -- on the -- at the boat and they took us to their home and they were living on the lower east side and I -- I nev -- in a walk-up, it was really amazing, you know, cause this was still the old Jewish section.</span> <span id="s1926">The old immigrants.</span> <span id="s1927">And they were totally amazed that we were sort of dressed well and we had cameras and we spoke languages.</span> <span id="s1928">And they left Poland, they ask [indecipherable] you know, they left Poland at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s1929">The old lady showed me how to put on the electricity.</span> <span id="s1930">And there was a little toilet with ush -- with the -- no -- chain.</span> <span id="s1931">So she took me in the toilet to show me how to flush the toilet.</span> <span id="s1932">And, of course I was very appreciative, I didn’t really want to show her that really Poland -- the Poland I left is not the Poland she left, you know.</span> <span id="s1933">And anyhow, we stayed on the lower east side, maybe day or two and then we moved to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1934">And again, we did what we did in -- in Lódz.</span> <span id="s1935">Kris and Miles went -- they -- they got jobs and I went to school.</span> <span id="s1936">And I did the cooking and the shopping, we lived together.</span> <span id="s1937">And again I was learning on Miles’s stomach.</span> <span id="s1938">And I went to Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1939">Lived in Crown Heights, Schenectady Avenue.</span> <span id="s1940">I think the number was 241, if I remember.</span> <span id="s1941">Well, whatever.</span> <span id="s1942">It was a walk-up and on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1943">We lived in Brooklyn and again, by a very, very lucky chance, I found myself in Jefferson High School, even though in those days, you had to go to a high school that was in your district and this was a little bit out of my district.</span> <span id="s1944">But apparently there was a group of refugee children, that was being organized into a special program.</span> <span id="s1945">And the Jewish agency in New York, the Joint Distribution Committee, for which we were also, we were -- we registered with them.</span> <span id="s1946">In fact, Kris and Miles found an apartment by going to the Joint Distribution and they gave them an address.</span> <span id="s1947">They had organized that group, the Joint Distribution Committee, or whoever.</span> <span id="s1948">I -- the Joint Distribution didn’t organize the group, they send me to Jefferson High School, to -- telling me that there is a group there and indeed there was.</span> <span id="s1949">The principal of the high school was Ludwig Karpen.</span> <span id="s1950">His wife was president of international ORT, O-R-T.</span> <span id="s1951">He -- I don’t know how the project was set up or whatever.</span> <span id="s1952">By the time I came, there were a total of us, about 35 kids, war survivors, fr -- fr -- of every background, academically and otherwise, from Hungary, from France, from Poland, from Germany.</span> <span id="s1953">You name it, they were there.</span> <span id="s1954">And we were going to be tested and incorporated into different grades, but we had what they set up to call basic English class.</span> <span id="s1955">Basic English class was basically a orientation class.</span> <span id="s1956">The head of the department, who ba -- who I’m -- was very fond of, she became my best friend, til she died a couple of years ago, Agnes Hay.</span> <span id="s1957">She was head of the English department and she was the head of this project.</span> <span id="s1958">We met every day, one period in that special class, for orientation toward Americanization, toward life, towards ha -- customs, see what customs, how do you greet people and how do you don’t greet people and how you shake hands or you don’t shake hands and -- and you know, and we were placed, for example, I was placed in two English grades.</span> <span id="s1959">For example, they gave me the test in history, they saw that I knew history up to the first war, like I know my name.</span> <span id="s1960">Napoleon and all, I knew it, this was all stuff.</span> <span id="s1961">I go-got credit for it.</span> <span id="s1962">I don’t know -- know American history, so I had to study that.</span> <span id="s1963">I had to study speech, definitely.</span> <span id="s1964">I had to take economics and this, you know, th-th-the s -- level was very much higher than in the high school.</span> <span id="s1965">And I met all these wonderful kids who were from all over and who were like I was -- eager to do well in school, eager to -- to excel, to be ac -- they were accepted into the academic background, most of us had an idea of going on to college and of course Dr. Karpen saw to it that we were propibliat -- properly assigned to classes, so that when we finally graduated, we absolutely had the -- all the requirements covered, you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: So it was basically a special program within an ordinary American high school?</span> <span id="s1967">That’s what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yes it was, right.</span> <span id="s1969">And when we did graduate, eventually -- in fact I got a scholarship from the educa-educational foundation for Jewish girls, because I was heading for college.</span> <span id="s1970">I graduated with honors as a matter of fact, from Thomas Jefferson High School, as many others did as well.</span> <span id="s1971">We were excellent students.</span> <span id="s1972">The reason is that we really knew it all -- we didn’t know it in English that well.</span> <span id="s1973">You see, my English was sort of shaky, but when we first came to America, we started going to night school, Kris and Miles and I went to night school.</span> <span id="s1974">I went to Jefferson in the day school -- in the day time and we came in February, I went to high school.</span> <span id="s1975">About March I went to summer camp, you see?</span> <span id="s1976">By recommendation, again.</span> <span id="s1977">To summer camp in the summer, by the time I came back from summer camp, my English was good enough to be in high school.</span> <span id="s1978">So that I had no -- you know, my la-language was not a problem any more.</span> <span id="s1979">And we were mixed in with the high school population and that was a very fine, very academically high, very good school and a lot of kids went to college from that high school.</span> <span id="s1980">Now, it’s really very bad, this high school is very bad, I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s1981">There are a few very bad high schools in New York, this is it.</span> <span id="s1982">When I -- Jefferson -- when I tell a few people that I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, they faint.</span> <span id="s1983">They faint.</span> <span id="s1984">“You went to Jefferson?”</span> <span id="s1985">Well, when I went to Jefferson, Jefferson was not what it is today.</span> <span id="s1986">It was a very fine academic high school.</span> <span id="s1987">Danny Kaye went there, way before I did.</span> <span id="s1988">Shelly Winters.</span> <span id="s1989">To this day she’s very -- this was -- the Gershwin lived around the -- the perimeter of Jefferson High School, this was east New York, which is near Brownsville, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1990">And that was a -- a blue collar Jewish neighborhood when I came in and the school had very high academic level because all these kids were what you call eager beavers, you know.</span> <span id="s1991">To get out of the -- of the working class, you know, Alfred Kazan and all the writers and all kinds of important people came out.</span> <span id="s1992">They went through this -- living in that area and they broke out to greater things.</span> <span id="s1993">Now, when I came to Jefferson, that was more or less the tempo of it, you know, you carried on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Let me ask you one more question, maybe.</span> <span id="s1995">Were you encouraged at all to speak about your war experience, either in that particular program or even in -- in [indecipherable]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1997">As a matter of fact, if I showed you some of these ar -- newspaper clippings, the head of the Hebrew dep-department was Dr. Horowitz, Edward Horowitz.</span> <span id="s1998">He was, as a matter of fact, you know the Jewish matzah people, the Horowitz matzah people?</span> <span id="s1999">He was one of those Horowitz’s, very well-to-do family.</span> <span id="s2000">He had a PhD in Hebrew or whatever.</span> <span id="s2001">He was the head of the Hebrew department and I took Hebrew as a foreign language, because I came out of a Hebrew school and his class was the very good class for me to get oriented to other things than Hebrew lessons.</span> <span id="s2002">To the way the school runs, the requirements, all these things I could get from hi -- from -- in that class in Hebrew, you see?</span> <span id="s2003">And he took a great liking to all the -- he had a few of these kids.</span> <span id="s2004">He took a great liking to me.</span> <span id="s2005">I was in his school and when they found out that I had a birthday coming, my 18th birthday, they gave me -- he gave me a party in his house.</span> <span id="s2006">He invited that Hebrew class.</span> <span id="s2007">And somehow or other, he got these newspaper people to come and interview me in -- in Jefferson.</span> <span id="s2008">And one of them -- he told them that I have a number and the other -- one of the -- from the New York Post, I think, he told me to show me the number -- to show him the number and for me to sit there while he took the picture, which I have to this day, pointing at my number.</span> <span id="s2009">I found it very stupid.</span> <span id="s2010">What was this thing -- what was so important about the number?</span> <span id="s2011">You know, I -- I don’t -- ah, he wants to know, probably Horowitz told him, but I didn’t care, you know?</span> <span id="s2012">And over there, nobody talked about those things.</span> <span id="s2013">That was past and that was then and now is now and we were very busy.</span> <span id="s2014">First of all, the idea of -- th -- Americanization was a totally different concept than it is now, you know?</span> <span id="s2015">The ethnicity of things did not -- was -- wa -- wa -- did not take priority.</span> <span id="s2016">I’m telling you, when he told me to pull my sleeve up and point to the number, th-the photographer from the Post, I did that, but I felt [indecipherable] this guy’s stupid.</span> <span id="s2017">I mean, why does he need that for?</span> <span id="s2018">Ah, he want it, let him have it.</span> <span id="s2019">And I had a wonderful party and they gave me presents and we sung and I was so moved because that was really the first time that I was really celebrated for myself, you know?</span> <span id="s2020">And by then I was rather well established in -- as a good student in the school, in Jefferson, you see?</span> <span id="s2021">So that I -- I didn’t feel below anybody -- anybody American or otherwise.</span> <span id="s2022">I really felt on the level.</span> <span id="s2023">I felt I -- I could just stand very proudly about -- feel that way about myself.</span> <span id="s2024">And, as I said, came time to go to college, you know?</span> <span id="s2025">The school helped us to -- we didn’t know about applications and things and such.</span> <span id="s2026">Dr. Karpen saw to it that most of us picked Brooklyn College, because that was the next step, you know.</span> <span id="s2027">From Brooklyn, to go to Brooklyn College, since that was that free institution, we didn’t have the funds.</span> <span id="s2028">So he -- the school helped us, applications and our records went in.</span> <span id="s2029">We were very good -- I say we, that group, were excellent students.</span> <span id="s2030">In fact where -- when I first walked in to Brooklyn College, to one of the class, somebody cracked a joke, “Oh no, she’s here again.</span> <span id="s2031">We have to work.”</span> <span id="s2032">I mean in an outburst, you know, because they knew that I worked so very hard.</span> <span id="s2033">I really did.</span> <span id="s2034">But, anyhow, the Jefferson High School saw to it that all the kids that wanted to go to Brooklyn College did so.</span> <span id="s2035">There was no question about going out of town, because who had the funds?</span> <span id="s2036">I lived with Kris and Miles.</span> <span id="s2037">Meanwhile, I did go to Brooklyn College, but Kris and Miles -- Krisha and Miles decided to move to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2038">But I did not want to miss the opportunity now, you see?</span> <span id="s2039">So I stayed behind and I had a scholarship from the educational foundation.</span> <span id="s2040">I stayed with friends, I lived with a family and they moved to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2041">And I was in Brooklyn College, about a drop over a year and I had, of course the -- some of these Polish, one of my very good friends, Sonia, who is no longer alive -- she committed suicide, as a matter of fact, I told you, at age 39.</span> <span id="s2042">There was a woman whose life was -- she had a PhD in English and everything.</span> <span id="s2043">But the war really made her a very unhappy person and totally unfit for really living.</span> <span id="s2044">But that’s another story.</span> <span id="s2045">Anyhow, Sonia and I were in the -- together in Brooklyn College, we came together out of Jefferson.</span> <span id="s2046">She came to Jefferson a few months before I did.</span> <span id="s2047">And she was an orphan, left without any family at all.</span> <span id="s2048">And she lived in orphanages and such.</span> <span id="s2049">She had a rough life.</span> <span id="s2050">She lived in the woods with the partisans and -- anyhow, when we found ourselves in Jefferson High School with -- in Brooklyn College together, we took about the same courses.</span> <span id="s2051">We had such fun, because we had to take all the requirements, which there was more of them -- then than now.</span> <span id="s2052">Political science and we had a fantastic time.</span> <span id="s2053">But every time we went home together, we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s2054">And I had a professor, his name was Felix Gross and he taught European theory -- European political theory and I loved that.</span> <span id="s2055">I -- I was very interested in history, always and I was so -- now I was eager to find out -- you know, I was in the war and I was -- as I always keep saying, in the eye of the storm, which is how it was.</span> <span id="s2056">But my knowledge of the war was strictly on personal experience, but the wider picture was eluding me, because I really didn’t know and then I got so busy living, I didn’t have the time to find out.</span> <span id="s2057">So now I said, “I’m going to really go after the historical aspect of how the things happen.”</span> <span id="s2058">And he was teaching political -- European political history, or something like that.</span> <span id="s2059">And he had an accent, but a lot of professors had accent, because there were a lot of Jewish professors who left Europe in the 30’s and this was only the 40’s, you see?</span> <span id="s2060">Actually, this was ‘49 -- 1949.</span> <span id="s2061">So one day -- so we saw him on the subway, Sonia and I would go home and talk, you know, girl talk on the subway and talk away and talk.</span> <span id="s2062">And then I used to notice that he used to sort of look at me peculiarly, but he didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2063">He heard me in th -- I mean I -- I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s2064">So one day, I’m in another class and I get a note, Professor Gross has to see me immediately.</span> <span id="s2065">I said -- in his office, he’s waiting.</span> <span id="s2066">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2067">I absolutely didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s2068">Immediately, out of the class, I have to go to see him.</span> <span id="s2069">So I go to see him, I said, “I received your message.”</span> <span id="s2070">He says, “Yes.</span> <span id="s2071">I know that you speak Polish very well and you are going to accept a job teaching Polish at the Indiana University.”</span> <span id="s2072">I looked at him like he fell off a tree.</span> <span id="s2073">So I said, “How did you know that I speak Polish and that I speak Polish well?”</span> <span id="s2074">He says, “I hear you talk to your friends on the subway.</span> <span id="s2075">On the --.”</span> <span id="s2076">Well, I practically wanted to kill myself that minute.</span> <span id="s2077">I thought that was the end of everything.</span> <span id="s2078">My embarrassment, because you know, we were talking all this girl talk and the boy talk and he sat there and I didn’t know he knew.</span> <span id="s2079">Well, after I got over the embarrassment and I said, “I -- what do you mean?”</span> <span id="s2080">He said, “I know you can do it and I know you’re Polish, so you absolutely are the person, because they look -- they are looking for an instructor who is a native and who had a back -- good -- very good, thorough European background.</span> <span id="s2081">And you have that and you have the ability and you’re going to go.</span> <span id="s2082">And you have to go downtown Manhattan to be interviewed.”</span> <span id="s2083">It was like a ton of bricks, and I said, “Well, you know, I -- I can’t go have a job there, I -- I got into college, I want to finish college.”</span> <span id="s2084">He says, “Don’t worry, I already spoke to the -- to the head of the department that they will adapt their schedule to your hours so that you could graduate chut.”</span> <span id="s2085">I said, “I don’t -- I don’t want to put over my graduation.”</span> <span id="s2086">I said, “I have already lost so many years and now I’m finally catching up and fitting in and I wouldn’t want to leave Brooklyn College and get dragged out again for how long.”</span> <span id="s2087">He says, “No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2088">Everything will be arranged.</span> <span id="s2089">You have to go.”</span> <span id="s2090">I called my sister and Miles and I told them, “Listen, I have this offer, what do I do?</span> <span id="s2091">And he’s pira -- he’s pushing me here and I already have an appointment.”</span> <span id="s2092">I went and I met this Professor Seebeeac.</span> <span id="s2093">He was ahead of the linguistics department at Indiana University.</span> <span id="s2094">And he told me that they have now established a language center in Bloomington -- Bloomington, Indiana.</span> <span id="s2095">And they -- this is now the Cold War, you know, this is 1950.</span> <span id="s2096">It’s -- the Cold War is on.</span> <span id="s2097">They need higher military personnel.</span> <span id="s2098">H-Higher ranked military personnel behind the Iron Curtain and they have to know -- they have to be taught.</span> <span id="s2099">And so I told him the same thing, I said, “I can’t take a job, because I have to finish my studies.”</span> <span id="s2100">“Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s2101">You’ll teach three hours a day and in the summer if you want to stay, you’ll teach six hours a day.”</span> <span id="s2102">I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s2103">I said, “What about writing -- what about the textbook?”</span> <span id="s2104">He says, “We’ll write a textbook.”</span> <span id="s2105">I said, “That’s going to take m -- .”</span> <span id="s2106">“No,” he says, “don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s2107">Lo and behold, this is what happened, I went downtown, Manhattan, the old Barbizon Pla-Plaza Hotel on Central Park West -- Central Park South, I was hired and within -- with a week I was packed and he s -- waited at the railroad station for me.</span> <span id="s2108">When I came -- I came by railroad, Penn Station to -- to Bloom -- to Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s2109">He was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2110">He got me into the housing office for regist -- I was asked whether I want to live alone, or in the sorority or what -- I said, “None of that, I want to live in the -- in the dormitory because I really want to mix with people.</span> <span id="s2111">I -- I am a people pe -- person.”</span> <span id="s2112">They asked me my religion, which I was amazed about.</span> <span id="s2113">They asked me if I would mind to live with a black girl and I was practically fell through the floor, I -- how dare they ask such a stupid question.</span> <span id="s2114">I said, “No, I -- I would live with anybody.”</span> <span id="s2115">I mean, listen -- look -- look where I came from, you know?</span> <span id="s2116">I should now have prejudices yet, on top of where I come from?</span> <span id="s2117">So everything was arranged exactly as I wanted, meaning he helped me register, transfer my courses, which were applicable because it was all academics.</span> <span id="s2118">I didn’t have any bean bag courses, you know.</span> <span id="s2119">I had to -- he arranged housing.</span> <span id="s2120">I -- I lived in a dormitory.</span> <span id="s2121">He arranged courses.</span> <span id="s2122">Transfer of courses.</span> <span id="s2123">I went -- I picked the courses that would fit.</span> <span id="s2124">I taught three hours a day and one professor from the linguistics department de-de-decided to write a book.</span> <span id="s2125">And wa -- he -- I helped out with the exercises and such.</span> <span id="s2126">And who -- the people I was teaching, I had -- how many people did I have?</span> <span id="s2127">Six or eight in the class.</span> <span id="s2128">These were Air Force officers.</span> <span id="s2129">They were older than I was, of course.</span> <span id="s2130">They were fantastic people and to this day I’m very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s2131">We correspond through the years.</span> <span id="s2132">They were trained to be attaché’s and such and you know, they had to know the language.</span> <span id="s2133">We taught grammar too, but basically there was -- half of it was conversation.</span> <span id="s2134">And I had to write the conversation patterns.</span> <span id="s2135">In other words, I picked the subject.</span> <span id="s2136">And they had to follow what I had to say and tell me -- we had a real conversation.</span> <span id="s2137">In other words, I had to judge how much of what I was -- I could pick any subject.</span> <span id="s2138">I could talk about the railroads, I could talk about love, I could talk -- I never talked about camp.</span> <span id="s2139">Never, never, never.</span> <span id="s2140">This was a totally different picture now.</span> <span id="s2141">Meanwhile, before I left Brooklyn, I met Victor, my husband.</span> <span id="s2142">And while -- he was drafted into the army, because this was the Korean War -- he was drafted and meanwhile I got that offer.</span> <span id="s2143">And so, when I was in Indiana, he was in the army.</span> <span id="s2144">And so he would come and visit me in Indiana.</span> <span id="s2145">And that’s another very interesting story, because in those days, the dorm were not integrated.</span> <span id="s2146">So when Victor co -- used to come and visit me, he sat downstairs in the living room.</span> <span id="s2147">You know, the dorm had many rooms.</span> <span id="s2148">When I tell it to my kids -- and there was curfew, I had to be back at 12 -- they said, “You allowed yourself -- you allowed them to do it to you?”</span> <span id="s2149">What did they do to me?</span> <span id="s2150">You know, this is ancient history.</span> <span id="s2151">So Victor used to come -- he used to come in the uniform, because that was cheaper to travel as a uni -- you know, as a -- as a military.</span> <span id="s2152">He was stationed in Watertown, New York.</span> <span id="s2153">No, not far from St. Lawrence, which was by coincidence turned out year later as a school for Paul.</span> <span id="s2154">But Victor was stationed there and I was in Indiana and I would stay on.</span> <span id="s2155">We would meet.</span> <span id="s2156">If I took a trip, let’s say for Christmas, to New York, then we would meet in New York.</span> <span id="s2157">He worked in the headquarters in Watertown, New York, so he somehow managed to -- to get the time when I was there or he’d come to Indiana and we had friends in Indianapolis, from Poland.</span> <span id="s2158">So he would come to Indianapolis, I would come to Indianapolis and there -- he would stay -- we would visit with the f -- with our friends.</span> <span id="s2159">And I had a very wonderful time in Indiana.</span> <span id="s2160">That is really a very special time in my life, you know?</span> <span id="s2161">I was already academ -- I was first of all financially independent, totally.</span> <span id="s2162">Because I was paid.</span> <span id="s2163">The courses I took, I did not have to pay the regular big fee, because instructors always had a discount.</span> <span id="s2164">I was earning enough to be truly independent, fully and enjoy and loving it.</span> <span id="s2165">Loving the job, loving the company, loving the dormitory, loving the class, loving everything, including Bloomington, because New York I thought was Europe.</span> <span id="s2166">You know, it was like Professor Gross used to say, “New York is the last city -- when you come from Europe to America, New York is the last European city.</span> <span id="s2167">After that is America.”</span> <span id="s2168">He used to say that.</span> <span id="s2169">And I found it very true.</span> <span id="s2170">So when I came to Bloomington and that was the midwest.</span> <span id="s2171">And believe me, that was a different kind of place, too.</span> <span id="s2172">As I told you, I was asked to fill in my religion when I registered and I was asked whether I would room with a black girl, with a Negro girl.</span> <span id="s2173">So you could see those were different times.</span> <span id="s2174">And -- however, this -- the -- the -- the whole ambiance of the place -- I took the courses I loved and by the way, I took -- I ma -- I majored in social work.</span> <span id="s2175">So my degree from Bloomington, from Indiana University is in social work.</span> <span id="s2176">Even though I was an instructor at the same time.</span> <span id="s2177">And I met many wonderful friends, of course, again to this day.</span> <span id="s2178">I keep on with everybody from -- you -- as I call my connection, my Indiana connection or my Berlin connection, you know, my Jefferson connection, my Indiana connection.</span> <span id="s2179">I have a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s2180">And it was a very exciting time, because I finally -- I think it equalized for me, you know.</span> <span id="s2181">My academic, my emotional, my physical, my all, it all came together, finally, you know?</span> <span id="s2182">And I was beginning to feel very much at ease in America.</span> <span id="s2183">I knew English very well, I’ve done a lot of good things.</span> <span id="s2184">And I’ve traveled to Canada to visit my sister a lot and I was very attached to the Lehrman’s, you know.</span> <span id="s2185">Very -- I mean, we’re such a close family, knock wood, to this day.</span> <span id="s2186">I mean , we’re just one.</span> <span id="s2187">And the kids -- our kids are now their kids and -- and our kid’s kid’s and all the cousins, that’s just one, to this day.</span> <span id="s2188">But Indiana was fantastic, it was rewarding, emotionally.</span> <span id="s2189">It was rewarding intellectually.</span> <span id="s2190">It was most rewarding as a final -- it’s a trite word, Americanization -- but I was taken in to -- to what this life was.</span> <span id="s2191">In other words, now -- not that I was done with Europe.</span> <span id="s2192">You know, I can’t be done with Europe, is like I can’t be done with my right hand, you know.</span> <span id="s2193">But I finally got into the spirit of the country and of -- oh, I got involved and -- and -- and I already had my ideas of politics and all this.</span> <span id="s2194">It really, absolutely coalesced.</span> <span id="s2195">It really got together.</span> <span id="s2196">It -- it -- it formed into a -- a unit.</span> <span id="s2197">And so that when Victor -- we were planning to get married, we got engaged, meanwhile.</span> <span id="s2198">And when Victor was discharged from the army in January of ‘53, I was supposed to graduate in February, you know.</span> <span id="s2199">In those days they graduated classes twice a year, February and June.</span> <span id="s2200">I was slated to graduate in February.</span> <span id="s2201">So, Victor came for my graduation, I have lovely pictures from that time and all the girls friends that I had there.</span> <span id="s2202">And we came back to New York and we got married in March of the same year.</span> <span id="s2203">Because he was now free, too.</span> <span id="s2204">He was free of the mel -- military.</span> <span id="s2205">He certainly didn’t want to be a military man, but he had to.</span> <span id="s2206">He was drafted, so he had to serve -- serve his time.</span> <span id="s2207">And so we -- we got married and I didn’t quite know whether I wanted to go into social work any more.</span> <span id="s2208">You know, I went -- I applied to Columbia for social work degree, PhD.</span> <span id="s2209">But just about that time, things began to be a little different -- or maybe it was different, New York was different from Indiana.</span> <span id="s2210">Over there, everything -- social work was still like -- they used to call it welfare, you know.</span> <span id="s2211">Welfare was very shameful.</span> <span id="s2212">I remember one day in the class -- I used to atte -- I used to -- I had cases, casework outside of my class.</span> <span id="s2213">I had field work to do.</span> <span id="s2214">I had two cases.</span> <span id="s2215">One was an old lady, was called Mrs. Wheeler.</span> <span id="s2216">And another case was a abandoned someb -- child or something like that.</span> <span id="s2217">Anyhow, while they were discussing cases and I made a mistake and I said when I -- that Mrs. Wheeler -- I was stopped by the professor right then and there.</span> <span id="s2218">She said, “Never, ever, ever, ever must you mention the client by name.</span> <span id="s2219">Never.</span> <span id="s2220">Because this is very shameful to her to receive welfare.</span> <span id="s2221">That if you discuss cases, you have to keep on the professional level, without reference to name.”</span> <span id="s2222">I -- that was the -- th-the philosophy of welfare in those days was that you can -- you are to help the person to help himself, but nothing -- not -- not to -- to provide for him for a lifetime.</span> <span id="s2223">I came to America and I went to Columbia to apply.</span> <span id="s2224">I came to America -- I came to New York and I went to apply to Columbia and they started b-briefing me on how the school is oriented and I said, “It’s not for me.”</span> <span id="s2225">This is a handout.</span> <span id="s2226">This is against my own principles, forget what I was taught at Indiana.</span> <span id="s2227">You know, this -- I remember Mitchell Ginsburg, I think was the name of the head of th-the social work school.</span> <span id="s2228">I told acur, “I don’t think I belong there.</span> <span id="s2229">I don’t think I’ll be happy there.</span> <span id="s2230">I can’t see running programs to -- to -- to make people di -- di -- to -- to -- to live on handouts.”</span> <span id="s2231">I mean, you know, I was poor enough in -- that we -- we didn’t know where the next meal was coming cru -- from, if ever the meal will come from.</span> <span id="s2232">And all the so-called schnoring, you know?</span> <span id="s2233">It wasn’t pit -- it wasn’t shameful to -- to schnor for bread when you were starving.</span> <span id="s2234">It was pitiful.</span> <span id="s2235">And I would now work for an agency that’s going to sa -- to -- to -- to -- to supply all the schnorer’s of the world?</span> <span id="s2236">Not for me.</span> <span id="s2237">I decided I’ll wait a few years.</span> <span id="s2238">I wouldn’t go back to -- right away to social work.</span> <span id="s2239">Then they offered me jobs at the UN, I didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s2240">I really wanted -- really -- I was most interested in setting up a life -- a married life, you see?</span> <span id="s2241">I was so knocked around with so many places and so many people.</span> <span id="s2242">You know, after the Lehrman’s moved to New -- to Vineland, I lived with three families before I went to Indiana.</span> <span id="s2243">I lived with one family and then I moved to a girl’s club.</span> <span id="s2244">And that wasn’t very good for me either, because there was too much commotion, I couldn’t study.</span> <span id="s2245">Then I moved with a -- another Jewish family from Poland that I knew, so that was okay.</span> <span id="s2246">And then I moved to Indiana and I didn’t yet have, you know -- like when I lived with the Lehrman’s, sure that was home, but it still wasn’t what I really wanted -- to have a place of my own and to -- being self-supporting and doing -- being productive in a way that the life prepared me for.</span> <span id="s2247">What was the use of all that education and everything, if I were not going to apply it to a normal life that would finally go back to what I understand life to be, which is now a very old-fashioned concept, you know.</span> <span id="s2248">But to me, that was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s2251">This it tape number four, side B. C-Could you maybe elaborate just a little bit more on the difficulty you had with the concept of welfare or social work that you encountered at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2253">Well, you see, having been orphaned during the war, I had one idea in mind.</span> <span id="s2254">I must never be a burden to anybody.</span> <span id="s2255">Not even to my sisters.</span> <span id="s2256">They were my protectors, they were my surrogate parents, they were my everything.</span> <span id="s2257">I still was not going to be a burden.</span> <span id="s2258">And it was so ingrained into me, that when I lived with the Lehrman’s and I did the cooking and the cleaning, I was thrilled.</span> <span id="s2259">Because they were so good to me, they were supporting me, but at least I was not a schnorer.</span> <span id="s2260">You see, I was not somebody -- and later on too, whatever it was that I did -- I babysat.</span> <span id="s2261">I had a job one summer when I was in high school as a governess, 25 do-dollars a week.</span> <span id="s2262">Five weeks job, I bought myself a mouton fur coat, a warm mouton, it was a fur coat, quote unquote.</span> <span id="s2263">I had jobs in -- in summer camps as a governess, as a counselor.</span> <span id="s2264">I babysat, I -- I worked -- when I was in high school, I worked.</span> <span id="s2265">I forgot to mention that.</span> <span id="s2266">Dr. Karpen’s wife -- or maybe I did mention it, was the head of the ORT organization.</span> <span id="s2267">I got a job in ORT, in the ORT office, main office in New York.</span> <span id="s2268">23rd Street and Madison Square and I was in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2269">I used to go from high school, from Jefferson High School, on the subway an hour and a half to go to ORT to work and back, after school.</span> <span id="s2270">And I came home and I had to cook and clean and I was more than happy.</span> <span id="s2271">Because -- and then I babysat and I s -- and I did everything I could -- not that the Lehrman’s ever, ever, ever brought it up to me.</span> <span id="s2272">If Krisha got a coat, I got a coat.</span> <span id="s2273">If Krisha got -- I was -- like Mile’s said, I was going to be their charge and -- until I get married.</span> <span id="s2274">And it exactly was like that.</span> <span id="s2275">But before I was married, I already had this thing, because I was in the war and things were so hard and we were so poor and -- not poor poor, but we were so deprived of everything, that I said, when I’m finally -- when it finally happens, never will I be a burden.</span> <span id="s2276">So, to connect all this -- this is personal philosophy, that precedes anything before America, even.</span> <span id="s2277">Then I come to America and I see what the Jewish agencies do for people.</span> <span id="s2278">Put them on their feet and let them go.</span> <span id="s2279">I go to Indiana and it’s about the same idea.</span> <span id="s2280">You help people along, an old lady who is an old widow, who must never -- nobody must -- should ever know her name.</span> <span id="s2281">She’s being held by a young intern, myself, to go and find out what she needs and so on and so forth, but everything is -- not in secrecy, but it should be done with dignity, you see?</span> <span id="s2282">And then I come to New York and I bump against this new concept, that they are explaining to me what this school idea is, of -- of educating social workers and how I’m going to fit into it.</span> <span id="s2283">And I see I am not going to fit into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: What was it, though?</span> <span id="s2285">What was the concept?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: The concept was -- you see, we are now talking about the mid -- th-the 50’s, you see?</span> <span id="s2287">That there are too many poor people in this wor -- the America and they should be put -- they should be given things.</span> <span id="s2288">There’s so much goodness, because you know, America in the 30’s had the Depression.</span> <span id="s2289">During the war, America brought itself out of the Depression, after, you know with the help of Franklin Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2290">In the 50’s, this was a land of plenty.</span> <span id="s2291">There was no war, there was prosperity and yet there were very many poor people.</span> <span id="s2292">And the idea was to re-organize the society.</span> <span id="s2293">I mean in schools of social work, such as the New York school.</span> <span id="s2294">Which I later found out he was a lidding -- leading liberal, I -- this head of the school, gee whiz.</span> <span id="s2295">Well, anyhow, the idea was that now you have to provide for the poor.</span> <span id="s2296">But for me, to provide for the poor is not the way I saw social work.</span> <span id="s2297">To me, helping the poor, is a way, but not -- it was more like Indiana, you see?</span> <span id="s2298">Where everything should be kept within very dignified -- welfare was a dirty word, you know.</span> <span id="s2299">Welfare in those days was -- they say, “Oh, she was on welfare.”</span> <span id="s2300">This type of thing was derogatory.</span> <span id="s2301">In Indiana we had it pounded into our heads, you don’t use word welfare, you don’t use the client’s name.</span> <span id="s2302">You -- you keep it as dignified, so that the least people should know that this person is getting helped, which was aid to aged people and so on, you see?</span> <span id="s2303">So, to answer your question, I did not think that I was going to be very happy in this school.</span> <span id="s2304">Of course I could have applied to any other school of social work.</span> <span id="s2305">But I was really, basically interested in starting my own life, personal life.</span> <span id="s2306">I said, “Gee whiz, I already put in time for all those other things that were of importance to me.</span> <span id="s2307">I finally have the education, I finally feel myself equal to everybody else.</span> <span id="s2308">I finally caught up within my own inner self, between the emotional and the intellectual and the m -- the mature.</span> <span id="s2309">I already -- you know, because on one level I was very mature after the war was ended and on another level I was totally ignoramus and stupid, probably.</span> <span id="s2310">I was a kid and -- and it -- it just wasn’t -- it didn’t mesh yet.</span> <span id="s2311">When I came out of Indiana and -- and we got married, I really knew that I was already a person i-in my own right and it was time to really make a home for myself and -- and whatever I felt was going to be my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: What kind of home and what kind of family did you want to have, did you build?</span> <span id="s2313">Did you want to have children?</span> <span id="s2314">Did you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: Oh yes, eventually I shoulds -- definitely would want to have children, but at first I was just interested in not having another roommate.</span> <span id="s2316">Like everybody said to me, “How does it feel to be married?”</span> <span id="s2317">I says, “You know what?</span> <span id="s2318">You just live with the same roommate.</span> <span id="s2319">I -- I’ve lived with so many roommates now.</span> <span id="s2320">This is just one more roommate, so I have no problem with that.”</span> <span id="s2321">Because it’s true.</span> <span id="s2322">By that time you have no idea, since we came to America, how many roommates I had, you know?</span> <span id="s2323">So I said, “No, Victor’s just another roommate, so I don’t have a problem with that.</span> <span id="s2324">And we get along very well, we love each other.</span> <span id="s2325">So it’s great.”</span> <span id="s2326">And it was, you see?</span> <span id="s2327">And the type of home was to -- to establish -- you know, I love company and I love to see people and to -- to have people over and to visit with people.</span> <span id="s2328">Yeah, I’m very people oriented person, so this is how I visualized it and that’s more or less how we started out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Where did you start out?</span> <span id="s2330">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Well, we actually -- first we lived downtown in a hotel, for about two months, three months and then we moved up into this neighborhood in a smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s2332">Victor worked downtown and we -- we lived here, on Cabrini Boulevard.</span> <span id="s2333">On that street that faces the river, but further down.</span> <span id="s2334">And oh, we didn’t -- now -- now we really lived a good life.</span> <span id="s2335">We traveled, we went to Bermuda for sort of a honeymoon, we went on vacation.</span> <span id="s2336">We went to places, we -- of course New York, to me, you know, I was away from New York also.</span> <span id="s2337">So now it’s -- you know I -- I -- I couldn’t have enough of it.</span> <span id="s2338">Go to the museums and join this and do that and -- and it was -- we didn’t have kids yet, not for three years.</span> <span id="s2339">So life was very good.</span> <span id="s2340">Very, very good.</span> <span id="s2341">And we eventually, when I became pregnant with the first child, Victor said, “You’re not going to live in one bedroom apartment and we’re not going to wait til -- til we have to move after the baby’s born, then it’s going to be much harder than it is now.</span> <span id="s2342">And this building here was going up in those years and he says, “Why don’t we stop and take a look?”</span> <span id="s2343">So we stopped and take a look and we found this apartment, because it was just being finished.</span> <span id="s2344">You know, the building was just being ready for occupancy.</span> <span id="s2345">So we moved in, I was still pregnant and the first child was born -- not in this apartment, but you know, in the hospital and we lived here.</span> <span id="s2346">Our older son Harry.</span> <span id="s2347">And he -- he was born here when we were -- I don’t know, we moved around Thanksgiving and he was born in May, so we were about half a year here when he -- and I used to go to -- Victor’s family had the business and they had industrial -- industrial cottons and I used to go to work in the business, before the babies were born, because the children were born.</span> <span id="s2348">So I helped out in the business for the first three years.</span> <span id="s2349">It was nicer to be around Victor all the time anyhow.</span> <span id="s2350">And -- and I wasn’t going to -- I didn’t want to work at the UN.</span> <span id="s2351">And I didn’t -- certainly didn’t want to go to -- to social work, not yet, until I really saw my way clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Why not the UN?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: You know, they were dealing with all kinds of things that I really didn’t want to be -- you know, I broke away from everything, you, know?</span> <span id="s2354">From the problems of wars, of resettlements, of all -- I wanted to live an American life, you know?</span> <span id="s2355">I really wanted something, you know, like use the expression, “Been there, done that.”</span> <span id="s2356">I’ve been in Europe, I’ve done that, I’ve done all the -- I had enough, I had enough of that.</span> <span id="s2357">No UN for me, no.</span> <span id="s2358">Yo -- subsequently, you know, when I became an -- and -- a translator, they wanted me.</span> <span id="s2359">I could have had that job, because I have a lot of friends working there.</span> <span id="s2360">No, but going back to 1953, when we were married and we moved here, to Cabrini Boulevard and then we moved to this building, which is also on Cabrini, but one block up, next to the park.</span> <span id="s2361">And Harry was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: When was your second child born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: The second child, Paul, was born in -- four years later.</span> <span id="s2364">So that in the first four years, I actually had a little hard time the first two years.</span> <span id="s2365">I was so conscientious about everything, I didn’t think I was doing a good job with the baby.</span> <span id="s2366">I read a lot about -- I read about Dr. Spock in yesterday’s paper, you know he died?</span> <span id="s2367">So I read a lot Dr. Spock and he put me at ease, because I didn’t have family here, you see, and Victor’s family wasn’t in town either, they moved out.</span> <span id="s2368">So, I was very -- I wasn’t -- I wasn’t well, physically.</span> <span id="s2369">I had a hard -- hard childbirth and so on.</span> <span id="s2370">But once I got over that, everything was fine and I started taking courses.</span> <span id="s2371">You know, school and me, that’s one.</span> <span id="s2372">I took -- first I took courses in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2373">I studied Russian.</span> <span id="s2374">Was a Mrs. Cherniak, she was a -- a retired teacher, Russian teacher, so we got together in group again, like in Poland during the war, there were four of us, we’re studying with Mrs. Cherniak.</span> <span id="s2375">Then I went to the new school to continue the studies, the Russian studies.</span> <span id="s2376">And of course we started having more friends and more going out and more, you know, a young couple.</span> <span id="s2377">But after Harry was born, I started really more con-concentrating more on the -- on the personal fulfillment type of thing, you know.</span> <span id="s2378">So I started taking courses.</span> <span id="s2379">I went to Barnard.</span> <span id="s2380">Then I took French cooking lessons.</span> <span id="s2381">Then I did, you know, I took translation courses and all these and of course I would not leave the children to anybody, so I decided, until the children are talk -- older, I am not doing anything except bringing up children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Did you have any particular ideas about how you wanted to bring these children up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2384">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2385">Had -- I had -- didn’t have much to do with my war time experiences.</span> <span id="s2386">Basically, I wanted them to feel happy, that -- every mother wants that.</span> <span id="s2387">I wanted them to ex-excel in school, which they did.</span> <span id="s2388">By the way, I did a lot of volunteer work while the kids were in school.</span> <span id="s2389">They went to an public school, P.S. 187, which is next door to us here.</span> <span id="s2390">I was -- 11 -- for 11 years I was a head librarian, volunteer librarian.</span> <span id="s2391">And then in Bronx High School of Science, when they both went to Bronx High School of Science, I was also very active.</span> <span id="s2392">I was vice-president -- I never wanted presidency, not here, not at -- nobody was going to get me to be president, nobody.</span> <span id="s2393">And they tried.</span> <span id="s2394">Vice-president and chairman of the executive board at Bronx High School of Science.</span> <span id="s2395">And we did a lot of good things there.</span> <span id="s2396">During the teacher’s strike, you know, that protected the school from being reorganized, but this is all academic stuff that is very important, but I don’t think it -- that it’s very pertinent here.</span> <span id="s2397">The point is that while the kids were growing up and we were very involved in the community, Victor was committee chairman for the Boy Scouts, both boys became Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s2398">Both are Eagle Scouts, by the way.</span> <span id="s2399">Both Harry and Paul are Eagle Scouts.</span> <span id="s2400">Harry, to this day is scoutmaster, every day.</span> <span id="s2401">That’s how he comes here on Fridays, because he has a troop Boy Scouts here.</span> <span id="s2402">Well, anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Is -- is your husband a Jewish American, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Oh, absolutely, Jewish American, yes.</span> <span id="s2405">His family originally came from Austro-Hungary, but his father was already born in this country, so you know that he’s third generation.</span> <span id="s2406">His grandfather came to America in the 19th century, when he was a young man, I mean teenager, I think.</span> <span id="s2407">And his mother’s side, he has a grandmother who is buried on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2408">As I told you, we go to cemeteries there.</span> <span id="s2409">She was buried in 1886 in Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2410">She was buried in ‘86, you see?</span> <span id="s2411">So they go way back -- way, way back.</span> <span id="s2412">But -- no, w-we always were very compatible, no question about that.</span> <span id="s2413">And he’s Jewish and he’s also of the -- not of the religious, which was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: That was another question I had, you grew up in a very -- in a secular Jewish household and that is still true for your own --</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Yes, we belong to the Reform Temple here.</span> <span id="s2416">Our children were Bar Mitzvah and all this and we -- we are still very good members of the Temple, we su -- we support the Temple financially, always, always.</span> <span id="s2417">We go to -- we go to services dirs -- definitely on the high holidays.</span> <span id="s2418">And Passover is very important.</span> <span id="s2419">By the way, Passover is our community dinner again.</span> <span id="s2420">We have the whole family get together.</span> <span id="s2421">We have always the Lehrman’s, everybody, all the kids and the grandkids and everybody, we have.</span> <span id="s2422">That’s annual.</span> <span id="s2423">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Did you ever have that desire to go to Israel, since your mother was involved --</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: Well, I was there just for a visit, as everybody else would go.</span> <span id="s2426">It’s another type of life and by the time I went there, you see, I was so swallowed up by American -- by America, by this new life.</span> <span id="s2427">I imagine I would have been swallowed up in Israel too, because I was ready, you know.</span> <span id="s2428">I -- I couldn’t wait to start normal living.</span> <span id="s2429">You see, I -- normal -- whatever I call normal.</span> <span id="s2430">To -- first of all, to be plugged into academics.</span> <span id="s2431">And then to -- to do the things that stimulate the brain and the -- you know, that -- and the thing is that -- when I came to Israel, well, we already had grown children and I was already an American in more ways than one and I have a lot of friends there, we visited all the friends.</span> <span id="s2432">Of course we went to Israel to visit Israel, which we did, too.</span> <span id="s2433">But then I -- they were so smart, one friend says to me, “I didn’t want you to have dinner in everybody’s house every night, so that you wouldn’t see Israel, so I invite --”, she invited everybody.</span> <span id="s2434">So I saw ev -- all the friends from camp and such, all at one time and we traveled in Israel and saw a lot and was -- but I couldn’t see my life away from this life any more, you see?</span> <span id="s2435">I -- I’m really -- this is really -- this life is what I really want and what I -- you know, as -- when the kids grew up, kids went to college, you know, both went to college and Harry’s a lawyer now, he went to law school and he’s married and has two children, one is nine year old and -- Max and then a new one was just born, last December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2438">His name is Joseph.</span> <span id="s2439">Lovely.</span> <span id="s2440">And they gave him a middle name, Adrian, my sister’s -- from Canada, you know?</span> <span id="s2441">Her husband just died last summer, so they gave him a middle name.</span> <span id="s2442">And the younger son, Paul, lives in Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s2443">Remember I told you he lives in New Mexico.</span> <span id="s2444">And he had the -- a degree in geology and went into landscaping and so he has a landscaping business.</span> <span id="s2445">Real outdoorsy man.</span> <span id="s2446">He’s coming for the Pa-Passover holidays, as he always does.</span> <span id="s2447">We’ll see him a little, you know, a few times a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: If you don’t mind, I would just like to ask you a few --</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: [indecipherable] few more questions.</span> <span id="s2451">One of them would be, to what extent did you talk to your husband in the beginning about your experience?</span> <span id="s2452">Was that an -- an issue?</span> <span id="s2453">And how did -- later on, with your children, did they ask?</span> <span id="s2454">Do you -- or do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: Well, you see, with my husband, it’s like this: he married me when I -- he knew I went through the camps.</span> <span id="s2456">When I met him, not very m-much was known about all these things.</span> <span id="s2457">He knew I had a number and he knew I ca -- he knew my background.</span> <span id="s2458">He -- I told him as much as I could, but th-the -- only as a -- as a fill-in, like I wanted to find out about his family, where they came from and what they did and how they did it.</span> <span id="s2459">When the children were born, I wasn’t -- I was never -- I never wa -- intended to hide my background, never, never.</span> <span id="s2460">They -- and when I was in camp as this counselor, they said, “You know, Red,” -- they used to call me Reggie, they said, “Show me your number.</span> <span id="s2461">Why did you put your telephone number there?”</span> <span id="s2462">Th-The kids in -- in -- in camp -- in the -- this was here in the New York state, in a camp.</span> <span id="s2463">And so later, when the -- my own kids were young and they used to say, “What is this?”</span> <span id="s2464">I used to say, “That’s my telephone number,” when they were two years old.</span> <span id="s2465">But later on, of course they knew everything, but I never sa -- burdened them with, “Sit down and I’ll tell you.”</span> <span id="s2466">Never, never, never.</span> <span id="s2467">First of all, they were both smart children and very read -- they read a lot, like I do, so they always used to find out a lit -- so tell me about it.</span> <span id="s2468">Any time they were ready to tell, I told everything.</span> <span id="s2469">And Victor, too.</span> <span id="s2470">He knows my life inside out and sideways, because he’s already heard everything.</span> <span id="s2471">And you know, as time evolves, you know, eventually I became a translator and interpreter and I did all kinds of jobs.</span> <span id="s2472">And a lot of work I’m doing is really dealing now, not so much before -- I did a lot of commercial interpreting and -- and translating.</span> <span id="s2473">I’m a member of the National Association of Translators.</span> <span id="s2474">Cr -- Accredited so I get calls from all over.</span> <span id="s2475">Now I -- my husband is retired, so I don’t want to take as many jobs as -- I could, if I wanted to, because I always get calls for jobs.</span> <span id="s2476">But you see, when -- the last 10 years, the majority of -- of -- I’m a free-lancer -- of work, is -- deals with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2477">And it’s a -- you know, I did -- did you ever see a -- a -- a film or did you ever read a book called the Lódz ghetto?</span> <span id="s2478">Okay, you see my name in that, I did the interpr -- the -- the -- one third of that book came from Polish.</span> <span id="s2479">I did the -- the translations and I worked on it a year and a half, because I got, used to get the material on a -- in and out by pieces.</span> <span id="s2480">You know, they used to get the -- all the Lódz ghetto book and the film.</span> <span id="s2481">Kolchuk, a lot of Kolchuk, all of Kolchuk material I used to do way.</span> <span id="s2482">Somebody wrote a play in California, for which I did translations of Kolchuk.</span> <span id="s2483">I just translated a book about the Kraków ghetto and of course, I was given a lot of mat -- other material about the Gypsies, about -- sa -- I’m telling, the last 10 years, I do still commercial work, you know, legal work and the positions and such.</span> <span id="s2484">But somehow or other, because I know the background, you see?</span> <span id="s2485">It’s very easy for me.</span> <span id="s2486">I get phone calls, see?</span> <span id="s2487">I get -- belong to this organization, so my friends in New York call me every now and then, they have work to do, what does this mean, what does that mean?</span> <span id="s2488">To me, I don’t even have to look it up, because if it deals with the war years, I really, truly have a better understanding, because you don’t translate words, you know, you work within a framework of a -- a concept.</span> <span id="s2489">And the underlying concept, anything to do with Holocaust, not everybody, even in the language, you know language deflects very much the times and word that could mean one thing 50 years ago, couldn’t mean the same today.</span> <span id="s2490">So, what I’m trying to say is that, somehow or other, because I’m working, I always have some Holocaust material.</span> <span id="s2491">Victor is in -- one time, if I wa -- had too much work to do, I ask him to -- I -- I translate by hand, sometimes he would type the material for me, you see?</span> <span id="s2492">If it -- because I had to submit it in typing and if I was overwhelmed, he will help me out a little and sit at night, after he came from the office and he would -- he would help me type.</span> <span id="s2493">So he -- he knew what I was working on and he would read it, you see and now he du -- doesn’t, I mean I don’t do these jobs any more, because our life is too busy and he’s retired and I -- I -- I should not be tying him down to -- you know, i-if I start getting jobs, even though I’m a freelancer, that means he has to hang around, too.</span> <span id="s2494">You know, we can’t take a trip, we can’t do this, we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2495">So, this way, if it’s a short job I take it.</span> <span id="s2496">Last job I did was a book, took me a year.</span> <span id="s2497">And I told the person, I said, “I wouldn’t do it less than a year, because I -- absut -- don’t -- I mean, you want it?</span> <span id="s2498">Fine.</span> <span id="s2499">If not, that’s fine.”</span> <span id="s2500">But I did it, so was one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: What are -- what are other events in America in the 50’s, 60’s or 70’s, that were really important, that have affected you somehow?</span> <span id="s2502">There’s so much that happened.</span> <span id="s2503">[indecipherable] civil rights movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Well, I’ll tell you, the McCarthy period affected me very much, because I just couldn’t see -- anything that had to do with persecution or that had to do with hounding other people, I -- and of course I came from a much more structured political system than American democracy.</span> <span id="s2505">To me it seems a guy like McCarthy should have been kicked out the same minute.</span> <span id="s2506">But it took all that time to go through the courts and to do this [indecipherable] the other.</span> <span id="s2507">Meanwhile, people li -- people’s lives were ruined.</span> <span id="s2508">And I basically had never any love for the Communists, that, believe me, because we left Poland because -- before the Communists got there.</span> <span id="s2509">You know, when we left they weren’t yet established.</span> <span id="s2510">Poland was not yet a satellite country in the way that it became later.</span> <span id="s2511">I had no love for them, because to me this was -- this was another kind of repression, plus the fact that I did find out, through the Jews who were in Russia, or even -- I had very wonderful Christian friends, who -- who also suffered.</span> <span id="s2512">One of my very dear friends, her father was killed in Cutting.</span> <span id="s2513">You ever heard that name, of that place?</span> <span id="s2514">Yeah, Cutting is a place where the Polish officers, the Christian officers were killed in a ravine in -- in -- in, by Russians.</span> <span id="s2515">But they said the Germans did it, but it really was the Russians.</span> <span id="s2516">So -- no, when I added all this up, what I heard from the Jews who went into Russia during the war and who came out -- and through the Christians who suffered in Russia and through all those other things that the -- the Communist regime was doing, I -- I had no love for them.</span> <span id="s2517">So when I saw that McCarthy was pursuing the so-called Communists, and -- and fellow travelers --used to be called in those days, a lot of it was not factual.</span> <span id="s2518">You know, because as I understood American history, in the 30’s, there was a great liberal movement in this country, that felt for Russia, you know, that -- that -- but of course that turned out to be a whole bunch of -- bunch of lies.</span> <span id="s2519">The Russian, so-called, you know, the -- the Russian, th-the trials and the -- I mean, this was -- now you’re finding out that Stalin was as big a murderer as Hitler, you see.</span> <span id="s2520">So I already had a good inkling in the 50’s and in the 60’s and when the McCarthy came, that -- it was absolutely painful to me.</span> <span id="s2521">That was one very drastic awareness, shake-up in my head.</span> <span id="s2522">The second was the 60’s, not the Civil Right Movements, because I didn’t know the extent to which the -- the blacks were being oppressed, prior to coming.</span> <span id="s2523">I knew I was in Indiana with blacks and I was in Jefferson with and I -- it di-didn’t make any difference to me and I didn’t acc -- understand the extent of everything.</span> <span id="s2524">But you see, I did very much object to the so-called revolution, the hippie revolution in the 60 and 80, 60’s -- in the 60’s, because that was already tearing at the fabric of society, you see?</span> <span id="s2525">And I went through very hard times in -- in the 1968 school strike, when I was so involved with the school board and the -- the library and all these school things and we had factions of people who were ready to tear down the system and -- oh, a lot of energy and a lot of tribulations, I assoc-associate with that, plus the 60’s as an -- a revolt against the culture, American -- you know the hippie movement and the free love movement and the living in communes, which everything now comes out to be that it really wasn’t, you know?</span> <span id="s2526">Th-This -- this -- th-th-the flower children and all.</span> <span id="s2527">It was only a sort of a -- you know, their numbers were greater, because they’re the boom -- the boomers, the baby boomers, so they could really show force in numbers.</span> <span id="s2528">But what they stood for wasn’t very much.</span> <span id="s2529">It was something that didn’t pan out the way they expected it, which of course everybody knew from the beginning that it wasn’t going to pan out.</span> <span id="s2530">As I knew in City College had -- they had open admission and we are predicted 30 years ago, they took 30 years to come to the point, after they ruined three generations of students.</span> <span id="s2531">I predicted that open admission is going to kill the standards, the academic standards.</span> <span id="s2532">That there was no reason why children could not learn, as -- as I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s2533">Children can learn if they are motivated.</span> <span id="s2534">You don’t bring them down to a levels of -- of whatever, you take them up.</span> <span id="s2535">And now you see -- now they are to -- trying to re -- re -- in my days, Brooklyn College and City College were as good as Harvard any time.</span> <span id="s2536">You see, in high schools and everything.</span> <span id="s2537">But the -- in the 60’s, where all this movement started toward liberalization of everything, so they threw the baby with the bathwater together, out.</span> <span id="s2538">And I know what we went through here in the schools.</span> <span id="s2539">Bronx High School of Science was threatened to become a neighborhood school, not a specialized high school.</span> <span id="s2540">We were instrumental, through Albany, to take it out from under the auspices of the brook -- of the -- no, in Brooklyn, it’s a school -- school administration for the city of New York.</span> <span id="s2541">Place it under the state administration.</span> <span id="s2542">I was instrumental in it, because Senator Zaretski from Albany lived in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2543">And we had a meeting with him -- science parents and he told us we will need a sponsor a bill.</span> <span id="s2544">And we had two parents with children who went to Bronx Science.</span> <span id="s2545">It’s Hirkt and Colundra bill was put through the senate -- state senate and Science was -- five -- five specialized schools were taking out from under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education in Brooklyn and pay -- placed under the state jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s2546">And that was Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, Music and Art and Hunter.</span> <span id="s2547">We saved those schools, because that was -- they were saying this --these schools were elitist, so they don’t belong in a democratic country.</span> <span id="s2548">They belong as neighborhood schools.</span> <span id="s2549">Well, every neighborhood school, which I told you Jefferson High School -- when I tell somebody Jefferson High School, they give me a double look.</span> <span id="s2550">They say, “You couldn’t have gone to Jefferson High School.”</span> <span id="s2551">“Yes, I did.”</span> <span id="s2552">It was a fantastic school, it was on the highest level.</span> <span id="s2553">And these school, luckily, the bill was passed, we went to all the new -- attended to it.</span> <span id="s2554">And we had all these, we had very strong parent’s association in Bronx Science, so that was accomplished, but all this ties in with that movement in the 60’s, everything goes.</span> <span id="s2555">In other words, you could tear everything that you don’t think is at all valuable.</span> <span id="s2556">Of course, when you’re young, nothing is valuable, because you want to rebel.</span> <span id="s2557">You rebel against this and that and the other, but then give you 20 more years and you look back, you say, “Why’d I do that?”</span> <span id="s2558">You know?</span> <span id="s2559">And all these -- these yuppies today, called yuppies, you know?</span> <span id="s2560">When they were -- they were the yippies, when they were -- look at how many of them ended up in -- in ne -- th -- the -- the -- the -- the what do they call that?</span> <span id="s2561">Th-The -- Industrial complex?</span> <span id="s2562">What was the name?</span> <span id="s2563">Military industrial complex.</span> <span id="s2564">I mean, look how many of these went into big business, they are on top of all the big corporations and things and they left all that nonsense behind.</span> <span id="s2565">And I am sorry to say that now things are turning back, because what was -- it was really that it wasn’t any good.</span> <span id="s2566">You asked me before how I wanted to bring up my children.</span> <span id="s2567">Well, our emphasis, as you could see with my involvement with the schools, was tremendous.</span> <span id="s2568">Both of us, but -- in fact, Victor, when it started to getting very hard to get to Bronx Science at night, I was afraid alone.</span> <span id="s2569">So Victor would come from work and take me there.</span> <span id="s2570">Because you know, it’s a trip by subway.</span> <span id="s2571">So they said, “What are you --.”</span> <span id="s2572">He said he would just sit there.</span> <span id="s2573">So they said -- used to meet in the library -- used to say, “Why is Victor sitting on the side?”</span> <span id="s2574">I said, “Well, because he has to ring me, I’m afraid to come in now.”</span> <span id="s2575">“No such thing.”</span> <span id="s2576">So he became treasurer.</span> <span id="s2577">They pulled him in, hook or crook.</span> <span id="s2578">They say, “We don’t care what you say, you sitting here, you going to be treasurer.”</span> <span id="s2579">So he was trea -- he was treasurer everywhere, all the time, but anyhow, Bronx Science, he said he’d just take me there and he’ll sit and he’ll read his pa -- newspapers, whatever there, on the side and they said, “No, you’re going to be treasurer.”</span> <span id="s2580">So, no, the kids were very much oriented to -- not so much to succeed as to broaden their horizon.</span> <span id="s2581">We traveled a lot with them, we -- together.</span> <span id="s2582">We did a lot of very interesting things.</span> <span id="s2583">Kids used to go to summer camp, to the Boy Scouts for a month.</span> <span id="s2584">And then we used to go traveling together.</span> <span id="s2585">Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Canada very often.</span> <span id="s2586">All the way to Indiana to re-visit my school.</span> <span id="s2587">It was very interesting and interesting trips and we wanted them to excel, very much and we wanted them -- we never pressed, you know.</span> <span id="s2588">Harry, the older one, always knew that he wanted to be a lawyer or something like that and Paul knew always he could not be a lawyer or anything that would keep him at a desk, you see?</span> <span id="s2589">He’s a very successful, lovely, lovely guy, but he’s all outdoors.</span> <span id="s2590">He cannot -- you would not put him -- he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: What is he doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: He has a landscaping business and he is very happy being outdoors, all the time.</span> <span id="s2593">He runs a business, he works on the site, with -- he plans the landscaping, you know, he draws projects and he does big -- you know, big jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: What does your other son [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: That’s Paul.</span> <span id="s2596">No, Harry is a lawyer and he’s married to Cheryl and she’s -- she works in New York for the arts.</span> <span id="s2597">Used to work for 10 years to the -- she was director of development for New York City ballet and now she works for the 42nd Street Development Corporation.</span> <span id="s2598">You know, the people who are the -- who are developing -- you know the Ford Theater and the New Victory Theater, that’s -- that’s the arts that she’s working for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: This is a coninti -- this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s2601">This tape -- this is tape number five, side A.</span> <span id="s2602">When -- when you think back about your life after liberation, is there anything in particular that we haven’t mentioned yet, that was very important to you or to your family that -- that we should simply mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Well, I think I did elaborate on the fact that certain lessons learned, through the bare experiences, benefited me in a certain way.</span> <span id="s2604">Number one is the importance of family.</span> <span id="s2605">We are -- we were, the three of us, the three sisters, were extremely close.</span> <span id="s2606">Each one of us married, we were extremely close as six people.</span> <span id="s2607">Each one of us has children and grandchildren and we are extremely close.</span> <span id="s2608">This is no exaggeration, even though my oldest sister has been living in Canada.</span> <span id="s2609">They could not make it to America, you know, because by then the quota was closed or whatever, by the time they came.</span> <span id="s2610">So they went to Canada, sponsored by my uncle, who lived there then.</span> <span id="s2611">And the importance of family, of being there, of being there for those whom you love and who love you.</span> <span id="s2612">This is the sum and substance of what I took out of my bad experiences.</span> <span id="s2613">The reason being, that my parents were torn away from me, as was my extended family.</span> <span id="s2614">Torn away in a way that you don’t even have a grave to go to, you see?</span> <span id="s2615">Therefore, the idea of the family unit, which, as I’m getting older, I find even more important, because society is changing so quickly.</span> <span id="s2616">People are scattered.</span> <span id="s2617">In the old days, there was always a -- a nucleus and a f -- and a -- an extended family within one geographic area.</span> <span id="s2618">Now, even in our own case -- you see Paul, our youngest son, lives in Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s2619">Of course, we see each other two or three times a year, he comes to every important ceremony or celebration.</span> <span id="s2620">A bris and the Passover Seder always and unfortunately last summer, we lost my brother-in-law, he went to -- came to the funeral.</span> <span id="s2621">And other than that, he comes to New York too and we’re on the phone five to seven days a week.</span> <span id="s2622">I mean, we have to find out where the weather is like and such.</span> <span id="s2623">That is the most important thing of all.</span> <span id="s2624">And as I say, it is being reinforced as I see the culture in America changing.</span> <span id="s2625">And the people getting alienated and scattered.</span> <span id="s2626">So, for that, I am grateful that I was able to achieve that.</span> <span id="s2627">That was really my number one thing op -- uppermost -- to create a family and to stay within that unit.</span> <span id="s2628">I have achieved that.</span> <span id="s2629">I have always been extremely attached to academics, as I said.</span> <span id="s2630">And I was forever grateful that I could get my education -- higher education here.</span> <span id="s2631">To the extent to which an education opens your eyes on things that you could do on your own.</span> <span id="s2632">I didn’t have -- I was going to get the -- more degrees, but it -- it didn’t turn out with degrees, but it turned out just the same that through the years, I was either involved in courses, or I was giving courses, or I was engaged one way or another with the schools or whichever.</span> <span id="s2633">Very grateful for the fact that I could accomplish that, so that I could develop my mind and now at my age, have all the resources.</span> <span id="s2634">If I’m interested in this, I know how to find it, I know where to look for it, I know what I like, I know which museum exhibit I will go to and which I don’t.</span> <span id="s2635">I don’t go to the movies just because it’s playing.</span> <span id="s2636">I know what I want and I wa -- that I don’t want.</span> <span id="s2637">I read the same way, selectively, always selectively -- so that I’m very grateful for that.</span> <span id="s2638">And other than that, you know, I feel for the world that is suffering.</span> <span id="s2639">The way things have not -- have not really come to a conclusion after the Holocaust on -- in the larger sense.</span> <span id="s2640">It’s still the same thing is going on.</span> <span id="s2641">Not to the same extent, but -- you read the papers and there’s Ireland and there’s Bosnia and now you have Kosovo and you have -- so one way or another, I don’t think that this -- in my lifetime, that I have seen a resolution of that bigger problem, which is humankind.</span> <span id="s2642">Of course, nothing would ever -- I can’t imagine a thing would ever compare to the genocide done by the Nazis to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2643">That, I think, is in a category all it’s own.</span> <span id="s2644">And much as people are trying to use the word Holocaust, which is now -- I -- I noticed this in the papers, the Times writes about it a lot, that the people are acquiring the Holoc -- the Japanese Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2645">This is totally without comparison.</span> <span id="s2646">No experience -- no experience compares to the Hol -- Jewish Holocaust -- the European Jewish Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2647">Not in history as I know history and not the present time in anywhere, does that compare.</span> <span id="s2648">The systematic, technological destruction of people, with a plan, that is a separate -- totally separate event.</span> <span id="s2649">As events in history go, that must always stand on it’s own.</span> <span id="s2650">And I -- I feel for other people, I sympathize with the Japanese, but I know what Holocaust is.</span> <span id="s2651">I’ve been there, I’ve lived through it.</span> <span id="s2652">I lost most of my family there and I can tell you that nothing ever -- nothing ever happened to compare.</span> <span id="s2653">And I hope it will never happen, which we don’t know, because technology now is even more advanced than it was in Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s2654">He could gas and -- and -- and -- and burn them in the chimneys.</span> <span id="s2655">Today, maybe they cou -- they could just nuke them, if they wanted to.</span> <span id="s2656">You know, you could throw one bomb and th-the -- nuke the whole world.</span> <span id="s2657">But this is -- those are the things that -- in the larger scale about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2658">But on the personals -- on the person -- coming down again to the specific from the general, I can tell you I consider myself extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s2659">I survived, not because I really was clever or smart or anything.</span> <span id="s2660">It just -- just -- that was that chance.</span> <span id="s2661">I married Victor, who’s a wonderful, wonderful husband and a wonderful father and we had a -- had a very peaceful, wonderful life.</span> <span id="s2662">I probably could never go through life again with any upheavals of any kind.</span> <span id="s2663">We are both sort of, we’re -- you know, we like quiet and solitude -- not solitude, but we don’t like the excitement.</span> <span id="s2664">I mean I -- when we were younger, we’d -- we did a little more, but absolutely I -- I -- I’m very grateful that -- that we are -- you know, we’re married 45 years now and we’ve gotten along very well and the kids are very attached to us, we’re very attached to the kids and our grandchildren and everything and -- you asked me about how much I told the children.</span> <span id="s2665">I mean now they’re grown men and I talk freely.</span> <span id="s2666">I gave them the cop-copy of my show and everything.</span> <span id="s2667">So I told them, look at the tape and ask me, ask me.</span> <span id="s2668">Really, ask me what you want.</span> <span id="s2669">Because now they know history and they know everything.</span> <span id="s2670">They ask me and we talk like -- as I do with you now and Max, too.</span> <span id="s2671">Max is our little nine year old grandson, Harry’s and Cheryl’s boy.</span> <span id="s2672">And I -- I tell him, I say, “You know why I have this number?</span> <span id="s2673">Because I was -- you know, I was in a concentration camp during the war, you know, when -- when I was in Europe.”</span> <span id="s2674">“Oh, yes, I know all about it.”</span> <span id="s2675">I said, “Well, any time you want to know more about that, you ask me and I’ll tell you.”</span> <span id="s2676">In other words, I always leave the door open, you see.</span> <span id="s2677">Th-The kids, they know everything, because I am very free to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2678">I don’t cry, I don’t break down, in the sense as other people get terribly emotionally disturbed.</span> <span id="s2679">That was a part of my life and as I think I told you before, I was so lucky to come here and to be a young girl in America, you know?</span> <span id="s2680">I was just so lucky.</span> <span id="s2681">And -- and a lot of people who came, who weren’t that much older, maybe 10 years older, they already had to go to work and they already had to struggle, they could never go back to school, you see?</span> <span id="s2682">Or maybe they came with a child and it was dif -- I came a young girl, like a -- like a young horse, you know, ready to get out of the stable and run.</span> <span id="s2683">I was just like that, you know?</span> <span id="s2684">I was like an eager beaver, I was willing and ready and everything was a lovely, nicest experience.</span> <span id="s2685">Even if it wasn’t so nice, I thought was great.</span> <span id="s2686">Everything I did.</span> <span id="s2687">Everything -- every summer camp, every baby-sitting, every this and that on the other, everything was wonderful, cause was a new experience, you see?</span> <span id="s2688">And it really took me away from -- not that it took me away, it was something I didn’t yet experience, you know?</span> <span id="s2689">I came here, I hadn’t lived yet, so everything that I lived was great.</span> <span id="s2690">And it -- in true fashion, it -- it really was.</span> <span id="s2691">I mean it was not an exaggeration because all these things that happened to me, everything was sort of by chance, people -- you know, I got a job to support myself by working in the ORT.</span> <span id="s2692">I didn’t look for it, they looked for it.</span> <span id="s2693">I got a job to teach in Indiana, I didn’t look for that.</span> <span id="s2694">You know, you know, you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s2695">Every time I do something th -- I was asked to do it or something and it turned out a fantastic experience, so that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Did you ever go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: Yes, I went back w -- twice.</span> <span id="s2698">Once with Victor, to show him around and -- by which time, I wasn’t so eager any more to go the route of -- of nostalgia or anything.</span> <span id="s2699">I -- I’m very much interested -- I love Ch-Chopin, Frederick Chopin’s music and I did some interpret -- translating for Chopin biographies.</span> <span id="s2700">So we traveled the Chopin route, that was one aspect.</span> <span id="s2701">We went wherever he was born -- where he was born, where he live, where the concerts were and so on.</span> <span id="s2702">That was one route.</span> <span id="s2703">The second was to go to my hometown and visit with the old friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s2704">And then we went to Auschwitz, of course.</span> <span id="s2705">We went to visit the camps, Shellneetsa and Mioufka.</span> <span id="s2706">Mioufka does not exist, they’re housing projects now.</span> <span id="s2707">And Shellneetsa is back to the firing range.</span> <span id="s2708">They still -- now they put it back into a firing range.</span> <span id="s2709">That was a very touching experience, going through my hometown with Victor.</span> <span id="s2710">But you see, I was already with Victor, so that was an -- I was already in another frame of mind.</span> <span id="s2711">Then, of course, we went to Auschwitz and while there, w-we also went to Vialeetchka, which is a salt mine.</span> <span id="s2712">They said all the salt mine in Europe and they take you down on a tour.</span> <span id="s2713">From the 11th century, all the way below, and I -- so I -- there was a combination and we went to Zarchoparna to visit the reserve.</span> <span id="s2714">In other words, it wasn’t all Auschwitz, you see?</span> <span id="s2715">It wasn’t -- it wasn’t all Auschwitz and it wasn’t all Shellneetsa.</span> <span id="s2716">Sure, we went to Shellneetsa, th-the -- the -- the taxi driver that took us there and we got there, it was after a rain, was such big potholes and he was driving into the camp and I said, “Don’t go, you’re going to ruin your taxi.”</span> <span id="s2717">He says, “No, no, you told me there was a camp here,” Polish taxi driver, “I’m going to take you in there.”</span> <span id="s2718">I said, “I don’t want to be responsible for a broken taxi.”</span> <span id="s2719">He insisted, he drove in and the old friends of my family’s granddaughter, she was a young woman, 25, she took us there, we walked around.</span> <span id="s2720">There was nothing except that little brook where I remember people used to wash themselves in.</span> <span id="s2721">And she told me, now it’s back -- Shellneetsa is back to a shooting range.</span> <span id="s2722">And the camp -- then we went to Mioufka.</span> <span id="s2723">And absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s2724">I mean, it’s another world.</span> <span id="s2725">Modern buildings and -- and the -- the bus runs through there and so on.</span> <span id="s2726">So that’s it.</span> <span id="s2727">And the old factory was converted to trucks, they do trucks.</span> <span id="s2728">Star -- you know like Ford, Chevrolet, Star is the name, because Starachowice is the name of the town, so they named the trucks -- pickup trucks and such, that’s -- the production was -- after the Russians -- by the way, the Russians dismantled the factory and took all this to Russia.</span> <span id="s2729">And when it was rebuilt, it was rebuilt as a auto plant.</span> <span id="s2730">So they do cars, th-the trucks.</span> <span id="s2731">So that’s the -- so nothing remained of that, you see?</span> <span id="s2732">So, as they say, you can’t go home again?</span> <span id="s2733">You see, but the old ladies, they were very -- I have pictures from that trip.</span> <span id="s2734">None of them are alive any more.</span> <span id="s2735">Of course, this was in 1980.</span> <span id="s2736">So that was one trip and the second was as an interpreter for the Holocaust Memorial Museum for -- when the archives were being released, f -- actually, that was the -- the negotiations for release of the archives, so I did that and that -- I went without Victor.</span> <span id="s2737">And that was very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: I know that you started a cemetery renovation project of sorts --</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Maybe you could talk a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Okay, I’ll tell you quickly about what happened.</span> <span id="s2742">When Victor and I were in Poland in 1980, we went to visit the Pole -- the Jewish cemetery and it was in horrible condition.</span> <span id="s2743">You know, the Germans have removed a lot of tombstones and made them for a -- for sidewalks, but -- but we found -- and I have pictures to prove it, we took -- Victor took many pictures, houses were being built on the half of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s2744">Well, I came back and I made a very big to-do about that.</span> <span id="s2745">We meet once a year -- the Starachowice people, we meet in New York, as they do everywhere, for the so-called Yurtside, which is October 27, thereabouts, we meet.</span> <span id="s2746">So, the prayer is said for the dead and then we discuss.</span> <span id="s2747">So when I came back in 1980, with the pictures, I send the pictures to Israel and I said -- I gave the pictures here, in st -- and I told them, we’ve got to do something, because there is still more building going on and we will lose that one last vestige of any -- anything that shows that there was Jewish life there.</span> <span id="s2748">We must do something.</span> <span id="s2749">And -- I’m sorry to tell you, that not everybody was on the same opinion.</span> <span id="s2750">I was highly criticized.</span> <span id="s2751">I was highly criticized that I would have the nerve to say that we should pour in thousands of dollars for people who wouldn’t care one way or another out there -- that they would ruin it anyhow.</span> <span id="s2752">But there were other people who saw the problem otherwise and it took quite a number of years to get around to the fact that we could do it.</span> <span id="s2753">Those that will want to do it, should do it and not to have the naysayers negate this project.</span> <span id="s2754">I personally have nobody in that cemetery.</span> <span id="s2755">You know, w-we don’t have anybody there, however, I kept saying, “How would ever -- how would anybody ever know that there was a Jewish community, except for that piece of a cemetery?</span> <span id="s2756">Whatever is there, let us save it.</span> <span id="s2757">Let us save it.”</span> <span id="s2758">We -- so, not long ago, we got together honestly and truly, because in Israel, they found somebody who goes to Poland to restore the cemeteries.</span> <span id="s2759">First of all, I was instrumental in registering it.</span> <span id="s2760">Here, in New York, a good 15 -- 10 years ago, with a Jewish agency, that had a list of Jewish cemeteries to be protected.</span> <span id="s2761">They could not do anything about it, but just put it on a list of historic what do you call -- his-his-historic sites.</span> <span id="s2762">So, maybe eight years ago, the Polish government -- Polish government put up a sign, historic -- okay, fine, historic area, what-whatever.</span> <span id="s2763">Something was already done.</span> <span id="s2764">Then we got, as the expression goes -- got on the stick.</span> <span id="s2765">I collected money here, we made a -- you know, personal, everything personal.</span> <span id="s2766">Got on the phone, I had a list.</span> <span id="s2767">People who -- whom I knew, who already expressed their opinion and great criticism, I didn’t call.</span> <span id="s2768">I called people -- I started from myself, I told everybody I gave so many hundreds of dollars, give me what you want, I don’t mind.</span> <span id="s2769">Send me a check, it should be mailed out -- made out to such and such -- Jewish projects or such.</span> <span id="s2770">I send a few thousand dollars to Israel.</span> <span id="s2771">Canada send a few thousand dollars to Israel.</span> <span id="s2772">Israel connected a few thou -- collected a few thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s2773">Now the cemetery’s a -- protected by a very beautifully designed iron fence with a beautiful gate.</span> <span id="s2774">The sign is there, says this is to be preserved.</span> <span id="s2775">No more buildings could be built.</span> <span id="s2776">The cemetery was a terrible place to see, whatever was left.</span> <span id="s2777">Stones were overturned, garbage was thrown on it.</span> <span id="s2778">Gr -- Growth -- overgrowth of greenery.</span> <span id="s2779">First, the people who went from Israel to Poland arranged for people -- caretakers to clean it up.</span> <span id="s2780">Then, a Mr. Yarley from Israel, who is also a -- restored already a Jewish cemetery in Tomashavma Sovietski -- went to Starachowice, contacted people who are artists, this -- the tombstones were righted, the lettering was restored, the place was cleaned up.</span> <span id="s2781">Now it’s behind a beautiful fence, now we have people who will be paid monthly or y -- annually.</span> <span id="s2782">Th-The person who is going to do it is a young artist.</span> <span id="s2783">He’s a sculptor and he’s too thrilled to have this job of caretaker.</span> <span id="s2784">And there is even going to be a book put out, with pictures, which -- I just had a letter from Israel.</span> <span id="s2785">But I feel very proud of it, because the few years that we didn’t do anything, we almost lost the project and the reason was that -- part of it was that I -- I didn’t want to create bad feelings and I -- I just let it -- ya -- so, when I first brought up and I was very highly criticized.</span> <span id="s2786">They say, “I’m surprised at you Renia, that you should t-talk about it.</span> <span id="s2787">We don’t want to pour money in there.</span> <span id="s2788">They going to ruin it,” and all this stuff and I -- I -- I just couldn’t fight it, but I should have, but I didn’t, but anyhow, cooler heads prevailed and we decided to work with the people who are willing and who are -- wh-who don’t look at it that way.</span> <span id="s2789">Now, we have a beautifully restored cemetery, it’s registered with the Polish government, it’s registered in the -- in America, which I did with another lady, in New York, when we registered with this Rabbi Hyatt was his name, when the project was first started, we were very lucky to get in our name on that list.</span> <span id="s2790">I don’t mean my name, but the -- the community’s cemetery.</span> <span id="s2791">I’m very proud of that accomplishment because as I said, having lost my parents in -- and family in a way that I never knew how they perished or where they perished, that little bit of the Jewish life that was left under that soil, should really be honored and preserved and I don’t care if it takes money or if -- whatever.</span> <span id="s2792">If they ruin it, let’s pay again an-an-and keep it up.</span> <span id="s2793">Of course now it would not -- there will be no more buildings.</span> <span id="s2794">That’s for sure because you can’t press on the -- on -- on the -- on the iron gates.</span> <span id="s2795">And the design was approved, who had approved it here, architectural designs.</span> <span id="s2796">So it’s really worth -- it -- I -- it makes me feel so good and you know, I had the money in no time.</span> <span id="s2797">As soon as I called up, everybody says, “Yes, of course.”</span> <span id="s2798">I -- I think I send two -- I send the check twice, the first phone calls, I had one envelope with checks and then the second envelope.</span> <span id="s2799">And before I know -- I mean it was o -- it was nothing.</span> <span id="s2800">Of course I knew whom I should call and whom I shouldn’t call and likewise in Israel.</span> <span id="s2801">So there are people that -- that -- my friend in Israel wrote me, one of them got up and made an awful row about how dare you.</span> <span id="s2802">The same thing.</span> <span id="s2803">How dare you want money for this thing when they not going to respect it.</span> <span id="s2804">But I do know it was an important thing to do.</span> <span id="s2805">I’m very glad I got involved in it, even though I really felt that it was going to come with a fight.</span> <span id="s2806">It didn’t come with a fight, because once we eliminated the naysayers, the coast was clear.</span> <span id="s2807">And money -- it’s only money, so -- you see, this is how it turned out and I’m very pleased about it and if there is a book, I might show you someday.</span> <span id="s2808">I don’t have it, but he said -- they told me in Israel that there will be a book, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">Q: I have only one brief question left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">Q: You mentioned your -- the -- the number you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: [indecipherable] in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2814">Would you mind telling us what the number is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s2816">First, the thing I told you -- first let me give you the number.</span> <span id="s2817">The number is A and then it’s 14178.</span> <span id="s2818">As I told you when they were tattooing us, we lined up, my sisters lined up wi -- I lined up according to age.</span> <span id="s2819">So my oldest sister Hanya or Anna, her number is A14176, Kris, the middle one, has 77 and I have 14178.</span> <span id="s2820">As you could see, there is an A letter preceding the number and a lot of people ask me, “Why is there a letter?”</span> <span id="s2821">Th-th -- you see, they ran out of numbers and they had to start a second -- in Auschwitz., they start a s -- what do you call it -- d -- a -- s-s-s -- a serial, an second serial and this is -- this is why there’s A.</span> <span id="s2822">You know, there was a number like this before, 14178, but the A is -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2823">And also, you know, it’s very easy now to tell, that this is from the later numbers.</span> <span id="s2824">You see, as I told you, we came to Auschwitz when the Russian offensive was nearing, meaning it was already late in the war.</span> <span id="s2825">So now -- and anybody who is knowledgeable, when they see A, they know -- they can place me, so to say.</span> <span id="s2826">To know that I wasn’t there in 1942 or something like that, when the original people came, you see?</span> <span id="s2827">And as I told you, I’m never, ever ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s2828">I never want to remove it and I had an offer many times.</span> <span id="s2829">I knew a plastic surgeon.</span> <span id="s2830">In fact, when I had the job in the summer -- in a -- as a governess to a child in -- one summer, I was still in high school.</span> <span id="s2831">He thought that I would be afraid I wil -- can’t afford it, so he said, “I’ll remove your number and I won’t charge you anything.”</span> <span id="s2832">I said, “No, I have not interest.”</span> <span id="s2833">He said, “But I wouldn’t charge you.</span> <span id="s2834">You don’t need it.”</span> <span id="s2835">I said, “I don’t need it, but I -- it doesn’t bother me.”</span> <span id="s2836">Was a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s2837">I was a governess to his child in the summer.</span> <span id="s2838">I went with the wife to a hotel in the Catskills and I was, you know, I was the baby-sitter.</span> <span id="s2839">And he didn’t see why I shouldn’t remove it, but I certainly wouldn’t, I go to my grave with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say in concluding the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Well no, it’s really nice of you to have put in all this time.</span> <span id="s2842">I know it’s an -- a big effort.</span> <span id="s2843">And I don’t mind talking about my experiences and I don’t mind pointed questions either and it’s a long interview.</span> <span id="s2844">I know I’ve worn you out.</span> <span id="s2845">My voice is going, too.</span> <span id="s2846">But no -- I’m very glad to share this and to have it for posterity.</span> <span id="s2847">For whatever reason.</span> <span id="s2848">Certainly I ho -- if I have a copy, I’ll be very happy to give it to my kids, even though they do know the story pretty well by now.</span> <span id="s2849">Because in bits and pieces they found out, as they asked.</span> <span id="s2850">Again -- as they asked, you see?</span> <span id="s2851">So I really thank you.</span> <span id="s2852">That’s very nice of you.</span> <span id="s2853">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s2855">And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">End of Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Conclusion of Interview Interview with Regina Gelb</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">August 27,1998 Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</span> <span id="s2860">This is an interview with Regina Gelb, conducted by Regina Baier, on August 27th, 1998 in Mrs. Gelb’s home.</span> <span id="s2861">This is part two of a follow-up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Regina Gelb on September 30th, 1991.</span> <span id="s2862">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</span> <span id="s2863">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s2864">This interview, as I said to you before, is a little different from the one that we had last time, because it was really important to not interrupt your narrative too much.</span> <span id="s2865">We covered, really, a lot of ground and I didn’t want to intercept with too many questions.</span> <span id="s2866">This time, it will be slightly different.</span> <span id="s2867">We are trying to fill in and clarify a few aspects, and to make that easier, because it is not quite so -- such a comfortable conversational mode, really, I would like to do that in a chronological manner.</span> <span id="s2868">So let’s start with a time when you were in Berlin, in the camp for displaced persons.</span> <span id="s2869">And you wanted to -- before I ask my first question, you wanted to talk a little bit about something that we didn’t mention in the first interview, which was the situation of Berlin at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Answer: Certain-Certainly, yes.</span> <span id="s2871">Yeah, well of course you can guide the interview however you wish, because I -- I don’t mind if you stop me, if you don’t stop, if you just let the narrative go.</span> <span id="s2872">Either way you decide is fine with me.</span> <span id="s2873">Coming back to Berlin, perhaps it would be good to mention the years again, so that we have it within a certain framework.</span> <span id="s2874">I arrived in the displaced person’s camp in Berlin, in the early part of 1946, probably around March or so, in the company -- actually my sister, Kris was married to Miles Lehrman at that time and they were my guardians.</span> <span id="s2875">So the three of us arrived in Berlin, in the DP camp, which was located in the American sector.</span> <span id="s2876">Now, this is 1946, the war is over not quite a year yet.</span> <span id="s2877">And Berlin is now divided into four sectors.</span> <span id="s2878">One is the American, in which the DP camp was located.</span> <span id="s2879">One is the British, one is the French and one is the Russian.</span> <span id="s2880">Now, a lot of people do not understand the concept of a DP camp and they say, “Well,” that you were in concentration camp and with barbed wires and, “Was this another one like it?”</span> <span id="s2881">Well, obviously a DP camp was not a camp surrounded by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s2882">It was an area designated for gathering up the people who were now shifting -- the people who were moving from place to place for all kinds of reasons.</span> <span id="s2883">And it was just an area where there were barracks for people to -- to -- to -- to live in.</span> <span id="s2884">Everybody had a room in a barrack.</span> <span id="s2885">It was very, very decent.</span> <span id="s2886">There was a -- a -- a mess hall, where people went for lunch -- breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s2887">There was an area which was set aside for -- for dancing, for there wer -- they had dances.</span> <span id="s2888">And there was the school, of course to which I went.</span> <span id="s2889">That was a building separate from the others.</span> <span id="s2890">We even had our own dining room, because a lot of the children, including myself, were highly undernourished.</span> <span id="s2891">We have never yet gotten our development, fall into the -- the range of devel -- of physical development, so that we actually had better food than -- not better, but probably more substantial, including chocolate.</span> <span id="s2892">I’ll always remember that, including chocolate.</span> <span id="s2893">They had bars of chocolate for the children all the time.</span> <span id="s2894">Well anyhow, Berlin itself, the city itself, was like any other post-war city, parts of it were bombed out horribly, parts of it were not bombed.</span> <span id="s2895">And the sector -- the particular sector always reflected the occupier.</span> <span id="s2896">In other words, in the Russian sector, it was very, very difficult to be around, because we were taught -- even the kids in school, we used to go on -- on these outings and we used to go to the theater with the class and so on.</span> <span id="s2897">We were told we can go very freely to the three sectors.</span> <span id="s2898">One, the American, the British and the French, but once you go into the Russian sector, you really -- if you have to, absolutely -- and sometimes we did have to, because the -- all city -- Berlin city, that had all the theaters, was within the Russian sector, so that you really had to just mind your surroundings.</span> <span id="s2899">The Russian soldiers were always asking for IDs and such.</span> <span id="s2900">The presence of the four occupiers was very visible.</span> <span id="s2901">You could always see American soldiers, in Jeeps, on foot, in the American sector.</span> <span id="s2902">You could always see the British in uniform, all over.</span> <span id="s2903">You could always see the French, so that Berlin, which is a German city -- and it was way before it was divided into south and west, we’re now talking at the period of time when I was there, which was from about March ‘46, til the end of January or so, in 1947.</span> <span id="s2904">And the city was vibrant, but it was first really emerging from the horror of war, which you could see.</span> <span id="s2905">I have pictures, as I mentioned before, where the -- the famous church on Coffersendam is all in rubble and I’m standing in front of it and I have a picture with it.</span> <span id="s2906">So that was the -- that was the reality of Berlin.</span> <span id="s2907">It was not what you would call a German city, as such, because German presence was -- if at all -- little visible to the naked eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: Did you have any particular feelings about the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Well.</span> <span id="s2910">I was thrilled, I was absolutely thrilled, because you know, to me -- I did not know American history, but I just learned, during the war, that America was this great, fantastic country and President Roosevelt was God.</span> <span id="s2911">And that -- that is all I knew at -- at that time.</span> <span id="s2912">And of course seeing Americans in uniform was so reassuring.</span> <span id="s2913">Having seen German uniforms around me for the duration of the war and fearing a uniform, even when I saw it from 10 blocks away, shaking in my sh -- boots, this feeling now, of -- of seeing these friendly Americans, you know, they were sort of a little boisterous and they were smiling.</span> <span id="s2914">And -- and you know, the idea of just passing somebody in the street and somebody smiling to you, didn’t say anything to him, he didn’t say anything to you, they just passes you by and he smiles.</span> <span id="s2915">Well, that was a -- that was a sort of a healing kind of a fee-feeling.</span> <span id="s2916">You know, I -- I’ll be talking in rhymes, soon.</span> <span id="s2917">The fact that my idea of the uniform, don’t forget I was still a young girl, my idea of the uniform was always connected with fear, always connected with fear.</span> <span id="s2918">I thought that I would probably go to my grave, sh-shaking over a military person, which of course is not the case, I mean, because you know, once you get over the original fear.</span> <span id="s2919">So, to answer your question, yes, I was absolutely thrilled to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: Among the American soldiers were also black soldiers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">Q: -- [indecipherable] the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">A: Yes, I’ll tell you, as a matter of fact, you know, I have never seen black people before in my life, because Poland was basically a white country and of course, predominantly Catholic.</span> <span id="s2924">And then, being in camps and so on, I -- I’ve -- I’ve met people -- Europeans, only.</span> <span id="s2925">Whether they were Greek or Italian, whoever, but I have never seen a -- a black person until I was in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s2926">And my first black person was a American soldier.</span> <span id="s2927">And I was absolutely fascinated, because he again had that smiley face, you see, he again, like the others, you know?</span> <span id="s2928">He didn’t know me, I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s2929">I just saw this -- this man, this black man in a -- in a American uniform, with a big smile.</span> <span id="s2930">And of course that -- that was totally disarming and I -- I always remember that, because when I came to America, of course, then I realized that this a multi-cultural country and multi-racial and certainly not the kind of background that I came with, where it was predominantly Catholic and a min-minority being Jewish, so that it didn’t compare and that was another sort of eye opening experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: And then eventually -- eventually you left for Bremenhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: And the question would be, why did you go and how did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: All right.</span> <span id="s2935">Well, as I told you, we -- I -- Miles Lehrman and Kris Lehrman were my guardians.</span> <span id="s2936">Miles had a -- I think I mentioned it in the other tapes, but I’ll repeat it just to give it context.</span> <span id="s2937">He had an old aunt living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s2938">She sent out papers for him, but wherever he went, his wife went and then I went.</span> <span id="s2939">As I was saying, I was the fifth wheel, but they didn’t think so.</span> <span id="s2940">But, in any case, he received papers to go to America for the three of us.</span> <span id="s2941">Now, in those days, because we were registered in the DP camp, we were sent to an American agency in Berlin, which was in the American sector.</span> <span id="s2942">Whether it was a consulate or the embassy, I couldn’t tell, but I do know that we were fingerprinted there.</span> <span id="s2943">That we were f-fully registered, our visas were processed.</span> <span id="s2944">In other words, our papers were completed at that spot.</span> <span id="s2945">From there we were given a date when we should go to Bremenhaven, where we are going to meet a ship, which is going to take us to America.</span> <span id="s2946">So, we left Berlin for Bremenhaven, and I think we stayed in Bremenhaven two to three days, because the ships that were taking the refugees to America were converted military transport ships.</span> <span id="s2947">And our ship was called Marine Perch and I couldn’t tell you the exact date when we boarded the ship, but we did arrive in New York Harbor on February 11th, 1947.</span> <span id="s2948">And, I might add something that’s -- that might be interesting.</span> <span id="s2949">A lot of people ask me, “Oh, so you went to Ellis Island?”</span> <span id="s2950">Well, I didn’t go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s2951">Even though Ellis Island was still functioning as a whatever you call it, transfer point or whatever, we were processed -- our papers were processed fully in Germany -- in Berlin, I mean, within the American embassy, let’s say, or wit -- or consulate.</span> <span id="s2952">So that when we arrived in New York and these old folks were there, this old aunt, she was I think in her late 80’s with this old husband and they were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s2953">We just presented our processed papers and we got off the boat and there we were in a taxi, going to the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s2954">So, we have never been to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s2955">And I think that -- that might be of interest, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">Q: Let me ask you just -- before we move on to the next part of your life, one quick follow-up question, you mentioned fingerprinting --</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: -- during your processing.</span> <span id="s2959">Which is sort of another way of -- of counting people in a sort of somewhat mechanized way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: Was that -- did -- did that have a different impact on you than others that you had experienced before, or was that slightly scary to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: Quite the opposite.</span> <span id="s2963">You know, having been tattooed with a number, in -- in Auschwitz, this fingerprinting was like somebody was opening the gate for me.</span> <span id="s2964">Because I knew that they are making sure that I will be secure, you see?</span> <span id="s2965">However I -- that I -- however I explain that, it absolutely had the utmost wonderful connotation.</span> <span id="s2966">It had nothing to do with fear, it had everything to do with a sigh of relief.</span> <span id="s2967">Finally, they will know exactly who I am, because they did, you know, when I looked at my -- the -- that card, the ship card which I -- well, that I still have.</span> <span id="s2968">They have my height, my weight, my -- the color of my eyes, the color of my hair, the fact that I have a number.</span> <span id="s2969">And of course I knew that -- that the fingerprints were there too, meaning they couldn’t mistake me for anybody else.</span> <span id="s2970">And I was going to America and that was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: So now you were in America, in New York and you would go to Jefferson High School, and the next questions are -- will be about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: That’s fine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: The -- the first question is, you went to a special, or there was a special program associated with your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Holocaust survivors would go to special classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Do you happen to know whether or not that was the -- the only program of it’s kind in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Well, I wouldn’t know for sure, but let me just again put it in the context of things.</span> <span id="s2981">This was in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2982">We moved to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2983">We lived in Brooklyn -- we meaning Miles, Kris and I, we lived in Brooklyn and in those days you had to be assigned, when you go -- went to high school, having come from the DP camp where the high school -- it wasn’t a diploma, but a certificate that I was already of high school quality, so to say.</span> <span id="s2984">In New York City, in those days, high schools were what you call neighborhood high schools.</span> <span id="s2985">In other words, you lived here and you were assigned to that high school.</span> <span id="s2986">Well, in east New York, which is Brownsville, there was this high school, Thomas Jefferson High School, which was out of my so-called district, because I belonged in Tildon High School.</span> <span id="s2987">But the Joint Distribution Committee advised me that I would belong -- I would find my place better in Jefferson High School and they could see to it that I was allowed to go out of my district.</span> <span id="s2988">It really wasn’t so far out of the district, I mean, was maybe six or seven stops on the subway, you see.</span> <span id="s2989">Jeffer -- Thomas Jefferson High School had a class especially for refugee children.</span> <span id="s2990">The reason being that there was a great influx of refugees to Brooklyn in those years.</span> <span id="s2991">When I arrived, I was really among the early arrivals, except for a friend of mine who came as an orphan, by herself with a transport in 1946, in September, I don’t think anybody came to Jefferson before September or October of 1946, is when my friend -- I know, because she was there six month when I arrived, and she was among those very first -- she did live -- she lived in the district, you see?</span> <span id="s2992">But anyhow, by the time I arrived, there was already a group formed that was called -- we were ca -- we weren’t called refugees in -- it was called basic English, yes.</span> <span id="s2993">It’s sort of a --- well, euphemism, but it really wasn’t far from the truth, because they did try to accommodate us to the English language in the first place, before they even tried to expose us to the American culture.</span> <span id="s2994">And as I mentioned before, the pres -- the principal of that high school was Dr. Ludwig Karpen and he -- whether it was he who had the original idea, or whether by virtue of the great influx of these children, that class was formed, I could not answer you this question.</span> <span id="s2995">I only know that by the time I came to Jefferson, and that probably was March or April, I met about -- there were about 30, maybe 35 of us in that class.</span> <span id="s2996">Now, how was the program arranged?</span> <span id="s2997">The program was arranged that the first thing you did -- like you know, the -- wi -- they used to be called homeroom -- other people had homeroom, you know, you came to class -- you came to high school and you had homeroom, whatever that meant.</span> <span id="s2998">We didn’t have homeroom, we had basic English.</span> <span id="s2999">We used to meet with the head of the English department, her name was Miss Hay -- Miss Agnes Hay.</span> <span id="s3000">She was the one who was to be not only our guiding spirit, she was to be our mother and father and surrogate everything.</span> <span id="s3001">She -- and she was the type, extremely warm and outgoing and soft, you know, she didn’t have any of that martinet kind of personality, she was a rather soft spoken woman.</span> <span id="s3002">And, so the in gathering of these different children -- the ages first of all were different.</span> <span id="s3003">They were something -- anywhere between 14 and -- and -- let’s say 19.</span> <span id="s3004">Some of them were 19 and didn’t -- and belonged to -- with -- you know, missed the education.</span> <span id="s3005">Some of them were 17 and had a lot of education, more than the high school and so on.</span> <span id="s3006">So all this had to be sorted out.</span> <span id="s3007">This class was, in the first place, also an orientation class as to how the educational system works.</span> <span id="s3008">Who is the principal and what are the rights of the students and what are -- what you cannot do and what you shouldn’t do -- what is expected of you.</span> <span id="s3009">And another fact was brought out -- that of course I wasn’t used to, the teacher is your best friend, so you can always go to the teacher and talk to -- about your problems.</span> <span id="s3010">In Poland there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s3011">The teacher was the teacher, the student was the student and after class, that was it.</span> <span id="s3012">Here we were taught in the basic class, you can always go, if you have a problem at home, if you couldn’t do your homework, if you don’t understand, if you find it hard.</span> <span id="s3013">Whatever problem, personal or otherwise, the teacher will help you.</span> <span id="s3014">Obviously the teacher was not going to be the only one.</span> <span id="s3015">He was going to be the one who was going to direct us -- direct us to other people who were also in place.</span> <span id="s3016">You see, everything was very subtle.</span> <span id="s3017">I didn’t understand a lot of it, but it -- it seemed like paradise.</span> <span id="s3018">But obviously there was a lot of planning put into it.</span> <span id="s3019">For example, lunch was 25 cents.</span> <span id="s3020">Now, you could not make a child -- they want -- not every child could afford 25 cents to have lunch, from the refugee children.</span> <span id="s3021">They wanted us to have a free meal, but you could not make a child feel inferior for not having to -- a quarter for the -- for the meal.</span> <span id="s3022">We were given tokens the size of a quarter and I remember the ladies name was Miss Frankel, or Mrs. Frankel or Mrs. Frank, something like this.</span> <span id="s3023">She was Dr. Karpen’s personal secretary.</span> <span id="s3024">And all you have to do it once a week goes to Miss -- go to Miss Frankel, or Frank.</span> <span id="s3025">She s -- handed you a little envelope, nobody knew what was in the envelope.</span> <span id="s3026">And when you went on line in the school cafeteria, you handed in that token that looked like a quarter and no child next to you or behind you, in front of you, could see that you were actually not able to pay for your lunch, you see?</span> <span id="s3027">Those were the subtle arrangements.</span> <span id="s3028">I mean, you never, ever had to say why you went to see Miss Frankel.</span> <span id="s3029">You just went into the office, you said, “I want to see Miss Frankel.”</span> <span id="s3030">You came in, she saw you, she gave you that little envelope, you see?</span> <span id="s3031">Everything was done with such dignity.</span> <span id="s3032">But of course this has nothing to do now with the education itself.</span> <span id="s3033">The -- the basic English class was the orientation class.</span> <span id="s3034">As to behavior, as to proper conduct in school, as to what was in-involved in American education, how th -- what things were expected of you, what was about higher education and we met every day.</span> <span id="s3035">In fact, they were telling us -- Miss Hay would call a child or two up front and say, “How do you greet people in Poland?”</span> <span id="s3036">You know?</span> <span id="s3037">Because I told her that I once re -- ex-explained in the subway when we had -- wh -- i-in the class, when we had -- the subject came up, I said we were in the subway, Miles, Kris and I and somebody we knew from Berlin or from Poland, saw us in the subway and came running over.</span> <span id="s3038">He kissed Kris’s hand and he kissed my hand and of course everybody in the subway gave us a -- I mean, people were astonished.</span> <span id="s3039">So when we were talking about proper greeting in basic English, I told Miss Hay how this thing happened and how peculiar that was in the subway.</span> <span id="s3040">So those were the a -- the things that were discussed and that class also helped determine the level -- the lev -- the educational level of each child.</span> <span id="s3041">So, for example, my English was rather poor, so I was put into -- in addition to basic English, which of course we also used to -- not memorize, but avail ourselves of phrases -- of every day phrases, how you greet people, what you do when you go to a supermar -- to the store.</span> <span id="s3042">What do you do when you want to ask a question in the street and so on.</span> <span id="s3043">That was from basic English.</span> <span id="s3044">But, to catch up with the English language itself, I, for example, used to take two English classes at one time.</span> <span id="s3045">Now, I was all -- by then I was already 17 and I was in a class with the 13 year olds, who were first entering high school, you see?</span> <span id="s3046">Because that was my first eng -- the -- the -- the -- the English course had to be covered, A to Z, four years.</span> <span id="s3047">Now, as for other things, such as physics or chemistry or math, we were tested on that and we were placed accordingly.</span> <span id="s3048">Same went for history.</span> <span id="s3049">Nobody was exempt from Civics, which was taught in those days, American History, American Economics and obviously English and Speech.</span> <span id="s3050">And the strange thing was that after awhile, it really equalized, you know?</span> <span id="s3051">That the people who didn’t have much background in English came up and people who had all this background in History, got on the same level with the others and we were not -- we were scattered in between different classes.</span> <span id="s3052">We had to take foreign language and as I also mentioned, I took Hebrew as a foreign language, because I just came out of Hebrew school and that was another bonanza for me, because Dr. Horowitz, who was the head of the Hebrew department, and taught my class, was another source of -- not advice -- you see, we’re talking basically about Americanization, about acculturation.</span> <span id="s3053">And I could tell you, that from my viewpoint, Jefferson to me was the acculturation for -- for all times.</span> <span id="s3054">They saw our needs, they knew how to meet them.</span> <span id="s3055">Everything was done with such discretion and with such dignity, that to this day I cannot -- absolutely cannot get over it.</span> <span id="s3056">You know, especially in the -- in -- in this more permissive time of welfare handouts and such, it was just a totally different scene and -- and aside from all of that, Jefferson was a very, very good academic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: Can I ask just one or two more question with regard to the basic English classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">Q: You said Americanization was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q: -- one of the -- or was the overarching goal, probably.</span> <span id="s3062">Could you give maybe one or two sort of more specific example of what -- what that meant?</span> <span id="s3063">How did they teach you?</span> <span id="s3064">What was -- what di -- what did they say was expected of you in America and did something of that strike you as odd or different, unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: Well, really the -- the underlying premise of Americanization was really democracy.</span> <span id="s3066">You see, a lot of us came from countries which were regimented, which -- I mean you didn’t ask questions, you were told and you obeyed.</span> <span id="s3067">And of course, having lived under the Germans, not only did you obey, you -- you feared for your life every second and you had to obey.</span> <span id="s3068">So that coming from a structure -- a political structure of pre-war Europe into American democracy could really be a shock.</span> <span id="s3069">Because I mean, you can get up and tell jokes in the class and I had a -- a -- apropos of that I have tell a velly funny -- a very funny thing I always -- this an anecdote, I always tell it.</span> <span id="s3070">I had a Mr. Jaffe for -- he was a very elegant little man, you know, with a vest and pinned up and really proper.</span> <span id="s3071">And Mr. Jaffe was sort of -- he liked being humorous, but to an ex -- to just with bor -- with -- with limits.</span> <span id="s3072">And we had a sort of a -- a wise guy type of fellow in the classroom and every now and then he would pipe out -- of course I was offended.</span> <span id="s3073">I mean, how can you stop the class?</span> <span id="s3074">But Mr. -- Mr. Jaffe once said to him, “Don’t be a wise guy.</span> <span id="s3075">I threw out Danny Kaye from my class and I can throw you out any time.”</span> <span id="s3076">Now -- of course, Danny Kaye did go to Jefferson High School, but way before I got there.</span> <span id="s3077">But the -- because he lived in that area.</span> <span id="s3078">But, basically, you see, I was not used to this total freedom; freedom of expression, freedom of -- of -- of -- of the being what you want and associating with wh -- with whoever you wanted to associate with.</span> <span id="s3079">And the basic English class was really you -- our introduction to democracy, on the very simple level.</span> <span id="s3080">I -- we’re not talking here theories and big things, we are talking every day living, just like not kissing somebody’s hand in the subway, is one of them, you know?</span> <span id="s3081">And -- and being -- feeling free.</span> <span id="s3082">Having a paper that doesn’t look like everybody else’s newspaper read in the subway, you could do that.</span> <span id="s3083">Didn’t have to hide it -- you don’t -- you know, you don’t have to look behind you or over your shoulder to see somebody spying on you, because this is not the type of country.</span> <span id="s3084">And you’re not going to be arrested by a policeman who will come and say, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s3085">And, “Show me your ID.”</span> <span id="s3086">That can never happen here without cause.</span> <span id="s3087">So, this was part of the -- of that basic English, which was acculturation, introduction to American democracy, but I -- I -- I am really -- it -- it isn’t all that formal, you know.</span> <span id="s3088">I’m just giving you the overall idea, because it was really rather loosely presented to us, not as a rule, with a -- wi-with a question -- with an exclamation mark at the end.</span> <span id="s3089">It was just simply put.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: This is the end of side A of tape one interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s3091">We’re going to stop now and switch over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s3094">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s3095">The next question would be -- I remember you saying -- and it also comes out in the way you explained just the -- the things before, that you were very hungry for life and you were very excited about the opportunities offered now.</span> <span id="s3096">But in mingling with other students at the school or with other refugees or Holocaust survivors, did you talk about the war experiences at all, or was that put aside?</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: If I remember correctly, I don’t think we did.</span> <span id="s3098">Because, you see, first of all we assumed that -- each one of us assumed -- one was Polish, one was Hungarian, one was French and whatever it was, we knew we re -- I personally was not interested in any other stories.</span> <span id="s3099">I knew everybody had a story to tell.</span> <span id="s3100">I had plenty of stories to tell.</span> <span id="s3101">I didn’t want to live those stories, I didn’t want to hear the other stories.</span> <span id="s3102">Besides, I didn’t have the time.</span> <span id="s3103">We were kept so busy.</span> <span id="s3104">We were kept -- don’t forget, lang -- fa -- English was a foreign language to us and we had to study subjects such as history and others.</span> <span id="s3105">Economics, which was -- I never studied ec -- American economics, or economics at all in Poland.</span> <span id="s3106">Or Civics.</span> <span id="s3107">And this required a lot of work.</span> <span id="s3108">Plus the fact that each one of us had some other obligation after school.</span> <span id="s3109">You know, I think I mentioned it before, I lived with Miles and Kris, I kept house, I shopped for food and so on.</span> <span id="s3110">I also had a job in the ORT organization’s office on Fifth Avenue, where I had to travel after school.</span> <span id="s3111">And then I had to -- I -- I -- I did absolutely stupid things there, I did filing and you know, but again, this was a kind of a job that they gave me because Dr. Karpen’s wife was the head of the office.</span> <span id="s3112">She was the head of the ORT, American ORT organization.</span> <span id="s3113">Her name was Gertrude Karpen.</span> <span id="s3114">And for me to earn this extra little money, I cannot imagine that I could do any more then than file.</span> <span id="s3115">But I was a filing clerk, I knew the alphabet.</span> <span id="s3116">So that was fine.</span> <span id="s3117">And all the other kids had obligations as well.</span> <span id="s3118">Don’t forget they were more or less in my shoes, so to say.</span> <span id="s3119">They had either families and they also had to scramble around to do a little something to sustain themselves so that we basically compared notes pertaining to the education and to the school.</span> <span id="s3120">And also, we got to be friendly with the Jewish kids -- Jewish kids, a lot of Jewish kids from the area.</span> <span id="s3121">That was a blue collar Jewish section in those days.</span> <span id="s3122">So we made wonderful friends among the Jewish kids who were normal, so to say.</span> <span id="s3123">Amer -- Jewish American kids.</span> <span id="s3124">So, all this really t-to just sum it up, didn’t -- this life in Jefferson did not fit with sitting there comparing notes, “Did you go to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s3125">No, I didn’t go to Auschwitz, I went to Ravensbrück.”</span> <span id="s3126">That was past, that was water under the bridge, you know?</span> <span id="s3127">Here we were, all these things were required of us, we were all willing and as I also mentioned before, a lot of these kids became academicians.</span> <span id="s3128">They taught all over the United States, professorship here and professor -- and everybody -- one wa -- most of these kids went to college and graduated from college.</span> <span id="s3129">So that you see, we were more or less on that same level of -- of trying to get on with life in an -- this new way, excelling educationally.</span> <span id="s3130">Find a place in this new world and who wants to talk about this old stuff?</span> <span id="s3131">You know, that was then and so this is basically -- for example, Miss Hay used to invite us to ca -- to tea.</span> <span id="s3132">She was a sort of former -- I think she was Irish by -- by -- from the fam -- anyhow, she used to invite us to tea, served beautifully, elegantly, with beautiful china cups.</span> <span id="s3133">Not all of u -- them, but she had her favorites.</span> <span id="s3134">So she had about four or five of us and we used to go to tea in her house, properly served with the napkins and the napkin rings and it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s3135">You see, now those are all these extra things that these teachers went out of their way to -- to -- to -- to -- to do for us.</span> <span id="s3136">But also, I might add, since I was so friendly with Miss Hay for all those years after -- til af -- til the time she died, she told me, “You know, Regina, I never, ever had a class like yours after your class left -- after your class graduate.”</span> <span id="s3137">She said it so many times and that is a fact, because this was a very special group and -- and I must tell you that -- that there must have been some kind of a spirit in these kids, for everybody to be so -- not just winning, I mean they -- everybody went out of his way to -- to accommodate us, to do for us, to -- to find us jobs.</span> <span id="s3138">To -- to -- so this is really -- this was a wh -- what is called a lucky break.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: Well [indecipherable] eventually you moved on to Brooklyn College?</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">Q: And I would like to quote something back to you.</span> <span id="s3142">You said in the first interview, that your knowledge of the war until then was very personal, because obviously you were sort of in the eye of the storm.</span> <span id="s3143">But now, when you went to Brooklyn College that you were quote, “Really ready to go after the historical aspects of how things happened.”</span> <span id="s3144">So that you were interested in the broader context of the war.</span> <span id="s3145">And the question, how did you do that?</span> <span id="s3146">Did you get formal education, did you talk to people about things?</span> <span id="s3147">How did you learn about it and -- and what did you learn?</span> <span id="s3148">Was there something surprising?</span> <span id="s3149">It’s a big question, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: Well, everything was surprising, for the reason that I, for example, didn’t know that the -- that the eastern part of Poland was evacuated before the -- before German occupation -- no, I -- I’m not expressing it correctly.</span> <span id="s3151">After Germ -- after the Germans occupied Poland, Stalin -- th-th-the Russians occupied eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s3152">I knew that, but I did not realize that a lot of the natives -- not a lot, the majority of the natives, Jews or Christians were evacuated deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s3153">I only found out about it in Berlin when people came to live in the DP camp, having come from Russia.</span> <span id="s3154">“What do you mean from Russia?</span> <span id="s3155">You speak Polish.</span> <span id="s3156">You come from Voofe, you come from Vilna, you come -- how did you?”</span> <span id="s3157">Well, they came out of Russia because they were evacuated en masse.</span> <span id="s3158">Apparently, the Soviets were planning to -- to get rid of the native population in order to -- to -- to resettle it with their own, or however.</span> <span id="s3159">So you see, that was the first thing that -- I started finding out these things.</span> <span id="s3160">Was very easy, of course, to -- to -- to read books.</span> <span id="s3161">I started also taking courses that pertained to -- to -- to history that -- that wasn’t -- you know, like I knew everything after the first war, I knew all that stuff.</span> <span id="s3162">But after that, I didn’t know much, you know.</span> <span id="s3163">So I started finding out.</span> <span id="s3164">And then I found out that the Polish government -- there was a Polish government in exile, in -- in -- in England during the war.</span> <span id="s3165">And then I started finding out all the other things, the atrocities of the Russians.</span> <span id="s3166">And being -- I’m always very curious about things and I know how to get -- how to find things in books, I always knew that, so it was always very easy, even if I studied something else.</span> <span id="s3167">I did take history courses in college and European political theory and all this.</span> <span id="s3168">I took it, but while I was doing my homework, I always knew how to go after that one s -- one something that I just discovered.</span> <span id="s3169">For example, the -- the Cutting Forest massacre I just discovered.</span> <span id="s3170">I went to look for it, I found it, you know.</span> <span id="s3171">And -- and -- and little by little, the -- the -- the invasion -- the Normandy invasion, the -- the Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s3172">I did not know those things.</span> <span id="s3173">I did not know about Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s3174">I mean, I knew it, but it was so sketchy, it was just an id -- something I knew, but -- so -- and -- and how -- how the allies cooperate, I knew how to find it and of course I started reading papers.</span> <span id="s3175">In fact, in Brooklyn College, the tea -- the political science teacher told us -- she rec -- she expected every one of us to read the New York Times, every day.</span> <span id="s3176">And she didn’t mean in a jokingly and she said, “Another thing, before the course is over, every one of us has to read the American constitution 12 times.”</span> <span id="s3177">Now, I am not talking about refugee children, I am talking about the regular course in Political Science.</span> <span id="s3178">Those were her two requirements.</span> <span id="s3179">One was you must read it 12 times to be able to understand it and before the course is over, you will have to know it sideways and upside down.</span> <span id="s3180">And you have to read the New York Times every day.</span> <span id="s3181">And I did.</span> <span id="s3182">So, I -- I -- I was always curious, you see, I was always curious.</span> <span id="s3183">All of a sudden I found out another detail about the war and then another detail, then of course the Nuremberg trials, you know.</span> <span id="s3184">That sort of opened a whole -- a whole new field to me that -- that I really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3185">And then of course I didn’t know too much about Italy, Fascist Italy and I wanted to find out about that.</span> <span id="s3186">And I -- so, little by little the puzzle got put together, because I searched, I really searched and I -- and I filled it in and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">Q: I -- I meant to ask you the question, did you learn anything that changed your understanding of the war, but that would be wrong in a sense, because you just began to really learn about the political framework, right?</span> <span id="s3188">Or was there anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: Well, you know, the idea of war, to me, when I -- when I -- when -- when second war first started, was that this was just a military engagement, you know, that soldiers fight and soldiers get killed.</span> <span id="s3190">And of course all this was based on the first war, not personal experience, but my knowledge of the first war, from books or from my parents, who lived through the first war.</span> <span id="s3191">Second war was a totally different thing, because it wasn’t just that they were bombing civilians, but it was -- it came to pass that they were exterminating people for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s3192">And that -- that was something that -- I mean, not only incomprehensible, but unbelievable and people wouldn’t admit it and I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it in the other tapes, but I always talk about it.</span> <span id="s3193">To this day, I had no idea what my parents knew, how much they knew, what they knew, but I do know that they did hide a lot from us.</span> <span id="s3194">In fact, they hid everything from us, because they nev -- I never knew the truth of -- and I suspect that they knew a whole lot of things.</span> <span id="s3195">Of the atrocities that were going on.</span> <span id="s3196">You know, my parents perished in the Holocaust, but even during the ghetto years and all this, I am sure they knew a lot, because there were people coming and going and reporting what’s happening here and there -- never, ever was I let in on what was happening.</span> <span id="s3197">And of course I saw with my own eyes, plenty, so maybe they felt it’s bad enough for a child to see and experience here, but not yet to live with the fear of what is really happening somewhere else, which is probably not true.</span> <span id="s3198">That was the attitude.</span> <span id="s3199">It couldn’t be true, because such a thing couldn’t be true, you know, that you take groups of people and you burn them or you gas them.</span> <span id="s3200">So that’s just gossip and during the war, there’s so much gossip, so why burden a child with this type of talk?</span> <span id="s3201">So you see, my idea of -- of war, after it was o -- after the second war was all over, was really that it brought out the beast in the human being.</span> <span id="s3202">It had nothing to do with land, you know, reclaiming your land one way or another.</span> <span id="s3203">It was nothing to do with fighting for the -- for your culture or for your moral standards.</span> <span id="s3204">It was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s3205">It was just a beastly expression of a human nature, which unfortunately fell within the new technology and it found it’s expression in annihilating by the youth of new technology and not the armed conflict of countries, but of just people being eliminated.</span> <span id="s3206">So this was basically my understanding of -- of -- you know, after all was said and done and I start -- started reading history, it go -- just confirmed what I have already experienced, that this was not a war like any other war.</span> <span id="s3207">That I knew Napoleonic wars and Franco -- the German war and this war and that war, that -- those were wars that th -- the Crimean war -- this war was nothing like it and of course the -- having confirmed it by studies, further studies, it -- it just reinforced by so many more ho-horrendous details of things that I really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3208">History f -- the -- that I got -- the history of the second war, that I got out of books, really built on my own understanding.</span> <span id="s3209">So it sort of rounded it out and I came away with -- precisely with the same concept as I had originally, before I read all the books and filled in the gaps, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Now, amidst all of this personal growth, expansion of -- of knowledge -- being busy all the time, did you ever allow yourself to mourn for your parents, for those who have gone, or did you make a point of -- of not doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Well, I didn’t mourn very inwardly, and of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: You were still very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3214">First of all, we observe the Yourtside.</span> <span id="s3215">This is -- Yourtside is the -- you know, the commemoration of the people who passed on on the day when they passed on.</span> <span id="s3216">Obviously I could not have a date for the -- for the -- for the mourning -- official mourning.</span> <span id="s3217">But I did join the group of people from Starachowice who were in New York.</span> <span id="s3218">And they established a Yourtside service and a -- a gathering of all the people from the hometown.</span> <span id="s3219">Why?</span> <span id="s3220">Because -- I think it was in Israel that a day was picked for a Yourtside for all the people from Starachowice, to be observed on the same day, meaning the day when the town was cleared of Jews.</span> <span id="s3221">And before -- because my father died in Auschwitz, sometimes in October, two years after my mother died with the owseedum -- with the -- when the town was liquidated, we decided that -- I decided -- everybody else decided that we still stick to this date, that’s October 27th.</span> <span id="s3222">So I light a candle all the time on October 27th and we have annual gatherings of that Starachowice society.</span> <span id="s3223">So we get together and prayers are said and in those days the group was much larger, I don’t have to tell you.</span> <span id="s3224">Kris and Miles, when they were in New York, they would go and prayers were said and then the morning prayers were said and then there was coffee and cake and so on, a little socializing.</span> <span id="s3225">So we did that once a year.</span> <span id="s3226">And so that was the official mourning, but of course, I missed my parents a whole lot.</span> <span id="s3227">But you know, I was thinking about it.</span> <span id="s3228">If I were still in Poland, I probably would have missed them much more because they were -- they fit into the -- into the setting.</span> <span id="s3229">Here, I was sort of on my own, you know?</span> <span id="s3230">I had Kris and Miles, of course, but after they moved away, I was really on my own and I knew that I absolutely cannot depend on having my mother help me out or my father help me out, you see?</span> <span id="s3231">I always missed them, you know, I always missed them.</span> <span id="s3232">I grieved for the fact that there was no cemetery that I could go to.</span> <span id="s3233">That bothered me and it bothers me to this day.</span> <span id="s3234">That I had -- if I had a place where I knew they were, I would -- of course in those days, I couldn’t take trips, but eventually I would get to that place.</span> <span id="s3235">But mother went to Treblinka and father perished in Auschwitz, so where is the place?</span> <span id="s3236">There is no place.</span> <span id="s3237">And the fact that we do observe October 27th -- I do, to this day, as the mourning for -- for my parents and for my hometown.</span> <span id="s3238">And you know, here and there, we -- I donated money in Israel to have the -- my parents name inscribed on a monument in the cem -- Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s3239">Also in Canada, my sister showed me when we were in Canada just last year -- and she showed me on the Jewish cemetery, there is a monument with names inscribed of the Holocaust victims who perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3240">And this was done by the survivors, so my parents names [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3241">I’m just very glad about that.</span> <span id="s3242">So we have the name in Toronto -- my parent’s name on the -- on the monument, and also in Israel.</span> <span id="s3243">So that is -- that I feel good about.</span> <span id="s3244">And the fact, of course that the observance -- that we observe, with the -- with the commun -- the survivor’s community, of whom there’s -- as you know, the ranks are thinning, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: Before I go to the next period of your life, which will be Indiana, of all places --</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: I would just like to ask you a quick, personal follow up on this one, because it just occurred to me that at that time, you seemed to feel quite strong and that you really wanted to move ahead.</span> <span id="s3248">Did you allow yourself moments of weakness, or of rage even?</span> <span id="s3249">Did you feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: Rage?</span> <span id="s3251">Probably not.</span> <span id="s3252">I am, by nature, very optimistic and I’m sort of serious, but I -- rage?</span> <span id="s3253">No, that’s not an expression of -- no.</span> <span id="s3254">Things are more internalized with me, so that if anything, I grieved, you know, I think a lot.</span> <span id="s3255">I think a lot, I mean, I probably, if I had a -- if I had a terrific problem, I would probably have sleepless nights, because my head would be running and running and running.</span> <span id="s3256">But that -- whenever -- I wouldn’t go break a chair or hit somebody or -- or curse.</span> <span id="s3257">I -- it’s just in -- not in -- it’s not my make-up, so to say.</span> <span id="s3258">I always wonder if that could be because I was the youngest and I was always spoiled, so I sort of -- you know, I was sort of singled out by my parents and oh, you’re so good and you’re so this, so may -- maybe that stayed with me.</span> <span id="s3259">I don’t know, I can’t say, but I’ll tell you no, rage is -- rage at what was?</span> <span id="s3260">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: Well, maybe rage is not a good word, I guess.</span> <span id="s3262">Let me rephrase this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">Q: What I also meant was -- did you ever feel -- it’s -- did you feel f -- that you wanted -- with regard to Germans, vengeance -- feelings of vengeance or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">Q: Or anger?</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">A: Yes anger, but you know, vengeance -- first of all, vengeance doesn’t accomplish anything.</span> <span id="s3268">What was done was done and what you do now, as a vengeful act, does not undo what was done.</span> <span id="s3269">So that’s -- that’s a fact.</span> <span id="s3270">Second is that if you are analytical and you really follow the thread, you -- in my case, I could never accept the fact that what happened was going to determine the entire course of my life, which I haven’t lived yet.</span> <span id="s3271">So, you see, I -- probably that was a kind of a determination, not that I didn’t have nightmares and -- and sleepless nights and all kinds of physical the -- th -- manifestations of an inner conflict.</span> <span id="s3272">But on the outside, I most certainly did not dwell on any vengeance.</span> <span id="s3273">I just felt that the Germans will probably eventually come around to understanding in their own way, what a horrible, horrible thing they did, that was unprecedented, that was unimaginable, that was beyond and -- above and beyond the human un -- human understanding, you know, that -- because, as I was saying before, this wasn’t a war like the other wars, like the Crimean war, like this war, there -- where there was shooting between soldiers and there was armistice and the war was over.</span> <span id="s3274">This was something that I was not going to allow to destroy my life, because my parents were -- my home was destroyed, my parents were killed, we were lucky enough to survive.</span> <span id="s3275">And -- and there was life to be lived and -- and I wasn’t going to worry about the Germans -- what was I going to take a gun and go to Germany and shoot somebody?</span> <span id="s3276">On the other hand, what was I going to do, sit home and brood and -- and ruin my life and get more nightmares and more -- I couldn’t do that either.</span> <span id="s3277">So thinking very logically and realistically, I imagined this is the conclusion I reached.</span> <span id="s3278">And the fact that I really was very busy.</span> <span id="s3279">I was very busy, so that I rather took it as an excuse, you know, I’ll think about it tomorrow.</span> <span id="s3280">Not about my parents, but about the whole idea.</span> <span id="s3281">And, as I told you before, that when I finally got the -- the book knowledge about the war and put it all together, it did not change my original understanding, which was personal and on a lower level.</span> <span id="s3282">It just enhanced it.</span> <span id="s3283">But my conclusion concerning the Germans was still the same.</span> <span id="s3284">I wasn’t going to get a gun and shoot them.</span> <span id="s3285">I wasn’t going to get myself sick, just immobilized by -- by the kind of fear I used to experience every single day of my life.</span> <span id="s3286">I haven’t lived yet.</span> <span id="s3287">I wanted book knowledge, I wanted to have fun.</span> <span id="s3288">I wanted to be a girl and go dancing and do things and I wasn’t going to allow that to f -- to -- to -- to -- to get in my way.</span> <span id="s3289">And that -- that is really how it was and -- and -- I -- I was grateful that my personality was such that it allowed me -- not to forget it, you don’t ever forget it.</span> <span id="s3290">You don’t -- you don’t forget anything, especially I don’t forget anything.</span> <span id="s3291">I mean, I have everything under a zipper in the back of the head.</span> <span id="s3292">I have all kinds of things stored in there, but that doesn’t mean that I need to go around and curse God for what happened.</span> <span id="s3293">Shoot the Germans for what happened.</span> <span id="s3294">It already happened, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">Q: Well, let’s go to Indiana -- Bloomington then.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">Q: It was kind of an interesting situation, because the cold war era sort of came along --</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">Q: You did say in the first interview that you were quite affected by McCarthyism --</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">Q: -- because it just didn’t seem -- after your own experience, especially --</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">Q: -- you know, the right thing.</span> <span id="s3304">But at the same time, you were going to Bloomington to teach Polish -- Polnish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">A: Yes, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: To people who were s -- going behind the Iron Curtain or just --</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: Air Force officers, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: Yes, so I would like to talk a little bit more about the -- the overall --</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: -- situation you found yourself in.</span> <span id="s3313">And sort of -- questions that are hopping a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">Q: -- all over the place, but -- but bear with me then.</span> <span id="s3316">You did say, first of all, that you were asked in the first questionnaire whether you would be willing to room with a black girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: And that you found that quite shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: Did you room?</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">A: No, I didn’t, because I was assi -- I told -- I told them assign me however -- wherever there is a vacancy.</span> <span id="s3322">The fact is, I did not come in September, I came in October, by which time the school was already -- you -- everything was settled and I told them wherever there is a vacancy and you can place me there, please do.</span> <span id="s3323">Of course, the way it turned out was that they -- had I had a black girl, I would have thanked God, because the one that I had was the messiest girl ever, that I ever, ever, ever lived with.</span> <span id="s3324">And it was so horrendous that she used to have papers on the floor and you couldn’t enter the room.</span> <span id="s3325">So, I always said, “For heaven sakes, why didn’t they give me a black girl?”</span> <span id="s3326">And of course, I couldn’t live with her any more than one semester -- through the end of that semester and then I requested a private room, because I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s3327">I had all that work to do, the library closed at 11.</span> <span id="s3328">I never, ever -- we had curfew in the dormitory, so I could only be in the library to 11, but I couldn’t work -- you know, I couldn’t work in the house, because I just couldn’t be in that -- in that -- it was a tiny room, with -- you know, but she was on the upper bunk, I was on the lower, you know, bunk beds?</span> <span id="s3329">And the piles of dirty laundry, of clean laundry.</span> <span id="s3330">I mean it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s3331">She was a girl from Gary, Indiana.</span> <span id="s3332">We got along very well, because we were sort of cordial, but I -- I absolute -- I mean, anyhows, to answer your question, I took what I was assigned, because that was October and it was, you know, the school was on already.</span> <span id="s3333">The first part of your -- oh, yeah, of the McCarthy era.</span> <span id="s3334">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">Q: Maybe we can sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">Q: -- come back to that later, because I do want to ask you to -- they also asked you what your religion was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">Q: Did you -- you too -- you -- you -- you said Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">Q: And the follow-up question would be, did you feel any particular responses among your students then, to you, as a -- as a Jewish person, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">A: My students?</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">Q: No, not -- did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3345">First of all, the housing was -- religion was import -- in the housing, for the housing application.</span> <span id="s3346">Those were the two questions asked on the housing application, not the school application.</span> <span id="s3347">Whether I would room with a black girl and whether I was Jew -- what was my religion?</span> <span id="s3348">Apparently they did not mean it the way I took it, because they meant, if you’re Catholic, maybe you’d like to be with a Catholic girl, go together to mass.</span> <span id="s3349">Or if you’re Jewish, you might want to observe Yom Kippur when the others -- that was a very innocent question, but -- you see, in those days I was drunk on American democracy.</span> <span id="s3350">You see, I felt that everything here was -- not that it was permissible, but all those restrictions, all those qualifications, are you this or are you this or were you -- is your father Jewish, or -- that all that didn’t apply here, you see, so my shock was based more on my misunderstanding of their -- of their real purpose.</span> <span id="s3351">They wanted you to be compatible with the person that you were going to be with.</span> <span id="s3352">I took it on the other hand as an expression of something from the past, where I always had to say that I was Jewish, where I always -- you see?</span> <span id="s3353">Where everybody was differentiated, you were Jewish so you were this and this was a Catholic and there was the other thing, so that it shows you that once in America, I -- I probably -- this -- this idea of democracy probably wasn’t yet formulated will enough for me to understand that this was not a very personal question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">Q: This is the end of tape one, side B and I think it’s the garbage truck in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Seven, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s3357">This is tape number two, side A and we are still in Indiana.</span> <span id="s3358">You mentioned in your earlier interview, that you could, in -- in your own teaching process, you could choose any conversational topic that you wanted to.</span> <span id="s3359">Is there an example?</span> <span id="s3360">Did you pick anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">A: Well, let me just tell you this.</span> <span id="s3362">The program was run by the linguistics department.</span> <span id="s3363">The students were all Air Force officers.</span> <span id="s3364">The languages taught were Serbo-Croatian, there was Polish, there was Russian.</span> <span id="s3365">If I remember, Ukrainian possibly.</span> <span id="s3366">Now, we had a syllabus that we followed.</span> <span id="s3367">We wrote our own textbook, with the head of the linguistics department.</span> <span id="s3368">And of course grammar was taught, Polish language you know, has declensions and conjugations, so there’s plenty of grammar to learn, much more than there is in the English language.</span> <span id="s3369">But in order to make it more accessible to these people, who were after all going to be stationed in a foreign country, where they would have to go and buy a container of milk and then be on a bus and overhear a conversation of people who are talking about wheat and baking bread, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3370">Therefore, the conversation slot, that unit of time that was devoted to conversation, was to be as if you -- from the teachers -- instructor’s viewpoint, meaning myself, as if I was talking to somebody n -- to another native, on any subject.</span> <span id="s3371">Of course, I like to make it interesting.</span> <span id="s3372">As I probably mentioned, or maybe I didn’t, I never, ever discussed the war -- the -- they knew I was Jewish, they knew I had a number, I was in Auschwitz, they knew I lost my parents.</span> <span id="s3373">They knew th-the general information about me.</span> <span id="s3374">They knew I came to Indiana solely because I was given this job.</span> <span id="s3375">And to make the conversations interesting, first of all I had a unit of time specifically designated for conversation and of course, now that I’m a translator, this was the so-called Monterey rec -- Monterey system was -- Monterey, California had a language school and they were just developing this new idea, that learning a language is best to -- to hear the music.</span> <span id="s3376">You see, language is based on an intonation, so that if you are attuned to the music of the language, you will absorb it faster than learning all the -- the -- the irregular verbs and the -- the -- the what -- whatever.</span> <span id="s3377">So I was told to pick a subject, to tell them a story.</span> <span id="s3378">Not in a simple language where I would have to go overboard finding simple.</span> <span id="s3379">Simply as if I were telling anything to somebody else who is native, after which time, I should just have -- what do you think -- let’s say I was talking about a goat that got lost, whatever, something like.</span> <span id="s3380">What do you think would happen after this was over?</span> <span id="s3381">What would you think was -- would happen to that goat that got lost on the ro -- in the same pattern of speech which I delivered my little story.</span> <span id="s3382">And they had to answer me, however ridiculous the answer was -- in their own way, for me to judge how much understanding of native -- of the native speech pattern they had.</span> <span id="s3383">And that was very interesting because I was free to pick subjects, you know, so if it was something interesting that came up in school, I told them about that.</span> <span id="s3384">If there was something -- of course they knew that I was engaged to Victor and Victor was in -- in the -- in uniform and he used to come and visit me, so one day I told him a -- told them about Victor and I wanted to double check whether they remember -- and they, you know, so that was -- that was also a way of -- I had to report, you know, to the department there -- the absorption level of the language.</span> <span id="s3385">And I was told later -- of course I’m in touch with these people, they’re very nice people, especially one of them, through years and years, we visit, we write.</span> <span id="s3386">Anyhow, I was told that those were very good, fun things to do.</span> <span id="s3387">Because basically, that’s what they had to do, they had to go behind the Iron Curtain and they had to be -- they were charge d’affairs for this and all kinds of other things.</span> <span id="s3388">And they had to deal with natives.</span> <span id="s3389">And I apparently had yet, the natives music in the -- in -- in the -- in the speech, so that that was worthwhile and I thought that was a very good part of the -- of the program.</span> <span id="s3390">Of course, that wasn’t my idea, you know, that was all included in the syllabus and decided by the linguistics department, because this was done for all these other languages, you see, that were taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: But -- but speaking of native, you were a native of -- Poland was your birth country?</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">Q: And at that time, it was becoming, because it was the Cold War era, sort of stereotyped many times.</span> <span id="s3394">Did that reflect in any way back on you?</span> <span id="s3395">Talking now not about the people you taught, but about the other people you might --</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">A: You -- you mean stereotyped during the Cold War?</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">Q: -- as a -- you’d be, as -- as a -- as a Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">A: Stereotyped during the Cold War?</span></p> <p><span id="s3399">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">A: Well, not among the people that I came across with.</span> <span id="s3401">First of all, you know, Poland was never incorporated into Russia.</span> <span id="s3402">They were a satellite country during the 50 years of Russian regime.</span> <span id="s3403">The Poles were fiercely opposed -- by then I als -- also knew history, you see?</span> <span id="s3404">They were fiercely opposed to the Russian government for years and years and there was no such thing as Poland being willingly in the satellite orbit.</span> <span id="s3405">The people that I -- I live and de-dealt with -- I never came across an expression that the Poles are Communists.</span> <span id="s3406">You see, because basically they were not.</span> <span id="s3407">The Poles were basically, fiercely independent and they expected to be liberated, period, after the second war.</span> <span id="s3408">But they were not liberated, and that is -- of course it’s all historical, convoluted chain of events, between Yalta and --and Stalin being who he was and -- and the Yalta agreement actually enslaved Poland for 50 years, but that’s another story.</span> <span id="s3409">The -- the point is that the people that I knew never, ever held it against me that I repre -- I was representing some -- that this was a Cold War and I was representing any kind of Communist type of thing, because basically, i-if I may just venture a guess, the reason that the American government was interested in sending people in there, was to really determine, are they turning Communist or are they staying quietly, but -- but fighting it?</span> <span id="s3410">And this is exactly how it really was.</span> <span id="s3411">And I -- I even knew it much later, when Victor and I went in 1980, when we went to Poland and I had friends and I was visiting.</span> <span id="s3412">So one friend told me, “Don’t speak in the hotel room to your husband, about anything.”</span> <span id="s3413">I said, “What do we think -- what do we wa -- what are going to --” She says, “Don’t do it.</span> <span id="s3414">There are microphones in the walls there.</span> <span id="s3415">Don’t speak to your friends, don’t speak in the taxis, don’t speak --” I mean, they put the fear of God in me, because what I knew and I was in Indiana was still true in 1980, before Solidarity, you see, that there was all pervasive Communist -- well, what would you call it, a -- the -- the Communist grip on Poland was very strong, but underneath, it wasn’t, you see?</span> <span id="s3416">This is how the warnings came.</span> <span id="s3417">And -- and I knew that when I was in Indiana, because the Cold War was -- this wasn’t just the 50’s, so the war wasn’t over even 10 years yet, you see.</span> <span id="s3418">And -- and there was still hope maybe Poland would sneak out from under, but of course it never did and then Czechoslovakia and all, so basically that was not at -- or -- an issue, ever.</span> <span id="s3419">Not from people who I dealt with, not from people whom I met and referred to me as Polish native, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3420">Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">Q: You were intoxicated by American democracy --</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: -- at one time, in your own words.</span> <span id="s3424">But did you also become aware of some particular, peculiar American prejudices maybe, for the first time, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">A: Well, I, for example, did not realize that the blacks were oppressed in this country.</span> <span id="s3426">I really didn’t know it, I must admit.</span> <span id="s3427">I knew that they were slaves at one time, that they came on ships from Africa.</span> <span id="s3428">I knew that they were freed by Lincoln.</span> <span id="s3429">And I knew that there was still discrimination in the south, because I knew that there was such a thing as bathrooms for blacks or whites, separately -- public bathrooms.</span> <span id="s3430">And water fountains, public water fountains, but no, I -- I really didn’t see it, or maybe I didn’t want to see it or maybe -- you see, I just didn’t know enough of -- of America in that sense, because I was still circulating in another sphere, so to say.</span> <span id="s3431">I was still in the academic world, you see?</span> <span id="s3432">And I had no access, truly.</span> <span id="s3433">I heard that there was an incident in Indiana once, but I -- wi-with a person in my class, that we experienced discrimination in the restaurant, but I -- I just didn’t feel that that was America, you know?</span> <span id="s3434">I had an idea of America, ideal America.</span> <span id="s3435">So I -- even if I did see a -- a little expression of something or other, I didn’t take it as the expression of -- of America as I wanted to see it -- as I saw it.</span> <span id="s3436">In fact, I saw it that way, because that’s how I saw reality in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">Q: You did give a -- a good impression of what -- or you have started to give a very li-lively impression, I think, of what America meant for you, but could you be -- maybe just give one more example of what you meant with the ideals of America?</span> <span id="s3438">What was -- was it -- what -- how was it different from being Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">A: No, it wasn’t different from being Polish, it was different from where I came from.</span> <span id="s3440">And that includes my war experiences in Germany and everything else, you see?</span> <span id="s3441">Being Polish is something else.</span> <span id="s3442">It’s very much connected to my childhood and to very wonderful life with my parents and my family.</span> <span id="s3443">That is what I mean by being Polish.</span> <span id="s3444">But being European is what I was, really.</span> <span id="s3445">Being European in the sense that I felt the brunt of German culture and I experienced the bestiality.</span> <span id="s3446">So that was now part and parcel of Europe for me.</span> <span id="s3447">And, though I know it wasn’t, but it was, because that was my personal life.</span> <span id="s3448">So when I came here, and I told you I found out all these things, that you are free to read the paper and you are free to express yourself and you can get up and disagree with your teacher in the classroom and all these things that you could do that were absolutely -- that they had no repercussions.</span> <span id="s3449">That they were -- you weren’t going to be shot or killed or sent in the prison, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3450">That was -- it’s a -- like a -- like an explosion of the mind, to me.</span> <span id="s3451">It was not directly connected to my being Polish.</span> <span id="s3452">It was connected to my overall background -- European background until I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Now we will be jumping ahead again, for quite a few years, I think, or quite a few years.</span> <span id="s3454">You had a family, you were having a family now at this point that we are jumping to.</span> <span id="s3455">And I do remember that you very vividly expressed sort of dislike for the counter-culture of the 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3457">Q: And there was some concern with regard -- were you concerned that your -- that your own children might go in a similar direction and if so, how did you teach them limits?</span> <span id="s3458">How do you teach, how di -- did you try to counteract that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">A: Yes, okay, let me start from the general and come to the specific.</span> <span id="s3460">I came out of Europe from chaos.</span> <span id="s3461">From everything being turned upside-down, from everything being torn up for an idea that the Germans had of -- of -- the hedanfolk and -- and all that.</span> <span id="s3462">And I came to America, I was intoxicated with this idea that this can never happen here.</span> <span id="s3463">And all of a sudden, in the 60’s, not that it in any way compared to Nazi Germany’s planned and -- and organized -- and -- and -- and -- and specified the -- horrible deeds.</span> <span id="s3464">This was all -- this was all in flux, but I suspected that the culture, as I have come to understand it, was being torn apart by this kind of an expression, which I took to be the other extreme, you see?</span> <span id="s3465">Whereas the first extreme was the organization -- no, perfection of the Nazis, here you had a total disruption of everything, without a central idea, nevertheless, disrupting.</span> <span id="s3466">You asked me how I did wi -- how the children -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3467">I have -- since my husband was working and I was sort of call -- the mother at home, I had the idea that I wanted my children to have self-discipline, and I stuck to it.</span> <span id="s3468">Wi -- They knew they were loved, they knew they were -- they weren’t indulged to a point, but everything was very logical.</span> <span id="s3469">In other words, if I said to a child, “You know, you have to put on your shoes, these shoes today, because the radio said it’s going to be stormy later.”</span> <span id="s3470">Whatever quote unquote order I gave the child, there was always, immediately, why.</span> <span id="s3471">I always explained why you need to do it, why you must do it.</span> <span id="s3472">You went to a restaurant, there are other people there, you cannot be disruptive, you cannot be loud, you cannot be in and in and under the table.</span> <span id="s3473">We went to a hotel -- French hotel in the Catskills.</span> <span id="s3474">People used to get dressed for dinner.</span> <span id="s3475">The children had to be dressed for dinner, with their little bow tie.</span> <span id="s3476">They knew it.</span> <span id="s3477">Came dinner time, they had to be dressed, that was it.</span> <span id="s3478">Otherwise we don’t go there.</span> <span id="s3479">If you want to go there, you like it there?</span> <span id="s3480">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s3481">Well, if you do, then you have to do what is expected of you.</span> <span id="s3482">And I wasn’t shy about punishing.</span> <span id="s3483">And I punished the child if he disobeyed and the consequences were bad.</span> <span id="s3484">I would take away the bicycle for a week, you can’t ride the bicycle for a week, you see?</span> <span id="s3485">You were supposed to do other -- something or other, that was canceled.</span> <span id="s3486">So that eventually the discipline -- our younger son Paul always tells me, cause he’s a free spirit, he says, “You know, that was really very good.”</span> <span id="s3487">Also the fact that the homework, when they were submitting homework, the -- public school.</span> <span id="s3488">I would tear up the homework if I thought it was messy.</span> <span id="s3489">You know, it was a homework assignment, a page and a half, so he -- 10 o’clock at night he scribbles out the homework and it looks like a dog wrote it.</span> <span id="s3490">So I would say no, I was a teacher once, too.</span> <span id="s3491">I would not accept homework looked like that.</span> <span id="s3492">Even if it was the best homework in the world, the smartest, you don’t hand in anything that looks so sloppy.</span> <span id="s3493">Was torn up, he had to write it again.</span> <span id="s3494">And there was always the reason, you see?</span> <span id="s3495">There was always a reason for doing things.</span> <span id="s3496">It wasn’t the imperial, “I said so.”</span> <span id="s3497">It sounded imperial to the child, but he had no -- and because I was with the children most of the time, what I said, went.</span> <span id="s3498">And the fact is that they had many, many friends and they went to school next door, so every child was allowed to bring a friend for lunch.</span> <span id="s3499">And I had assignments, Wednesday was Melanie and Tuesday was Willy Popper and everyb -- you know, so there were -- the house was always open to friends, always.</span> <span id="s3500">And that -- I told you, by appointment, every Wednesday belonged to another kid that they brought from school.</span> <span id="s3501">Black kids, white kids, Jewish kids, any kids that they chose to bring.</span> <span id="s3502">So they never felt deprived of something that they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s3503">They knew that we are there and they knew that we are very reasonable.</span> <span id="s3504">You see, that we don’t order things without a basis for ordering it.</span> <span id="s3505">And to this day, my older son, who now has children, you know, he disciplines the older -- the boy -- the older boy, the nine year old.</span> <span id="s3506">And apparently something stayed with him, because I do believe in self-discipline.</span> <span id="s3507">I believe that you know you have to discipline your mind to -- to -- for it to find the expression in your daily living.</span> <span id="s3508">You know, if you have to do homework, you have to do it.</span> <span id="s3509">If it’s already too late, you still have to do it.</span> <span id="s3510">You have to do it, you have to be on the job at nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s3511">Can’t be there five after nine, you know?</span> <span id="s3512">If somebody expects you to do something, it has to be done.</span> <span id="s3513">This is self-discipline and the parent isn’t around forever to tell you so.</span> <span id="s3514">If it’s ingrained, it stays.</span></p> <p><span id="s3515">Q: Your husband just walked in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3516">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">Q: -- which gives me the -- the key for the next question.</span> <span id="s3518">Was good timing on his part, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Victor, you husband, we didn’t talk very much about him last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">Q: How did you meet -- who is -- who is -- what did you talk about?</span> <span id="s3523">Did -- how did he learn about your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">Q: Your war experience?</span> <span id="s3526">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">A: Well -- well, we met in a very casual way, that there was most -- most ordinary way.</span> <span id="s3528">I used to live, as I told you, when Kris and Miles moves aw -- to Jersey, I used to live with different families and then I lived with another family in Brooklyn, in Brighton Beach and the person -- th-th-th -- it’s a friend, my fr -- sh-she was our friend from Poland, she was there and her father and I lived with her and her father.</span> <span id="s3529">She went to Brooklyn College at night for courses, psychology, this and the other thing.</span> <span id="s3530">And she had a friend who was a secretary to Victor’s father.</span> <span id="s3531">Victor’s family had a textile business.</span> <span id="s3532">So one day, the secretary in the office told Victor that she is going to Brooklyn College to see -- he graduated from Brooklyn College, but way before.</span> <span id="s3533">He graduated in 1949, when I was first graduating from high school.</span> <span id="s3534">Anyhow, so she said, there is this fantastic course she is taking and they are going to show a certain film, if he wants to go.</span> <span id="s3535">So he went with her, he drove her to Brooklyn College and after the film was shown, where this friend of mine was, Victor drove both ladies home.</span> <span id="s3536">So he first dropped off this one woman, Cecile and then he came to drop off Fella.</span> <span id="s3537">And Fella said to him, “Why don’t you come in and say hello?</span> <span id="s3538">I have -- my father is there, I have a friend living with us.”</span> <span id="s3539">So he came in and there I was.</span> <span id="s3540">I didn’t look for him, I didn’t chase him.</span> <span id="s3541">He was -- I was there and he walked in.</span> <span id="s3542">And so we got to know each other.</span> <span id="s3543">And I used to have a lot of friends, male friends, boy friends.</span> <span id="s3544">I used to love dancing, so I used to go dancing with one boyfriend.</span> <span id="s3545">I had all kinds, really.</span> <span id="s3546">I had a -- a rogue’s gallery album full of these guys.</span> <span id="s3547">And then Victor walked in and then he lived not very far from that.</span> <span id="s3548">So, every now and then we used to meet.</span> <span id="s3549">We went to a -- to the opera, we went to -- his family had a subscription to the Metropolitan, so we -- we had tickets.</span> <span id="s3550">Anyhow, we -- we did a lot of cultural things, we went out to dinner and -- he knew about me, I mean as much as -- as he want -- as -- again, like the way it happened with the children.</span> <span id="s3551">I told him some and I told him, if you’re interested in anything else, tell me and I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s3552">I -- not going to sit here, bore you about things that -- if you want to know, I’ll tell you anything.</span> <span id="s3553">Well, this is how it happened.</span> <span id="s3554">And then he was drafted in 1950, in the Korean war, he was drafted and went to -- upstate to Watertown.</span> <span id="s3555">And that same year I went to Indiana.</span> <span id="s3556">So he started coming -- we used to meet in New York.</span> <span id="s3557">He started coming there or we would meet in New York and then we got engaged and when I graduated, he came for the graduation and then we got married, in New York.</span> <span id="s3558">Of course we came back to New York to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">Q: How did you feel -- just mentioned that he was in the Korean war.</span> <span id="s3560">How did you feel about that war and about Victor being in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">A: I was really -- I mean -- as far for -- I was worried about him, of course, but I just couldn’t understand, in those days, I just -- because, you know, this is 1950, this is only five years, five short years.</span> <span id="s3562">Of course now war has this other connotation in my mind, you see?</span> <span id="s3563">I said, “For heaven sakes, there is another war and nothing has been learned?</span> <span id="s3564">Nothing?</span> <span id="s3565">It’s --” I -- of course I didn’t understand about the war, anyhow.</span> <span id="s3566">But I -- I absolutely did not understand the war, Korean War, I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s3567">Of course, Korean War now, as I know it, was really the -- a -- a piece of the larger picture of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s3568">But in those days, I absolutely didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s3569">But I -- I worried about him an -- a whole lot, I really did.</span> <span id="s3570">But finally, he had a very good assignment, he’s such a precise man and he’s so good at thing that are -- that require organization and precision, that the -- he was placed in the headquarters in the Camp Drum, that’s upstate New York in Watertown.</span> <span id="s3571">And every time a sh -- and -- and of course the -- his boss was a general and the general loved to play golf.</span> <span id="s3572">Once he found Victor, he could go play golf all day long and Victor would -- everything would be perfect.</span> <span id="s3573">So, whenever there was a -- because this was a transitional camp for -- for -- before people were sent to -- to -- to Korea.</span> <span id="s3574">So actually what happened is this, Victor was drafted and he went to -- in Massachusetts, what was the name of the camp?</span> <span id="s3575">It will come to me.</span> <span id="s3576">He came for basic -- went for basic training and after that he was sent to Camp Drum.</span> <span id="s3577">And once he got settled in that headquarters, where he was the secretary to this general, the general didn’t want to get rid of him, because he needed him to play golf.</span> <span id="s3578">So Victor was sitting in the office and for that he was never shipped up.</span> <span id="s3579">As a matter of fact, whenever he requested a three day pass to come to Indiana, he got it too.</span> <span id="s3580">So, if I came home for Christmas to New York, he requested a pass, and he got it, to come to New York, you see?</span> <span id="s3581">So, that was very, very lucky, but the overall picture of -- of the Cold War and Korea, as it was in -- evolving, was so far -- no, it wasn’t foreign to me, but it was a -- I just could not comprehend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">Q: Did Victor feel slightly different about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3583">A: About the Korean War?</span> <span id="s3584">I don’t know how he felt about the Korean war, except for the fact that he was drafted and he had to go and he -- he was sort of brought up in a well-to-do family and he never experienced anything like the six weeks of basic training.</span> <span id="s3585">What was the name of the camp in Massachusetts?</span> <span id="s3586">Whatever.</span> <span id="s3587">So, after that, he came back, he was hard like -- you know, hardened by the push-ups and by all that stuff.</span> <span id="s3588">And in those days, American boys still -- still felt very -- this was before the 60’s -- strongly about doing for the country that was asked of them.</span> <span id="s3589">Well, he was drafted -- he didn’t ask for it, he was drafted, he was taken in.</span> <span id="s3590">He put in his two years.</span> <span id="s3591">He discharged at honorable discharge.</span> <span id="s3592">So that’s how it was and that was not questioned in the 50’s, such things.</span> <span id="s3593">I can’t imagine that he would ever try to wiggle out of it, because he probably have -- never would think of it.</span> <span id="s3594">This is how it was and he did it.</span> <span id="s3595">He was just lucky, knock wood, that because he is so efficient in an office setting, that the guy knew whom he had, him, and Victor, by virtue of that was -- wa -- never went to Korea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: What was your actual wedding like?</span> <span id="s3597">You mentioned it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">A: It was very private, just his family and Kris and Miles and their little daughter.</span> <span id="s3599">That was it.</span> <span id="s3600">And we were married in the rabbi’s study.</span> <span id="s3601">The ra -- the family rabbi.</span> <span id="s3602">His father was quite ill, in fact his father died the same year that -- we were married in March, he -- the father died in November.</span> <span id="s3603">The father was after seven strokes and it was just even questionable if he was going to make it to the wedding, but he did.</span> <span id="s3604">It was -- the marriage was in the rabbi’s study in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s3605">They were supporters of the Temple there and everything, so the rabbi accommodated us.</span> <span id="s3606">And then we went out to dinner in a restaurant and that was it.</span> <span id="s3607">It had to be very low key for hi -- for his father’s sake, but it was also very low key by -- I would have pre -- I -- I preferred it that way, you know.</span> <span id="s3608">I never would think of having a big mar -- wedding for myself, never, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">A: I don’t like to be the center of attraction, that’s number one.</span> <span id="s3611">Number two, not having my parents, I didn’t think that I was going to feel good about being married.</span> <span id="s3612">But the way it turned out, tha -- this didn’t even come up.</span> <span id="s3613">Because the question was, how to have a wedding where the father -- Victor’s father can still make it.</span> <span id="s3614">Well, he made it and that was the best -- was very beautiful in that rabbi’s study.</span> <span id="s3615">You know, we had the [indecipherable] there in the -- it’s beautiful, book lined study with oriental carpets.</span> <span id="s3616">Was lovely, lovely and the family -- immediate family.</span> <span id="s3617">And that was just the way I felt comfortable about, because without my parents, I did not think I really would ever want to be a big -- in a big wedding.</span> <span id="s3618">And for me that wasn’t -- it’s not my bag to place myself at the center.</span> <span id="s3619">I don’t like that, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">Q: Eventually you went back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">Q: Twice, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3624">Q: And I would like to ask you about the first time, how did you feel?</span> <span id="s3625">How did it feel going back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: Well, I’ll tell you frankly, before we went, I was scared.</span> <span id="s3627">I was very scared.</span> <span id="s3628">I did a lot of reading, of course I always do before I go on a trip, I read this and I read that, because we ha -- I -- I didn’t want to take Victor to Poland -- this was my trip with Victor, to burden him with -- to go and cry in Treblinka and the Holocaust and the -- and Auschwitz, I didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s3629">I wanted to make it a two prong thing.</span> <span id="s3630">One part would be that and going back to my hometown to see the very lovely Christian people who were my parents friends and who really were instrumental in -- in pulling us through the war, survive it -- helping in the surviving.</span> <span id="s3631">And so we organized -- in fact I went to a Polish travel agency here, rather than American travel -- we went on our own, you know, not with any group or anything.</span> <span id="s3632">And I thought Victor ought to be exposed to Polish culture a little, because I’m so -- you know, I -- I have it in my blood and -- and I -- I’m still very much attached to Polish music, Polish literature and such, so I felt this is part of my life that he’s not part of at all.</span> <span id="s3633">I mean, he hears me speak Polish, h-he doesn’t know what it is about, but at least if he went with me so he would have a connection to where I come from, even though he’s by now half-Polish in the sense, because he’s been exposed -- he goes with me to all these sympo -- the symposium here and a concert there and the -- and the Polish theater, there he goes and he loves it.</span> <span id="s3634">But in those days -- now, this was 1980, we were already -- 1980 we were already married many years, because we got married in ‘53.</span> <span id="s3635">I still did not want to make it a crying kind of experience.</span> <span id="s3636">However, I really feared for myself.</span> <span id="s3637">I really, truly was scared the first time.</span> <span id="s3638">I just didn’t know how I was going to react, because my memories were -- I -- I -- I felt maybe my childhood memories all gone and what I will just remember is the horrible, not the good.</span> <span id="s3639">But it didn’t turn out that way at all.</span> <span id="s3640">I had no need to worry.</span> <span id="s3641">I had everything arranged through a Polish travel agent, exactly the type of itinerary that I wanted to have and it so happened that once we got there, since I peak -- speak Polish, was very easy to have a taxi driver take us to our -- to my hometown and do all these other things, plus go on a to -- take tours, you see?</span> <span id="s3642">So that th -- the experience was wonderful.</span> <span id="s3643">We do -- did go to Auschwitz, it was a very painful thing for me because -- well, we were part of a tour, so it wasn’t very personal, you know?</span> <span id="s3644">We were there with eight other people, or -- no, there were eight all of -- the total was eight.</span> <span id="s3645">We -- we took that bus from Warsaw to Kraków.</span> <span id="s3646">We stayed in a Kraków hotel, this was a group, see?</span> <span id="s3647">And when we went to Auschwitz, this tour guide -- we were the only two Jewish people, they took us to all these places, except to Birkenau, where I was.</span> <span id="s3648">You see, I was in Birkenau in the camp, in -- in the barracks.</span> <span id="s3649">And she cracked some anti-Semitic jokes on the bus.</span> <span id="s3650">You know, she was joking.</span> <span id="s3651">And I did not feel that that was tailored to me.</span> <span id="s3652">This was tailored, this [indecipherable] in fact, just before we left, I said, “I understand --” we were done with the visit.</span> <span id="s3653">We went to see where Father Colba died and all this.</span> <span id="s3654">And of course -- so I went out in a tower to see where the barracks were, but I never went into the barracks.</span> <span id="s3655">So then we were ready to leave, I said, “I understand there’s a Jewish museum here.”</span> <span id="s3656">She says, “Oh, yes, there is.”</span> <span id="s3657">I say, “Aren’t we going in there?”</span> <span id="s3658">She says, “No.</span> <span id="s3659">If you asked, we would have gone.”</span> <span id="s3660">I said, “Well, I’m asking.”</span> <span id="s3661">So she took us to that Jewish museum and there was Anne Frank and all the other and there was a book, so I signed the book and I -- and I said that my father perished there, that I survived.</span> <span id="s3662">I wrote it in -- I think I wrote it in Polish and English.</span> <span id="s3663">So that was not a very satisfactory experience.</span> <span id="s3664">We did see a film before we went, you know, the -- you come, so this was an -- because this was an English speaking tour, so we saw the film.</span> <span id="s3665">The film gave me more than the tour itself.</span> <span id="s3666">Course later on I made up for it, but we’re talking now with Victor, 1980.</span> <span id="s3667">And a much more rewarding feeling was when we came to my hometown, because the old ladies were there and they prepared lunch for us and there was no -- there was such poverty there and there was no -- there was no meat to by had for anything, why they needed meat I don’t know, but anyhow, she stayed at the -- one of these old ladies stood in line seven hours to get a piece of meat to make pirogue for us when we came.</span> <span id="s3668">And of course I brought them stuff.</span> <span id="s3669">I brought a whole suitcase there, you know, which I emptied.</span> <span id="s3670">Full -- filled suitcase and they stilled lived in the house that was -- had a crack from the bombs.</span> <span id="s3671">Anyhow, we left them money, so subsequently she moved to a better apartment.</span> <span id="s3672">Was a very touching experience because they saw Victor and I -- I was like a -- suppose like a Ping-Pong because they spoke and I told Victor and he told me and -- and there was a granddaughter that I got to know that was -- she was lovely and she helped us and I -- so we had lunch there and the taxi driver who -- who brought us, I told him -- we gave him some money to go have lunch, because I wasn’t going to invite him with us, this was such a personal meeting.</span> <span id="s3673">And then of course we visited the town, which was totally different.</span> <span id="s3674">The camp one -- I already mentioned that one camp didn’t exist any more, it was just built up new development.</span> <span id="s3675">The other is now a shooting range, so that was very touching.</span> <span id="s3676">The railroad -- Victor saw a beautiful locomotive from the 19th century at the railroad station, so we took a picture of that.</span> <span id="s3677">He -- you know, and I -- we walked around and I showed him -- that was -- but that wasn’t the type of experience that broke me up, you see?</span> <span id="s3678">I thought Auschwitz would, but because the Auschwitz was such a cold, impersonal thing, it just passed me, you see?</span> <span id="s3679">The thing that I really fear turned out nothing, because it was so s -- poorly arranged, you see?</span> <span id="s3680">Whereas the going back to my hometown was really the absolute heart of that trip.</span> <span id="s3681">And of course, then in the ci -- yeah, w-we did other things, we met other people in the hotels, they came to visit us in -- but that was on another level, that was already on -- on level of 1980, people -- grownups meeting grownups, but that visit to my hometown really did it and of course, as I think I mentioned, we went to the cemetery and we took pictures and -- that -- all this had meaning and it was touching and it was lovely, but it was not the kind that broke me.</span> <span id="s3682">It did not break me and Auschwitz couldn’t break me, because it was too cold and too impersonal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">Q: We will continue a little bit with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">Q: I just need to finish this side now.</span> <span id="s3686">This is the end of tape two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">End of Tape Seven, Side A Beginning of Tape Seven, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s3689">This it tape number two, side B. And I have two follow-up questions with regard to Poland, and one is, did you feel while you were there, especially in your hometown, did you feel entirely, wholly American, or was there an essence, a core left that was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">A: Well, I tell you, I still feel very Polish, so there is no getting away from that.</span> <span id="s3691">I still love the language, I love the music and I am very much part of what I was, so I felt very much at home, on one hand.</span> <span id="s3692">On the other hand, I did not feel that that -- that Poland that I saw -- and that was Communist Poland, that’s another thing, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s3693">At the height of Communism, if -- in fact, that very August that we were in Poland, they started having strikes there.</span> <span id="s3694">That was the Solidarity movement just started.</span> <span id="s3695">But when we were there, as I told you, everybody was warning me, don’t talk here, don’t do this and don’t do that and the -- the whole -- the ambiance, the -- the -- the -- the -- the atmosphere was strange.</span> <span id="s3696">Whether it was because it was Communist or because there were just no more Jewish people around.</span> <span id="s3697">Much as I considered myself part of it, I already felt that I was an American with another -- besides, having Victor around, I already -- this is my life, this was -- this was one time and tha -- it’s now so different.</span> <span id="s3698">But, by the same token, all life is different after 50 years.</span> <span id="s3699">And as I was telling Victor, because we saw my -- part of Starachowice, which was called Wierzbnik, was very dilapidated now, in 1980.</span> <span id="s3700">So I told him, when I came to America, I went to visit somebody -- Huntspoint Avenue in the South Bronx.</span> <span id="s3701">A -- a friend I had, and it was a very decent part of the city.</span> <span id="s3702">If you tell somebody now that this was -- South Bronx was lovely, I mean -- so I told him, this applies to -- to Wierzbnik, this part of Starachowice that was so dilapidated.</span> <span id="s3703">I said, “If you want to south -- went to South Bronx 50 years later, that -- you have that.</span> <span id="s3704">You come here and you have this.”</span> <span id="s3705">So the resemblance to things I knew wasn’t there physically.</span> <span id="s3706">The Mioufka camp was gone, was a brand new development.</span> <span id="s3707">So except -- aside from that Jewish cemetery and the visit with the old ladies, my parents friends, was the only true connection.</span> <span id="s3708">Other than that, we just went as tourists, we went.</span> <span id="s3709">I told you, the shopen route and we went to the salt mines and we went to zarcoparna and we went to Chancetahova.</span> <span id="s3710">We went to see the -- the holy picture, you know, the -- you know the Chancetahova?</span> <span id="s3711">No, Chancetahova is a very famous Polish monastery that has the Madonna -- the famous Madonna, the black Madonna picture?</span> <span id="s3712">Okay, I had to see the black Madonna, because I was brought up about that and I knew about it and I -- so since the tr -- group was going there, we went to see the black Madonna.</span> <span id="s3713">And we went into -- was just before a mass, we were brought in through the room where the priests were being robed in de -- and we stood right in front, against that -- against that -- the -- it was like a fa -- barrier, you know, and we were the first row of the pilgrims -- that was pilgrimage time, too, there was thousands of people in the church and we saw the black Madonna, so I did that -- which was interesting, because you know, this fitted -- this fit in a vacuum that was in my -- my brain that I was -- I -- I was brought up on this thing, this is the holiest picture in the Christian -- in Christian faith in Poland, is the black Madonna.</span> <span id="s3714">Now, I’ve seen the black Madonna, so -- so this was basically the trip with -- with Victor and of course, he got a good feeling of what it was about.</span> <span id="s3715">But it -- as you could see, it didn’t turn out to be scary, as I expected it to be.</span> <span id="s3716">It was on another level, at another age -- my personal age, with Communism all around, with the -- all places having changed physically, too, so it just wasn’t -- it -- it -- anyhow, it was to my benefit, because the way it turned out.</span> <span id="s3717">The second trip that I took with -- for the Holocaust Museum, that -- for the interpreting, that was a little more personal and much more worse.</span> <span id="s3718">Well, because we went to Auschwitz and I was at the ba -- in the barrack and the -- and the bunk where I slept and you know, that was all very personal.</span> <span id="s3719">But by then, since I was already in another capacity as an interpreter, I couldn’t allow myself to be breaking down, you know, like when we came to Majdanek, and there was no interpreter, English in -- we were supposed to -- the group was supposed to have an interpreter.</span> <span id="s3720">So they only had the Polish interpreter, so I stood there and I was the -- I was the interpreter.</span> <span id="s3721">So I -- I had to process the language and I couldn’t -- I could not feel the meaning of the words that I was saying, you see?</span> <span id="s3722">So that -- but that was much more worthwhile, the second trip.</span> <span id="s3723">But still, I have already been through that first hoop of -- of facing up to Poland, so it -- that went -- that wasn’t bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">Q: I would like to tie it together and then have a question, two episodes that were very painful, but resolved themselves in a sense.</span> <span id="s3725">You mentioned much earlier in this interview, that it was very painful for you to not have a place where you could mourn your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3727">Q: There was no cemetery, there was no place, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">Q: Then later in Poland, you saw this cemetery, this Jewish cemetery and it became your mission, in a sense, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3730">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3731">Q: -- have it restored?</span></p> <p><span id="s3732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3733">Q: And it was a painful episode for you that there were op -- reservations?</span></p> <p><span id="s3734">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">Q: From the Jewish community --</span></p> <p><span id="s3736">A: From the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">Q: -- from -- for different --</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">A: -- the town community.</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">Q: From the town community?</span></p> <p><span id="s3740">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">Q: But also from American Jewish people you knew here, who -- who weren’t that interested in raising money for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3742">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3743">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3744">So my question would be, was it so especially painful you -- for you to have that rejection here in America in a sense, because it prevented you from having a conc -- a resolution a little bit of -- of something?</span> <span id="s3745">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3746">A: I’m not sure I understand the question, but I could tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: Was it important for you, in a sense, to have that cemetery restored -- to have a place restored, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">A: Yeah, that was one part, definitely that was one part.</span> <span id="s3749">But the other part, the predominant part was that having been to Poland twice, to my hometown twice and having found nothing of the old Jewish life in ei-either time, first was 1980, then was 1987, I felt that any way of commemorating the former existence of a Jewish community in Poland was to save that cemetery.</span> <span id="s3750">There wasn’t much left of it, but whatever was left, that that was now a mission, in a sense, because when I was in 1980 and Victor made all those wonderful pictures and I brought them back to the Starachowice Society at the time when I told you, in October, when we meet for the Yourtside?</span> <span id="s3751">And I was really sort of told off and -- and I didn’t want to create waves and I didn’t want to make enemies and I sort of never liked to push myself, so I let it slide and I sent the pictures to Israel and nothing came of it and I had correspondence going on, whatever.</span> <span id="s3752">After I was able to just register the cemetery in New York, with this other lady, who was -- she happened to have been my -- Polafunk is her name, she was my religion teacher in Poland, she happens to live in New York.</span> <span id="s3753">She’s an elderly lady now.</span> <span id="s3754">We discussed it, she also was really v-v-very much on the -- on -- on my wavelength, so to say.</span> <span id="s3755">We’re still around and we must do it.</span> <span id="s3756">If they -- whoever doesn’t like it -- the Polish community will not do it.</span> <span id="s3757">A, they’re poor, B, they’re not interested, C, they would rather have houses built there than have a Jewish cemetery, because who’s here?</span> <span id="s3758">There’s nobody around, nobody will know and such and such.</span> <span id="s3759">So we did this one thing that we accomplished, we registered the cemetery here in New York, just before the list was closed for the Jewish cemeteries that were going to be given to the Polish government.</span> <span id="s3760">So we got that done.</span> <span id="s3761">After that, when they -- I have already spoken about it, when the idea of them -- collecti -- thing the money was -- came -- it was the easiest things, I just didn’t call the other people and called those that gave and they gave and money went to Israel, then the man was sent to Poland and things were done and it’s done.</span> <span id="s3762">And it’s -- it’s easier than -- th-than pie, as they say.</span> <span id="s3763">Had I known, I would have -- or maybe you know, on the other hand, maybe 1980 people weren’t quite ready yet for that.</span> <span id="s3764">That’s -- you know, you really have to be in a special frame of mind to undertake a certain -- a certain obligation.</span> <span id="s3765">I saw this in 1980 because I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s3766">The houses were being built, the cemetery was neglected, it was overgrown, it was -- the -- the -- the monuments were knocked over.</span> <span id="s3767">The Germans took out a lot of the monuments and they paved streets with it.</span> <span id="s3768">And I said, “If you allowed what’s going on til now, another year or two, there’ll be nothing there.”</span> <span id="s3769">This granddaughter of this -- these old ladies, they -- she came with us to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s3770">And through her, you see, after I left Poland and I was constant correspondence with her.</span> <span id="s3771">She went again and then she wrote me a letter, she said -- three years later, she says, “Whatever you and your husband saw, there is less of it now.”</span> <span id="s3772">When I had that letter, I hit the ceiling.</span> <span id="s3773">And so this, I think, was the final -- the final push that I needed.</span> <span id="s3774">And I got in touch with Israel and I got in touch with everybody else and I said, “We do it or we’ll never have it and let’s forget everybody else.”</span> <span id="s3775">So this was a fulfillment, not -- to answer your question, it wasn’t only because I had no place to grieve.</span> <span id="s3776">I have nobody in that cemetery, we never did have anybody there.</span> <span id="s3777">This was to preserve a token, that this is a token, to preserve a little bit of sacred soil, so to say, to show that there was a vibrant community here at one time and is no more and -- and if it takes money to do it -- to perpetuate it, that could be done.</span> <span id="s3778">There are a lot of survivors whose children are interested and there’s no reason why this cannot be perpetuated, to be -- to have a caretaker and to just keep that little bit of whatever was left.</span> <span id="s3779">I personally don’t even need -- read Yiddish.</span> <span id="s3780">I couldn’t even read the -- the monuments.</span> <span id="s3781">Victor took close up pictures, I brought it to New York and I asked some people to read the names.</span> <span id="s3782">But that’s not -- that doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s3783">This is a Jewish cemetery and -- so that was the project that really was -- i-it -- it was good for me, personally.</span> <span id="s3784">You know, however i-it wa -- whatever good it did for others, it was good for me, personally, very fulfilling.</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">Q: There was some -- there is something else that is very -- or was very -- or is very important for you to talk about, and that has to do with your profession as an translator.</span> <span id="s3786">You did work about Yannish Korchuk?</span></p> <p><span id="s3787">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">Q: Who was a very important --</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3790">Q: -- impressive figure.</span> <span id="s3791">Do you want to say a little bit more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">A: Yes, well actually, my translation does not have much bearing with the Korchuk -- you see, I -- I used to write and publish articles and such and those are two separate issues, so maybe I will start with the Korchuk, okay?</span> <span id="s3793">And then with the translation, cause those are separate issues.</span> <span id="s3794">I was -- and still am, for many years, a member of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences.</span> <span id="s3795">It’s an academic institution of -- i-it was organized by Polish Jewish -- Polish Christian -- Polish Jewish scholars during the war, when they ran away from Europe.</span> <span id="s3796">And this was an academic institution and it has always done things that pertain to Polish academic life.</span> <span id="s3797">And culture, too, but Koschushka Foundation, which is another organization, Polish organization, deals more with the cultural aspect, but the Polish Institute was always part of the academic world.</span> <span id="s3798">American fit into the academic world, cause a lot of the people there were the professors, professors in American universities.</span> <span id="s3799">Anyhow, in the early 80’s, a dialog was started, a Polish Jewish dialog, you know.</span> <span id="s3800">There is a Polish Jewish dialog in London, there is one in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3801">There -- there are Polish Jewish dialogs forever going on everywhere, but not much progress ha -- some progress has been made, but not as much as it could have.</span> <span id="s3802">Anyhow, there was an idea arose that because Ko-Korchuk was a humanitarian, who was a great educator, philosopher.</span> <span id="s3803">He was also, you know, a doctor who organized the famous orphanage, the Jewish orphanage, who had this new idea of child upbringing and he was an assimilated Polish Jew, who also suffered anti-Semitism while he lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s3804">He was a -- a 19th century man who lived under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s3805">Well, Korchuk was a humanist of men of the highest moral and ethical standards.</span> <span id="s3806">Of the highest devotion to -- to -- to humanity.</span> <span id="s3807">And because his considered himself a Polish Jew and a Jewish Pole, it was decided, whoever it was, Polish organizations and Jewish organizations decided to use Korchuk’s name as a core, as a central piece of a Polish Jewish dialog.</span> <span id="s3808">I was nominated from the Polish Institute to become -- to join the group of people who were organizing this dialog.</span> <span id="s3809">And this was in the nine -- early 1980’s, ‘81, ‘82, ‘83, ‘84.</span> <span id="s3810">Anyhow, we would meet at the ADL, at the ameri -- Anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s3811">The -- the whole idea was -- because he was also a great writer, he wrote books for children and about children.</span> <span id="s3812">Books on psychology about children, but fantastic books for children.</span> <span id="s3813">I -- he also had a radio program and every child -- he used to read books to children.</span> <span id="s3814">So every child who grew up in the Poland, in the inter war years, would know Korchuk’s stories.</span> <span id="s3815">Anyhow, he was used as a central figure for the dialog.</span> <span id="s3816">And in a competition -- international book competition was established, where books would be submitted for children -- books written for children, or about children -- two separate categories.</span> <span id="s3817">And, when the prizes were going to be given out, then it would be a gathering of Polish and Jewish -- Polish Christian and -- and Jewish Polish group meet and we would have ceremonies and so.</span> <span id="s3818">I became a what you call reader, because I do book reviews a lot.</span> <span id="s3819">I ri -- I do book reviews for the American Translators Association and anyhow, since I wrote a lot of book reviews, too.</span> <span id="s3820">So I became a book reader and I -- because I also worked in the Children’s Library here for 11 years, I picked the children’s books.</span> <span id="s3821">So I would have 20 - 25 books to read.</span> <span id="s3822">And I had an outline, how to mark that.</span> <span id="s3823">We would submit it, then the judges would decided and then there would be a ceremony.</span> <span id="s3824">Now I really am very much interested in reading you the names of the organizations which participated.</span> <span id="s3825">Unfortunately this is now all past tense, because this whole thing fell apart, this whole ca -- dialog.</span> <span id="s3826">We had it for about four or five years and then it didn’t terminate, it petered out.</span> <span id="s3827">There was never an official notice, we no longer do it, we -- whatever.</span> <span id="s3828">All of a sudden -- I didn’t get a notice, there will be a fo -- there will be -- I was never notified that they’re going to send me a boo -- box of books.</span> <span id="s3829">I never heard from anybody, nobody ever heard from anybody and the thing just thinned out into the air.</span> <span id="s3830">So I thought if I read you some of this -- these participating groups, which was a mixture of Polish Christian and Polish Jewish.</span> <span id="s3831">So there were the anti-Defamation League of B’nai Brith, the American Council of Polish Cultural Clubs, the American Federation of Jewish Fighters, Camp inmates and Nazi victims, Federation of Polish Jews in the United States Holocaust Library.</span> <span id="s3832">The Koschushka Foundation, which I told you before is a cultural Polish organization.</span> <span id="s3833">The North American Study Center for Polish Affair, also called Studium.</span> <span id="s3834">The Polish American Congress, that’s -- they -- their -- their home office is in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3835">The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America.</span> <span id="s3836">That’s this organization that I was a member from.</span> <span id="s3837">Polish Judiciary Organization.</span> <span id="s3838">Vargro, which is the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization and the World Federation of Bergen-Belden -- Belgen Associations.</span> <span id="s3839">In addition to which there was also the head publisher and chief editor of the Polish Noveegenyeek, which is a very substantial, very high level Polish language newspaper in New York.</span> <span id="s3840">His name is Bola [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3841">He was also part of it as a member of the institute, not as a representative from his paper.</span> <span id="s3842">He cannot be a newspaperman and be listed, yeah.</span> <span id="s3843">Well anyhow, this, as you could see, was a very well integrated type of a group.</span> <span id="s3844">People on very high level of -- of achievement -- organizations and such.</span> <span id="s3845">One of -- we met -- a few of these award ceremonies took place in [indecipherable] here in New York.</span> <span id="s3846">One took place in Washington, I remember traveling -- in the Kennedy Center.</span> <span id="s3847">One wa -- had the Cheswafmeewash, the Polish Nobel Prize winning poet, as keynote speaker.</span> <span id="s3848">Once they had Governor Keene from New York -- from New Jersey, a -- he was the governor then, a keynote speaker.</span> <span id="s3849">They had very interesting keynote speakers -- was lovely get together, the prizes were handed out.</span> <span id="s3850">First prize I think was thousand dollars, second prize -- and there were two separate categories, as I told you.</span> <span id="s3851">One was books for children, one was books about children.</span> <span id="s3852">And the books actually were submitted internationally.</span> <span id="s3853">That means, the books from Israel, from Poland, from England, from France, from the United States and of course the judges picked -- had -- they picked the first, second and third prize in both categories and this was sort of a -- like a very good quote unquote excuse.</span> <span id="s3854">It wasn’t an excuse, but it was a very good -- th-the joining point, to -- to have something like this go on and much as these -- this group was in agreement that Korchuk personified the very essence of what humanitarian d-deeds should be about, as much as he personified the Pole and the Jew, all one, as -- as the humanist, you see?</span> <span id="s3855">As the -- as the person of -- of the highest ethical standard.</span> <span id="s3856">He personified humanity, so he had to personify Polish Christians and Polish Jews all at once and because he was assimilated and he was a man of both worlds, you see?</span> <span id="s3857">Both the Christian and the Jewish.</span> <span id="s3858">He was not of the religious type of Jews, he -- they were -- there was an assimilated family.</span> <span id="s3859">His father I think was a lawyer and his grandfather was a doctor or som -- he himself was a pediatrician, by training.</span> <span id="s3860">So, you see, this had such great possibilities.</span> <span id="s3861">And this had such very major aspects of reconciliation built into it.</span> <span id="s3862">Because he was that thing that we were trying here to build up.</span> <span id="s3863">We already started with a model, you know?</span> <span id="s3864">Not a role model, with a model of what we are after.</span> <span id="s3865">And it somehow -- it fell by the wayside.</span> <span id="s3866">It just -- I don’t know if I mentioned it, I had open heart surgery in 1989, so after that my ho -- personal situation change, I stop -- I stopped publishing and I stopped accepting invitations to do this and join that, because you know, I had to slow down physically.</span> <span id="s3867">And now of course I -- I am much better than I was in the first few years, but I still am not of the same -- on the same physical level that I was before the operation, so that it petered out just about the time I got sick.</span> <span id="s3868">And I wasn’t going to be bothered, because I was too much involved with -- then two years later I found out that it -- it isn’t that they didn’t notify me, they just didn’t -- they just -- it just fell apart, so -- but there are other dialogs, you know, going on, Polish Jewish dialogs that are going on.</span> <span id="s3869">There is a very fine group in London and there’s one very good -- good group in Chicago.</span> <span id="s3870">At this point we have nothing here and I don’t know if -- it’s a very thorny problem, because there’s two steps forward, one step back.</span> <span id="s3871">And there’s a lot of animosity and misunderstanding and there shouldn’t be.</span> <span id="s3872">Absolutely should not be, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">Q: I meant to ask you something else first, but in a sense you have prepared the grounds for something that I wanted to ask you later, but let me ask it now then.</span> <span id="s3874">The -- some of the key words were con -- reconciliation, that is very important to you?</span> <span id="s3875">And thorny issues --</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">Q: -- that’s another.</span> <span id="s3878">There are some -- what one might call hot button issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: Or divisive issues --</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3882">Q: -- in the Jewish American community, but also in -- among survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3883">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">Q: I think maybe we can talk just briefly --</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">Q: -- about -- about a few of those.</span> <span id="s3887">The Arafat visit --</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3889">Q: -- earlier this year, turned out to be very difficult in many ways, of course, but also the incident with the invitation, it was at first given and then withdrawn and then given again from the Holocaust Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s3890">How do you -- how do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">A: Well, I don’t know what the reasons were for what happened.</span> <span id="s3892">From my personal viewpoint, if I were to decide, I would welcome him.</span> <span id="s3893">Because you cannot resolve issues if you are not willing to talk to your en -- to your enemies.</span> <span id="s3894">You don’t have to talk to your friends, because you know that they are on your side.</span> <span id="s3895">But you do have to talk to your enemies.</span> <span id="s3896">And there are always viewpoints that are wide spread -- spread very -- very far apart.</span> <span id="s3897">But, bringing them closer, you don’t have to attempt to bring them together the first time or the second time, but you have to allow time for a reconciliation which finalizes a point that is mutually acceptable to two sides.</span> <span id="s3898">Therefore, I -- my personal -- that is nothing to do with what the politics of the matter are or how the Jewish community feels or how the Arab community feels, had it been up to me, I would have invited him.</span> <span id="s3899">That is all I can tell you.</span> <span id="s3900">And -- and I think that was an opportunity missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">Q: In slightly other terms, what -- what do you think should the role of the Holocaust Museum be and the -- the leadership?</span> <span id="s3902">Are there things that they should not be doing or that it is important to do as much as possible as an educational museum?</span> <span id="s3903">How do you kind of feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">A: Well, I’ll tell you frankly, I am very much impressed by the work they’re doing.</span> <span id="s3905">I think the museum, as an educational institution cannot be compared to any other body of -- of -- of -- you know, cause any -- not to any other museum, because museums don’t deal with education, really.</span> <span id="s3906">This is a combination of -- of resource center, educational center and museum.</span> <span id="s3907">And that -- and the way it’s run and the way they have it all, is so impressive.</span> <span id="s3908">I’ll tell you, I went to the -- the -- the Holo -- not the Holocaust -- the Jewish museum in Lower Manhattan, Battery Park?</span> <span id="s3909">I liked it.</span> <span id="s3910">I can’t say I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3911">It’s -- it has three approaches and you know, before the Jewish experience, it’s a -- encompasses the entire Jewish experience, whereas the Holocaust deals primarily with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3912">I was more impressed by the Holocaust Museum concept and I think it hits you much stronger than this museum, because when you go to this museum, here in New York, you feel that you’ve been to a museum.</span> <span id="s3913">When you go to the other museum, it’s an experience that shakes you up.</span> <span id="s3914">And that, you need.</span> <span id="s3915">I don’t mean you, the visitor, but anybody, you know, who even -- never went there, but knows what this deals with specifically.</span> <span id="s3916">It is sort of like a reminder, you know?</span> <span id="s3917">Which is the par -- purpose, I imagine, of the museum, not to forget what happened and to learn from that experience.</span> <span id="s3918">And I’ll tell you, I told Miles about it.</span> <span id="s3919">This is -- I met somebody in New Hampshire, he was an -- very simple man who does road work, you know, one of the bulldozers and -- young fellow, maybe 35 years old or so and he noticed my number.</span> <span id="s3920">And he told me -- he says, “Oh, you one of those?”</span> <span id="s3921">He -- he said it like that.</span> <span id="s3922">And I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s3923">I say, “Why did you say that?”</span> <span id="s3924">He says, “Oh, you know, I must tell you about a place, you must go there,” he tells me.</span> <span id="s3925">I said, “What place is it?”</span> <span id="s3926">He says, “You know, my wife and I and I -- our 13 year old kid and my -- my mother-in-law, we went to Tennessee and we decided -- we were in Washington, they said there is this museum, we’ll go to see it.</span> <span id="s3927">You have no idea what kind of place that is.”</span> <span id="s3928">This is this man telling me.</span> <span id="s3929">So, he says, “You must go there.”</span> <span id="s3930">He says, “You know, it’s all about the war and what the Germans did to the Jews, and,” he says, “I can’t get over it.”</span> <span id="s3931">Well, I told him, “I’m so glad you saw it, because I do happen to know about it.”</span> <span id="s3932">I said, “Yes, this deals with the kind of experience of --” cause I didn’t go into details with him of anything.</span> <span id="s3933">I said, “What did your young chil -- young boy think?”</span> <span id="s3934">Oh, he says, “Oh, he was very impressed with -- even my mother-in-law couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3935">She didn’t want to go there,” he tells me.</span> <span id="s3936">Well, as soon as I -- the conversation was over, I called up Miles and I told him, “Miles, this is one thing you have to hear, because coming from this man who -- who lives in the provinces, in a village, who happened to be in Washington on the way from Tennessee, they -- where they visited fa-family, who never had any intention of going, but somehow or other he heard something and he went to see.</span> <span id="s3937">And for a man -- a Christian man, obviously, to be so impressed and so overwhelmed, that when he saw me, he couldn’t believe that -- I -- he should tell me about it to go there immediately.</span> <span id="s3938">And I told Miles, I said, “Spread the word in the museum, that whatever it’s you’re doing, you’re doing it very well, because it is reaching the kind of people that should be reached.”</span> <span id="s3939">See, that is the point, that the museum -- the Holocaust Museum reaches people in a way that nothing else would reach them.</span> <span id="s3940">I mean, for me to go to the museum, well, I go.</span> <span id="s3941">But for somebody who didn’t even know the story of the Holocaust, to go with the -- the three generations of family and everybody was impressed and he himself, couldn’t get over it.</span> <span id="s3942">Now there is the sum it up.</span> <span id="s3943">They are doing the best possible work that could be done to educate, to keep the memory and to stay within the historical framework -- you know, without.</span> <span id="s3944">There is very little commentary there that would make you feel that it is slated -- that the -- one way or another, because I feel it’s a very well balanced -- the Holocaust Museum, I think is very well balanced in con -- the content is very well balanced.</span> <span id="s3945">So, I have the highest regard for what they are doing and I’m very, very pleased that it has run so efficiently and so well.</span> <span id="s3946">And as I told you, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.</span> <span id="s3947">If this man, of all people -- I mean, if I met in -- somebody in New York City and he told me, well, you know.</span> <span id="s3948">But over there?</span> <span id="s3949">A man lives in a hole in the wall in a village somewhere and works on the -- works for the state, digging, you know, the roadwork.</span> <span id="s3950">To be so impressed as to tell me 50 times, he repeated, “You must go,” until I [indecipherable] “I went there, I wa --” He says, “Why don’t you go again?”</span> <span id="s3951">I said, “I know the place.”</span> <span id="s3952">I didn’t want to tell him much about it, you know?</span> <span id="s3953">But I found it so interesting, I’m telling you, I called Miles immediately.</span> <span id="s3954">I told him, “This you’ve got to hear.”</span> <span id="s3955">Cause there is your answer about -- not that he asked the question, but this basically illustrates how I feel.</span> <span id="s3956">I feel that it is reaching the kind of people that the New York museum probably will not reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">Q: Since you have a scholarly background yourself, let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s3958">There’s sometimes difficult issues with regard to research -- Holocaust research, which has in a sense developed -- in effect developed into a very specialized field, in it’s -- for the last decade, I guess.</span> <span id="s3959">Some people are a little bit worried about that, because they -- they -- they are concerned with a-academicizing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">Q: -- with a certain jargon that comes into it and -- and -- and sometimes people are invited and disinvited again because they have controversial issues they are dealing with.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">Q: H-How do you feel about scholarship -- specialized cholarship -- scholarship with regard to the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3964">Is there --</span></p> <p><span id="s3965">A: I don’t really quite understand the question.</span> <span id="s3966">How should specialized scholarship be conducted or how should it be -- how should the conclusions be promoted, or -- or -- I don’t understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3967">Q: Do you -- do you feel that there is inhe-inherent danger in specializing in the Holocaust in s -- in some way?</span> <span id="s3968">Have -- or -- did -- did you come across controversial issues with regard to -- to scholarship?</span> <span id="s3969">Certain gender issues are sometimes problematic for some people because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">A: Well, I’ll tell you -- to give you a general ex -- answer, as you know, within a society there are a million -- million people with million opinions.</span> <span id="s3971">There are issues that don’t get resolved for many, many years.</span> <span id="s3972">There are issues that -- that will never be resolved and I think an institution that is open to the larger public -- I mean, everybody goes to the Holocaust Museum, you know.</span> <span id="s3973">It isn’t that only academics, or only university students go there, but this is open to the larger public, Christian and otherwise, from all over the world.</span> <span id="s3974">I understand there -- they have attendance from all over the world.</span> <span id="s3975">That issues have to be presented, but not as a final conclusion, you know?</span> <span id="s3976">There are issues, like the Polish Jewish dialog.</span> <span id="s3977">It is inconclusive, it is ongoing, it is forever evolving and there is no answer.</span> <span id="s3978">There are a trillion such issues in the world now.</span> <span id="s3979">There is Ireland, that unfortunately has been going on for years and years within the same people.</span> <span id="s3980">So there is no such a thing as preventing some viewpoints and -- and excluding other viewpoints.</span> <span id="s3981">I have always been for reconciliation of ev -- of every kind and I’ve always been for inclusion.</span> <span id="s3982">In this case, inclusion has to mean -- even if not resolving certain issues, presenting certain issues.</span> <span id="s3983">It’s -- it was like with the Jewish cemetery, you know?</span> <span id="s3984">I was discouraged by the criticism that I was planning to do something.</span> <span id="s3985">I should have overlooked it.</span> <span id="s3986">I should not have been bothered.</span> <span id="s3987">But my natural instinct was, this is controversial, I don’t want to make people feel bad, I don’t -- this and the other thing.</span> <span id="s3988">Meanwhile, the issue was being dead and buried in front of my own eyes, until it came up and we seized the opportunity.</span> <span id="s3989">And this is just a -- a stupid example, maybe, but it basically applies in life.</span> <span id="s3990">You cannot close the doors on anything and you cannot consider anything as a final expression of whatever it is.</span> <span id="s3991">Because everything is evolves -- everything evolves and you leave -- if you leave it breathing room -- you know, if you’re leaving a roo -- if you leave it the room -- breathing room, you -- you could be all inclusive for every viewpoint, without having to ara -- arrive at the specific, final determination or conclusion.</span> <span id="s3992">Those aren’t always called for.</span> <span id="s3993">Determina -- final determinations, nothing is final.</span> <span id="s3994">You know, you grow older, you find out.</span> <span id="s3995">Everything is changing, always, everything.</span> <span id="s3996">So if there is an open door type of approach, there’s always a chance.</span> <span id="s3997">We’ll be gone years and years, God only knows, there will be reso -- resolution to Ireland and to -- to Middle East and -- and everything else will be -- would -- would resolve itself, you know?</span> <span id="s3998">So this is personally my -- my feeling, but I have the highest regard for the museum’s work.</span> <span id="s3999">And as I told you, I consider it much superior to the museum in Lower Manhattan.</span> <span id="s4000">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s4001">Others are no comparison.</span> <span id="s4002">This is interesting, in New York.</span> <span id="s4003">The other is profound, stimulating and it shakes you up.</span> <span id="s4004">That is the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s4005">Q: Well, it’s -- do you have anything that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s4006">A: No, really, I’m -- I’m really very grateful to you for taking the time and for coming back and -- and all this and it was really very nice.</span> <span id="s4007">But this is an awfully -- that’s going to be part of the other tape, I imagine.</span> <span id="s4008">So it will be an awfully long interview.</span> <span id="s4009">I don’t know who will ever want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4010">Q: Oh, I think there are people out there who would love to hear it and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial -- End of Tape Seven, Side B Beginning Tape Eight, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s4011">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s4012">This is tape number three, side A. And, although I had already tried to conclude this interview, since your name got cut off from the side before, I thought I may as well sneak another two questions in.</span> <span id="s4013">And the first question is not related to anything that we have talked about so -- so far, but in a sense, it may be.</span> <span id="s4014">What do you base your Jewish identity on?</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">A: Well, you know that your -- your -- your group identity, so to say -- let’s put it in a bigger framework, relates basically to your childhood.</span> <span id="s4016">This is the way I see it.</span> <span id="s4017">I do not -- excuse me -- I do not come from a very religious family, observant or strictly religious.</span> <span id="s4018">Our parents were Progressive Jews, very much interested in Zionism and also attached to Judaism through religion, but certainly not of the Hassidic type that was prevalent in Poland, in between the wars.</span> <span id="s4019">And of course, this sort of rubbed off on us children, the idea, the -- the very strong idef -- identification with the Jewish people, but not through religion.</span> <span id="s4020">Not -- no, not through religion strict observance -- through religious observance, but rather on a -- on a -- on another level than the Hassidic, that the prevalent observance was -- was known for at that time.</span> <span id="s4021">Consequently, obviously, I had -- I did go to -- to Hebrew school, as I told you, which was -- dealt with Jewish religion and it had dealt with the Bible and Jewish history, but that was sort of more secular, by nature and so was our life at home, even though my grandmother was very religious, which I also mentioned prior to this ex -- to this interview.</span> <span id="s4022">I seem to have continued in that vein.</span> <span id="s4023">It was lucky when I married Victor, that his family was affiliated with a Reform Temple in Brooklyn -- a rather well-known Temple, with -- Rabbi Steinback was his name, he was a poet and a writer and an army chaplain and he was also a very inspired type of clergyman, you know, he talked poetry and he -- even when he married us, it was, “What a -- what two beautiful names, Regina and Victor.</span> <span id="s4024">Can you imagine a combination of two names like --” you know, he made a whole to-do about it.</span> <span id="s4025">Those were his sermons, that was his approach.</span> <span id="s4026">That was Victor’s background, this Rabbi Steinback.</span> <span id="s4027">When we got married, we discovered that we more a -- we are on the same level.</span> <span id="s4028">My identity -- Jewish identity was stronger than Victor’s, because of the Zionist connection, number one and of course the fact that I was singled out during the war for being Jewish and nobody ever let me forget it.</span> <span id="s4029">You know, for the fact that I was going to be a victim any second, just because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s4030">So that most certainly, if nothing else, would remind me that that’s what I am.</span> <span id="s4031">So that when we got married, we also joined a -- a Reform Temple, in our area.</span> <span id="s4032">And our -- both children were Bar Mitzvahed in that Temple.</span> <span id="s4033">We -- we don’t have a kosher home, you know, we observe the Jewish holidays, we are members of the Temple all these years, the same Temple.</span> <span id="s4034">That goes back 35 years at least and -- we are not active in the Temple, even though they were trying to get us in, somehow or other, I don’t know, we never got involved in the Temple, but we are certainly very much interested in supporting the Temple financially and seeing that it’s viable then.</span> <span id="s4035">And we enjoy going there to services.</span> <span id="s4036">We go -- th-they have a Kristallnacht observance in Novembers, we go to that all the time.</span> <span id="s4037">We go to the Shoah observances, we go to -- in between the Jewish holidays, but we do not go regularly, like weekend services.</span> <span id="s4038">We don’t go regularly, every now and then we do go, so that to this day my religious orientation is within those bounds of -- of an inner life that does not need the reinforcement, but it needs the connection, you see?</span> <span id="s4039">The connection to -- to -- to Reform Judaism is very fine with me.</span> <span id="s4040">It -- it keeps me within the frame that can accommodate my inner self, you see?</span> <span id="s4041">Whereas if you put me to be with the Lubavitches, I would probably be rebelling to the point where I would deny that I’m Jewish, because I probably could not accept it as part of who I am.</span> <span id="s4042">You see, there’s too na -- th-th-th-th -- their -- their focus is too narrow and so on.</span> <span id="s4043">The Reform Temple has a wider focus and -- and that suits us very well.</span> <span id="s4044">So, to that extent, we are good Jews, so to say, not religious.</span> <span id="s4045">And certainly, as far as identity is concerned, not only hundred percent identity of Judaism, but a million percent, if there is such a thing, you see?</span> <span id="s4046">So, I -- I -- I hope this answers your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">Q: Had your war experience an impact on your faith in any way?</span> <span id="s4048">And had America?</span></p> <p><span id="s4049">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s4050">You see, I -- since I did not come from a background where religion was the answer, I did not seek the answer in religion during the war, obviously, you know?</span> <span id="s4051">And I don’t know that I -- I -- I -- I ever followed this idea of everything being preordained or predetermined.</span> <span id="s4052">I -- I believe in -- in free will, you see, and -- and so when I bak -- was in America and I became old enough to appreciate the philosophical un-underpinnings of religion, I rather liked where I came from, you see, and I was happy with the way I was and I’m happy the way I am.</span> <span id="s4053">And obviously we would have -- we would have changed one way or another, but obviously we carried on, in -- at the -- in the same vein, right through, so it has to sit well with us, otherwise we wouldn’t do it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s4054">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4055">And one last question, one final question.</span> <span id="s4056">You mentioned in our first interview, that you tried to be in touch with as many old friends from all different --</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">A: Connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s4058">Q: Connections, yeah.</span> <span id="s4059">Could you mention, maybe, just a -- a few people, a few persons?</span></p> <p><span id="s4060">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s4061">For example, I told you I know the students -- I mentioned before from my -- the Air F -- Air Force officers.</span> <span id="s4062">He was a colonel.</span> <span id="s4063">Now, we have been in touch for all these years.</span> <span id="s4064">They came to visit here, we went to Boulder, Colorado to visit them, we correspond all the time.</span> <span id="s4065">He sends me pictures, I send him pictures of the grandchildren and children and we tell each other, Christmastime, all the time -- by the way, I am a letter writer.</span> <span id="s4066">Other people don’t write letters any more, I do.</span> <span id="s4067">Now this is one old connection I -- people from Berlin, from the DP camp.</span> <span id="s4068">My very dearest, dearest friend from the DP camps -- DP camp, are still here.</span> <span id="s4069">One of them is George Schwab.</span> <span id="s4070">Another is Roma Lichtenthal, she’s also -- she lives in Scarsdale.</span> <span id="s4071">My friend in Argentina, I’m very close with her.</span> <span id="s4072">W-We write to each other, we see each other at least once a year, because she comes through New York once a year.</span> <span id="s4073">And that’s from the DP camp.</span> <span id="s4074">Of course, from high school -- I still have my friends from high school.</span> <span id="s4075">One lives in Albany.</span> <span id="s4076">We still are -- we’re still in touch, Toby.</span> <span id="s4077">My very best, dearest friend committed suicide.</span> <span id="s4078">She was from that connection, but that’s an whole other story, because she was very dependent on me for many years, so she was more like friend because she -- she was psychologically damaged and she was part of my family as long as she lived, for the reason that she was a needy person.</span> <span id="s4079">I don’t mean financially, you know, she had a Ph.D. and everything, but she was needy, very needy.</span> <span id="s4080">Then a friend from Poland, who lives in Brooklyn, who -- with whom I lived for awhile.</span> <span id="s4081">She’s another connection.</span> <span id="s4082">From Indiana University, certainly -- certainly, I have Nancy, who still lives in Montreal, retired now.</span> <span id="s4083">She was Professor of Biology.</span> <span id="s4084">Now, with Dr. Karpen, Jefferson High School, going back to Jefferson High School, when Dr. Karpen was alive and his wife was alive, I was with -- in correspondence with them all the time.</span> <span id="s4085">They had a summer home in Chichester, New York and whenever we used to go to the Catskills -- that’s also in the ca -- upper Catskills -- whenever we used to go to the Catskills, we used to go visit them, with the children.</span> <span id="s4086">I have lovely pictures from that period.</span> <span id="s4087">Miss Hay, who was alive, while she was alive, she lived in Seetawket.</span> <span id="s4088">Also went there, with the children, with -- for lunches, for dinners, we used to invite her, she came here.</span> <span id="s4089">I had another very favorite teacher from Brooklyn College speech class, Professor Lawson, she was a lovely woman.</span> <span id="s4090">Also, she died in California.</span> <span id="s4091">Unfortunately, all these people I’m talking about, who, through the years -- they were first here, then they were maybe very nearby and then they were moving away.</span> <span id="s4092">So, most of it remained as contact by correspondence, and I’m just trying to think, although I’m sure I wouldn’t do justice to most of my friends, to whom, I mean, th-th-th -- on Israel, well, of course, Israel is Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s4093">Israeli connection -- friends in Israel, with whom I correspond to [indecipherable] and see each other.</span> <span id="s4094">We go there, they come here.</span> <span id="s4095">That’s -- that’s more like family than friends.</span> <span id="s4096">That’s people that I went through -- we -- through the camps with and such.</span> <span id="s4097">And of course, I’m very much in touch with the Jewish organization, the Starachowice organization, which now, as I told you, also, unfortunately people are passing on and the thing is not what it used to be, so -- you know, we used to be invited to their Bar Mitzvahs and we used to go and visit and have these meetings once a year.</span> <span id="s4098">That is now -- most of it actually is thinning out.</span> <span id="s4099">The group is thinning out because of age -- they move away to Florida or they die.</span> <span id="s4100">Most of us now are getting on in age.</span> <span id="s4101">I -- I can’t begin to -- to think, from Bronx Science, when the kids were in Bronx Science, we made connections there, we had friends, neighborhood people.</span> <span id="s4102">I mean, the fact remains that I write letters and I -- I like to write letters.</span> <span id="s4103">My friend from Poland, who is now in Chicago, we’re in constant correspondence and I haven’t seen her maybe eight years, Irene.</span> <span id="s4104">But we -- and of course, the telephone helps, too.</span> <span id="s4105">And family, I -- family -- I’m very much attached to family, to cousins and such, so we -- that telephone takes care of that, all my -- my nieces and my nephews and my -- so that -- that goes without saying, but as far as friends are concerned, I can’t quite now remember off hand, but I can tell you, I have all these friends whom I call my connection.</span> <span id="s4106">This is a Berlin connection, this is a Thomas Jefferson connection.</span> <span id="s4107">This is Indiana connection, you see?</span> <span id="s4108">This is Bronx Science connection.</span> <span id="s4109">So I already have these categorized, these people categorized.</span> <span id="s4110">They are friends of equal importance, otherwise I wouldn’t have to -- stayed in touch.</span> <span id="s4111">It’s just that they are from different periods of my life and I will be very sorry to see when -- when writing letters is no longer fashionable, you know, because that will be a very great loss to -- to human contact, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s4112">Because I have Christian friends whom I don’t see for 10 - 15 years at the time.</span> <span id="s4113">Comes Christmas, I get a full letter, I write a full letter.</span> <span id="s4114">And that is -- that’s in fr -- friends from Indiana, from wherever.</span> <span id="s4115">I have -- and of course Poland.</span> <span id="s4116">I write to Poland a lot.</span> <span id="s4117">But I can just tell you that it’s like clockwork.</span> <span id="s4118">Comes Christmas, I spend two weeks writing letters, because I know that everybody’s going to write to me as well.</span> <span id="s4119">And I think this is just wonderful.</span> <span id="s4120">That’s -- that’s the way I love it.</span> <span id="s4121">And people who are going to dispose of -- of correspondence, will probably be very much poorer for it.</span> <span id="s4122">I -- I really feel that way.</span> <span id="s4123">I really, truly -- I adore receiving letters.</span> <span id="s4124">Not le -- not mail, not bills, letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s4125">Q: Well, maybe this concludes -- I think this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Regina Gelb.</span> <span id="s4126">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s4127">A:
