1992.</span> <span id="s5">I’m Anthony Di Iorio and I’m at the home of Mrs. Irene Shapiro in Ipsmont, New York and I’m here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington to interview Mrs. Shapiro about her experiences and those of her family during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6">Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Good afternoon to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: I thought perhaps we could begin by having you tell us where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I was born in the small Ukrainian town, Brezany.</span> <span id="s10">It was part of what’s now known as the Polish Ukraine and the breadbasket of both Poland and the Ukraine and later the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And when were you born there?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: 1925, which was ancient history of course, and well, I was born there as I explained to you.</span> <span id="s13">It was almost accidental, certainly not historically awaited, and that is, I was -- my parents were at that time living in a town on the Vistula River before it goes into the Gdansk Bay.</span> <span id="s14">The name is Gludjan.</span> <span id="s15">However that time there were no, very few Jewish people, perhaps, and no rabbis and no moyels and so my mother in her eighth or ninth month of pregnancy went by train two days back to Brezany where a midwife would deliver just a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Just a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Just a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: No.</span> <span id="s20">At that point I was the one and only, but later on another “just a girl” came along but she was born in Gludjan.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: So you were born in Brezany when it was part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Brezany became part of Poland in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And you grew up not in Brezany but in Gludjan?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Gludjan.</span> <span id="s25">Until 1938 I lived in that part.</span> <span id="s26">It was known as the corridor.</span> <span id="s27">It was everybody’s transit point since ancient times, since the Teutonic orders yet.</span> <span id="s28">And in 1938 my family was forced to leave the corridor or ____ and went to Bialystok, and that was an entirely different part of Poland.</span> <span id="s29">It was the formerly Russian part.</span> <span id="s30">Poland was under occupation for 150 years, and that part of Poland was a czarist part.</span> <span id="s31">So everybody spoke Russian and it had the looks of a Russian part.</span> <span id="s32">It was poorly maintained streets, whereas Gludjan was a western German, typically German town, and in 1938 for one year I attended the 4th grade of junior high school, Polish junior high school in the so-called Druszki Gymnasium which was the most expensive but very modern academically very advanced junior high school and high school.</span> <span id="s33">And then I entered the high school in 1939 but the high school became in the Soviet 10th year school ____.</span> <span id="s34">The Soviets occupied as part of Poland.</span> <span id="s35">This was the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement.</span> <span id="s36">It was fortunate for us as I told you before.</span> <span id="s37">The Germans did come to Belsic for one week and promised us a proper, final solution even then, but the Soviets intervened and so we lived under Soviet occupation and most ordinary people, and especially from the viewpoint of a child we had a very good time.</span> <span id="s38">This was the time when they sort of tried to schmaltz up to us kids, tried to get us to the Pioneer Organization and the Counselor Organization and politicized us and etc., etc., etc.</span> <span id="s39">I’ll never forget myself screaming at our landlord: ‘if you don’t fix that toilet I’m going to tell on you.’</span> <span id="s40">This was the time, but generally it was a normal time.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: You’re talking about the Russian occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: The Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s43">I wanted to set the record straight.</span> <span id="s44">People are expecting us to say all bad things about the Soviets.</span> <span id="s45">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s46">They were very careful about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s47">They put people in jail for anti-Semitic expression, so I saw absolutely, I saw nothing, but of course my friends whose fathers were factory owners and such were sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And what was their crime?</span> <span id="s49">Being a class enemy?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Bring class enemy having employed and not having workers testifying for them.</span> <span id="s51">Apparently if the workers testified and intervened they might have been given some jail sentence but their family was not removed and otherwise they were removed especially if they were very wealthy and didn’t get out.</span> <span id="s52">Most people who had that kind of money could also get out because Lithuania at the beginning was not yet a Soviet republic until 1940.</span> <span id="s53">There were quite a few months and many people did go through Lithuania, Romania and such.</span> <span id="s54">Some even got to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s55">Many had gone to China and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did any members of your family go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My uncle left Poland much before that as a young law student from Lember Wolf as a Zionist and --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: That’s your father’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: That’s my father’s brother and he was in Israel until very recently.</span> <span id="s60">In fact, I did not know, he adopted me.</span> <span id="s61">You see, I was nineteen and a half when the war finished and was still adoptable.</span> <span id="s62">I think it was still until twenty-one.</span> <span id="s63">And he adopted me.</span> <span id="s64">But I didn’t know and I went to the United States and he was just heartbroken, and I would have been his daughter in Israel while I was already in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Could you tell us more about growing up in Poland, as a little girl and then as a young adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, the times I had in Grujan were not particularly happy for me personally because I had a very strict father, still the Austrian school where you’ve got to be home on time, you can’t go --you can’t pal around with somebody whom we don’t know.</span> <span id="s67">And that let out most of the Jewish boys and girls that I knew.</span> <span id="s68">They were all daughters and sons of lower merchants and merchants and as I’m told by a friend whom I know now, my parents were stuck up.</span> <span id="s69">And I missed on this and I interpreted all this as it was I who wasn’t popular, nobody liked me, I had no friends and so forth.</span> <span id="s70">And I became --I was very bright, and excellent student, so I didn’t suffer any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s71">This was a Polish girls’ Gymnasium; I was the only Jewish child in class, but so good a student that I was always at the top of the list all the time.</span> <span id="s72">But I wasn’t very happy as very young teenager.</span> <span id="s73">Also most of the kids, they were a little older than I was and looked down upon me.</span> <span id="s74">But when I went to Bialystople, that made my day.</span> <span id="s75">I was in a Jewish school with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me.</span> <span id="s76">I became not only popular but I was voted in a an S.O.G.O. whatever, students’ organization president prior to the coming of the Soviets, and then after that when the Soviets marched in I ran into a problem because they voted me in but the Soviets didn’t want to have a non-Communist, and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s77">Well, that was the worst thing you should have stated.</span> <span id="s78">They were forced by my colleagues to let me be, to be the president of their Utchcom the student committee, but at home my mother packed my valise and waited for the NKVV then -- the KGB now -- to come and take me away cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very close to Marxism.</span> <span id="s79">In fact, Marxists, the Zionists and we the Jews have the same right to feel proud of our nationality, as did the other Soviet republics.</span> <span id="s80">I in essence negated the Jewish question of Stalin, the little pamphlet, that the Jews are not really a nation because they don’t have a land of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Sounds like your heart belongs to your uncle in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: It sort of disappeared on me.</span> <span id="s83">I was very easily swayed to look the other way and then I joined the Pioneers, you know, which wasn’t much of a plan either, and I sort of had the left-winger’s leniency because of my revolt against my parents and my grandparents.</span> <span id="s84">I played with daughters of supers in the house and working kids and so forth.</span> <span id="s85">So, in Soviet Bialystok I was very busy with political affairs of the school.</span> <span id="s86">I was on the committee and I was in charge of the newspaper and what not, very, very involved with that.</span> <span id="s87">Very little time for my poor mother, and it was the first time in her life that she didn’t have a servant.</span> <span id="s88">You had to have a doctor’s certificate to be entitled to a maid and she didn’t have.</span> <span id="s89">I feel very guilty about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Your activities as a student and with this paper, was this always in Polish or Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, no the school became a Russian school, a school with a Russian language of instruction.</span> <span id="s92">I am fluent, or was at least till the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You’re fluent in Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s95">I was a so-called otlichnica which means I had all “A”s and therefore I could enter the university without an exam.</span> <span id="s96">And based on that I was able to get my Regents, my graduation diploma because the list of these otlichnica was kept somewhere.</span> <span id="s97">I came here to the Soviet consulate, where they piously tried to say to me what are you doing in America, you should go back to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s98">But they did get me testimony of so-and-so, I gave the name of my director that I was a very good student ---- otlichnica.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: You were conducting your own pro-Zionist activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Oh, no, I knew better within a month.</span> <span id="s101">This was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s102">After people started disappearing and after my friends came to school crying, I knew better.</span> <span id="s103">It was just the beginning; no, after that I never owned up to anything other, oh, I fervently, I very much -- I really enjoyed what was happening.</span> <span id="s104">You have to understand this.</span> <span id="s105">They made us, as kids feel very important.</span> <span id="s106">I discussed this with the people who survived that.</span> <span id="s107">We all had the same feeling.</span> <span id="s108">Who cared what they did to the grownups, or the capitalists.</span> <span id="s109">I mean we were kids and they had all kinds of things for the kids.</span> <span id="s110">They had a way of getting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: You’re referring now to the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s113">And, well, we were too young.</span> <span id="s114">You couldn’t even think of being a Communist.</span> <span id="s115">In fact, that isn’t what they were interested in.</span> <span id="s116">They wanted us to be supportive, and we were, some of us at least.</span> <span id="s117">I was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: How would you describe or summarize the political information of the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: You see, Bialystok always had a left-wing population.</span> <span id="s120">They were not Communists; they were -----.</span> <span id="s121">It was the second international.</span> <span id="s122">I don’t know, besides the leaders who were sent out, some of them, most of them I think, switched.</span> <span id="s123">They had a large workers population that possibly support them and the rest were as anybody else.</span> <span id="s124">I was very opportunistic.</span> <span id="s125">That was the way to get a job.</span> <span id="s126">That was the way to get ahead and my father had a warm feeling about the Soviets because really they saved his life, you know.</span> <span id="s127">He was caught up in the revolution.</span> <span id="s128">He was captured as an Austrian prisoner of war and when they took him out of that prison, it was going from whites to reds, from whites to reds, and the reds ---</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You’re talking about World War I and then the Revolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: 1917 -- that’s right, and he was when the reds came, he was pronounced to be a white, or was it the other way around, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s131">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s132">So they were supposed to execute him, and they did apparently, but one of the ladies there whom my father was in love with traded his freedom for some money or what and he became -- they liberated him and he was able to go home, so he was very, very thankful to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How did your father get to be a judge?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: He was the bandleader in the army.</span> <span id="s135">He was, I think, an officer.</span> <span id="s136">I have a feeling that the bandleaders had to be.</span> <span id="s137">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: In the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Polish army.</span> <span id="s140">He was at that time, when he was, after the Revolution, he was offered the freedom of joining of them forming Siberian legions of --- which he did and via the Far East through China, Hong Kong, he went around through Persia, I would say, through the Persian Gulf and so forth, and Suez I would say and came back home, in the legion.</span> <span id="s141">And stayed in the Polish army till much after Poland was formed and still was fighting with the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s142">He was in the middle of the Battle of Warsaw, the famous battle, and christened forever by that fact and had difficulties with the Soviet people because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What was he by vocation?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: My father was a violinist.</span> <span id="s145">He was desperately trying to play in the Huberman Symphony Orchestra in Palestine at that time and somehow couldn’t get out, but he was an excellent violinist.</span> <span id="s146">He was an excellent violinist but there was absolutely no making a living that way in Poland for a Jew.</span> <span id="s147">And he might have tried other symphony orchestras too, and he couldn’t get in; he couldn’t get out, get out.</span> <span id="s148">As a matter of fact, my father had an American visa.</span> <span id="s149">As late as 1939 a visa was waiting for him in Warsaw, but not for us and not for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Just for your father …</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: And he refused to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Had he tried to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">My uncle here in California got him the visa but refused get it for his family.</span> <span id="s155">That was the way it was done in the days past.</span> <span id="s156">The husband would come and then bring his family, but my father knew better.</span> <span id="s157">He knew the war was coming and so he didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Now where did your father grow up?</span> <span id="s159">He was born in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: He was born in the same town, Brezany and that’s where he grew up.</span> <span id="s161">He was the oldest of three children of my grandfather who always impressed me as an Austrian sergeant who marches through town and everybody would bow to him and that again was an old Austrian household with a very strict father and I guess my father perpetuated this.</span> <span id="s162">I think I broke the vicious cycle.</span> <span id="s163">I became the democratic parent.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Your father was strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: My father was extremely strict.</span> <span id="s166">I think that he realized what he was doing when he was taking his exams in pedagogy.</span> <span id="s167">He would tell me “Hmm, now I know why you always say no and never yes.”</span> <span id="s168">And I guess he had an idea he was not raising us properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: When he spoke to you when he was being strict, did he speak to you in Polish or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No, only in Polish.</span> <span id="s171">We spoke Polish at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was he strict when it came to religious matters?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No.</span> <span id="s174">We were not religious.</span> <span id="s175">Most westernized Jews were really once a year, one day or two days Jews, so called and that is they’d go to synagogue on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s176">My parents were keeping tradition in a modern sense.</span> <span id="s177">All these modern children’s holidays were maintained.</span> <span id="s178">The little community in --- maintained all the holidays and they had a Zionist organization to which I was not allowed to belong but nevertheless I was taught Hebrew.</span> <span id="s179">They imported a teacher from Warsaw, a young man who taught us boys and girls Modern Hebrew and religion with it.</span> <span id="s180">To that extent we were Jewish, with all the holidays maintained more or less the way American Jews, those who are not Orthodox, the sort of social life centering around the suburban synagogue, the reform temple.</span> <span id="s181">That is more or less what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: My grandparents were modern too, but a little less, because they still kept a kosher house and I had the most miserable time to remember which knife went where and why I shouldn’t take butter with the same knife or fork.</span> <span id="s184">I was just flabbergasted but to that extent they were more religious, but my grandmother did not have the wig, and again they didn’t go to, they did not, they maintained, they lit candles for Sabbath.</span> <span id="s185">We didn’t, not very much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did they live in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: They lived in Brezany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: How did your father get to _____?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Again another not very large town that nobody ever heard of.</span> <span id="s190">Another accident.</span> <span id="s191">His army unit was sent to, this was a very big army and air force base.</span> <span id="s192">I think it was the 67th -- Polish army something, and that’s where he stayed and that’s where he was discharged and he fell in love with this little town.</span> <span id="s193">He played at that time in cafes, and they had a French-style café where you would sit and have coffee and eat a very fine piece of cake and listen to some nice Viennese violin playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: He was a violinist.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s196">And the orchestra leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Oh, orchestra leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: He had his own violin?</span> <span id="s200">What type of music did he ---</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: (Cough) I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s202">Almost any kind, but I would surmise that if it was a café it was chamber music of the lightest type, Viennese, Schubert.</span> <span id="s203">Ours was a very musical home; I played the piano, my father played the violin, my sister danced, and this was our trio.</span> <span id="s204">We had Friday coffee hours with German friends of my father would be invited for “café mit zamen” which meant coffee with cream, and the children and the father would perform.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: How about your mother?</span> <span id="s206">Did she …</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: My mother refrained.</span> <span id="s208">She was an operetta and an opera buff from her Viennese times and she would sing a little but she did not perform, no.</span> <span id="s209">She was a very sweet, soft, very kind person.</span> <span id="s210">I will never forget my mother giving bread in a concentration camp to a child.</span> <span id="s211">That was not done.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What did your father do for a living once he left the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: He was playing in the café for a while and met some people and drank with those musicians ----- because when I went back to Poland in 1956 I called up some people who said to me, “Ah, that was a musician; they don’t make them nowadays this way.’</span> <span id="s214">So he was still known.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: I recall when we were looking at photos of your father --- he was a teacher, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: He was having memory loss spells when he was giving concerts --- Well that’s what he was doing in Gdansk; he probably went to give concerts, and he was in the middle of something ______ and he would take bromides to be able to play, and finally the doctors told him “Sir, you better give it up.”</span> <span id="s217">So he did.</span> <span id="s218">He went back to Lumber____ and whatever pedagogy classes and music appreciation and whatever else he had to do and took exams with everybody at home frightened out of their wits while he was studying and took the exams one or two or three evenings and passed and got his license.</span> <span id="s219">And he started teaching music in a German school, Folkschule and Gymnasium which is the high school, more than a high school.</span> <span id="s220">A high school plus.</span> <span id="s221">And that’s how he finished his career.</span> <span id="s222">He was always a musician; once a musician, always a musician.</span> <span id="s223">So he still entertained for the Jewish community, and he gave of himself or organized a mandolin orchestra; he was an extremely gifted musician.</span> <span id="s224">He played one, two, three, four, maybe five instruments besides the violin.</span> <span id="s225">He orchestrated his own music.</span> <span id="s226">He wrote excellent scores for the silent movies.</span> <span id="s227">This was a gift.</span> <span id="s228">He was an excellent conductor also, a very --- I watch some and I see -- very sad -- when I think of my father; that’s the kind he was, and very gifted, wrote his own music, orchestrated almost anything and he performed all through his life with the children.</span> <span id="s229">Kids were very fond of him; he was very handsome.</span> <span id="s230">Now I have friends who would say “Hah, well of course he looked at me once or twice!”</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: These friends who were students…</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes, they were having a crush on him, and he conducted choral groups in all languages.</span> <span id="s233">We spoke about Yiddish; in Bialystok this was a literary Yiddish not just a jargon, a beautiful language, and somehow he mastered it.</span> <span id="s234">He must have been able to read it -- the Yiddish alphabet -- and he taught the students Yiddish folk songs which I sing to this day with my guitar.</span> <span id="s235">And just a very gifted person; that’s how he died.</span> <span id="s236">I was told by people who got out of ___ Majdanek in October, that they’d seen him in camp orchestra.</span> <span id="s237">So they must have gotten him a violin; his was taken right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: These friends who were students …</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes, they were having a crush on him and he conducted</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: In November of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: ’43.</span> <span id="s242">And I am told that the orchestra people were the last to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So he went to his martyrdom because --- yet in the 1930’s he was teaching music to German students.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: How he got to teaching Germans -- I think he started with the Germans because he spoke German.</span> <span id="s245">My teachers -- all my music teachers were German.</span> <span id="s246">We palled around with many____; they were very lovely people.</span> <span id="s247">They were all Socialists by the way__.</span> <span id="s248">He dealt not with the Deutsche Reich.</span> <span id="s249">He dealt with the Volkdeutsche.</span> <span id="s250">They were much less anti-Semitic than were the Poles.</span> <span id="s251">And those were our friends and they, I am told, behaved very, very nobly, by my friends in ____ today.</span> <span id="s252">And these were his friends and I guess they lined up some kind of contact for him both for ___ and here and then next step was to become a teacher for the high school, for the elementary and the high school.</span> <span id="s253">I doubt if the Polish high school would have had a Jew.</span> <span id="s254">There wasn’t a single Jewish teacher there, no.</span> <span id="s255">But they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: But he got along well with German community in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Until ’35, 6, 7, whenever, when the students started wearing their swastikas.</span> <span id="s258">What do you mean, you have a Jew?!</span> <span id="s259">Not everybody knew he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s260">H-A-S-S, S-F as it is written in German is not a Jewish name, and Adolph was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: ---name in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: So they got to know it when it was important to know and when the director of the school, whose name was Hildebrand, I couldn’t forget, wrote the most beautiful letter, “I am ashamed to have to dismiss you, but such are the times, and I wish you the best of luck, and you are a fine, fine musician, and so forth.”</span> <span id="s263">He cherished that letter.</span> <span id="s264">Those were the Volkdeutsche.</span> <span id="s265">The few who were ashamed of what was happening, but times were changing, and it was in Poland.</span> <span id="s266">They weren’t free to march as Nazis; it was all hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: When was he dismissed?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s269">That was after the Anschluss of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: After the Sudeten …</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: The Sudeten, right.</span> <span id="s272">So at that point it was obvious that Poland was on it’s way to becoming the next customer.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And he was dismissed because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s274">And who ran, who financed the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: That school was financed from Germany.</span> <span id="s276">This is why they had to dismiss him.</span> <span id="s277">Perhaps if it was a Polish school they would not have -- no, they couldn’t have dismissed him on that -- that, the principal made sure that he’d know that he wasn’t being dismissed because he was an incompetent teacher but that he was ---</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: The mandate came from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s280">___.</span> <span id="s281">On racial grounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: How were your father and mother’s relations with Poles in that ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Very good.</span> <span id="s284">She was a good neighbor, ‘cause when we went to my apartment the neighbors would say, “Ach, that was a house where you could always borrow a glass of vinegar.”</span> <span id="s285">And I remember going to funerals of people, and it was a very good relationship, and once again, this was a non-Jewish town, and until this anti-Jewish sensitization happened via students, the National Democratic Polish Party where they had picket lines in front of stores -- “Don’t buy here, buy ___,” there wasn’t any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s286">It was completely unknown.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s289">All of my -- I was the only Jewish student in my class, so since I was not allowed very often to meet with my Jewish friends, because they were freer and they could do things on their own, they weren’t – it was important, it was described in my home as a ____ you see, “upbringing”, the proper one, how to sit at the table, and what to say, and when to say, and how to say thank you, when to come home, and --- the Polish Jews, coming from Poland proper didn’t quite, it was the nouveau riche sort of atmosphere as opposed to the grandfather to father to daughter Austrian upbringing and so my parents were afraid that I would learn bad things.</span> <span id="s290">So, yes, I was allowed to play with the daughters and sons, daughters, no sons, daughters of the Polish officers and so forth who went to my school.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: No Jewish friends …</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes, a Jewish friend and she’s alive and in Rhode Island and I just discovered her.</span> <span id="s293">She’s a few years older.</span> <span id="s294">She was the daughter of an engineer, also with a good upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you notice any difference between the Germans and the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: The two didn’t mix.</span> <span id="s297">Not at any time.</span> <span id="s298">The Germans were very large -- they were business people and very largely gentry more or less, so they were living on the outskirts and had gardens and such.</span> <span id="s299">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: How about in relations with Jews, the way Germans dealt with Jews and the way Poles dealt with Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Germans had no dealings with Jews other than my father because there was 150 families of Jews and the Germans kept to themselves.</span> <span id="s302">It was a tightly closed community.</span> <span id="s303">My father had dealings with them because he organized their community house activities.</span> <span id="s304">He was very well regarded until the onslaught of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Earlier you mentioned there was an increase of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s306">Did you notice any changes in the school that you were attending?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s308">I personally didn’t have any attack; I was accepted.</span> <span id="s309">I think partially because my father was an officer of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s310">He was the proper Jew, but my friend, the one who’s now in Florida told me she was badly mistreated.</span> <span id="s311">She was a poor student.</span> <span id="s312">It still didn’t compare with what we had to -- it was a kind of gentleman’s agreement.</span> <span id="s313">That’s what we had.</span> <span id="s314">It didn’t compare with what was happening in towns where there were a lot of Jews and the National Democratic Party.</span> <span id="s315">Don’t forget, these were the times where the Jewish students had to sit in a separate portion of the university where ritual slaughter was being forbidden and where Foreign Minister Beck was a German and ___ who was pro-Jewish or at least benevolent</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Not anti-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Was ___ after ’35 and ___ who was the field marshal that time was my family’s personal friend.</span> <span id="s318">He comes from Brezany.</span> <span id="s319">That was the funny part but I don’t think he would have stood up for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Just the fact that he established the quotas at the university .</span> <span id="s321">.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: The universities.</span> <span id="s323">It was either numerous klauses or numerous.</span> <span id="s324">In Warsaw you had klauses and in (?)</span> <span id="s325">you had klauses, but they had the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: During these years did you know who Hitler was?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s328">I knew he was .</span> <span id="s329">.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: What was being said of him in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: We were busy.</span> <span id="s332">I guess the Jews of (?)</span> <span id="s333">were busy with Polish anti-Semitism because at that point they were having all this happening but we knew.</span> <span id="s334">I now read the letter that my American relatives had that my father wrote in 1938.</span> <span id="s335">“We are heading for a catastrophe.</span> <span id="s336">Help us.</span> <span id="s337">We’re sinking.”</span> <span id="s338">I cried bitterly.</span> <span id="s339">“Help us!”</span> <span id="s340">He tried Holland, he tried the poor relatives they had here in the Bronx and he knew.</span> <span id="s341">So my parents knew.</span> <span id="s342">I was as much aware as the average American junior high school student.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Do you wish to elaborate on .</span> <span id="s344">.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s346">I was about that much involved.</span> <span id="s347">I read the children’s version of the Polish-Jewish newspaper “Nash Schaglone” which came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s348">It was primarily jokes and puzzles and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So these were probably the days when your father’s beginning to try to get a visa to go to America, that you mentioned earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s351">I think he tried in ’37 or ’38.</span> <span id="s352">I would say ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: After being dismissed.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I think that summer was the crucial summer -- no, he must have been told that he would be released before.</span> <span id="s355">The spring, right.</span> <span id="s356">And that’s -- he didn’t think he would get a j ob and then towards the end another letter said that he was settling in Bialystok, but before that he tried through a rabbi who knew somebody in Amsterdam to contact the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s357">As a musician he did have a profession where he didn’t really need the language.</span> <span id="s358">He could have settled somewhere but nothing came forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: The summer of ’38 is when you .</span> <span id="s360">.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Were you still in touch with the rest of the staff at Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s364">I went to Brezany in 1935, ’36, ’37 and ’38 for my vacation.</span> <span id="s365">There was a railroad executive who my parents knew from Brezany and I would go with them.</span> <span id="s366">We would go by train.</span> <span id="s367">So that’s how I knew Brezany.</span> <span id="s368">It was the first time that I encountered boys and the story goes that anything that wore pants was an absolute object of awe on my part after the years of starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: You’re talking about after .</span> <span id="s370">.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: ---.</span> <span id="s372">And I’d go there and be able to have at least walk counter-clockwise with the boys walking one way and we’d walk the other way.</span> <span id="s373">It was known as the Curso.</span> <span id="s374">And then I would have big eyes -- anything –</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Promenade?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Promenade, yes.</span> <span id="s377">With this cousin of mine, and the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: You were close to at least one cousin in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Ah, no.</span> <span id="s380">This one and the one who’s older than I. Very close.</span> <span id="s381">I would spend days with them; there was a gigantic, gigantic lake in Brezany with a beautiful beach and early in the mornings, supplied with a big lunch, I would go walk with my cousins and all their friends to swim, and I was an excellent swimmer.</span> <span id="s382">And that was Brezany.</span> <span id="s383">I’d gain about 20 pounds and be all sun tanned and come home and my mother would say, “Oh, God Almighty, you look like a Ukrainian peasant’, and I would lose my very, very Mazurish, which is a very chopped Polish accent and speak with a very, very sort of like southern Polish accent, and was spoiled by my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Your grandmother and grandfather were … how did she spoil you?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I mean, she just allowed -- well, I was always chaperoned.</span> <span id="s386">The cousin who was my chaperon is now in Mexico.</span> <span id="s387">I was only allowed to go (?)</span> <span id="s388">in the evening, in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s389">She spoiled me by feeding me and there was no end to it, spoiled me by having time with me.</span> <span id="s390">Scanty time with my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s391">My mother was very much involved with my father; maybe it was my fault.</span> <span id="s392">I really wasn’t a child who would go and converse very much, but there I was very giving and -- permissive people.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Grandmother Ida.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s395">My grandmother Ida; the other one was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Do you have a sense of what she was thinking during these years about the world and about the dangers that your father …</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, it was never, it wasn’t customary to speak with children.</span> <span id="s398">I never heard anything spoken other than my own parents who were discussing it at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s399">Not there.</span> <span id="s400">They had no such thoughts.</span> <span id="s401">That was a different part of Poland.</span> <span id="s402">Here my father was actually threatened from two points of view.</span> <span id="s403">We could see the border on a clear day.</span> <span id="s404">There was no question about it if the war started (?)</span> <span id="s405">would be occupied within half an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: How about relations between Jews and gentiles in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Bad.</span> <span id="s408">Good with the Poles, because they themselves were a minority there.</span> <span id="s409">And they were of the higher class.</span> <span id="s410">The Ukrainians hated their guts, but nothing was ever done.</span> <span id="s411">You did not have to (?)</span> <span id="s412">.</span> <span id="s413">Oh, incidents, but I mean.</span> <span id="s414">The city was, the town was largely Jewish with Ukrainians and Poles on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s415">And now, my uncle the lawyer was handling gentiles exclusively because I know because they paid with chickens and geese and eggs.</span> <span id="s416">That was the lawyer’s fee very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What was your cousin Sylvia doing…</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Oh, Sylvia, fist of all, was not only older in years, she was older, older.</span> <span id="s419">I was a child.</span> <span id="s420">One of my cousins claimed that I was a real teenager because I was imitating her.</span> <span id="s421">But Sylvia was a lady or a sort of somebody to be admired by the whole town.</span> <span id="s422">She always walked with her mother.</span> <span id="s423">I was being trained.</span> <span id="s424">See, her mother was gathering her dowry.</span> <span id="s425">I never even heard of it.</span> <span id="s426">My parents were saving money for my medical school.</span> <span id="s427">It was a different kind of thing.</span> <span id="s428">It was a little town, and there she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So Sylvia was planning on getting married.</span> <span id="s430">Did she have a fiancé?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: She had, yes, well, I was in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s432">Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s433">Yes, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: In Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: In Brezany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: She finished her schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: She did, no, she graduated before me.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: But she finished her schooling with high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, with a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s440">In ’39, no ’41.</span> <span id="s441">No, it couldn’t, I, She graduated in ’39 and I graduated in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: She graduated before the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Was she working or…</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, I was told that she was working after that during Soviet times.</span> <span id="s446">And she had a fiancé who was a student in (?)</span> <span id="s447">, really a fiancé, ‘cause I had a boyfriend, but nobody called him a fiancé.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: It was just a ghetto friendship which, boy-girl explorations, which were the end of the world kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So, Sylvia was planning on getting married and…</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: In a proper way, with the two families introduced and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So, it wasn’t a childhood sweetheart?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s454">Somebody she met, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: From Lvov (?)</span> <span id="s456">?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Lvov, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And she was working during the time of the Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: She was.</span> <span id="s460">Everybody was.</span> <span id="s461">You had to.</span> <span id="s462">You had to.</span> <span id="s463">Unless you had somebody who was incapacitated.</span> <span id="s464">My mother really had a very weak heart, angina and so forth, so … not that they forced you but there wasn’t enough to eat if you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Your grandparents were still in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: They were retired I would imagine by…</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: My grandmother never worked but my grandfather was a retired person all through the Polish --in between the Polish republics.</span> <span id="s469">He was getting his Austrian pension…</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: He was an Austrian civil servant?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s472">That’s what he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">(END OF SIDE A) I now recollect that during the Soviet times my father was sending money and I would put the two and two together knowing what I know about the Soviet Union that they probably did not honor the pensions.</span> <span id="s474">Or did they?</span> <span id="s475">I don’t know, but somehow I’m under the impression that things were tough at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Where were you and your family when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I was in Bialystok and during our graduation ball, came home, got to bed and suddenly the bomb was flying.</span> <span id="s478">My father was at the airport walking with the students when he saw the bombing of the airport, the Soviet airplane.</span> <span id="s479">And we had a Soviet officer living in our house, one room was rented, and he walked out.</span> <span id="s480">He says, “Oh what stupid guys, it must be maneuvers.</span> <span id="s481">They must have done something wrong.’</span> <span id="s482">It was one bomb.</span> <span id="s483">It wasn’t maneuvers.</span> <span id="s484">Then we heard (?)</span> <span id="s485">announcing that they were invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: This was the Soviet invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: That was the German invasion of the occupied territory of Poland.</span> <span id="s488">We were almost at the end of it, almost at the end of it…</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So in September 1939 German troops marched into…</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: September 1939 was their original…Oh, you’re talking about…</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Yeah, that’s what I was referring to, when war broke out.</span> <span id="s492">Yeah, you were in Bialystok when the war began in September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: ’39.</span> <span id="s494">The Polish-Soviet, the Polish-German war.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, that lasted a very short time.</span> <span id="s497">The Polish army suddenly was no longer there.</span> <span id="s498">It was busy fighting the Soviet army, not the German army.</span> <span id="s499">It was from both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Bialystok received some visitations, did it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Bialystok received a visitation.</span> <span id="s502">Even before all of this there were some Germans infiltrating there but it had the Germans in for a week.</span> <span id="s503">I believe that the fighting took maybe a week, certainly not more.</span> <span id="s504">And in September, whenever the Yom Kippur, the Rosh Hashanah came, they were already there, for a week.</span> <span id="s505">Yeah.</span> <span id="s506">But this was the beginning of the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s507">The final solution was yet postponed.</span> <span id="s508">That was the beginning.</span> <span id="s509">I don’t know how they worked it in Poland proper.</span> <span id="s510">They were killing people but weren’t as organized; it wasn’t yet a conveyer belt operation.</span> <span id="s511">So I can’t think of any atrocities of that time.</span> <span id="s512">It was a week of intimidations, I would say.</span> <span id="s513">They would come over to a Jew with a beard and smack him and do things like that, nothing beyond this, but they were promising it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: They were.</span> <span id="s516">I overheard them talking, that within a week they were going to become much less gentlemanly.</span> <span id="s517">And we expected it.</span> <span id="s518">We already knew what they were capable of doing because they’ve done it to German Jews.</span> <span id="s519">Yes, I was aware of German Jews being, former Polish Jews, who lived in Germany, being thrown back to Poland, and what they were doing, the euthanasia programs and the concentration camp of Buchenwald existed.</span> <span id="s520">The German Socialists and Communists were being persecuted and German Jews.</span> <span id="s521">Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s522">All this was already known.</span> <span id="s523">So we at that point knew what to expect, and I was on breadlines when they said that on Yom Kippur they were going to celebrate that holiday properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: The Germans would?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: The Jews would.</span> <span id="s526">The Germans were (?)</span> <span id="s527">a girl standing, you will read this, and I came home, I said, and told my parents about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: The Germans were saying that the Jews---</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: That the Jews -- don’t worry about the Jews.</span> <span id="s530">We will, we know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s531">But they already, within a day or two they were removing their belongings, their telephone lines and everything, leaving us.</span> <span id="s532">And the Soviets came in and were greeted with flowers and songs, by all but the Poles.</span> <span id="s533">They did not trust them.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Well, their country had been invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: And vice-versa.</span> <span id="s536">The Russians, this is why, this is why, not that they so very much loved the Jews.</span> <span id="s537">They were the only ones who they could trust.</span> <span id="s538">They had nothing against the Soviets, the Jews.</span> <span id="s539">Here they came and liberated them from Germans.</span> <span id="s540">Anybody would be a hero, and certainly they were.</span> <span id="s541">And the capitalists were the only ones who knew, but didn’t know to what extent they would be persecuted.</span> <span id="s542">Yes, everybody knew about the purges in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s543">I didn’t, but the older people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So the Jews of Bialystok were glad to see the Russians come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And how was the German evacuation…</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: The German evacuation was very curious.</span> <span id="s548">I didn’t see that part, but I did see, while the Germans were moving, at the same time in one such street, I saw a contingent of Jews with a red flag.</span> <span id="s549">Now can you imagine Nazis and the red flag?</span> <span id="s550">You can only do that brazenly when you know that this will be done with impunity.</span> <span id="s551">And that’s what they were counting on and of course the Germans weren’t doing anything at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: The Jews were waving red flags…</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: And throwing things at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Throwing things at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Eggs and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Throwing eggs at the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And they made a note and they came and knew about Bialystok already, knew where it came from, from the Jewish sector.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So the period of the Russian occupation was a relatively safe period for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: To the non-capitalists.</span> <span id="s560">By capitalists I’m simply talking about very rich people, or people who were in some way intimidating workers, and there were such always.</span> <span id="s561">And, oh, no, politically involved people, Polish officers, policemen, not fanatical Zionists, all leaders, all leaders were in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How did the Russians treat your father, who after all had been an officer in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: They didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: They didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No.</span> <span id="s566">My father hid his army booklet.</span> <span id="s567">I don’t think he burned it because he felt maybe he’d have to use it some day, but he hid it and he told them he didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s568">You had to give up our military and your Polish passport to get a Soviet passport.</span> <span id="s569">We became a Soviet Byelorussia, Byeloruss now.</span> <span id="s570">And he hid it and they disbelieved that.</span> <span id="s571">You don’t lose a military booklet, whatever it was, or any document.</span> <span id="s572">You don’t travel, you don’t go shopping with it for sure, but he wouldn’t give it, so they called me.</span> <span id="s573">The KVD requested my presence.</span> <span id="s574">Mother was scared to testify against my father but I knew better.</span> <span id="s575">At that point I certainly never would have been politicized against my father personally, but I wasn’t even politicized against, for them, or against Zionism.</span> <span id="s576">This was not yet, they hadn’t reached me and all I knew was that my father was in trouble.</span> <span id="s577">Was he an officer?</span> <span id="s578">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s579">Was he in the army?</span> <span id="s580">I think so, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s581">Have you ever seen any booklet?</span> <span id="s582">I haven’t seen any of his papers.</span> <span id="s583">That’s how it went, hour after hour.</span> <span id="s584">The only time I knew what it was like was when we had the hearings of Anita Hill.</span> <span id="s585">You remember Specter?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: That’s how I was interrogated.</span> <span id="s588">And I wrote a letter to Specter and told him that.</span> <span id="s589">That was a shameful performance.</span> <span id="s590">This way you can get almost any “truth” that you wish to get, and that’s how, but they didn’t break me down.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did they interrogate your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No.</span> <span id="s593">They knew that if they ever going to get something it would be through the kids.</span> <span id="s594">The bad guy and the good guy.</span> <span id="s595">You know that routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Was your father able to continue working as a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: He was not only able to, because he really had a very good story to tell, that he was in the Soviet Union during the Revolution, that he certainly wasn’t siding with the Whites, and why should he have?</span> <span id="s598">He was just an Austrian soldier, that he, that they made him a commissar of something the month or two that he was there.</span> <span id="s599">But he was also just a musician, just a teacher, and that’s what was called (?)</span> <span id="s600">.</span> <span id="s601">You were between the working people and the peasants.</span> <span id="s602">So, so long as you weren’t tied in with the capitalists, you were a safe social class and they (?)</span> <span id="s603">He was very well regarded and he did know Russia.</span> <span id="s604">He still remembered enough.</span> <span id="s605">So he worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s606">He was involved with the (?)</span> <span id="s607">which was sort of the children of the schools were creative in all kinds of musical and dance ways and they had Olympiads to that effect and he was going to Minsk and to Moscow with his choral groups.</span> <span id="s608">He worked in high schools.</span> <span id="s609">He was working very hard, very tired, but he surely liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: This was a good time for you as well as for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: For me it was a grand time.</span> <span id="s612">I was allowed to stay up late.</span> <span id="s613">The school was a second session.</span> <span id="s614">I would be there in the evening.</span> <span id="s615">Boys were coming from Warsaw, you know, the refugees were coming and I met some very nice, interesting people, and that was the time that I actually met with true Communists for the first time.</span> <span id="s616">Those were people who were imprisoned in Poland.</span> <span id="s617">The Polish Communist Party was illegal.</span> <span id="s618">Some people sat in prison ‘till the Soviets came.</span> <span id="s619">Their daughters and sons were different than we were.</span> <span id="s620">They really and truly believed in Marxism.</span> <span id="s621">And they were also nice people; all they said was very plausible, ethical, and I was very impressed with it.</span> <span id="s622">Little did I know what else was behind, that I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: So you’re a high school student at a school that is now a Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: It became a Russian school.</span> <span id="s625">And at first it looked as if I was going to be in trouble because very childishly and naively when we had our electioneering, I told them, thinking that I’m doing something great, I said, “I was a left wing Zionist!”</span> <span id="s626">Little did I know that it was a dirty word.</span> <span id="s627">You don’t ever, you can be all left wing you want, you’re still a nationalist, you’re still a Zionist, that’s a nationalist.</span> <span id="s628">We don’t believe that.</span> <span id="s629">Marxist is not even a second international -- you know.</span> <span id="s630">It’s a …</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: That’s purging the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: It would have been just as bad if I told them that -- worse, if I told them I was a Trotskyite and just as bad if I told them I was a Buden member.</span> <span id="s633">This was Hashomer Hatzayir (?)</span> <span id="s634">in 1939, I was a gymnast in their camp.</span> <span id="s635">To that extent I was a Zionist, so I pronounced it proudly.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How did Brezany fare under the Russian occupation?</span> <span id="s637">Were there any changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No.</span> <span id="s639">I would surmise that all of the towns that I know had about the same fare, and that is influx of Soviets, we called them (?)</span> <span id="s640">, or the (?)</span> <span id="s641">, eastern people would come.</span> <span id="s642">First we poked fun of them.</span> <span id="s643">They didn’t know how to dress (?)</span> <span id="s644">.</span> <span id="s645">All the institutions will become (?)</span> <span id="s646">but it became Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yes, there is a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, but you don’t run pogroms at a time that they are trying to pronounce themselves Internationalists.</span> <span id="s649">In our case I’m telling you this is the truth and everybody would corroborate that a person who was sitting in a dentist’s office went ahead of a Jewish patient and that Jewish patient said, “That’s an anti-Semite” he had to serve in prison a day or two at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: That’s under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s652">They were very, very correct.</span> <span id="s653">They were trying to force my school to become a Yiddish-speaking school, saying “Aren’t you ashamed to speak Polish with all the Polish anti-Semitism?”</span> <span id="s654">It was a whole different ball game.</span> <span id="s655">They were conducting, they had a university in Yiddish in (?)</span> <span id="s656">They had a Yiddish library in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s657">All the songs, everything was in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s658">They promoted, not Hebrew, not Zion, but Yiddish.</span> <span id="s659">That’s what was happening, and the same thing was happening there except there it wasn’t Yiddish, it was maybe Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: The Russians were calling the shots.</span> <span id="s661">The Ukrainians are not –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: The (?)</span> <span id="s663">Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s665">Keeping in mind the relations between the Ukrainians and Poles, the Ukrainians and Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Ukrainians hated the Soviets to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Uh hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I don’t think the Russians trusted the Ukrainians as much as they trusted the Jews, for a simple reason.</span> <span id="s669">What could the Jews do but be obedient citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So the union of Polish Ukraine with the Ukrainian republic is more nominal than real.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Nominal.</span> <span id="s672">It became a Soviet Ukraine.</span> <span id="s673">So did ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Now, where were you when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union and come to Bialystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I was (?)</span> <span id="s676">that I was home.</span> <span id="s677">That was the day, the year of my graduating from the Soviet tenth year of school, in lieu of the lycee of science which I was really part of, and that was June 21st, I think, 22nd perhaps, 22nd.</span> <span id="s678">And on the night of the 21st and the day of the 21st we had our graduation ball in school.</span> <span id="s679">I came home very late; that was also my first kiss with a boy, which I won’t forget.</span> <span id="s680">And that early morning they bombed something in the city, I don’t -- forget -- a house.</span> <span id="s681">One house, and we thought, and so did the Soviet officer in our house that this was some mishap with the maneuvers, but they didn’t know that they were attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So it was a big surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s684">I saw soldiers coming out in their underwear to get to their units.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Nobody that you knew even suspected or talked about the possibility that --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s687">There was a talk that they had seen Germans, that they had seen strange people walking around pointing to the pictures of Stalin, Molotov, (?)</span> <span id="s688">, etc., etc. “That’s not going to be here the day after --“ and the date was given.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: You were very close to the German frontier.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: They infiltrated, we were told, with the refugees yet.</span> <span id="s691">You see, the Jewish refugees were coming in 1940, winter of 1940.</span> <span id="s692">They opened the borders.</span> <span id="s693">They knew what was going to happen to Jews, and allowed them in.</span> <span id="s694">They took so many and no more; then they closed it and I am told that that was one danger, that they got Germans and then they did try.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: What happened during this second German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Well, that second German occupation was the real McCoy.</span> <span id="s697">They’ve already had two years with Poland, so they already started the annihilation of Jews.</span> <span id="s698">So obviously they were just going to take up to this point (?)</span> <span id="s699">, which they did.</span> <span id="s700">They burned the Jewish sector; they burned the people.</span> <span id="s701">They took people who had, the Thursday people or the Friday people, they would round up by profession, by age, men, only, and purportedly took them to work.</span> <span id="s702">They mentioned that they went to work.</span> <span id="s703">Later when it was discovered that they were then killed (?)</span> <span id="s704">but they used them for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: This was immediately after --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: This was for about a month.</span> <span id="s707">No, it was more than a month, it was the summer and into the fall.</span> <span id="s708">Then in October, I believe, of that year, which was in 1941, they constructed the Bialystok ghetto.</span> <span id="s709">They walled in a section of town and my family had to move in.</span> <span id="s710">We were given one portion of a room, a specific amount of cubic meters per person.</span> <span id="s711">It formed a (?)</span> <span id="s712">like this, about the cubic meters, three cubic meters.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Your family had lived outside of the ghetto before this time.</span> <span id="s714">Was it a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: And how was the ghetto run?</span> <span id="s717">Did your father continue to teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s719">There were no schools.</span> <span id="s720">Schools were absolutely forbidden.</span> <span id="s721">The only schools -- no, Jews were not to be trained, not in the academics.</span> <span id="s722">They would only attend ORT schools; you know, like the Jewish ORT.</span> <span id="s723">Those were artisan schools.</span> <span id="s724">(?)</span> <span id="s725">We ran our own schools.</span> <span id="s726">I ran a little school for little kids.</span> <span id="s727">High school graduates would do that because most of our teachers, professors we called them, were killed.</span> <span id="s728">Very --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: My father, no.</span> <span id="s731">They never got to him.</span> <span id="s732">He was just in the ghetto and at first he worked in a -- uh -- he worked in some kind of a factory, I believe a furniture factory or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So he’s no longer a music --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s735">In fact, all of his music was up on the roof, under the roof (?)</span> <span id="s736">but my father at first worked there and then this didn’t shield him.</span> <span id="s737">That first action which happened was in February or January in ’43, February, I think, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: A year and a half later.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s740">And he was in danger.</span> <span id="s741">We hid in the Yudenrap (?)</span> <span id="s742">the Jewish community because of my uncle who worked there</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: So you had an uncle who worked for the Jewish council?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: He, yeah, he was something -- a minor official.</span> <span id="s745">And he coaxed my father to become something.</span> <span id="s746">They didn’t have an opening there, but they did have an opening for a scribe in the Jewish police, the militia, and as they booked the scribes, it was a totally benevolent non-malignant type of an institution, because there was no reason for it.</span> <span id="s747">There was no crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So your father was a scribe?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s750">He was sitting in the -- they called it the Revere.</span> <span id="s751">It was an all-officer thing, the militia.</span> <span id="s752">And as such, he was getting a daily soup (?)</span> <span id="s753">it was just a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s754">And we sold everything we had, little by little.</span> <span id="s755">You had to smuggle going through the ghetto walls all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Food was being rationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, we all lost weight, but uh -- halfway decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did you have to wear a yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s760">We had to wear a yellow star right away.</span> <span id="s761">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s762">I had an Aryan look.</span> <span id="s763">Uh-uhh.</span> <span id="s764">I went to villages and sold things and brought food home.</span> <span id="s765">Before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s766">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Your mother and father did wear yellow stars?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s769">They stuck at home.</span> <span id="s770">But I didn’t.</span> <span id="s771">I took a chance.</span> <span id="s772">Very -- I didn’t mind taking a chance.</span> <span id="s773">Should’ve could’ve taken more of a chance but didn’t.</span> <span id="s774">Could’ve gotten actual papers.</span> <span id="s775">When I was going to the Soviet Union trying, at first the army.</span> <span id="s776">What happened was when the Germans attacked us, the Soviets were folding every office and moving and the trucks were moving, and the cars were moving and families, Soviet families, they were removing themselves.</span> <span id="s777">The army was removing themselves.</span> <span id="s778">They came to my father and said, “Tovarishka (?)</span> <span id="s779">!”</span> <span id="s780">means come with us.</span> <span id="s781">Please come with us, you know what happens.”</span> <span id="s782">And my father answered, my father told me you don’t move anywhere during the war; I’m staying here.</span> <span id="s783">And when I heard that, I had two more friends and we were walking around I said “This ain’t good; let’s get out of here.</span> <span id="s784">They’re going to come here any day and there we go.”</span> <span id="s785">All Bialystok was moving on foot.</span> <span id="s786">With rucksacks they were moving, especially those who were in some way involved, whether they worked for the Soviets.</span> <span id="s787">Who would have asked them id they were truly Marxists?</span> <span id="s788">It was another thing -- it was put in a managerial position to call him a Communist.</span> <span id="s789">It was bad enough to be a Jew, but to be called a Communist Jew, that was in the end, so somebody like myself and they would call me everything else, I just didn’t even want to take a chance, and besides I knew what was going to happen, so we marched in order to cross the front line.</span> <span id="s790">I was going by foot, didn’t get too far, and we came back</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Overtaken by the Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: I -- we stayed -- we stopped when we knew that they were ahead of us and then we were overtaken.</span> <span id="s793">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: That’s interesting that you would seek to flee, you who are in less than immediate danger than say, your parents, who were obviously, your father was a leader of the community and clearly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, they wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s796">My father was, because there plenty of such, who were on the road.</span> <span id="s797">I went with my friend’s parents who were his age, but that was the nature of my father and my mother, and I was afraid of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Your experience suggests that if they had tried to leave they wouldn’t have gotten --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s800">They would have come back; the trains were demolished.</span> <span id="s801">Even if my father were -- the trucks were demolished.</span> <span id="s802">I mean they were bombarding us.</span> <span id="s803">I would go -- planes would come.</span> <span id="s804">I would go to a little forest; I’d wake up -- there was no wood.</span> <span id="s805">Now that’s what I was trying to say -- and so many dead people, and some of them Christians.</span> <span id="s806">I certainly could have gotten somebody else’s papers, easily.</span> <span id="s807">Just the birth certificate would have sufficed, in my case, my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Do you know what was going on in Brezany during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: We knew that the same thing was happening.</span> <span id="s810">The ghetto was formed.</span> <span id="s811">And it was true of all the little towns and some of the towns were completely demolished but Brezany was in existence.</span> <span id="s812">That we knew.</span> <span id="s813">Some of the people in the smaller towns, their Jewish populations were partially shot and they were removed to a larger town.</span> <span id="s814">They were consolidating the Jews into specific centers to await the final solution.</span> <span id="s815">The planners had that in view all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Were you in touch -- were you and your family in touch with other members of your family in Brezany during --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s818">Well, yes.</span> <span id="s819">I remember one letter clearly.</span> <span id="s820">I have a feeling there may have been one before that.</span> <span id="s821">And we had family in another part of southern Poland in the Carpathian Mountains.</span> <span id="s822">I had an aunt who was a dentist and a younger aunt -- my mother’s family, and we were not only in contact with them but my sister was there.</span> <span id="s823">And it was my sister who was hidden by my aunt for whom Aryan papers, a birth certificate of a deceased gentile Christian child.</span> <span id="s824">These papers were bought and she was taken by a guide to another part of Poland, given to a Christian family who were told that she’s the daughter of Polish officers who were executed by the Russians.</span> <span id="s825">And subsequent to that I discovered that she was christened by the guide, now that he didn’t tell my aunt.</span> <span id="s826">It was just a matter of her giving him a certain amount of gold, dental gold, I suppose, and something, and that’s how my sister became Christian, and she was on her way intercepted by a German officer who said “Yude!”</span> <span id="s827">to her, because she looks very Jewish.</span> <span id="s828">She became frightened.</span> <span id="s829">The guide told him, “OH, no, no, no, no, no -- I mean here are the papers, blah, blah ---“ She ran out and locked herself up in a bathroom, refused to leave.</span> <span id="s830">It was a tough time.</span> <span id="s831">When she got out, when she got out, she tells me she wanted to have nothing to do with it -- with her Jewishness, and she sat in front of St. Mary’s picture and said “Now, I don’t know if you’re really there, or if you were, but I promise you, if you save me, I’ll stick to you.’</span> <span id="s832">And she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: She was saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: She felt she was saved as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: She survived the war in your aunt’s town?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: She survived -- no, she survived not in my aunt’s town --where she was taken to that Christian family.</span> <span id="s837">I went back to Poland in 1945 -- ’44 -- ’45, and I came to her high school, and she walked out.</span> <span id="s838">She recognized me and she said, “Where’s my mother?”</span> <span id="s839">That’s how she greeted me.</span> <span id="s840">And after that, the next day she went to mass to expiate the sins of our parents who killed Christ.</span> <span id="s841">And that’s when I said to myself, “I lived as a Jew, not very Jewish, I suffered as a Jew as the rest of them, I’m going to die as one”, and I stayed for a while and I left for Germany.</span> <span id="s842">And that’s another fancy story.</span> <span id="s843">I told you I became a British subject by birth to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Now, a few moments ago you said that you recalled one letter from your relatives in Brezany.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s846">My boyfriend, my first love, the one in Bialystok -- no, no, that was a boy in high school, in (?)</span> <span id="s847">.</span> <span id="s848">No, this was another, it was an older boy.</span> <span id="s849">He was already a year o two older than I and he wasn’t from Bialystok; he was from Lieder, and he came to our house and he wanted to have a connection with the underground and somebody told him if there was anybody who knows it would be (?)</span> <span id="s850">and they brought him to my house.</span> <span id="s851">And indeed I had a connection, but at first I had to get to know him.</span> <span id="s852">So I did get to know him.</span> <span id="s853">We fell in love and both of us fell in love and he stayed in our house.</span> <span id="s854">My parents were -- because his parents were -- his mother and brother were shot in front of his eyes, and a Lithuanian guard knew him from the school and pulled him out and started -- he didn’t look Jewish -- he says, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s855">-- and got him out, so he was saved.</span> <span id="s856">Shot badly.</span> <span id="s857">So that news that this is a boy who lived in our house and was my boyfriend, that became the big story that wanted to travel somehow to Brezany and the letter came, ‘Huh, you have a boyfriend; he must be very rich -- who has boyfriends nowadays?</span> <span id="s858">Must be lots of money.”</span> <span id="s859">Little did they know that he was on my parents’ keep with no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Who did this letter come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: My cousin, surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Was it Sylvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: It must have been my grandma.</span> <span id="s864">She was likely to be the acidulous type of (?)</span> <span id="s865">.</span> <span id="s866">It wasn’t usual -- it was -- the story went, “It’s in the ghetto, you became engaged or you married, it was for money.”</span> <span id="s867">Younger girls marry older guys who have some smuggling -- you know, money from here, there or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s868">But the truth was that very many young kids like myself acquired live-in boyfriends because we all felt, and I wrote music with him, that the world is in flames, and we are spinning in that ship on that ocean of foam and wrath and, let’s be together, let’s see what it is like.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Live for today because there may not be a tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: What else were you doing during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Well, you have my story of the involvement with the underground.</span> <span id="s876">I met with the underground through English lessons.</span> <span id="s877">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: So you were taking English lessons because the underground --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I suspect, I suspect it was a boy that had something to do with something and he inasmuch as admitted -- I knew him from (?)</span> <span id="s880">, he was from Bialystok and we decided let’s continue those lessons.</span> <span id="s881">I was going to drop it already, but he said, “Let’s continue those lessons.</span> <span id="s882">That will be a good way for us to talk.”</span> <span id="s883">And he involved me and it was decided that because my father was a policeman this house wasn’t likely to be searched, so under my mattress there was some old Russian magnum (?)</span> <span id="s884">, a long thing, you know, -- a pistol, a very long pistol and a couple of grenades and literature also.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Where did these come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: From the left wing underground.</span> <span id="s887">I was associated with a left underground which meant it was all the way from Communists to Zionists -- left wing.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: So, the Jewish underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Oh, yes, exclusively Jewish.</span> <span id="s890">And -- so that was part of it.</span> <span id="s891">But I would occasionally meet one person, all I knew, his name was Beryl, and that he was telling me that I would go to the woods when the time comes.</span> <span id="s892">When the time came I did go, but not very far because it was decided they wouldn’t waste the weapons on an inexperienced girl, having so many boys who could do it, or girls who could do it -- whatever it was -- I wasn’t quite what I might do.</span> <span id="s893">I tried to convince them that I could pass for gentile and I can easily get money, I mean food, I can, I am experienced.</span> <span id="s894">I was led to believe we don’t do it that way.</span> <span id="s895">We’ll go in with our guns and force them to give food which was absolutely (?)</span> <span id="s896">.</span> <span id="s897">And besides, they said, you are the spiritual kind of person, you write music -- I wrote some part of the songs -- you go to the ghetto and be in charge of our propaganda to get more and more people.</span> <span id="s898">So I, from the sort of a way station, went back.</span> <span id="s899">That was my first and only encounter, because the second time that there was a chance to go out I was in love with a boy and not ready to leave this -- that was that time -- and so we were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: You were caught --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s902">And we discovered the night we did have somebody in our headquarters who was a Gestapo Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: You mean within the -- within --</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Gestapo.</span> <span id="s905">He was our contact with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s906">He knew the ghetto would be liquidated within a day.</span> <span id="s907">Apparently, he did know -- somehow we knew that it was going to happen, that they’ve already brought Ukrainians and Lithuanians in and they’re surrounded.</span> <span id="s908">Now that this happened we had a dichotomy of philosophy.</span> <span id="s909">The older people said, “Let’s all perish fighting and write history.”</span> <span id="s910">And we said, “The hell with history.</span> <span id="s911">Let’s not perish; let’s get out and hibernate in the woods and save the cream of the nation.</span> <span id="s912">Give us your arms.”</span> <span id="s913">And so for a while, we didn’t wasn’t to stay in the ghetto and that’s why the young were going, the older were thinking of (?)</span> <span id="s914">occasionally, Parisian commune style of showing this was a left-wing division.</span> <span id="s915">But the same was happening with the revisionists and the right wing also; they were talking about (?)</span> <span id="s916">.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: When was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: This was ’43 because we had the first action in February and after that we knew that we were doomed.</span> <span id="s919">We thought at first we were designed to survive; we were going to be the museum piece.</span> <span id="s920">No, we weren’t.</span> <span id="s921">The final solution -- we were going to be -- and we already knew about Treblinka because people were coming back and telling.</span> <span id="s922">So we knew there was no hope.</span> <span id="s923">So that’s the time, on that night before the final solution and that had to be September 4th or 5th, one of those because my birthday is September 6th and I was already on -- waiting for the train.</span> <span id="s924">We staged, we had it in plan, but now the orders were given.</span> <span id="s925">So I was given an order in the morning to go in such and such a place with a grenade and wait for the tank and the tank was going to come and I was told where it was going to come, only I didn’t know how to use that grenade, and I’d seen enough cowboy movies and such type movies where I knew you had to pull something with your teeth, but which part, and what do you do with it?</span> <span id="s926">And so I went there and they were firing; we had guns -- it was an uprising.</span> <span id="s927">We were -- I don’t know what they were shooting.</span> <span id="s928">They were shooting Germans or Ukrainians or something and I was supposed to stand there and wait for the tank.</span> <span id="s929">The tank never came, but an old German came -- a wee old Wehrmacht who was not involved with the Ukrainians, but he was truly helping people settle down on their march towards the train where they were going to be taken, because they were wearing kid gloves with us.</span> <span id="s930">All alone, nobody was shot at that point.</span> <span id="s931">That was one of the gimmicks.</span> <span id="s932">“Oh come on, you know you’re not going to die.</span> <span id="s933">You know that you’ve worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s934">You are working contingents.</span> <span id="s935">You’re all going to work.</span> <span id="s936">Just behave.</span> <span id="s937">Make sure that your luggage is well labeled and --“</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you were being resettled?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: So that German intercepted me and because I was still looking at that grenade he assumed that I picked it up from the men who were lined up somewhere behind these things.</span> <span id="s940">And he says, “(?)</span> <span id="s941">Leave it, don’t touch it, and give it to me.</span> <span id="s942">Or put it down.”</span> <span id="s943">And he picked it up and, “Where are your parents?”</span> <span id="s944">And took me over -- was totally bewildered.</span> <span id="s945">A little bit later my boyfriend came.</span> <span id="s946">He says, “That’s a lost cause.”</span> <span id="s947">He was shooting (?)</span> <span id="s948">.</span> <span id="s949">It was a lost -- we didn’t, weren’t even organized as well as they were, Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s950">But it lasted.</span> <span id="s951">We burned up that whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s952">I’m told after we were taken away there was still shooting.</span> <span id="s953">They had barricades.</span> <span id="s954">They died to the last person.</span> <span id="s955">There were more people like myself who went off or were directed off.</span> <span id="s956">Girls, not boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: How many would you estimate were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: In the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Yes, and in the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I have no -- that you would have to check records.</span> <span id="s961">Because all I could see that one little piece, that one little street, I never knew the leader, any second names.</span> <span id="s962">I knew one face, one man and suspected another, so if I was caught I could be tortured to death, I had nobody to tell on.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Did your parents know what you were up to?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: My mother discovered in the concentration camp and all she could say, “Oh, is that what you’re to us?”</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: This is after she was in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: “That’s what you were doing to us.</span> <span id="s967">You could have had us all killed!”</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: And what were your parents doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: My mother was working in a sewing factory, making a uniforms or parts of it, something like this.</span> <span id="s970">My father was, I told you, a scribe in the militia, and I at that point was made into a gardener.</span> <span id="s971">We were raising our own vegetables and in the militia garden.</span> <span id="s972">Somehow he got me released from work, my father, but my main job in the last few months was teaching younger children.</span> <span id="s973">I opened little schools.</span> <span id="s974">The boss gave me a couple of dollars, vlatiks, whatever, and it gave me, I apparently was born a teacher, the pleasure of facing a child and saying “You’ve got to know Latin and Physics, absolutely and there it is.</span> <span id="s975">Without that you will never be accepted to the school.”</span> <span id="s976">And the little child translated it into, “I’m going to live!”</span> <span id="s977">So I credit myself with able to do that more than anything else; this was the greatest amount of passive resistance.</span> <span id="s978">Of course, none of these children survived.</span> <span id="s979">Nobody very much younger than I survived because then they were classified as children.</span> <span id="s980">Eleven, ten, some tall, twelve, thirteen, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Were your parents rounded up at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: They went.</span> <span id="s983">We were given an order -- you had a choice.</span> <span id="s984">You either stayed in your apartment to be clubbed to death or to be killed there and my friend’s parents chose this.</span> <span id="s985">Or you had to line up -- you were given the hour, the placement to bring your knapsack and label it, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were you with your parents or with your boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, I was with my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s988">I was told -- my parents left and we said we were going after you.</span> <span id="s989">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s990">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s991">We went where we were supposed to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: So your paths did not cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s994">Then the Germans brought me to them, my mother said, “Where have you been?”</span> <span id="s995">I didn’t tell her.</span> <span id="s996">Then I saw another girl who also came.</span> <span id="s997">I was disheveled, without anything, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: What were you able to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Must have been the best that we had.</span> <span id="s1000">A skirt and a sweater, cold -- some shoes, possibly soap, I would say.</span> <span id="s1001">Food, maybe some bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Where were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: We were taken by train to Treblinka, which was not even a retaining camp, just pure and simple extermination.</span> <span id="s1004">You were driven in, exterminated.</span> <span id="s1005">So we passed the field of ashes and human bones, and they were totally unabashed.</span> <span id="s1006">We saw it.</span> <span id="s1007">And it was at that point, and there were many train, that we started to sing all kind of songs, among them, “The International” and they were shooting onto the train because there were some left-wing and some Zionists -- and we were singing all kinds of songs and that was the song of our revolt, and they shot me between my thighs and I was scraped by the bullet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: You were grazed by the bullet which was shot through -- you were in a cattle car --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes, yes, and so we decided to jump.</span> <span id="s1010">We were nearing the point before we went to that Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1011">We knew where we were going.</span> <span id="s1012">We -- there were some people -- at that point I realized there were more people in the underground, even the other factions, you know, whoever they were, and they were, uh -- I cut my skirt -- there were no slacks worn in those days, and we were going to jump through the window and we saw people who were jump --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Through the window in the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yes, you could.</span> <span id="s1015">You would push -- you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: No window, but the opening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: The opening.</span> <span id="s1018">The opening.</span> <span id="s1019">That was big enough to be pushed through and we saw -- I mean --to let you know that you could -- see, we’ve seen bodies.</span> <span id="s1020">We’ve seen.</span> <span id="s1021">I’ll never forget the jazz musician whose song I carry in my heart and nobody to write it down, and he was shot in front of me.</span> <span id="s1022">He jumped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: As he was jumping, he was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes, and then he didn’t move, and I never heard of him.</span> <span id="s1025">Never.</span> <span id="s1026">So he was killed.</span> <span id="s1027">And we still decided we will take a chance.</span> <span id="s1028">But there was not -- we didn’t have anything with us.</span> <span id="s1029">We didn’t have weapons, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1030">So we asked people, “Please give us your money.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So you got out of the car successfully?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1033">We were standing in the car and we’re asking people who were sitting there praying to God, “Never mind your prayers.</span> <span id="s1034">We are your hope.</span> <span id="s1035">If we survive, that nation will live.</span> <span id="s1036">We can’t; we need your money.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Oh, okay, cause I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: We knew.</span> <span id="s1039">Somebody said, “Oh, this one, this is rich so-and-so.”</span> <span id="s1040">Their answer was, “We need that money to buy ourselves out.’</span> <span id="s1041">And besides –</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: This was still in the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1044">And then somebody said, “If you dare to come close to that window we’re going to call the Ukrainian, because if you jump, they’re going to shoot through the car.”</span> <span id="s1045">So, we said the hell with it.</span> <span id="s1046">At that point (End of Tape 1).</span> <span id="s1047">I didn’t mind taking a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: So we’re outside Treblinka in the rail car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: That’s how we crossed to Treblinka after the shooting I already had a sore and the reason which I so well remember the scene because with me were my high school friends whose names I know.</span> <span id="s1050">I know how they perished.</span> <span id="s1051">Yes.</span> <span id="s1052">And I know how they perished.</span> <span id="s1053">And because my mother fainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Your parents were in the same car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1056">I joined them with that German and I went with them and I managed to pass the selection.</span> <span id="s1057">Many parents were sent off and the train stopped in Treblinka and the last two wagons or three wagons were detached and these people went directly to the annihilator.</span> <span id="s1058">But my parents passed their original inspection and were with us young people in the same wagon.</span> <span id="s1059">My mother fainted and she couldn’t even go down because it was so crowded.</span> <span id="s1060">This was the first time that I opened my big mouth to my father.</span> <span id="s1061">Normally had I done this he would have let me have it.</span> <span id="s1062">I mean physically.</span> <span id="s1063">I said, “God damn it, would you get off your you-know-what and help your wife.</span> <span id="s1064">She’s fainted.”</span> <span id="s1065">And wild-eyed, he looked at me as if he was from a different world, and that’s when I recognized that that’s the end of the big father of mine and the beginning of me, the leader of that family.</span> <span id="s1066">I’ve done this all along, supported them, got food for them, gave them the money that I earned.</span> <span id="s1067">I was the undertaking kind of a person but now I knew if there was any decision to be made, it would have to be me because he’s just not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: This was a different world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: This was a different world, and I had to live up to it, so I went to my mother and I said, and I shook her, and I said, “No, you live.</span> <span id="s1070">You will live.</span> <span id="s1071">Now you stop it.”</span> <span id="s1072">She said, “Why did you do it?</span> <span id="s1073">Why did you wake me up?</span> <span id="s1074">I could have died.’</span> <span id="s1075">I said, “You don’t know yet.”</span> <span id="s1076">And for some reason at that point when I knew I couldn’t -- we passed the point.</span> <span id="s1077">Treblinka was much too far from wherever we could go, somebody told us where the point was.</span> <span id="s1078">There were many more people.</span> <span id="s1079">I never knew how many --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Who were to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Who were to escape -- oh, my boyfriend knew.</span> <span id="s1082">See, my boyfriend was taken with the first action, the one that was in February, and he jumped the train; that first train in February, and he stayed with farmers and he came back home to me.</span> <span id="s1083">So he knew the point of -- where you could go to, uh, where there was Jewish underground.</span> <span id="s1084">There was no point going anywhere especially not where there was a Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1085">You had to go where we knew we had hiding places.</span> <span id="s1086">The underground amounted to hiding places.</span> <span id="s1087">We did a little sabotage, but it was basically survival.</span> <span id="s1088">Well, at that point, we said, well, let come whatever may, and once it passed Treblinka, we started believing, yes, that we are going to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: You’re in the cars that were not left there, so the train continued?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1091">And at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And your family is still together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Friends are still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1096">And we were taken to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1097">Katzov Lublin.</span> <span id="s1098">It’s known as (?)</span> <span id="s1099">.</span> <span id="s1100">And that is the first time that I realized that they annihilate people in the way they said, because I saw cans of Zyklon B gas right in front of me -- a pile.</span> <span id="s1101">(?)</span> <span id="s1102">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Were you the only one to see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: No, we all saw it.</span> <span id="s1105">And we also had children removed from their parents and taken to the place in front of which was the Zyklon B gas, screaming mothers, mothers trying to go with children and some of us screaming, “No, you can have other children!</span> <span id="s1106">For the nation.”</span> <span id="s1107">We didn’t let them.</span> <span id="s1108">Some went, some stayed.</span> <span id="s1109">We were separated from them in that Zukplaza (?)</span> <span id="s1110">which was in Lublin depot and my friends volunteered themselves.</span> <span id="s1111">Call went for young ladies to work in such and such a factory and all the women started beautifying themselves with the kerchiefs.</span> <span id="s1112">Something told me, “Don’t do that.”</span> <span id="s1113">Well, those friends of mine went and never came back.</span> <span id="s1114">That was one other ploy.</span> <span id="s1115">See, they didn’t have a full capacity for all these exterminations.</span> <span id="s1116">We had such a big transport.</span> <span id="s1117">So they minimized it.</span> <span id="s1118">They used all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1119">They would take you part way in the train and gas -- CO -- carbon monoxide or whatever in the train or an exhaust or shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: When you stopped at Treblinka were you separated from any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: No.</span> <span id="s1122">We would start separated from the beginning -- separate.</span> <span id="s1123">I knew some friends who went with their grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: No, I mean your group.</span> <span id="s1125">You, you, your car, your wagon, relatives and a lot of friends that you mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Just some that I knew.</span> <span id="s1127">Most were on other trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: That means you all continued on after you stopped at Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: When we disembarked in Lublin, that is when I realized that we were so very few.</span> <span id="s1130">That means that the rest either disappeared with the first action --it was (?)</span> <span id="s1131">big ghetto or were already separated and had gone on to Treblinka and I know that my neighbors, young people, a boy and a girl, my age, went with their grandparents, in a wheelchair, so obviously I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s1132">And my father and my uncle came out of -- you never knew what it was -- steam was coming out from both.</span> <span id="s1133">Sometimes the steam meant that there was steam coming down as well -- hot water coming for a wash-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: You’re talking about Lublin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1136">We were all given -- no, no, we were not all given baths.</span> <span id="s1137">My par – our men were given a bath.</span> <span id="s1138">That included my cousin, my uncle, my boyfriend and my father, and they got out.</span> <span id="s1139">We saw them.</span> <span id="s1140">And they were brought to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1141">Majdanek was behind, it was an adjunct, sort of a part, outlying area of the (?)</span> <span id="s1142">of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1143">We were walked to that concentration camp without the bath.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: The women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: The women.</span> <span id="s1146">And we were placed in a square with lights shining on us.</span> <span id="s1147">We were walked with the dogs and I was looking around saying, “How do I escape?</span> <span id="s1148">I’m going to my death.</span> <span id="s1149">How do I?</span> <span id="s1150">Do I go to a German and tell him a story?</span> <span id="s1151">“You know, I’m an adopted child.</span> <span id="s1152">I’m not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1153">Maybe I can befriend a dog.</span> <span id="s1154">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1155">How do I go?</span> <span id="s1156">Where do I go?”</span> <span id="s1157">Nowhere.</span> <span id="s1158">I got to that square and I became frantic because I saw the steam houses.</span> <span id="s1159">I was sure this was the gas chamber, and no escape.</span> <span id="s1160">And again, around the friendly faces of the Ukrainians, I tried to talk Ukrainian to them.</span> <span id="s1161">“Oh, you know, I’m really --“ I was just out of my wits.</span> <span id="s1162">Towards the morning I said to myself.</span> <span id="s1163">“I think I’m going to live.”</span> <span id="s1164">And all of a sudden I came to my mother and I said, “You know what, I have a feeling we’re going to live.</span> <span id="s1165">Now let’s stop that.”</span> <span id="s1166">Oh, my God, she was petrified.</span> <span id="s1167">I said, “Uh, uh, something tells me I’m going to live.”</span> <span id="s1168">And I turned around to the others; I said, “Let’s stop being stupid.</span> <span id="s1169">If they wanted to exterminate us, why did they bring us here and not there?”</span> <span id="s1170">I was partially right because they did have a selection right there.</span> <span id="s1171">I was able to push my mother with me and we went to the bath instead of the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1172">We got out, the others never did.</span> <span id="s1173">We were taken to Majdanek which was a nothing camp but occasionally we would go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: You were with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Always with my mother, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Your mother was criticizing you as she did before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Oh, no my mother was a child of mine.</span> <span id="s1178">From this point on just as she had been a child of my father, a subdued female, so now I became the leader in a very forceful ---.</span> <span id="s1179">Not only her but I was elected a st_______(?)</span> <span id="s1180">the leader of that particular -- with all the older women and everything.</span> <span id="s1181">Because they knew me from school and somehow I made this impression.</span> <span id="s1182">My spirit wasn’t broken.</span> <span id="s1183">As a st______, one morning we walked out to work in the fields, somewhere collecting cabbages or whatever it was and we came back late.</span> <span id="s1184">Instead of being brought to where we were on top of the field, we were lined up at the bottom of the field precisely at the time that a factory camp like the one described in the book was looking for seamstresses, just for seamstresses.</span> <span id="s1185">I knew if they say seamstresses from a concentration camp, you raise your hand, oh, yes you are a seamstress.</span> <span id="s1186">So I raised my hand and the SS woman was picking out specifically fair, gentile-looking, young girls.</span> <span id="s1187">That was me and in the back of me was my mother.</span> <span id="s1188">Once she passed and she pointed to me to go to the line, not only did I go but grabbed my mother and said you go and stood in front of her and hid her.</span> <span id="s1189">That’s how my mother ended up in the girls’ work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Your mother was how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: She was 49, that wasn’t a girl.</span> <span id="s1192">We ended in a camp, Blitzen, (?)</span> <span id="s1193">.</span> <span id="s1194">While we waited in Lublin train station, they marched in 350 men.</span> <span id="s1195">While they were standing waiting also to be joined with us.</span> <span id="s1196">This was the contingent of a city of 150,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1197">One hundred and fifty of us and 350 men.</span> <span id="s1198">That’s all that eventually survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: That’s when they were walking to the train, I asked him.</span> <span id="s1201">Somebody that I knew, did you see my father?</span> <span id="s1202">He said yes, he’s in the orchestra.</span> <span id="s1203">Oh I said, he must have more soup.</span> <span id="s1204">I was rejoicing for him.</span> <span id="s1205">Being something in camp to meant that he’s a little better off.</span> <span id="s1206">Little did I know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1207">So we worked in that Blitzen, indeed I worked in a knitting factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: How close was Blitzen to ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: To Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: To Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: To Lublin.</span> <span id="s1212">No, I think this was the Blitzen.</span> <span id="s1213">Was near Radom.</span> <span id="s1214">Not very far, I would say ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Another rail trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: A 150, 200 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So you went by train again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Yes, by train.</span> <span id="s1219">But it wasn’t a big trip, no.</span> <span id="s1220">This camp was different.</span> <span id="s1221">It was not a typical concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1222">It was a working camp where the families weren’t together, but women who came before us had their clothing on, their things, their belongings.</span> <span id="s1223">We didn’t, because they took it away.</span> <span id="s1224">We came from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1225">But they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: What were you wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: I had some old rag with something on the back, whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: What they gave you at Lublin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yes, after the bath.</span> <span id="s1230">Yes, we looked real funny.</span> <span id="s1231">They didn’t shave our heads at that time.</span> <span id="s1232">That Blitzen was survivable until about Christmas of that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: December, December ____?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Was okay.</span> <span id="s1235">By okay I meant the soup was pretty dense, there weren’t killings, there weren’t executions.</span> <span id="s1236">They were intimidating, there were a lot of civilian Germans worked the factories.</span> <span id="s1237">Then there came the leadership of Lublin, of that camp, Majdanek and took over.</span> <span id="s1238">Our camp became a concentration camp and things became worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: So the Majdanek management basically, took over the management Blitzen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: But I didn’t know how and why and then we discovered it.</span> <span id="s1241">Because some wood, burning wood, woodpiles came from Lublin to us.</span> <span id="s1242">In them a piece of, a chunk of, a log was found was Hebrew inscription.</span> <span id="s1243">That told us on November 2, for three days, machine-gunning of all Jews, they are no more.</span> <span id="s1244">So we knew that I had no father, no boyfriend, no uncle and my mother ---.</span> <span id="s1245">Well, she said if I survive I can find another guy, she says.</span> <span id="s1246">Interesting, my mother.</span> <span id="s1247">I couldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: That’s her humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: No, it was a method for surviving.</span> <span id="s1250">Oh, we’ll manage, you did not despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: So your father was killed in the final liquidation --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Of that Majdanek, the Jewish, it was a gigantic amount.</span> <span id="s1253">So that these guys who escaped going to the front line ---- and I also discovered from the book, from Schlindler’s List, that all of these camps, the work camps, were really refugees for enterprising Germans.</span> <span id="s1254">Made a lot of money but they were all converted to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1255">Now without the Wannsee Conference, they were planning for mass executions.</span> <span id="s1256">So we stayed in Blitzen and started hearing big guns going off in the East.</span> <span id="s1257">I went through dysentery and a severe one.</span> <span id="s1258">I went through typhoid fever, typhus because we were knitting the soldiers’ socks and they came with lice.</span> <span id="s1259">It was a very big epidemic, lots of people died.</span> <span id="s1260">I not only didn’t, if you want to know how easily I survived.</span> <span id="s1261">Because I was a sports-minded, _______(?)</span> <span id="s1262">kind of girl.</span> <span id="s1263">I had typhus and the German doctor disbelieved it because I was picked up from the factory with very high fever, walking.</span> <span id="s1264">So he personally came to the hospital to examine me and that wasn’t done by German doctors.</span> <span id="s1265">Because he didn’t believe -- it was after everybody had their typhus, I came down with it.</span> <span id="s1266">He found that my spleen was yet to be enlarged but everybody had to go through 14 or 16 days.</span> <span id="s1267">I was done with it in 12.</span> <span id="s1268">After 14 or 16 days people were just lying and I stood and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1269">Furthermore, I ate and nobody ate.</span> <span id="s1270">So I was never really very skinny because I utilized my fat and I was taught sparingly so I survived the typhus very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: How was the food at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: We counted it out.</span> <span id="s1273">I have a cousin who taught at Yale and in that camp, we came to a count of about 700 calories a day.</span> <span id="s1274">That’s a reducing diet for sure.</span> <span id="s1275">Later it became worse.</span> <span id="s1276">In a concentration camp, it was about 350 calories a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: And Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1279">So that would have been very much more reducing.</span> <span id="s1280">But I wasn’t there long enough.</span> <span id="s1281">Fate has just foreshortened all of my sufferings in this graceful way.</span> <span id="s1282">We stayed there until May, I think, of ’44, in Blitzen.</span> <span id="s1283">Then they took us to Auschwitz with an order that these are German workers.</span> <span id="s1284">Nobody touched us, no selection, no shaving heads, stamped numbers, all of us.</span> <span id="s1285">The entire contingent of that camp got into the Auschwitz area.</span> <span id="s1286">People were asking me what is it?</span> <span id="s1287">Who did you know?</span> <span id="s1288">To this day, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: You were all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1291">From this book I’m surmising that these civilian Germans still hoped that they can get some of us out.</span> <span id="s1292">Because that’s what they did, that Schindler did.</span> <span id="s1293">It was skilled workers he had there.</span> <span id="s1294">Machinists, all kinds of people and he was hoping to get some of us out.</span> <span id="s1295">I mean we could make socks in no time and all kinds of things were done for the army.</span> <span id="s1296">I don’t remember if they did some work for the navy.</span> <span id="s1297">We got to Auschwitz intact and my mother stayed with me.</span> <span id="s1298">They had a selection there later and my mother stayed with me.</span> <span id="s1299">Somehow I managed until --.</span> <span id="s1300">By the way, in Auschwitz I was helping a Russian to pass soup to the officers who were in very bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Russian officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1303">I helped a French marquis, manage to get a contact to keep some Red Russians and to give them to another camp.</span> <span id="s1304">There were so many camps and I survived by being with them all day long.</span> <span id="s1305">Instead of sitting and moping around and being hungry, there was no work, I would go from contact to contact.</span> <span id="s1306">Some died and met some people from Paris and so forth so I did in that sense help.</span> <span id="s1307">They helped me; I got a little more soup and I bring it to my mother who needed it more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Where were you housed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: In a barrack.</span> <span id="s1310">I’ve visited there, I’ve been to Auschwitz several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Were you in the main camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: No, Birkenau, Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1315">I was in the former gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1316">It was an A camp, no a B camp.</span> <span id="s1317">I had – my number was A.</span> <span id="s1318">What was it Marvin, 4, 5?</span> <span id="s1319">45867, my mother’s was 45868, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: You weren’t tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s1322">I had it taken out because I used to hang on a subway strap and people were looking.</span> <span id="s1323">I came here before anybody else.</span> <span id="s1324">I just didn’t want to have it on me.</span> <span id="s1325">_____________(?)</span> <span id="s1326">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Were you put in slave labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: No, once I was.</span> <span id="s1329">They didn’t and if so, it was busy.</span> <span id="s1330">Birkenau, you were waiting your turn basically but this was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1331">What started was exporting people to replenish missing slave labor of other nationalities.</span> <span id="s1332">People were getting out, some of them might have just gone to be exterminated, you never knew.</span> <span id="s1333">There was a civilian coming it was more likely to be for work.</span> <span id="s1334">He was handpicking his -- mind you they claimed they didn’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1335">What were they doing picking people?</span> <span id="s1336">They didn’t know it was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: And you arrived in May of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: I was there until November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Did you notice operations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1341">I was near the gas chamber because when we arrived that scene, the girls showed me.</span> <span id="s1342">Once I did go on a work there.</span> <span id="s1343">I wouldn’t see the bodies.</span> <span id="s1344">Furthermore, how could you miss it?</span> <span id="s1345">These chimneys, the four chimneys were smoking so viciously, with such a stench, that only the burning of animal fat, animal protein could produce.</span> <span id="s1346">You couldn’t miss it, the stench was awful, and it was so hot, the flame was coming out.</span> <span id="s1347">Because they were very heavy hydrocarbons, pardon my biochemistry, coming through.</span> <span id="s1348">It was incomplete combustion, because of the amount of bodies and the paucity of oxygen.</span> <span id="s1349">So it was black smoke that was catching on fire from the heat.</span> <span id="s1350">What was it?</span> <span id="s1351">And I was right next to the train, the rails.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Did you see the people arriving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: What do you remember seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: I saw people dressed beautifully sometimes.</span> <span id="s1356">Being aroused, marched, I saw all that you see in the movies, I really saw it.</span> <span id="s1357">Then I could see trainload of 50 people coming into camp of a load of thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Now this was the busiest time in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: A time of the Hungarian deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1362">Not only this, we saw.</span> <span id="s1363">We didn’t know what they were doing there.</span> <span id="s1364">We hadn’t worn this kind of clothing for a long time.</span> <span id="s1365">But there they were coming in and it was happening at night.</span> <span id="s1366">We had the so-called blockspech ______(?)</span> <span id="s1367">.</span> <span id="s1368">The block was closed; you never went out to the bathroom at night.</span> <span id="s1369">You just used the barrels, but on the outside of the block, they would bring them in and you couldn’t when they had the blockspech _______.</span> <span id="s1370">We told one another, ah, coals have arrived for the stoves.</span> <span id="s1371">Yes, I knew about this and yes I knew about the men’s camp.</span> <span id="s1372">We saw them, they were less capable of surviving.</span> <span id="s1373">We saw the so-called muselmenn looking worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1374">Wasn’t very bad, not as bad as it was in the spring.</span> <span id="s1375">Were real horrors in there.</span> <span id="s1376">We seen people being punished by having to sit down in ditches for a day with hands-up.</span> <span id="s1377">Torture.</span> <span id="s1378">We seen beatings; we seen people on the electrified wire fences.</span> <span id="s1379">I just discovered -- I was giving that soup and I was told don’t have your hands shake, you gonna feel the field.</span> <span id="s1380">I didn’t and that book claims that the inner fences were not electrified that we were told untruth.</span> <span id="s1381">That to scare us they told us these were electrified wires but that they weren’t.</span> <span id="s1382">But the outer ones were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: I’d like to ask you to backtrack just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1384">Your journey to Treblinka and then to Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: And then to Blitzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: And then to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1387">Certainly in the early part of this trip, you were in the same car as your parents --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: And other members of your family and your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, just my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1392">Do you recall what was being said, what was being thought during these days of traveling, the time that you were waiting to see what would happen at Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: No, I would say that people prayed, I would say that many people hugged or, if they were my kind, walked around.</span> <span id="s1394">You’ve seen the animals at the zoo?</span> <span id="s1395">Back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s1396">That was me at all times, where do I go, what do I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: You paced inside the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: No, I was thinking, I was active.</span> <span id="s1399">I would go to a person and say what do you think we could do?</span> <span id="s1400">Do you think there are loose parts.</span> <span id="s1401">Where is the -- getting the information -- what could be done?</span> <span id="s1402">Same in camp.</span> <span id="s1403">I met a Hungarian and a Romanian girl and French girls.</span> <span id="s1404">Some people I knew from Brezany would surface there.</span> <span id="s1405">What do you know from the outside and what do you think is going to happen?</span> <span id="s1406">Do you know if they’re burning, what kind of people?</span> <span id="s1407">Does that mean that we’re staying?</span> <span id="s1408">Just constantly doing something.</span> <span id="s1409">In a sense of being involved with people who were doing something and possibly promoting my mother’s survival.</span> <span id="s1410">Because if something was going on and we could become part of it -- or at least get some better accommodations.</span> <span id="s1411">That was happening all along.</span> <span id="s1412">If you could become a helper of the kapo or something like this, that meant survival, at least temporarily.</span> <span id="s1413">Nobody was thinking tomorrow but nothing like this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: But in the cattle car, before you actually arrived, was the sense of, the mood of --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Desperate.</span> <span id="s1417">What were other people doing, saying on the train?</span> <span id="s1418">What were they expecting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: There was fighting for water.</span> <span id="s1420">We were beastly thirsty; we were drinking all sorts of dirty water that some pitying Ukrainian would give to us.</span> <span id="s1421">People had to defecate and urinate where they stood.</span> <span id="s1422">Some people were fighting.</span> <span id="s1423">There was no friendly atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1424">If you know the biology of the crowded rat, you don’t expect that from people in those conditions.</span> <span id="s1425">Human behavior is not very different.</span> <span id="s1426">But we were the young, we were part of something, some hopeful thing, we felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: I remember there was a debate during the initial train trip about whether to try to jump out of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yes, we would have, several of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Were there other similar type --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Escapes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: No, not so much escapes but arguments, debates regarding what to do?</span> <span id="s1432">What to expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: No, the only impression I have is a very negative one, is from the same religious people who believed that G-d will help them but did not see that so much more will be achieved if at least some of us survived to have children and so forth.</span> <span id="s1434">There was a chance, because people did get to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1435">My boyfriend, as I told you, jumped the train and survived that time.</span> <span id="s1436">That’s how I could have but you had to have money to pay that farmer not to inform --.</span> <span id="s1437">For the immediate thing, without money, there wasn’t very much of a chance.</span> <span id="s1438">Even your gun wouldn’t have really helped you on your own.</span> <span id="s1439">It’s only when you’re already with a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: You and your mother remained together through the time you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: All the way to November when they had another selection.</span> <span id="s1442">At that one, she was so debilitated and old looking that she no longer passed.</span> <span id="s1443">I hid her again in back of me and she was pulled out.</span> <span id="s1444">I went after her and my friends grabbed me and said don’t you dare.</span> <span id="s1445">She ended up in what used to be a chamber of the doomed.</span> <span id="s1446">This painting I have, I made it.</span> <span id="s1447">It’s in my family.</span> <span id="s1448">The place didn’t have windows, it had skylights, painted.</span> <span id="s1449">They waited there until the black ______(?)</span> <span id="s1450">was completely enclosed.</span> <span id="s1451">Most barracks were just free, that one had a little enclosure and grating with wires.</span> <span id="s1452">At night, a black truck would come and take them to be gassed.</span> <span id="s1453">So the next morning after a night of anguish and guilt feeling, why didn’t I go with her?</span> <span id="s1454">Somebody came and said, she isn’t gassed, that’s where she is.</span> <span id="s1455">I went there and lo and behold, the door was open.</span> <span id="s1456">Later I learned that there was an explosion in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1457">There was an uprising, they went up with it.</span> <span id="s1458">Then something, I think the Swiss commission, whatever it was, my mother was there because they separated the old from the younger.</span> <span id="s1459">Still this kind of selection going on, in part because now they really were taking the young ones to work.</span> <span id="s1460">They didn’t know yet how they’re going to kill the old, the older people.</span> <span id="s1461">I came to her every day and even there they had a selection because the Theresienstadt women came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: So your mother was saved basically by the revolt that took place in the crematorium?</span> <span id="s1463">This was in, say November of 1944?</span> <span id="s1464">So you’re again together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: In a sense.</span> <span id="s1466">I was in a different group.</span> <span id="s1467">Then things became very bad with me.</span> <span id="s1468">It may have been the beginning of typhoid fever or it may have simply been the food or it may have been an ulcer but I was vomiting.</span> <span id="s1469">I was taking whatever it was in the morning and vomiting.</span> <span id="s1470">Taking whatever it was later and vomiting.</span> <span id="s1471">I knew that that meant that I would die and my mother would see me die.</span> <span id="s1472">I then decided I’ll take a chance.</span> <span id="s1473">They were taking people, some to work and others to be killed and others to different camps.</span> <span id="s1474">We were quite close to the front line with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1475">The Russians came in January, I think; this was November.</span> <span id="s1476">So I spoke with my mother and I said I am going to try to get you on the list of the capable work.</span> <span id="s1477">You’re not that old, don’t act old.</span> <span id="s1478">Act young, perk up and so forth and you will yet go to work.</span> <span id="s1479">But I can’t wait because I’m dying, I’ve got to get out.</span> <span id="s1480">Something in the water, or something in the food but I can’t hold it.</span> <span id="s1481">Yes, she said, I, somehow through a doctor, reached, and there was another one, Weiss I think was his name, a German doctor who was making the selections.</span> <span id="s1482">He put on the list of those who were capable of work.</span> <span id="s1483">The rest of those people were left in that place were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1484">But my poor mother was taken, with the people who were on the list, on the death march to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: This was in January?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: She survived until the end of February.</span> <span id="s1487">She died a natural death in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: If you call it that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Well, everybody was starving.</span> <span id="s1490">She was in bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: She was marched all the way to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: The situation there was just absolutely awful.</span> <span id="s1493">They were hardly giving them any food and she was already exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: She died in ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: In bed.</span> <span id="s1496">My friend was with her one evening, talking to her.</span> <span id="s1497">She was telling her I’m trying very hard to survive, to live.</span> <span id="s1498">I know that’s the end and I just want to live, I have two daughters.</span> <span id="s1499">She believed my sister was alive.</span> <span id="s1500">She worried more about me than she worried about my sister because of the vomiting but she wanted to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: She died in her bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: She came in the morning, the bed was empty.</span> <span id="s1503">She can’t remember if it was February or March.</span> <span id="s1504">She approximates based on the day of liberation, sometime in April, something.</span> <span id="s1505">So it was not when the British were there as I was told.</span> <span id="s1506">And others had seen her too and seen her walking to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1507">In other words, she was not sick, sick, she was just debilitated, worn out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: I was taken to a munitions factory, L____(?)</span> <span id="s1510">near where Krup_____work and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: This is January, ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: I worked, made hand grenades and befriended some Italian prisoners 0f war who refused to fight on the Leningrad front.</span> <span id="s1513">They were taken back to Germany and put to work.</span> <span id="s1514">I befriended a German overseer, an older guy, who came to my work and said I want to hear the story.</span> <span id="s1515">We spoke German and little by little I told him.</span> <span id="s1516">So I found a sandwich on my workbench every night.</span> <span id="s1517">It was a night shift, a night shift which was constantly interrupted by the British, came at night and the Americans came at daytime.</span> <span id="s1518">That lasted until the end of March but in the meantime I became sick with typhoid fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: So you went from typhus to typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I was taken to the typhus barracks (?)</span> <span id="s1521">the quarantine.</span> <span id="s1522">Once again I showed everybody a miracle because I walked.</span> <span id="s1523">I wasn’t even sick but my fecal examination was constantly showing the bacillus.</span> <span id="s1524">Again it was hard to believe that they couldn’t --.</span> <span id="s1525">I got to look and act so much better that I started menstruating.</span> <span id="s1526">Now I’m menstruating, you didn’t have enough fat</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Were you treated by German doctors or by prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Prisoner, a Hungarian doctor.</span> <span id="s1529">But I had a friend, he was a Polish SS man.</span> <span id="s1530">He was a former PPS or socialist or a communist, Polish from _______(?)</span> <span id="s1531">who knew my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Someone who knew your father.</span> <span id="s1533">Was he _______ or in the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: He was given an option.</span> <span id="s1535">We either shoot you or you go to the SS.</span> <span id="s1536">He was bringing me onion because that was something very valuable as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Did he recognize you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: No, he didn’t know me.</span> <span id="s1539">He was -- but he knew my father because he probably was a musician.</span> <span id="s1540">Well, I saved his life later, I mediated between him and the gum chewing GI.</span> <span id="s1541">But in 19___.</span> <span id="s1542">I got out of the typhus-barracks as I said to you, menstruating and looking so well that the Germans were asking me, where have you been, at a resort?</span> <span id="s1543">This is what I mean, survival of the fittest, I wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s1544">I must have been endowed with some survival genes which unfortunately doesn’t serve me right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: You look like a pretty tough lady to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Well, after this, the order still was _________Judenrein (?)</span> <span id="s1547">.</span> <span id="s1548">No matter what you were or what you looked like.</span> <span id="s1549">At the end of March, they marched us out of that L______towards Buchenwald only they didn’t get too far.</span> <span id="s1550">They came to a little village Kaunitz, K-a-u-n-i-t-z.</span> <span id="s1551">I might visit it if I have enough nerve.</span> <span id="s1552">We sat in the ditches and right in front of us, there moved a jeep with a white star on it.</span> <span id="s1553">We had better sense than say a boo.</span> <span id="s1554">First of all, they probably wouldn’t have heard us and second of all, we could have been shot.</span> <span id="s1555">We looked like the army, later on the patrolling airplane told us they didn’t know what the hell was going.</span> <span id="s1556">They’d never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s1557">We each wore an army blanket on us.</span> <span id="s1558">They didn’t know if we were army women.</span> <span id="s1559">They never saw Jews.</span> <span id="s1560">We were the first liberated Jewish women yet.</span> <span id="s1561">So we let the Americans pass and sat in the ditch.</span> <span id="s1562">All of a sudden all of our SS disappeared on us.</span> <span id="s1563">The overseer, his mistress, everybody except for the Polish SS.</span> <span id="s1564">He said, Pan_____(?)</span> <span id="s1565">, he called me Irene, you remember don’t you?</span> <span id="s1566">I says yes, I remember, stay with us.</span> <span id="s1567">We saw the whole village was hanging white flags out.</span> <span id="s1568">At that point I became a front-runner because I knew English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Your boyfriend’s help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: I still thought that they were British.</span> <span id="s1571">I didn’t know the Americans were at war.</span> <span id="s1572">We walked to the village proper and there stood a tank with this gum- chewing individual, his funny helmet.</span> <span id="s1573">I asked him, who are you?</span> <span id="s1574">He says I’m an American.</span> <span id="s1575">I said, where from?</span> <span id="s1576">He gave me, I said are you sure you’re not British?</span> <span id="s1577">They all started laughing and they asked me who I was.</span> <span id="s1578">I told them and he said, I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1579">He called in so and so and they came over to us and took out their mezuzah and asked me to identify.</span> <span id="s1580">.</span> <span id="s1581">I told them what it was, So they what they call organized, they didn’t organize those tanks right away.</span> <span id="s1582">They occupied the whole village and kicked the Germans out and said girls, this is yours.</span> <span id="s1583">Everything in it and we will bring you more.</span> <span id="s1584">And they did!</span> <span id="s1585">Clothes and chocolate, started pushing on us, crying some of these guys.</span> <span id="s1586">You are the first surviving girls yet.</span> <span id="s1587">We can fraternize with you, you’re not German.</span> <span id="s1588">It was something first for the -- especially the Jewish GI’s.</span> <span id="s1589">We stayed in that village and that’s when I met Captain Lubetsky who was in charge of the American garrison there who was looking for an interpreter.</span> <span id="s1590">I was walking with a frying pan to the burgomeister to have it fixed.</span> <span id="s1591">That’s how brazen we were.</span> <span id="s1592">Hey toots, said he, and proceeded to talk to me and discovered because I spoke Russian and he was in charge of the PW and DP camps.</span> <span id="s1593">Come on, he said, you’re going to be working with us.</span> <span id="s1594">What kind of house would you like?</span> <span id="s1595">I said with a piano.</span> <span id="s1596">Okay it will be with a piano.</span> <span id="s1597">They found a house with a piano and I was working with the army all through.</span> <span id="s1598">Then the British came and took over.</span> <span id="s1599">Again I worked with the British and recuperated and traveled to Bergen-Belsen to find my mother.</span> <span id="s1600">But what was in my mind was what my uncle said.</span> <span id="s1601">You find your sister.</span> <span id="s1602">So sometimes in November, I declared myself to be a Soviet citizen because that’s where I thought my sister was.</span> <span id="s1603">They needed somebody to accompany the Soviets, the PW’s who refused to go back home to the Ukraine which would have been where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1604">I went with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Go home voluntarily or involuntarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1607">It was a matter of propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">(END OF SIDE A, TAPE 11) Why would they be willing to get them?</span> <span id="s1609">What do they need them for?</span> <span id="s1610">These are all traders, they’re not going to shoot them all?</span> <span id="s1611">He said, why not?</span> <span id="s1612">Little did I know!</span> <span id="s1613">I didn’t believe it, not based on the behavior they showed to us when we were there.</span> <span id="s1614">It was none of this Stalin’s paranoia at that point.</span> <span id="s1615">That was later on so I went all through Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1616">I saw what Warsaw looked like and while I was (PAUSE IN TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: You saw flyers in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: This was announcing hangings of those who staged the pogrom in Lublin of Jews.</span> <span id="s1619">I will find my sister but I’m not staying.</span> <span id="s1620">I went to the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1621">First of all, I was dragging with me Polish-Jewish girls who didn’t speak a word of Russian to discover on the German-Polish border that it was no longer Soviet Union, but it was Poland.</span> <span id="s1622">That all the Soviet Jews were coming back.</span> <span id="s1623">So now I was going into the Soviet Union and I belonged here.</span> <span id="s1624">I couldn’t tell them that I was Polish so with my purest Russian I said __________(?)</span> <span id="s1625">.</span> <span id="s1626">Who, me?</span> <span id="s1627">______ They’re all Russian.</span> <span id="s1628">I passed through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: All Russian girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: I have this ability to mimic an accent.</span> <span id="s1631">I went through the Soviet Union to once again encounter anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1632">Jews don’t wash, Jews go to the front of the lines, they don’t fight.</span> <span id="s1633">I didn’t tell them I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1634">I learned right away if I want to go through that without much hassle, what do I have to tell them I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1635">I told them _____(?)</span> <span id="s1636">Polish.</span> <span id="s1637">I could hear it and I immediately realized that this is not a country I want.</span> <span id="s1638">I went through the Soviet Union to the place where my aunts were last.</span> <span id="s1639">I found some Ukrainian patients of hers who told me that they were all transported to what was formerly Germany and now became Poland.</span> <span id="s1640">It was a trading.</span> <span id="s1641">Polish Ukrainian became Soviet Ukrainian and Polish Jews from there were -- and Poles, not just Polish Jews --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: These were aunts from which town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: The town was B____(?)</span> <span id="s1644">which was the only part of Poland where they had oil, mine.</span> <span id="s1645">That’s where she lived and that’s where my sister went to visit before the war started.</span> <span id="s1646">I supposed she had some kind of pneumonia and that was good for her.</span> <span id="s1647">I still didn’t know if my sister was alive but I heard that she was on Aryan papers.</span> <span id="s1648">From there I went to Poland, to a Jewish committee in Prague.</span> <span id="s1649">They looked up lists and yes, your aunt is in such-and-such place.</span> <span id="s1650">I went there and they greeted me with where is your mother?</span> <span id="s1651">We heard she was alive.</span> <span id="s1652">I went to tell them the story and -- why did you leave her?</span> <span id="s1653">Can you imagine having this kind of greeting.</span> <span id="s1654">I needed a psychiatrist right there!</span> <span id="s1655">They told me, yes, your sister is alive but she never told these people that she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s1656">She’s going out with a boy who doesn’t know she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s1657">She doesn’t want to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1658">Maybe she will change if she sees you.</span> <span id="s1659">So I went over there and she didn’t change.</span> <span id="s1660">My parents killed Christ and I told her, years ago it wouldn’t have mattered to me but now I am Jewish so we better part company.</span> <span id="s1661">I suggest, I told her, I don’t want to stay.</span> <span id="s1662">I have to be on my own and I want to be where I am going to be free.</span> <span id="s1663">I am going back to the army and I am offering it to you.</span> <span id="s1664">I will manage, you come with me.</span> <span id="s1665">No, no, she had a boyfriend, her church and so forth.</span> <span id="s1666">I left and the only way I could go is with the Germans who were being sent to Germany from the Polish part.</span> <span id="s1667">But how can I go as a Pole, impossible.</span> <span id="s1668">I took my papers and they became my citizenship papers and I didn’t speak a word of Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: You mean -- which papers now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: I had an army paper: To Whom It May Concern, Miss Irene Hass is our interpreter and we would appreciate it if all help were given to her.</span> <span id="s1671">She is looking for her family in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: So this is an American document in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: That was British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: British, a British document in English ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Which they couldn’t really believe.</span> <span id="s1676">It had a very fancy stamp, it looked like a true citizenship papers, not very much different from my citizenship papers here.</span> <span id="s1677">That’s what I managed to tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: So you were able to fool the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: They let me though both the Poles and the Russians.</span> <span id="s1680">Not only this but on one corner of the bridge, they were telling the other corner, hey you there.</span> <span id="s1681">This is not a German girl, don’t be fooling around.</span> <span id="s1682">They were raping Germans.</span> <span id="s1683">This is the way I got to Berlin, West Berlin, into a British citizen camp which also had the AKA and the AKA army, Those soldiers were telling me, you can tell them the truth now.</span> <span id="s1684">You don’t have to tell them you’re a British subject by birth here.</span> <span id="s1685">Oh, no I said.</span> <span id="s1686">What do you mean, my father, my mother, now I don’t remember who was British.</span> <span id="s1687">I went back because of my mother or because of my father but my whole family’s there.</span> <span id="s1688">I was questioned by the British and I am sure that they didn’t believe one word of what I was saying but I was much too young to know from such things.</span> <span id="s1689">I maintained my story.</span> <span id="s1690">I was afraid they would send me back.</span> <span id="s1691">I didn’t tell them and I couldn’t get out of the situation because they had written to Great Britain, it would have come out.</span> <span id="s1692">I was wise enough to say I better get out of here.</span> <span id="s1693">Where do I go, I always wanted to go to the university, mind you.</span> <span id="s1694">I went to Berlin Medical School and it was raining through the roof which was non-existent.</span> <span id="s1695">They told me the only university which is totally intact is Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1696">That sounded great so I had a story.</span> <span id="s1697">I came to them and said, my medical school told me that I can get a transfer to Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1698">I did go to Heidelberg and I said let me know when the papers come from Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1699">I went to Heidelberg and that was the first time where I became me.</span> <span id="s1700">Not only did I become me, I enrolled at the university as an under-student but the Philadelphia Inquirer ran pictures of me.</span> <span id="s1701">Here they are.</span> <span id="s1702">This was all in the Philadelphia Inquirer playing the piano.</span> <span id="s1703">You see that I am corpulent.</span> <span id="s1704">This is the UNRRA officer and I am sitting in the office.</span> <span id="s1705">This is Ruth Krager that was in my girls’ dorm.</span> <span id="s1706">This is the JWV, Jewish center where the GI’s met with the Jewish girls and we had our salami and coke, salami sandwich and coke.</span> <span id="s1707">These papers appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer and my cousin is in Philadelphia and they discovered a survivor, one lonely survivor there, me.</span> <span id="s1708">A telegram came, registered to the American council for a visa.</span> <span id="s1709">At the time where I had already applied for savant (?)</span> <span id="s1710">because I did speak French.</span> <span id="s1711">I decided to go to America.</span> <span id="s1712">Before that time, a little bit before that happened in Heidelberg, a very strange thing occurred.</span> <span id="s1713">Because I am not an English speaking person and because my behavior was very much like that of gentiles and Wasps and because there was preconceived notion of children of immigrants who came here from the little shtetls without manners and without this and that, that I couldn’t be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1714">I was summoned before the and I didn’t speak Yiddish -- in other words, I just didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s1715">The other Jewish boys and girls even at the medical school were more like the type that you would find among New York Jewish people for instance.</span> <span id="s1716">It was just a total bias.</span> <span id="s1717">I was summoned to prove that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1718">I was questioned by a Canadian head of the Joint Distribution Committee to prove to them that I was Jewish before I get the toothpaste and the toothbrush or whatever else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Didn’t you have your tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: That didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1721">I could have done it to myself.</span> <span id="s1722">So I asked him.</span> <span id="s1723">He had an aide who was a German Jew.</span> <span id="s1724">I asked him do you speak any Hebrew?</span> <span id="s1725">He said no and I proceeded to recite poetry by the noted poet Bialy (?)</span> <span id="s1726">All he was interested in was the prayers and I knew the prayers and after two minutes, they realized.</span> <span id="s1727">I didn’t have enough guts and knowledge to just tell this guy what here the Polish organization was begging me to sign that I am Polish and give me anything just to sign.</span> <span id="s1728">We all signed stateless, we were furious with the Poles.</span> <span id="s1729">Why would he want me to prove I was Jewish?</span> <span id="s1730">Surely I wasn’t German, so what was I, Polish?</span> <span id="s1731">Why couldn’t you give me a toothpaste and toothbrush to a Polish girl?</span> <span id="s1732">That was horrible, I will never forget this denigrating experience.</span> <span id="s1733">But eventually my visa didn’t come, I didn’t wait and meanwhile Truman signed a 2,000 person collective visa for professional students and such.</span> <span id="s1734">I was asked to sign that.</span> <span id="s1735">I came here on that collective visa and my visa went to somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: When did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: I came here with the very first Marine perch (?)</span> <span id="s1738">in May of 1946.</span> <span id="s1739">I was greeted by the press for whom this was the first experience.</span> <span id="s1740">Nobody came before and that was that.</span> <span id="s1741">I stayed with my relatives for a while.</span> <span id="s1742">I knew English well enough to immediately enter Hunter College.</span> <span id="s1743">Tried to get to medical school, didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s1744">I knew Russian, taught myself to type and worked as a translator for Russians who went to school.</span> <span id="s1745">One of these days, I was introduced by my former boyfriend to that guy and that’s how the story goes.</span> <span id="s1746">We’re still friends with the boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Still married to the guy too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Still married to the guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: What happened to your grandmother back in Brezany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: I am told – I was told by one of my aunts that was in the hiding -- I am assuming that she may have heard it from the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1751">She was hidden by the Ukrainian family -- that my grandmother couldn’t get off the bed.</span> <span id="s1752">She was clubbed to death and that my aunt and my cousin, my girl cousin, were taken away.</span> <span id="s1753">What happened after that, I don’t know if they were shot, executed on the cemetery or wherever or taken to a camp to be executed.</span> <span id="s1754">Somehow I have the feeling that somebody said my little cousin was trying to run away.</span> <span id="s1755">He did look Aryan, he was blond and all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Sylvia’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Brother, that they shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: From the letters that you received, they were still alive in the spring of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1760">I’m putting that together with what I know later and they probably perished in that massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: The final deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: I didn’t even know that that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1763">I thought they were just doing it to people who were in bed killing them on the spot.</span> <span id="s1764">So with the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1765">Countless mounds of -- those who didn’t migrate to the United States at the end of the 19th century, some of my relatives were here already, and later.</span> <span id="s1766">Those who were, were still _____(?)</span> <span id="s1767">.</span> <span id="s1768">Some great aunts and uncles and cousins and second cousins that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Did you return to Brezany at the end of the war in ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: No.</span> <span id="s1771">That became the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1772">No, I didn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: You just went looking for your sister and your aunt and that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Yes, because by then I already knew that there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s1775">There were no small towns that had survivors.</span> <span id="s1776">No point going anywhere, no survivors anywhere.</span> <span id="s1777">Coming back from camps later, they were often hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: I have one small question I would like to ask you.</span> <span id="s1779">I’m pretty sure you’ll know the answer to this one.</span> <span id="s1780">That is the day that you were liberated, I’m sure you will not forget.</span> <span id="s1781">Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: April 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: April Fool’s Day.</span> <span id="s1784">So you were one of the first to be liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: We had to be, we were almost at the Dutch border, oh yes we were.</span> <span id="s1786">They had just broken through.</span> <span id="s1787">They were stalled, this is why we were marched toward Buchenwald because they were stalled.</span> <span id="s1788">They were bombing but they were stalled for a while at Ochen(?)</span> <span id="s1789">and we were not very far from Ochen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Normally, the forced marches and evacuations were in the opposite direction but instead you were moved closer towards the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: No, we were moved closer -- in between the Russians and the Americans, Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: I’m saying Buchenwald --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Closer to the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Yeah, so you were moved in a westerly direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: In an easterly direction -- we were between the two fighting armies.</span> <span id="s1796">They had no way, we were almost at the American lines, we couldn’t go west.</span> <span id="s1797">There was south, they could have taken -- no, Bergen-Belsen was liberated maybe 15 days later so that entire front line was really broken through.</span> <span id="s1798">The only way they could go is a little further east.</span> <span id="s1799">That indeed took a longer time.</span> <span id="s1800">Buchenwald was liberated much worse, much later and was in a worse shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: They had an order because each working camp was known as the ouserkommando and we were ouserkommando of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1803">That’s why they are marching us there but never got there.</span> <span id="s1804">That Polish soldier, I told the American.</span> <span id="s1805">I said now look, he was kind, he was helpful.</span> <span id="s1806">I said at least question him.</span> <span id="s1807">I was under the assumption he was going to be shot.</span> <span id="s1808">Because later on I did some things I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s1809">Women captured a horrible, horrible overseer who’s beating, in Germany, beating the women merciless.</span> <span id="s1810">The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme.</span> <span id="s1811">He says if I give him to the CID forget it.</span> <span id="s1812">With the white gloves nothing’s going to be done.</span> <span id="s1813">I know what we’ll going to do.</span> <span id="s1814">I have a dumb so-and-so southerner.</span> <span id="s1815">I will tell him that if this guy budges, he’s to shoot.</span> <span id="s1816">I’m going to stand there and I’m going to call for him to come to me.</span> <span id="s1817">Don’t say a word, he said to me.</span> <span id="s1818">I said okay at first.</span> <span id="s1819">This procedure was being enacted, something drove me out of it.</span> <span id="s1820">I screamed, no, don’t you dare to do it and spoiled the story.</span> <span id="s1821">He said why did you?</span> <span id="s1822">I says killed in battle but kill, his wife and children are standing, that’s not a revenge.</span> <span id="s1823">We are not vengeful people and that is what I would like to say to the blacks who executed a Jew.</span> <span id="s1824">We didn’t do it, very few cases where the people got out of camps and killed Germans.</span> <span id="s1825">You would have heard about them.</span> <span id="s1826">We are not vengeful people and I didn’t have it in me at that point, at least, or now.</span> <span id="s1827">I am not able to go to Germany and enjoy it, sightsee at this point because of the things that have been happening.</span> <span id="s1828">I cringed when I meet Germans who are the proper age and start questioning me where from Poland, where am I from?</span> <span id="s1829">I see the type but beyond this ---.</span> <span id="s1830">“Never again” means don’t let it go and get to that point.</span> <span id="s1831">That was before.</span> <span id="s1832">At this point I am most concerned with anti-Semitism whereas before I was concerned with all kinds of biases.</span> <span id="s1833">This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious and vicious because it singles one particular group of people to cure all ills anywhere you go.</span> <span id="s1834">You name a country where there was no anti-Semitism and no killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s1835">So it’s much worse than blacks because they’re not being singled out all over the world.</span> <span id="s1836">But Jews are, even in Japan, that never had and doesn’t have Jews.</span> <span id="s1837">Now I’m saying charity begins at home.</span> <span id="s1838">I put all of my efforts trying to stop this vicious happening.</span> <span id="s1839">That’s just the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: I thank you on behalf f the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and I certainly hope that your wish will come true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
