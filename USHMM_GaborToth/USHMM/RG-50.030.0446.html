__________________ that is, there are two Auschwitz publications,_______________ of Auschwitz, _______________ has the wrong _____________, so if they had got to swindle or to retouch or to add something to an aerial view, then the whole United States aerial view, aerial view photographs should be now investigated.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Question: If who swindled?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: There are photographs, you said, taken by the Air Force.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: That doesn't look to me like a photograph taken by the Air Force.</span> <span id="s16">That is a photo mounting of aerial, of aerial, aerial view of the region and a drawing which was added on top of the, of the map, just for educational purposes.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: It looks...</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Yes, _______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: But I thought you are

including later on, _______________ new zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to measure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I want to do that myself because I don't want to use _______________ original architectural drawings.</span> <span id="s24">Because we were smuggling out plans and if we would have ever caught, then they would have suspected that I have been involved, yeah?</span> <span id="s25">So I camouflaged my whole operation by, by, measuring the whole model which I made, measuring barrack by barrack and distances from each barrack and so on.</span> <span id="s26">So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system, good or bad, whatever ________________ _______________ afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I, I produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and _______________ _______________ sent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to Berlin.</span> <span id="s27">And so did all my other, other work of drafts and diagrams went to the_______________ ofttimes.</span> <span id="s28">But we had no fifth row in the _______________ camp flag like produced in all of those drawings.</span> <span id="s29">As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings, with correct numbers.</span> <span id="s30">Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more interested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, authentic, they are people who could not read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she learned to read an architectural map or a land drawing or so.</span> <span id="s31">And she just copies it and if go further you will find dozens and dozens, many dozens of ______.</span> <span id="s32">But how could the Air Force produce aerial views if, of things which did not exist then, I mean that is a very touchy, touchy, situation, don't you think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">I: Ann and I want to add is that yes, is that she remember that Helen made a map

id="s161">I: Because there are certain words I know in German or she knows in German and I don't, I am not Polish, I am not German, but I understand enough and certain things I can express in German much better than in Polish and vice versa.</span> <span id="s162">Or in English, so we'll see.</span> <span id="s163">We will need somebody who is bi, bi_______________ lingual to make sense of

that I spoke Hungarian in those days...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s175">I: So I said, I still speak Hungarian, it nearly cost my life because I speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s176">[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s177">I volunteered to come this _______________ into the block, into the barrack, the Hungarian newcomers there, _______________ SS wanted to_______________ the ride home.</span> <span id="s178">Now this _____________, huh?</span> <span id="s179">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s180">So _______________, when I went with her [speaks foreign language here], she instructed me what to tell_______________ girls.</span> <span id="s181">So she said, write home, write to your people and write to them whatever you want, that you are here and you are alive and you are well off.</span> <span id="s182">Each helped us, so what I did, I said to the Hungarian girls, "Look, you are told to write to your people but please don't write to the correct addresses of your people because some of them are in hiding or so.</span> <span id="s183">Write to the center Jewish office and ask them to forward it to certain people."</span> <span id="s184">And the Hungarian girls were mad at me because I told them not to write to their people, but to write through a center office.</span> <span id="s185">So they're running to the SS woman and told SS woman that I told them not to write.</span> <span id="s186">Now, then what could I do, she nearly, she went mad.</span> <span id="s187">She said, "Are you out of your mind?"</span> <span id="s188">I said, "No, they did not understood Hungarian."</span> <span id="s189">So, but it, it was, it wasn't fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: ___________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s192">The Nazis not believe me, but they believed the SS woman.</span> <span id="s193">And [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s195">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s196">That was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s198">I: [speaks foreign language here] asking me, "Are you out of your mind,?"</span> <span id="s199">Yeah.</span> <span id="s200">[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s201">She was caught in ____________, SS woman...</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s203">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s204">You will read about her, it's a book, which I _______________ with ______________, there_______________ is, I made a statement to the author about ______________, but in connection with _______________, not with my own experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s206">I: Yeah.</span> <span id="s207">_______________.</span> <span id="s208">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s210">I: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s212">I: Do you, would you have some patient, to translate a thin book to your mother, if I make you a present?</span> <span id="s213">From English into ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: It's, it's, it's, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">I: Because that's a biography, this is the biography of Gracie.</span> <span id="s216">Gracie ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s218">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s219">I: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s221">I: Now I'm telling her about one situation because she's ________________ arrived at the end of '42, but she's did not know prior to that what I have experienced as being amongst the very first women in the camp.</span> <span id="s222">And she's interested because the Auschwitz people at the museum, in their whole research and report have very little reports on the day by day happenings during.</span> <span id="s223">We have general, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as I have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a secretary who was [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s224">She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was arrested.</span> <span id="s225">Now, there is a special, an English expression for ________________, you probably know it, but it turns my tongue around and I have to look that up.</span> <span id="s226">In any case, if a Jew and a non-Jew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were unmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish and usually killed and the German woman ended up in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s227">The insignia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star, yeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Miller, he was there only for two months, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy.</span> <span id="s228">I, because I was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack during lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp and I called out to her, "Look, honey, I'm here."</span> <span id="s229">And she was running up to her office and all of a sudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Shteebitz(ph), "Where is that inmate so and so?"</span> <span id="s230">And then they guided him to me and then he asked me, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s231">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s232">I want to go back to work."</span> <span id="s233">So he said, "Come with me."</span> <span id="s234">Took me back to the barrack and asking me to go up and_______________ three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on top of the others, exactly the one you have at your museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very sick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times.</span> <span id="s235">Little he knew that I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm_______________ a girl, I could climb and I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed.</span> <span id="s236">I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals during my professional career and so on.</span> <span id="s237">He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as many times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what was this thing, ____, it's a ditch, yeah.</span> <span id="s238">There were ditches alongside the center, the central camp road, not like, _______________ said, [speaks foreign language here].</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s240">I: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s242">I: [speaks foreign language here] We are laughing because he, he translated this so funny.</span> <span id="s243">And he's a friend of her, so.</span> <span id="s244">Of, now what have I, yes, so he took me over to jump over the ditch and off to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s246">I: Ah, she said that was, that was ______________.</span> <span id="s247">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s249">I: It was quite, and I could jump, yeah, so I jumped.</span> <span id="s250">So I passed my jump, I passed my up and down and then, into the camp infirmary.</span> <span id="s251">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s253">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s254">In that office, there was Orly(ph), a German...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s256">______________, Orly(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s257">I: Orly(ph) ______________, who was a _____________, no

girls, _______________ German women from the_______________ first group that my friend Enna(ph) Weiss(ph) who was then already_______________ on the doctor, physician __________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s262">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s263">Then there were some employees, some nurses, everybody, yeah and the men in charge, the SS men in charge, Heinry(ph) Schwartz(ph), yeah?</span> <span id="s264">And he, he was not happy that the camp leader, sending over _______________ who was ______________, to overrule his desire to kill everybody and to gas everybody who is, who was there already waiting to be loaded onto the trucks.</span> <span id="s265">And while he, he, and, so he made it his business, he didn't know exactly how, what to do.</span> <span id="s266">Hirst(ph) described him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah?</span> <span id="s267">So whenever he had an

were selected and gassed, just like the Jews, people do not believe me, yeah?</span> <span id="s400">And here you have a witness, who went through three selections.</span> <span id="s401">But then later on, some of the researchers already _______________ sometimes it is mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And it was through out the

id="s408">I: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports arrived from Holland, France, Greece and so on.</span> <span id="s409">Then _________________, when they discovered another thing, not _______________, was they discovered then, that the Jewish numbers, the tattooed numbers, [speaks foreign language here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a sudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when the switch or the change of policy occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more, during an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where non-Jews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped when the big influx of Jewish people were coming.</span> <span id="s410">But then they discovered, all of a sudden that we are carrying the same number, the Jews and non-Jews alike.</span> <span id="s411">So how to distinguish during the selections?</span> <span id="s412">With a man they could do anything they want as they were marked, but a woman was not circumcised.</span> <span id="s413">So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a triangle under your number for Jewish women.</span> <span id="s414">And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was invented.</span> <span id="s415">And no one of those big shots who are now in research, engaged in Holocaust and Auschwitz research have the slightest idea why is the triangle is there.</span> <span id="s416">Now they started to put the triangle retroactive, but I was hiding.</span> <span id="s417">I knew what it meant and I just took, I decided if I can go away without the triangle, I do.</span> <span id="s418">And I'm still running around without the triangle of course it could have saved my life once in awhile, yeah, but not always because you were not gassed before your identity not established _______________ anyhow.</span> <span id="s419">But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I escaped many times those things because I had no triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So non-Jews, when they were selected, it was only inside the camp, it wasn't on the ramp, it wasn't in coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">I: Never.</span> <span id="s422">Only the_______________ transports, let me explain that to her.</span> <span id="s423">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: [speaks foreign

sleep outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">I: Outdoors, because they couldn't wait until the barrack was not put into order and cleaned.</span> <span id="s1022">Because the men were living before us there and that, they were not as good as a woman would have been by keeping the barrack clean.</span> <span id="s1023">In any case, it was a dirty barrack.</span> <span id="s1024">Full of all kinds of fleas, bugs.</span> <span id="s1025">I remember there were rats too, but she does not remember.</span> <span id="s1026">Rats.</span> <span id="s1027">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">I: See how,_______________ have used some poisoned gas for the gassing and the, the, for, my God, they are not even

couldn't even enter or sleep there because after the extermination, which took place in _______________, it was smelly and we were afraid to sleep indoors because we had the impression that's the same gas they have used for the extermination, but they've used on, on humans, so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed, of us, we were able to enter, to breathe, to sleep and to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So they actually tried to clean the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1035">Because the _______________ neglected the whole thing and the women were afraid to enter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Now were the women actually treating the barracks better than the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">I: Definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s1038">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">I: I am going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay?</span> <span id="s1041">Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be.</span> <span id="s1042">If men were, if a woman was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question.</span> <span id="s1043">Now my answer and her answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack.</span> <span id="s1044">So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, __________________, we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the _________________ Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I _______________ became part, not part, but in charge.</span> <span id="s1045">We were administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed.</span> <span id="s1046">What _______________ underlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting ________________ wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size.</span> <span id="s1047">Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report _______________ and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I could work and was called the drawing office.</span> <span id="s1048">They had neglected the _______________ drawing office all the time, I don't know why, I have been known ___________, known as the_______________ from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office.</span> <span id="s1049">So drawing office became ________________ office of the drawing office.</span> <span id="s1050">So I was _______________ from the [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1051">But, but she, especially on the _______________, certain functions could not be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the replacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide ________________ camp,_______________ barracks, ___________, designated to us, into a housing or sleeping, sleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities.</span> <span id="s1052">And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever.</span> <span id="s1053">And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">I: [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1056">I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to her previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of professions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well, in addition she added painters.</span> <span id="s1057">So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always looking for painters in the ________________, but in those days we had no painters, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: I wanted to ask you, when Katya came into your barrack...</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Was this Barrack

that women in this barracks had a drawing room and then because of Tsippy(ph)'s(ph) talent, she was a very talented drawer and, and, and graphic designer, so that was the reason why they opened a

important that they have inserted the plans and, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right thing, why have they used and copied the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that they have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views.</span> <span id="s1652">I've given strong signal, yeah?</span> <span id="s1653">Can I call that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: You mean, you mean with a diagram as opposed to a photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: With a diagram, correct.</span> <span id="s1656">But then they had not and you cannot even blame the people what they did because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland, by famous researchers like Dr. _______________ for example, he published the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one, I have that in both languages, in German and in, in, in Polish, which he forwarded to me because I, that's always active and tried to keep in touch with the post-war Auschwitz family of inmates, I mean, it's not the families, but we got a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with.</span> <span id="s1657">That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz committee, under the stewardship of ____.</span> <span id="s1658">And then there was the museum and there are people who tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no, they were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there was a stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect.</span> <span id="s1659">But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using some, they couldn't, tools, all those_______________ by foot, they had no experts to perform, they, to perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office, they didn't even know then that it ever existed.</span> <span id="s1660">People, the historians who were trying to start to bring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and so that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah.</span> <span id="s1661">We know today how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was,_______________ sit down and _______________ complain.</span> <span id="s1662">So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from __________________, that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1663">I mean they tried and they still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted because the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical background, yeah?</span> <span id="s1664">If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing for my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language into simple lines and diagrams.</span> <span id="s1665">The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after effects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Tsippy(ph) where was the, where were the, the building plans office?</span> <span id="s1667">In the men's camp or in the women's camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">I: No, you can spot that in one of the aerial views or you have to [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1669">You

in my head, I would, I'm asking her where was that, the answer.</span> <span id="s1672">No, it was not in A, it was in B, you see, because it couldn't have been but if you, she would not talk to me

[speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1833">We suspected, we suspected, we have [speaks foreign language here], that was a reason, [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1834">That was the reason why we have tried to bring that to the attention of the management in Theresienstadt when they arrive, to know in what direction, what the, how the camp was established and which direction was the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Did you know that when they were going to bring in people from Terezín...</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">I: Yeah?</span></p>

Auschwitz nothing, in Auschwitz [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">I: We were not sure what they are going to do, [speaks foreign language here], you see these, nobody knew, I think the people in Berlin didn't know what to do with them, they knew somehow they are going to bring an end to the people of Theresienstadt, but didn't know when the time was right.</span> <span id="s1847">The political situation, how to camouflage things, how to pretend, how to lure the people into be able to be driven into the gas chamber without any resistance.</span> <span id="s1848">So we were, nobody was sure the Germans in Auschwitz had no idea when, when and what order will come from Berlin, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">I: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Or understood.</span> <span id="s1852">Now here's another question.</span> <span id="s1853">The Gypsy camp is also men and women, the Terezín, the family camp is men and women.</span> <span id="s1854">What is the relationship of the men's camp to those camps and what's the relationship of the women's camp?</span> <span id="s1855">Because all the rest of the camp is divided by sex, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">I: Okay, only, only the role call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: So you took care of, the women's camp took care of the role call of the Gypsy family camp and the Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">I: Correct.</span> <span id="s1859">We knew exactly how many Gypsy women, Gypsy children, female, she does know that, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: [speaks foreign language

<span id="s1877">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">I: They had, in, inside, what I said, inside activities like food distributions, looking after the children, they had a little bit of cultural activities because there was nothing else to do, but there was no physical work performed, like in our so-called [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">I: The tragedy was that they made no use, during a war, where manpower or womenpower was short to use the young family members, men and women for something productive, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: You mean the Germans didn't use any?</span></p> <p><span

the possession of letters, before dated, compared with the date of, of, with the date of death of those people, while they were gassed, so we know only now how they were luring and pretending inside of the camp, the whole situation, to prevent disorders or disturbances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Is it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: [speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">I: [speaks foreign language here], nobody wanted to believe any more because the information from the camp underground, or whoever was sending ____________________, Theresienstadt, the report what happened and then the predated letters, the people in Theresienstadt and the world was confused.</span> <span id="s1896">And that what the Germans tried to do, but what you don't know is and you have not reported and never mentioned, [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s1897">Katya overheard once in an telephone conversation, while she was on her own, it is actually, but I'm not [speaks foreign language here], I wouldn't like to talk about it because it's very, very described what I have to say about Katya in one of the books of _______________ wrote in his last
