I'd like you to begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born.</span> <span id="s11">A: And then continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: If you would.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Steve Galezewski.</span> <span id="s14">I was born May 11th, 1923 in the Town of Inowroclaw in northwest Poland.</span> <span id="s15">The reason why I am talking today is I am a Pole who was born in a generation, the only generation really, in free Poland.</span> <span id="s16">Poland became a free country in 1918, and then was, of course, was attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s17">Being brought up in the climate of freedom, I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War.</span> <span id="s18">In my childhood, I was very involved, as well as my father, in the Boy Scout movement.</span> <span id="s19">This is the reason why my father was arrested and eventually killed by gestapo, because he was a leader of the youth in the Town of Inowroclaw where we lived.</span> <span id="s20">My childhood was a very happy childhood until the year 1939.</span> <span id="s21">At that time, I was 16 years old, and almost, I could say, that at time I had to put the uniform and start my war days.</span> <span id="s22">So you can see that I missed all the high school proms and the fun most of the high school kids have in their last days of high school.</span> <span id="s23">On September 1 ...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Could I just ask you to talk a little bit more about what life was like in this town and whether or not you had Jewish friends ...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s26">Well, let's erase the last sentence I had.</span> <span id="s27">In the Town of Inowroclaw, the Jewish population was not very numerous like in other parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s28">However, there was a beautiful synagogue with the roof which we thought was gold, gold-leafed roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">One of the better buildings in town.</span> <span id="s30">In my high school, I did have a class of some 25, 30 people.</span> <span id="s31">I had two Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s32">I remember their names.</span> <span id="s33">One was Smalish (ph) and the other one was Zowagazski (ph).</span> <span id="s34">Two different people.</span> <span id="s35">Smalish was not very athletic.</span> <span id="s36">He was more or less a sedentary type.</span> <span id="s37">The other one, Zowagazski, was involved with us in all the school activities like soccer, basketball, and he quite often visited my home, so I was fairly close to him.</span> <span id="s38">I wish today I knew whether they still alive or what happened to either one of them.</span> <span id="s39">When the Germans actually came to Inowroclaw, I don't recall any activity against the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s40">I don't remember, because most probably they had moved away from the German Army as the German Army came in.</span> <span id="s41">The war started for us, the Second World War started for us September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s42">Two, three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up in a soldier's family.</span> <span id="s43">My father was a professional soldier.</span> <span id="s44">And two, three days before his regiment, which was the 59th Infantry Regiment, moved to the defense line on the German border, he called me and gave me a pistol, which was a Walther 7.65 millimeters and had a talk with me man-to-man.</span> <span id="s45">And said, "Look, I am leaving.</span> <span id="s46">I don't know when I will be back.</span> <span id="s47">You are the oldest boy out of three of you.</span> <span id="s48">You will assume the role of the head of the family.</span> <span id="s49">I want you to take good care of your mother and two brothers.</span> <span id="s50">And then, of course, he went to war.</span> <span id="s51">Already after the war ended, I learned a lot of things which happens to him during that war.</span> <span id="s52">For instance, he was in the Battle of Kura, which was one of the fiercest battles fought during that campaign.</span> <span id="s53">And when the entire army was surrounded by German panzer divisions near that River Kura, they were already after three days of fighting without ammunition, without support of any kind.</span> <span id="s54">And casualties were extremely heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Commanding officer of the regiment, according to the write-ups in the newspapers, called my father and asked him to preserve the regimental flag.</span> <span id="s56">Regimental flag for a Polish soldier is something very sacred.</span> <span id="s57">Still today, when I see an American flag, for instance, not necessarily Polish, something grabs my heart, and I am ready to take the hat off my head.</span> <span id="s58">That's part of the upbringing I grew in.</span> <span id="s59">He, according to the versions in the newspapers and accounts of those who survived the prisoner-of-war camp, he apparently broke through the encirclement of Germans and buried the flag in a forest.</span> <span id="s60">Of course, he subsequently in 1940 was arrested by gestapo, that's the last time we saw him, and nobody knew where the flag was.</span> <span id="s61">In 1985, someone with a metal detector was going through the woods and detected that there was something buried.</span> <span id="s62">They dug it out and it was a backpack and in that backpack was the regimental flag, half destroyed.</span> <span id="s63">It was restored and is today flying proudly in the Army Museum in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s64">When father -- when the father was arrested -- this is something which really sticks in my mind.</span> <span id="s65">Because the gestapo came in early in the morning, he was not home.</span> <span id="s66">He was not home, and they said, "You sit down.</span> <span id="s67">We wait for him here.‚Äù</span> <span id="s68">And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s69">To me, it was a horrible because I wanted to warn him and yet, here were the gestapo bandits with a woman and three young boys.</span> <span id="s70">And I couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s71">Father was accused of trying to break away that region of Poland from the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Germans already considered Pomerania, that part of Poland, as their territory, and really, that's why the war started.</span> <span id="s73">Because they wanted a corridor from Germany to the Gdansk and to east Prussia.</span> <span id="s74">Poland, of course, refused to buckle under this trap, and that's how the war started.</span> <span id="s75">After arrest of father, we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our apartment and put in a concentration camp in Inowroclaw, where we were for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s76">After that, we were put into the cattle train and shipped out of the Verdun, out of what Germany considered - - what Germans considered German territory and were taken to the Warsaw region and the Minsk-Suwatki (ph), the doors of the cattle wagons were opened and we were let out to start a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: ... a few questions.</span> <span id="s78">You've mentioned that you had Jewish personal friends.</span> <span id="s79">Were you aware of a general climate of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, occasionally in the newspaper, you would read that a Jewish shop was demolished, and that something was going on.</span> <span id="s81">But not in the region of Poland where I come from, that's only from the newspaper I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: But was it something that other boys talked about ...</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, that was never really discussed, because to us, a human being was a human being.</span> <span id="s84">Whether you are Jewish or -- well, frankly, they were Polish citizens anyway, all of them.</span> <span id="s85">So to ask, there was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I'm also curious.</span> <span id="s87">Before September '39, what you knew about the activities of the Nazi Party ...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Well, that's -- again, we knew that inevitably something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s89">That's why in Poland our army was mobilized and we were somewhat prepared.</span> <span id="s90">To the extent that, for instance, my high school made donations from all the students, and we purchased a heavy machine gun for the 59th Regiment.</span> <span id="s91">It wasn't like you have here in the United States where you have millions of dollars for armament.</span> <span id="s92">Out there we had to scratch everything we could to arm ourselves.</span> <span id="s93">From my generation, there were some very heroic moves.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't have very many submarines, for instance, but we had what we called live torpedoes.</span> <span id="s95">And I was so proud of our house help, because she volunteered, 18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in household, she volunteered as a live torpedo.</span> <span id="s96">Germany, of course, we knew that was fully armed, was belligerent and that the trouble will come from there.</span> <span id="s97">Also, their treatment of Jews was giving us indication what will happen if they ever show up in Poland.</span> <span id="s98">As a matter of fact, somewhere from 1936, if I'm not wrong, we opened up pretty much for the Jewish people escaping from Germany or trying to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s99">We opened up the Polish borders and let quite a few of them into Poland.</span> <span id="s100">I'm pretty sure that they -- except for the incidents of anti-Semitism here and there, I'm pretty sure that felt at home, because in Poland for 30 million population, we had some 3 million Jews.</span> <span id="s101">So this was a very big percentage.</span> <span id="s102">I don't know how many millions of Jews are in Israel, but I'm pretty sure not much more than 3 million or maybe even less.</span> <span id="s103">We being prepared for a war somewhat, in Boy Scouts on all the camps to which we went in 1939, we were trying to make them on the Polish/German border.</span> <span id="s104">And during our campfires, we, of course, sung the Boy Scouts' songs, patriotic songs, always trying to warn Hitler not to try us -- not to try because we would not behave like the other countries behaved when Hitler invaded them.</span> <span id="s105">We wanted him to know that we will fight.</span> <span id="s106">That fight came in finally on September 1, 1939, when 5 o'clock in the morning 21 Heinkels, 88 Stukas bombed the open town.</span> <span id="s107">This is the first time I saw dead bodies, not only of horses and animals, but of human beings.</span> <span id="s108">Up to that moment, I didn't ever even go to a funeral, so this was for me a very traumatic day.</span> <span id="s109">I also when I think about that day, I almost have to laugh at myself.</span> <span id="s110">Because the 7.65 millimeter pistol my father me, I was trying to shoot down the diving bombers, and, of course, it's a laughable thing.</span> <span id="s111">It would be just like a fly going with an elephant.</span> <span id="s112">The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war, and I decided, although father designated me as the head of family, I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight.</span> <span id="s113">So I gave the pistol to my brother, who was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s114">Gave him the same talk father gave me, and very promptly lied my age.</span> <span id="s115">I was 16, I had to say I was 18.</span> <span id="s116">And I joined the 59th Regiment, that is the unit which was being organized in the back of the fighting unit.</span> <span id="s117">Went through most of the fights on the road from Inowroclaw, Warsaw, Lublin, Kovel'.</span> <span id="s118">The humiliation of the villagers and population was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s119">They were simply machine-gunning women and children, bombing villages which had nothing to do with the military.</span> <span id="s120">In the eastern Poland where we got near Kovel', Ukrainians started their own fight and started burning Polish village, and started burning and killing Jews and Poles.</span> <span id="s121">No wonder that later on, Germans were able to organize SS Militia Division out of the Ukrainians and use them as guards in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s122">The war was over basically in October 2nd, 1939, and I returned home in about November.</span> <span id="s123">Didn't get into the POW camp.</span> <span id="s124">Most of the Polish Army, of course, either crossed through Romania or Hungary, and eventually reorganized in France; or shed their uniforms with civilian clothing and returned home.</span> <span id="s125">When I came home, mother and my brothers were already there.</span> <span id="s126">Thank God they survived.</span> <span id="s127">Father came in later.</span> <span id="s128">He also, after saving the flag, returned home in civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s129">Of course, he did not talk about the flag at all, so I was unaware what was going on in that particular thing.</span> <span id="s130">When I was asked by the historians, I couldn't contribute much on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Was he angry that you hadn't followed his directions?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s133">Actually, we were all happy that everything finished and we were still together.</span> <span id="s134">Then, of course, after he was arrested and we were transported to the Minsk-Suwatki, we started a new chapter in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: I just wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s136">You mentioned that you and your family was put in this concentration camp for a few months or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: A couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: ... a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s139">Who all was in there with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: All the people like us who did not want to become .</span> <span id="s141">In that area, Germans considered that territory German, and they gave people an option to sign a German list.</span> <span id="s142">Yes, I am a German.</span> <span id="s143">And we considered ourselves Poles, and we did not want to become Germans.</span> <span id="s144">So all those people were simply taken out of their houses, put in concentration camps, and transported to what they considered Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And the Jews in your city were in this camp, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I don't recall that.</span> <span id="s147">I don't recall specifically seeing Jews in that camp.</span> <span id="s148">Q: What happened at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: This was a camp from which you either landed eventually Mauthausen or some other big camp, or like in our case, being transported to the other part of Poland, move them away from the German part of Poland.</span> <span id="s150">We were called displaced persons, DPs as they called them, they called us after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you remember exactly what your family thought about what was going on, why you were being moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, father, of course, was gone.</span> <span id="s153">With mother, talking about things of that was -- well, it was not normal to talk to mother about things men talked about, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s154">It doesn't mean that women were not treated equally in Poland, by any chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, at that age and from what I already went through, I wasn't frightened.</span> <span id="s157">Frankly, I wanted to fight.</span> <span id="s158">I wanted to revenge what they have done up to now from what I have seen.</span> <span id="s159">And remember one thing, that I was born in free Poland.</span> <span id="s160">I was brought as a free Pole, and I couldn't stand, for instance, things we were required in that town.</span> <span id="s161">Like at the entrance to the movie theater or to a restaurant or to a park where children play, a sign, "For Poles, Jews and dogs, entrance forbidden.‚Äù</span> <span id="s162">Or when I see a German walking on the sidewalk, I'm supposed to step into the gutter, take my hat off, bow, and stay in that position until he moves away three paces from me.</span> <span id="s163">Those were not things compatible with freedom I enjoyed in Poland.</span> <span id="s164">Therefore, I was looking for a source where I could arm myself and fight.</span> <span id="s165">I thought about crossing the border and getting to France where Polish troops were being organized.</span> <span id="s166">Somehow that didn't happen, because when they let us out of in Minsk-Suwatki, we had absolutely no money.</span> <span id="s167">We had absolutely no time to take anything from our household, jewelry or anything.</span> <span id="s168">We were simply taken out.</span> <span id="s169">And incidentally, into our house or into our apartment, they put Germans whom they transferred from like where they are to other regions.</span> <span id="s170">So in one minute, you lost your entire life's assets.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What was the ?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: That was like April, May 1940 -- I'm sorry, '41.</span> <span id="s173">Not so sure, not so sure.</span> <span id="s174">It's '40, '41, somewhere there.</span> <span id="s175">One thing I should also mention, the Jewish synagogue, incidentally, they burned it.</span> <span id="s176">But first, they took the golden leaves off.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Who else would have been ?</span> <span id="s178">Did they prevent you from going into Polish schools or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: There were absolutely no Polish schools beyond the sixth grade.</span> <span id="s180">Germans considered us a race which was supposed to be eliminated after they eliminated the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s181">We were the number two in line.</span> <span id="s182">And, therefore, they said they don't have to be educated beyond the simple reading and arithmetics.</span> <span id="s183">Therefore, no high schools in Poland.</span> <span id="s184">Of course, immediately the underground high schools sprang up, and the former teachers, you know, they were meeting in groups of four, five, ten private homes and continuing the studies.</span> <span id="s185">Universities, of course, were nonexistent for Poles.</span> <span id="s186">In the area of Minsk-Suwatki, I was a stranger.</span> <span id="s187">I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s188">It took some time before I started to know who is who.</span> <span id="s189">I have joined, of course, first thing, the high school -- underground high school where I continued my studies.</span> <span id="s190">Out there among the boys, I found my first contact on the fighting underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Let me change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well, that was among these students in this underground high school.</span> <span id="s193">And after a while, I was asked to join an underground organization, fighting organization.</span> <span id="s194">And I was worn in; of course, I have to be certain that I was swearing the obedience to the right people and fortunately I did.</span> <span id="s195">Because this was the Polish government under the allies, which was at the time located in England, in London.</span> <span id="s196">I won't say much about the high school, but I will mention one thing.</span> <span id="s197">That my last year in that high school, the principal came in to me and said, "Look, you are in endangering the group.</span> <span id="s198">We will give you your high school certificate.</span> <span id="s199">You don't have to attend any more of the classes.</span> <span id="s200">We know you are engaged in the underground activities.‚Äù</span> <span id="s201">And he did that to a couple of other boys from my group, so we basically did not finish the actual, listening to actual lectures.</span> <span id="s202">But we got the graduation on the merit of what we had done up to that point.</span> <span id="s203">And that was, of course, the second year.</span> <span id="s204">I was in this almost 18 months.</span> <span id="s205">The beginning, my beginning in -- also, general life conditions in Minsk- Suwatki at that time -- in 1940 when we arrived there, I think it was late 1940.</span> <span id="s206">The Jews already had to wear the Star of David on the arm band, but they were not in ghettos.</span> <span id="s207">They lived in their own homes like they did before.</span> <span id="s208">And I think late in 1940, I remember, the ghetto was organized in Minsk-Suwatki.</span> <span id="s209">This was a very unique ghetto because no wires or no barbed wires were put in.</span> <span id="s210">But they simply designated four main streets as the boundaries of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s211">Of course, the order of the day was that any Jew who was found outside of that was shot on the spot, and that happened quite often.</span> <span id="s212">I didn't see, personally, myself the shooting, but I've seen the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Something happened maybe 15 minutes I arrived at that point.</span> <span id="s214">The ghetto I think was fairly loose and a lot of Jews from Minsk-Suwatki, I think managed to mingle with Poles and get away from the town, according to various villagers.</span> <span id="s215">And farmers, of course, it depends again on the personality of the farmer.</span> <span id="s216">Quite for money, quite often for humanitarian reasons, they would hide and save the Jews.</span> <span id="s217">This was very dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever, food or sheltering, you endangered your entire family and your village.</span> <span id="s218">It happened many, many times where a neighbor who didn't like his neighbor said, "Hey, my neighbor yesterday gave something to the Jews who came out of the woods, out of the forest.‚Äù</span> <span id="s219">Well, that entire family was wiped out, and their house was burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s220">And the news all around was arriving, this happened in this village; this happened in that village.</span> <span id="s221">So population, Polish population basically was very frightened and very careful on it.</span> <span id="s222">This probably could be the reason why it was universally practiced.</span> <span id="s223">On the other hand, AK, which is the underground organization to which I belonged, and that means -- AK means Army Krajowa, which is home army.</span> <span id="s224">Had very specific orders to assist and help as much as possible by absorbing young Jews who were in the forest and wanted to join the guerrillas, they were welcomed with open arms.</span> <span id="s225">As a matter of fact, here in Los Angeles, we had an example of that.</span> <span id="s226">In my combat organization, Mr. Harter, who belongs to veteran's organization, veteran guerilla organization, was saved by Poles and survived the war by being in the guerilla unit.</span> <span id="s227">I heard of many, many instances of the same thing happening, but this is my personal involvement with Mr. Harter.</span> <span id="s228">My beginning in the underground was simply what they call small sabotage.</span> <span id="s229">We were putting placards on streets, anti-German, trying to change their morale, which at the time at the beginning, 1940, '41, was still pretty high.</span> <span id="s230">But we were trying to pass some messages to them by graffiti type, by placards, by all possible means that the war, the fighting is a hopeless war.</span> <span id="s231">They're not going to win.</span> <span id="s232">After a few months, I graduated from this small sabotage into the real fighting unit where we were, for instance, protecting the parachute drops from England.</span> <span id="s233">We also were protecting on other occasions the radio station which was communicating with the West.</span> <span id="s234">In 1941 there were still very few actual attacks on German compounds, but in 1942 the speed of the military involvement increased.</span> <span id="s235">And in that I took part, and oh, in 1942 in blowing up two trains.</span> <span id="s236">In 1943, ammunition train, we blew up and also took materials to support ourselves from various industrial complexes like a chocolate factory where we took tons and tons of sugar.</span> <span id="s237">We loaded them on the horse and buggies the peasants supplied.</span> <span id="s238">And then sold that for money to support the guerilla activities.</span> <span id="s239">Blew up a vodka distillery, other smaller activities wherein the villages -- in every village, Germans said you have to deliver so many horses, so many cows, so many tons of grain or potatoes for the Germany effort.</span> <span id="s240">And usually, there were designated people who were responsible for that.</span> <span id="s241">And those people knowing that they're working and they can be banished for it, they were very eager.</span> <span id="s242">We tried to dampen their enthusiasm and warn them not to do it in a too eager way.</span> <span id="s243">If someone like that didn't listen to us, next time we took him and publicly in that village, let's say, 50 lashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">We also watched women, that they wouldn't go with German soldiers or German civilians.</span> <span id="s245">If that happened and she didn't get the warning and continued, a unit would go shave her head to zero and put a finger on her that she was a prostitute.</span> <span id="s246">Smaller other things, and usually the boys 12, 13, girls even were involved in it.</span> <span id="s247">In the movie theater, there would be a German with a Polish prostitute in the mink coat.</span> <span id="s248">Well, they would have the spray bottle with the strong acid, and very quietly would spray that acid on the fur coat of the girl.</span> <span id="s249">By the time the girl was leaving the movie theater, the fur coat was almost falling off her back.</span> <span id="s250">Those were the expressions of resistance from the youngest all the way up.</span> <span id="s251">We tried to liberate our prisoners.</span> <span id="s252">We attacked several prisons and liberated quite a few.</span> <span id="s253">What Germans in Warsaw, however, for every German killed, they tried to wipe out 25, 50 Poles.</span> <span id="s254">And what they would usually do, they would put a sign on all the visible places in Warsaw that today or yesterday a German soldier was attacked and killed.</span> <span id="s255">For that 50 Poles tomorrow will be executed, although they were listed as possible people to go free.</span> <span id="s256">So the terror was unbelievable, but by the year 1942, '43, we realized that if we were doing nothing as we were in 1940, let's say, the underground, we were dying.</span> <span id="s257">We were being hanged on the streets for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s258">The concentration camps were full of Poles, not only Jews, but Poles.</span> <span id="s259">Of course, those Jews from Poland were Poles anyway, so there's no distinction there.</span> <span id="s260">But in the Polish located camps, Germans, of course, brought Jews from other countries.</span> <span id="s261">From that you can see what the situation was developing in Poland.</span> <span id="s262">So we finally decided, hey, if we have to die, we might as well die taking some of them with us, and that's where this pace of resistance accelerated.</span> <span id="s263">And that's where more trains went up, more bridges were blown up.</span> <span id="s264">More attacks on the airfields and other military objectives happened.</span> <span id="s265">By 1942, I think it's July 1942, in July 1942 out of the ghetto I think they have taken some 220 people and in one day shot them at the cemetery, at the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s266">Now, I have not witnessed that, but it was universally known.</span> <span id="s267">On August 1942, the Minsk ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s268">What happened is the Germans, Latvians, Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police, rounded all inhabitants of the ghetto into the marketplace.</span> <span id="s269">A few thousand people were in that marketplace, and they didn't know what is going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s270">They stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s271">Some were trying to escape, and they were, of course, shot during the escape.</span> <span id="s272">Next day in a column -- they formed the columns and all the inhabitants of the ghetto were marched into the railroad station where numerous cattle wagons were waiting for them.</span> <span id="s273">They were loaded with the help again of Jewish police.</span> <span id="s274">The Jewish police, although not armed, they had baseball bats, all of them, and special hats and special arm bands.</span> <span id="s275">During that transport and during the gathering of the ghetto in the marketplace, the word was that about 1,000 of the Jews were shot.</span> <span id="s276">Where the trains went, I'm not sure whether they went to Majdanek or Auschwitz or some other camps.</span> <span id="s277">I have witnessed the march from a window on the street to which they were going, I have witnessed the march of the Jews to the trains.</span> <span id="s278">I have not seen personally anyone killed, because the region where I was was rather short visible from the window where I was.</span> <span id="s279">But I could hear the shots, and then the word came in the next day and the following day among Poles that about 1,000 were shot during that incident.</span> <span id="s280">So this was the finish and annihilation of the Jewish ghetto in Minsk.</span> <span id="s281">There were, of course, 500 craftsmen -- tailors, shoemakers, people who were taken out of ghetto before, and they were housed in the Copernicus (ph) School, and they were working for the German Army, working on the German uniforms.</span> <span id="s282">Working on producing shoes, doing things which were useful for the German Army.</span> <span id="s283">From that group, sometimes in 1943, '42, '43, some 200 were taken and shot again in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s284">The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army.</span> <span id="s285">On January 6th, which happens to be a Polish Catholic holiday, that's why I remember the date, was the annihilation of the rest of the Jews from the Copernicus School.</span> <span id="s286">How did that happen?</span> <span id="s287">And that I personally witnessed.</span> <span id="s288">At that time I had the documents on my own name; however, they were documents very strong which I received from the underground channels, underground help.</span> <span id="s289">I was a fireman in a factory.</span> <span id="s290">There was a factory in Minsk where several of us from the underground were employed for the simple reason that those documents allowed us to be on the street after the curfew.</span> <span id="s291">Curfew in town was like 7 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock, no Jew, no Pole could be on the street.</span> <span id="s292">Only Germans were allowed to be after curfew on the streets.</span> <span id="s293">So with those documents, of course, we could go on our underground activities, gather for the job to be done somewhere.</span> <span id="s294">That very morning on the 6th of January, we noticed shooting.</span> <span id="s295">And looking outside we see a lot of smoke coming out.</span> <span id="s296">Being, of course, a fire brigade in a factory, our concern was supposed to be a factory, but we decided to go and see if we can help and put the fire out in town.</span> <span id="s297">So we all put the helmets on, jumped into the wagon, and went toward the smoke.</span> <span id="s298">Well, the smoke was coming in from the Copernicus School where the remnants of the Jewish population of Minsk were housed.</span> <span id="s299">On arrival, the entire building was in flames.</span> <span id="s300">The roof was on the verge of collapse.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Outside one could see uniformed Latvians, Germans, Sicherheitspolizei, and Polish police shooting at the window and generally trying to finish whoever was trying to get out of the fire.</span> <span id="s302">I could see two piles of bodies some six, seven feet high, piled up next to the school.</span> <span id="s303">I could see on the ledges of windows half-burned bodies.</span> <span id="s304">I could a mother with a little child trying to throw the child out of the window when someone shot her and killed her.</span> <span id="s305">The thing which stayed with me for many, many, many years after the war, however, was an incident which happened a few steps from me.</span> <span id="s306">A gendarme, a German six-foot plus tall, because I am six foot so I can judge the height, some 250 pounds heavy takes a little Jewish girl by the hand.</span> <span id="s307">Leads her to the wall, sits her by that wall, corrects her posture even.</span> <span id="s308">Moves back a few steps and shoots her right in the head.</span> <span id="s309">Now, at a moment like that, one is ready, of course, to jump and do something, but what could one do?</span> <span id="s310">I could only pay back for happenings like that through my underground activities.</span> <span id="s311">Because anything on the spot out there would have meant death to all of us.</span> <span id="s312">I did not want this to be forgotten in case they do not have in the museum any records of what happened in Minsk- Suwatki.</span> <span id="s313">Two often one hears the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s314">Well, here is one eyewitness who saw what was going on and what was happening.</span> <span id="s315">Where the Jews from Minsk were taken, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s316">Whether this was Majdanek, whether this was Sachsenhausen or Auschwitz, but usually those three were the main sources of gathering the Jews from Polish ghettos in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: No.</span> <span id="s319">Frankly, we didn't hear much about it.</span> <span id="s320">Although I tell you one thing from reading after the war, we had a courier from Poland who is still alive, still lectures.</span> <span id="s321">Who went from Poland to London and reported to allies and to Roosevelt and Churchill what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s322">Because Germans were trying to say nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s323">Well, so the Jewish population in the United States through that should have known what is happening to their brothers and sisters in Poland.</span> <span id="s324">And yet, to my disappointment, they didn't do enough to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: I was curious how and where you were at that time .</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No, you were not aware.</span> <span id="s327">Your movements were so limited.</span> <span id="s328">You were not supposed to move from one town to another town, so the people who were aware that there was something going on were only the people who lived close by.</span> <span id="s329">In 1943, of course, as I said, the pace of the underground activities accelerated considerably, and also in 1944.</span> <span id="s330">The defeat of German was very apparent in 1944.</span> <span id="s331">One could see the things they had to do to sustain their fighting.</span> <span id="s332">For instance, an order would come in like winter 1943 to all the Polish women.</span> <span id="s333">Any fur coat you have you have to deliver to a pickup point.</span> <span id="s334">So they picked up all the fur coats any woman had in Poland.</span> <span id="s335">The next few months, you could see the Germans coming out of Russia on their tanks wearing women's fur coats.</span> <span id="s336">The winter was hitting them so badly in Russia, they were not prepared for it, that they had to be in Polish ladies' fur coats.</span> <span id="s337">Underground was prepared to the point that when the defeat of Germany was apparent and before the Soviets moved to Poland, liberate ourselves.</span> <span id="s338">There were at that time in the underground some 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s339">When that day came in, when the Soviet troops moved on the territory of Poland and the Warsaw uprising started on August 1, 1944 -- and incidentally, when I talk about Warsaw uprising, I'm talking about the Polish uprising.</span> <span id="s340">There was a Jewish uprising in Warsaw several months before that.</span> <span id="s341">It didn't last very long.</span> <span id="s342">Resistance was not very strong.</span> <span id="s343">Polish underground tried to help by delivering to the underground channel through the sewers a lot of arms to the fighters in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s344">But those few who were fighting were eliminated and that was liquidated totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You know, I'm not sure whether something is -- we're starting a new tape.</span> <span id="s348">It might -- I wanted to learn a little bit more some of the specific risks you undertook in some of your underground activities.</span> <span id="s349">And I also want to ask you questions about general underground organization, but wherever you want to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, let's first talk about the organization of underground.</span> <span id="s351">In the early days of war, that means 1939, '40, there were multitudes of organizations, underground organizations, all eager to fight Germans.</span> <span id="s352">They ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right.</span> <span id="s353">In the extreme right, you had what probably what gave the rest of us the anti-Semitic, how you call it?</span> <span id="s354">The anti-Semitic, I'm fighting for a name, image.</span> <span id="s355">Those were the extreme right organization, Knesset, Natrilova Shevis Brenner (ph), where they considered that Poland is only for Poles.</span> <span id="s356">They were as close to the Nazi thinking that one could go, but they were soldiers; they were fighters, and they were supported from the West probably more than we were from England.</span> <span id="s357">Some of them when order came to consolidate all the fighting units, some of them didn't join and stayed separate, like in Knesset (ph) .</span> <span id="s358">Most of the unit except the branches of Knesset and except the Communists, Army , which were run by Stalin, by Moscow, joined together.</span> <span id="s359">And from that Army Krajowa emerged.</span> <span id="s360">Army Krajowa in 1943, '43, one could consider entire nation in the underground.</span> <span id="s361">It had all kinds of functions like medical/sanitary functions all over the country.</span> <span id="s362">It had underground court system all over the country.</span> <span id="s363">It was run from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s364">There was one head man, general, who was the head man of the Armia Krajowa, but in each region -- and Poland was divided into several regions.</span> <span id="s365">Like my region, Minsk-Suwatki, was called Varangia.</span> <span id="s366">That's a region between Minsk and Lublin.</span> <span id="s367">In each one of those regions, there were subdivisions where a small village would have an Ob Vood.</span> <span id="s368">Ob Vood was still subdivided into what they call platsuski (ph).</span> <span id="s369">That was the smallest possible underground unit, platsuski, which consisted usually of one or two platoons of the local peasant, local soldiers, who would train on weekends when they didn't work in the fields.</span> <span id="s370">They would go and train at night in the art of military fighting.</span> <span id="s371">There was a system of military schools.</span> <span id="s372">For instance, I am a graduate of the underground military officers' school, which I took for several months in 1942, '43.</span> <span id="s373">During that period, for instance, that gives you an idea to what extent we went during those several months, there were numerous instances where we fired live ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Where we spent nights and nights in woods learning the survival techniques.</span> <span id="s375">Occasionally, on something like that there would be an action where you would blow up a bridge or a train or something.</span> <span id="s376">During the -- the aim was so well specified that in small towns, the military objectives in case the uprising, they're already designated for individual units, for individual platoons.</span> <span id="s377">To give you an example, in Minsk there is a police headquarters.</span> <span id="s378">That's a building which is three stories high.</span> <span id="s379">That three-story high building has only one entrance, so guards were put out there.</span> <span id="s380">You know, they pretty well controlled entry to it.</span> <span id="s381">Well, each window had a balcony.</span> <span id="s382">We had ladders stored for months waiting for something to happen out there where we wouldn't have to look for ladders, that the ladders were already there.</span> <span id="s383">We took the ladders and attacked them from balcony, rather than through the doors.</span> <span id="s384">It was so well thought through, so well organized, that it's incomprehensible sometimes.</span> <span id="s385">Numerous -- for instance, I took part in a liberation of a prisoner who was caught by gestapo, was tortured and we were afraid he might break.</span> <span id="s386">We went -- and they kept him since he ...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: ... okay, you were trying to ... this prisoner who you thought might break.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s389">And incidentally, his name is Tarchinski (ph), I remember still.</span> <span id="s390">And he was after being beaten, the doctors advised gestapo that he will die if he is not taken to hospital.</span> <span id="s391">So they took him to hospital with a gendarmes or gestapo man sitting by his bed.</span> <span id="s392">Well, we went to free him in German uniforms.</span> <span id="s393">We entered, nobody even stopped us.</span> <span id="s394">The man by the bed of our comrade didn't even lift himself off the chair when we entered the room.</span> <span id="s395">Several, several actions were performed in such a fashion that either German uniforms or gestapo uniforms were worn.</span> <span id="s396">I was myself in gestapo uniform two, three times on various actions.</span> <span id="s397">It's not universally known in the West, but some very, very high-ranking SS officers were executed in Poland.</span> <span id="s398">One of them was the head of the gestapo for the entire eastern region.</span> <span id="s399">His name was General Kiichira.</span> <span id="s400">If I remember, he was even son-in-law of Himmler.</span> <span id="s401">He was executed on Warsaw street.</span> <span id="s402">The death sentence was given to him for his activities against Poles and Jews, and he was executed.</span> <span id="s403">So you can see that we had the -- not only the judge, but we had also the executioners in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: First of all, how was the underground economy?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: This is all entire nation underground.</span> <span id="s406">Schooling system, medical system, court system and then army.</span> <span id="s407">When the Warsaw uprising started on August 1, the so-called what we call code name Buja (ph), which is tempest.</span> <span id="s408">Tempest was declared, and out of the underground some 300,000 underground people came out in various parts of Poland and started hitting the German units.</span> <span id="s409">How the uprising in Warsaw started, 5 o'clock in the afternoon -- and again, every unit had objective.</span> <span id="s410">This unit was taking the powerhouse, this unit was taking post office.</span> <span id="s411">Some other unit was taking the railroad station or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s412">On 5 o'clock, August 1, 1944, windows suddenly opened and any German on the street was just killed from the window by people like you and me.</span> <span id="s413">Warsaw uprising was ready and was supposed to last four, five days at the most.</span> <span id="s414">And we had enough ammunition and supplies for that.</span> <span id="s415">By that time it was universally assumed by all of us that there will be landings in Vilna and Gdansk from England, that Marines will be in Poland.</span> <span id="s416">The Polish forces, the paratroop brigades that we had, will be dropped on Warsaw.</span> <span id="s417">Instead, what they did they took and annihilated that part of brigade in Arnheim.</span> <span id="s418">That was incidentally, under the leadership of General Sasaboski (ph).</span> <span id="s419">When you look at the movie theater "Bridge Afar," Sasaboski is mentioned and the paratroopers are mentioned in it.</span> <span id="s420">The Warsaw uprising lasted 62 days instead of those four, five days.</span> <span id="s421">And I would say that almost everybody was involved in that fighting.</span> <span id="s422">Civilian people were digging the trenches, were putting the barricades on every street.</span> <span id="s423">Young children were used to take messages in between.</span> <span id="s424">Kitchens were set up my housewives all over.</span> <span id="s425">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s426">In first days, almost entire Warsaw was in our hands.</span> <span id="s427">After those five, six days when there was no ammunition, only that ammunition we had which we took from Germans, was taken.</span> <span id="s428">Germans used some unusual techniques.</span> <span id="s429">For instance, to give you an example.</span> <span id="s430">Barricaded, they cannot take.</span> <span id="s431">Any tanks they use gets burned by the Molotov cocktails from windows all over.</span> <span id="s432">Tank on narrow streets is not a good weapon to use.</span> <span id="s433">But they had armor, so the people were protected out there.</span> <span id="s434">As long as they stayed away from the area approaching the barricade, they could fire that cannon and then machine gun at will.</span> <span id="s435">And we couldn't do much because all we had is the rifles and then the pistols.</span> <span id="s436">What they did in a couple of instances in Warsaw, they surrounded the wives, mothers and children, put them in front of the tanks, and moved them toward the barricades.</span> <span id="s437">And the people behind the barricade see the mother, see their sister, maybe.</span> <span id="s438">They know what to do.</span> <span id="s439">You shoot your own or you let them break your barricade and make a breach into your defense line.</span> <span id="s440">Well, you're faced with decisions like that.</span> <span id="s441">I won't tell you what happened in those instances, but you figure out what you would do in a case like that.</span> <span id="s442">They also invented, I would say, what we call the Goliath.</span> <span id="s443">It's a little tank, small one, maybe one meter long.</span> <span id="s444">And they put on it half a ton, two- or three-quarter of a ton of dynamite, and this was electrically controlled and they could direct it.</span> <span id="s445">Here is a building which we're defending for two weeks, they cannot take it.</span> <span id="s446">They direct that right at the building and they explode it right at the building.</span> <span id="s447">Of course, not only this building but buildings around go with -- just like what you've seen here in the United States in car bombs.</span> <span id="s448">Warsaw finally fell after 62 days of furies, out of AK, some 17,000 died.</span> <span id="s449">Total population loss in Warsaw was over 300,000 in 62 days.</span> <span id="s450">If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60,000, here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting.</span> <span id="s451">In 62 days, you have over 300,000 casualties.</span> <span id="s452">Of course, Warsaw negotiated the surrender with the German Army.</span> <span id="s453">The German Army was pulled from the eastern front, was pulled from wherever they could find them to just defeat Warsaw because that was their road from Russia to Berlin.</span> <span id="s454">At that time in other parts of Poland -- and incidentally, during the negotiations the Warsaw commander negotiated with Germans that the AK guerrillas and the fighters of Warsaw will be considered under the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s455">Up to that moment, they considered us bandits.</span> <span id="s456">In other words, anybody could shoot us without getting any responsibility for it, taking responsibility for it.</span> <span id="s457">The surrender conditions were that they all will be treated under the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s458">That means they will go to the regular prisoner of war camp, and that, they lived up to that, one must say.</span> <span id="s459">The rest of Poland continued fighting.</span> <span id="s460">The rest of Poland continued fighting and was fighting -- Soviet troops, of course, came in through treachery by inviting the Polish officers for the joint strategy sessions, the Russians invited them and those officers never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">They landed all in Siberia.</span> <span id="s462">The troops without the officers were surrounded by Soviet troops, were disarmed and forcibly forced into a Polish Army under the Soviet command, which had an obedience to a Soviet puppet government in Moscow.</span> <span id="s463">They created a Polish government in Moscow consisting of some hard-nosed Polish Communists.</span> <span id="s464">I found myself in that army eventually, and in that army, incidentally, that army was being organized east of Lublin between Homel' and Lublin.</span> <span id="s465">In Lublin, on the outskirts of Lublin is Majdanek, and that's where my unit was stationed, in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s466">We had out of Majdanek five guards, which were put into this time, not an underground anymore, but a formal court.</span> <span id="s467">The court found them guilty of atrocities against the Polish and Jewish population, and they were sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s468">And the execution of the guards was performed in Majdanek itself.</span> <span id="s469">My company was assigned to put a barrier between the witnesses, the hundreds and thousands even of population, and the place of execution.</span> <span id="s470">The place of execution was very simple, the gallows was put up and the trucks came in with the open back.</span> <span id="s471">The guardsmen with their hands tied and their legs tied were stationed on the beds of the trucks.</span> <span id="s472">And on command, the trucks moved and they simply dropped and were hanged.</span> <span id="s473">We only hanged four of them because one of them hanged himself in the cell.</span> <span id="s474">In the unit, I was a company commander as a second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s475">That unit was training for battlefront activities, and after a few weeks, I discovered that most of the soldiers in the unit are the Polish guerrillas, AK.</span> <span id="s476">Officers like me who were commanding different companies, they were also AK.</span> <span id="s477">Well, we got together; we got together, and we have decided that we have to organize something within this brigade, when the allies finally show up in Poland, that we as a unit can then arrest all the Soviet officers in the unit and all the political officers in the unit and simply fully armed cross into the allied side.</span> <span id="s478">Well, after a few weeks, we accomplished that, and we had underground army within the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s479">We made contact on the commander officer of the AK for the Lublin region, which was still operating.</span> <span id="s480">He was underground, he was not arrested by the Russians and gave himself under his command.</span> <span id="s481">This is probably silly to say at this point, but I will mention it.</span> <span id="s482">We made a proposal to this particular head of the underground for that region that in October when there was a big parade was going to be held in Lublin.</span> <span id="s483">And in that parade the entire Polish government formed in Moscow plus Marshal Orkorsowski (ph) and some Soviet generals were supposed to on the tribune receiving the parade of all the Polish troops, which were ready to go into battle.</span> <span id="s484">This is October/November 1944 at that time.</span> <span id="s485">We made a proposal that we give our soldiers live ammunition for that parade, and the moment we are in front of the tribunes, we open fire at the government and show the world that Poland does not want what Soviets are bringing, and that that government created by Soviets in Poland means nothing to us.</span> <span id="s486">We are obeying the government inland at that time which was cooperating fully with the United States, England and allies.</span> <span id="s487">Well, supposedly, the message was sent to them and came back saying, "Forget about what you're proposing because Stalin would then make out of Poland simply a Soviet Republic like he made it out of Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia.‚Äù</span> <span id="s488">So we promptly forgot it.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: I'm going to ask you stop at this point.</span> <span id="s490">When you were talking about the hanging of the guards at Majdanek, is this the period when you and the Soviet Army liberated Majdanek there?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s492">That was already four, six weeks after.</span> <span id="s493">Majdanek was liberated I believe in July somewhere, and this was happening July, August, September; end of September somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Were you part of the group that went in and liberated Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s496">At that time I was still in the Polish underground in the area of Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: And when you were speaking about the Warsaw rising and how people were fighting all over the country in the summer of '44, where were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Okay, a week before the Warsaw uprising started, we pretty much knew that the end was nearing.</span> <span id="s499">Because you could see on the major highways from east to west chaos.</span> <span id="s500">It reminded us of 1939, where you could civilians, you could see German soldiers individually, on bicycles, on foot, on horseback, on military vehicle, civilian cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">You could see that the panic was setting and that they were running from Russia.</span> <span id="s502">So a week before uprising started, we went to destroy all the communications between the east and west.</span> <span id="s503">That meant all the telephone lines, all the railroad lines going to Minsk to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s504">I was assigned the region between Minsk and Warsaw, and we simply blew up the rails.</span> <span id="s505">Somebody else did the telephone poles and got them down.</span> <span id="s506">Somebody else in the different regions west -- I mean east of Minsk did the same thing.</span> <span id="s507">Then we had a concentration of our entire area ordered for a certain time and certain date.</span> <span id="s508">And after accomplishing our blowing up of the rails, we decided to move to the concentration point.</span> <span id="s509">At that concentration point, there was supposed to be 22nd Infantry Regiment and Brigade Calvary which is the Mazovian Calvary Brigade.</span> <span id="s510">One of my boys said, "Well, inside of walking, how about getting a car and riding there?"</span> <span id="s511">Well, we decided that that was not a bad idea, and took the fire engine from the fire station in Minsk.</span> <span id="s512">We put our guns under the blankets.</span> <span id="s513">Put the helmets on, and drove out of town, not directly to the concentration point, but on the secondary roads we stayed overnight in a village.</span> <span id="s514">Next day, we still stayed in that village because to get to concentration point, we had to cross the main highway, and by that time, the front was already nearing.</span> <span id="s515">You could see the entire sky red, you could hear the guns.</span> <span id="s516">You could hear the , which were the Soviet rockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">So at the -- in the evening when it was just about dark, we started moving, and we got to the main highway in total darkness without lights, without anything.</span> <span id="s518">It seemed to be absolutely empty.</span> <span id="s519">We got on the major road.</span> <span id="s520">Suddenly I see somebody striking a match, and my heart stopped.</span> <span id="s521">I see an SS helmet, and I see unshaven faces of several SS soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: I hate to do this, but we're out of tape.</span> <span id="s523">It's a bad point to stop.</span> <span id="s524">Okay, let me just do something for a second.</span> <span id="s525">When we unfortunately stopped you, you saw the SS helmets.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Almost automatically without thinking, I hit the bell on the fire engine, and we kept going on the road.</span> <span id="s527">And the Germans either because they are so disciplined, and to them it was very logical that somebody was driving -- that the fire engine was going towards the fire, didn't even think.</span> <span id="s528">We passed that turnoff where we were supposed to turn off and disappeared.</span> <span id="s529">What happened there, it was an SS Hermann G√∂ring panzer division.</span> <span id="s530">Four days later when we went through the battlefield out there, we could see the remnants of some of the tanks who took part in that battle, mostly German tanks.</span> <span id="s531">On the concentration point, we had some 3,000 people concentrated, which was this regiment and the calvary brigade I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s532">The defensive lines were -- on several villages, we took our defensive lines and stayed on the defensive line awaiting the front somehow to roll over us.</span> <span id="s533">Because the front was still east of us, and they were withdrawing west.</span> <span id="s534">So that night I see planes very high, flying from west to east.</span> <span id="s535">One of them burns, comes down like a meteor, and that's it.</span> <span id="s536">The next morning, I'm going on a patrol with a group of soldiers to penetrate the woods to see if anything is going out which were like few hundred yards from us.</span> <span id="s537">In the woods, we see movement.</span> <span id="s538">We see uniforms which don't look German.</span> <span id="s539">That's where Soviet paratroopers with a radio station, they were dropped behind the German line.</span> <span id="s540">Well, we kind of waved at each other, the white thing.</span> <span id="s541">Started talking.</span> <span id="s542">From them we learned that they were parachuted behind.</span> <span id="s543">We told them we are the Polish guerrillas.</span> <span id="s544">We also told them that -- that morning, we found incidentally from that burning plane, we found one man with half-burned parachute.</span> <span id="s545">So we told them where buried the man.</span> <span id="s546">On the radio station, they passed that to their headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Their headquarter wanted to know our strength, our location, where we were.</span> <span id="s548">Well, I wasn't going to give it to them, but I gave them a guide and sent them to the headquarters.</span> <span id="s549">They wanted information, headquarters could give it to them.</span> <span id="s550">Four days later, we were withdrawing -- and incidentally, our involvement at that time was very simple.</span> <span id="s551">We didn't get into any major fight.</span> <span id="s552">All we were doing was disarming single or two, three German soldiers running away.</span> <span id="s553">So it wasn't the war I was really trained for.</span> <span id="s554">Four days after that, we're passing through the area where we met this SS Hermann G√∂ring division.</span> <span id="s555">And the burned bodies in tanks and the tanks were really telling us that that big tank battle between the Soviet tanks and German tanks took place there, and that the German tanks were waiting to jump on the moving Soviets.</span> <span id="s556">Most of our officers, as I mentioned, were invited for a strategy session.</span> <span id="s557">Never came back from that strategy session.</span> <span id="s558">The next time we heard from them was Ruzyne on Siberia.</span> <span id="s559">Soldiers were surrounded, disarmed and put in -- we made a proposal to them.</span> <span id="s560">Leave us as we are, arm us a little bit better and we go right now today with you for Warsaw, to liberate Warsaw.</span> <span id="s561">Well, how naive I was as a young boy, it was all preprogrammed what would happen to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s562">Stalin simply wanted that to last until Germany finishes Warsaw, because he knew that all the fighters in Warsaw were anti-Communist.</span> <span id="s563">So he wanted Hitler to wipe out the anti- Communists for him, and that's precisely what happened.</span> <span id="s564">We as the faithful allies of America, England and the Western world, we were really let down and left to fend for ourself.</span> <span id="s565">I don't think we deserved that.</span> <span id="s566">We were the most faithful friends the West had at the time, but that's how the war sometimes ends.</span> <span id="s567">Lesson from it from my own personal experience is don't let the war ever happen on you own soil; fight it somewhere else.</span> <span id="s568">You fight it in Vietnam or some remote place, at least your mothers, your sisters are not being raped and then murdered and houses burned.</span> <span id="s569">So let's fight it somewhere else, not at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Where your family?</span> <span id="s571">What happened to your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: My family, my younger brother found himself with -- he was at that time -- well, let's see, this was 1944.</span> <span id="s573">He was 17, I found him in the same concentration where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">And, as a matter of fact, he was the first one who put Polish flag in Minsk-Suwatki on the ratush (ph) of Minsk-Suwatki.</span> <span id="s575">The younger brother and mother stayed in a village where they were settled after being kicked out of our own home in Inowroclaw.</span> <span id="s576">And that village, the fight took place in that village.</span> <span id="s577">Some of that village was burned, and they stayed in the cellar and survived.</span> <span id="s578">I was -- my unit after - - first of all, my unit was taken in the liberation of Warsaw, which was not much of a fight.</span> <span id="s579">Germans already were running.</span> <span id="s580">What I found, however, and never forget is the ruins and the rats.</span> <span id="s581">Rats fed on the bodies, human bodies, were so fat and so numerous it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s582">And the houses, I couldn't find one single house unscratched.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Everything was burned and finished, to the ground.</span> <span id="s584">My unit was ordered to stay in Warsaw in garrison.</span> <span id="s585">The other went east towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s586">We in Warsaw, we were supposed to pick up from cellars remnants of Germans, individuals or still a small unit which was hiding somewhere.</span> <span id="s587">They were not problems for us, the Germans out there because, you know, my entire unit were former underground guerrillas.</span> <span id="s588">Each one had some kind of a casualty, so right there that was for them the opportunity to even the score a little bit.</span> <span id="s589">So we didn't take any prisoners.</span> <span id="s590">The problem we had was with Soviets.</span> <span id="s591">Soviet troops, before they entered Poland, they were told by Stalin, by their commanders, "After you cross the border, do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s592">Just pay them for what they did in Russia.‚Äù</span> <span id="s593">And they really started in Poland already that.</span> <span id="s594">So they were raping Polish women, for instance.</span> <span id="s595">We being on patrol duty because the being in the garrison involved patrolling the streets, you come on incidents where there are some drunken Soviet soldiers.</span> <span id="s596">Well, you want to disarm them; they don't want to be disarmed.</span> <span id="s597">What do you do?</span> <span id="s598">Well, in most cases, we had to shoot them.</span> <span id="s599">Sometimes, you know, a woman, for instance, reported every night a soldier, drunk soldier is trying to break into my house, my apartment.</span> <span id="s600">Apartment, whatever she rebuilds, wherever she was.</span> <span id="s601">Well, we left a couple of men there for a night with her one night, and sure enough, 11, 12 o'clock .</span> <span id="s602">Russians want that she open the door.</span> <span id="s603">Well, after he was insistent on it, the boys opened fire right through the door, and sure enough, there was a Soviet soldier on the other side.</span> <span id="s604">So Poland was on the verge of getting rid of one occupant, Hitler and Nazis, but was at the beginning of another occupation, Red Terror, the Soviet, the MKVD.</span> <span id="s605">I was in Warsaw in Warsaw garrison till March 1945.</span> <span id="s606">March 1945, my commanding officer tells me, "They have something for you.</span> <span id="s607">You have go and report to another unit where they give you the instructions.</span> <span id="s608">You might be going to the front.‚Äù</span> <span id="s609">Which I wanted to go to the front anyway.</span> <span id="s610">I wanted to pay Germany back for what they did in my country.</span> <span id="s611">I got in the car with two other officers.</span> <span id="s612">I didn't know they were not from my unit, and they pointed the door to me, "That's where the commanding officer is.</span> <span id="s613">You have to report to him.‚Äù</span> <span id="s614">I entered the door and immediately the guns were pointed to me.</span> <span id="s615">Two Polish officers in Polish uniforms, none of them could speak. "</span> <span id="s616">," which means hands up.</span> <span id="s617">They took my lieutenant's stars out, took my eagle from my cap, took my sidearm and the belt and I landed in the cellar.</span> <span id="s618">For three days, nobody bothered about me out there.</span> <span id="s619">Then the interrogation started.</span> <span id="s620">I'm accused of organizing underground within the army, which I did, of course.</span> <span id="s621">But who would be talking?</span> <span id="s622">How do they know?</span> <span id="s623">How much do they know?</span> <span id="s624">So I totally denied everything till the very end.</span> <span id="s625">I finally learned that another Lieutenant Oliva, his name, was also arrested and that he is a couple of doors down from me.</span> <span id="s626">So seeing that they don't have much, I denied till the end that it's not true.</span> <span id="s627">That I'm a Pole who fights for Poland, and I had in July, after three months of interrogation -- I didn't sign anything.</span> <span id="s628">I had a court martial.</span> <span id="s629">In court martial, there were three officers, staff officers in Polish uniforms.</span> <span id="s630">None of them could speak Polish.</span> <span id="s631">They needed a translator for me.</span> <span id="s632">And I was stripped of citizenship, of my belongings.</span> <span id="s633">Whatever was mine was no longer mine and got six years hard labor, whatever.</span> <span id="s634">Then I was put in the infamous Rakayetska (ph) Prison in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s635">Mostly people in that prison were former AK.</span> <span id="s636">And what happened in the meantime after I was arrested in March, my second in command, Lieutenant Horoshevski (ph), -- and he doesn't appreciate my fighting stories, the peaceful Swiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Okay, where we stopped, you weren't quite done.</span> <span id="s638">Your second in command.</span> <span id="s639">You were talking about being in prison in Warsaw and your second commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: The second in command in my unit, Lieutenant Horoshevski, as I learned later, took whatever soldiers were in the garrison at the time and fully armed crossed into the guerrillas who were operating still in that region.</span> <span id="s641">They knew that there was something going on in this unit.</span> <span id="s642">So on account of their being smart, advised I guess to take all the soldiers remaining in the brigade and spread them throughout the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s643">So they took four, five, maybe ten soldiers, put them in this regiment; another 10, 20 in some other regiment.</span> <span id="s644">That way the entire brigade in which I was disappeared.</span> <span id="s645">So I landed in the Rakayetska Prison, which was the prison which held mostly the former AK accused of -- well, being AK was enough to go to jail.</span> <span id="s646">They were calling us at that time "spit-on midgets of reactionary forces.‚Äù</span> <span id="s647">That's how they called, Russians.</span> <span id="s648">In that prison a lot of executions took place.</span> <span id="s649">By that time there were no Jews there anymore, strictly Poles.</span> <span id="s650">There was a cell where they were torturing people.</span> <span id="s651">And we knew that because next to the cells, they kept always the, what do you call, you carry the wounded on them.</span> <span id="s652">Stretcher.</span> <span id="s653">There was always stretcher and we could kind of peek and see that on a stretcher, they were taking a body at night out.</span> <span id="s654">The cell in which we were was very small, and there were some 13 of us.</span> <span id="s655">One slept on the floor, and actually to turn around, it had to be on command.</span> <span id="s656">Everybody had to turn because there was not enough room.</span> <span id="s657">For urination and physical discharge, there was barrel kept inside, just covered.</span> <span id="s658">So the smell was horrible.</span> <span id="s659">After that prison, I was arrested in June -- I mean in March 1945.</span> <span id="s660">In July of 1945, I was half blind.</span> <span id="s661">Partial blindness from the lack of vitamins, I guess.</span> <span id="s662">I lost some 60 pounds during that period of time, and I peeked through the window and I see horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s663">But all I could see is maybe left leg of the horse and the right ear and maybe a head of the peasant who was running it.</span> <span id="s664">I couldn't see the full picture.</span> <span id="s665">One night in July, suddenly something unusual happened.</span> <span id="s666">They taking us for a shower and they shaved us totally to the ground.</span> <span id="s667">I mean head and everything.</span> <span id="s668">Well, the word went they taking us probably to Russia, Siberia.</span> <span id="s669">They don't want Polish insects out there in Russia, I guess.</span> <span id="s670">They have enough of their own.</span> <span id="s671">They washed us and the trucks, several trucks came in on the property of the prison inside.</span> <span id="s672">And they started loading people into the trucks.</span> <span id="s673">We didn't know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s674">I suddenly looked and I see in one of the loys (ph) my company chief, Sergeant Shuper (ph).</span> <span id="s675">He just happened, just happened by miracle that the group of soldiers when they disbanded the brigade was put in the unit which was ordered to transport us somewhere.</span> <span id="s676">Now, Shuper recognized me immediately.</span> <span id="s677">Put his finger on his lips, and then when the trucks started moving, he jumped into the truck with me.</span> <span id="s678">That's when I learned that Horoshevski took the rest of our soldiers who were at the time in the barracks and took them into the German guerrillas.</span> <span id="s679">That's where I learned that the brigade was disbanded and Shuper is telling me that "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s680">When you ask to be taken to urinate out of the railroad car, just run.</span> <span id="s681">And the guard will shoot above your head, so you don't have to worry.‚Äù</span> <span id="s682">And I told him, "No, either all of us or none.‚Äù</span> <span id="s683">"You will be going to a territory where the guerrillas still operate, and I want you in every stop we make to pass the word that the AK prisoners are being transported to Russia.‚Äù</span> <span id="s684">And, of course, wherever we stopped -- and we stopped many times because the Soviet war was still on.</span> <span id="s685">The Soviet troops -- no, the war over in May, but trains east/west with the military equipment and troops were having the priority.</span> <span id="s686">So we were stopped quite a few times.</span> <span id="s687">We were singing the songs of the Warsaw uprising, the patriotic songs.</span> <span id="s688">People ...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: You know, I have to stop you.</span> <span id="s690">We have one second of tape ...</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: People would look at the cattle wagons with the barbed wire on the windows and look at our thin faces and listen to the song we're singing and they were crying and you know -- at least we knew we had the sympathy of the population.</span> <span id="s692">Nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s693">And then on one station, I noticed some younger people in the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">And one of them kind of motioned and I see a gun, and I knew that somebody was observing us.</span> <span id="s695">Next day, shots are fired.</span> <span id="s696">Right away, I jumped to the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Through the window I see, you know, a perfect performance of military tactic.</span> <span id="s698">A platoon coming out of the woods towards the train.</span> <span id="s699">The train stopped right there on the spot.</span> <span id="s700">There is no firing from the train to the people coming at the train, not one shot.</span> <span id="s701">The shots were guerrillas just warning.</span> <span id="s702">Actually, it was a shot for the engine man who stopped because he was AK also.</span> <span id="s703">And the railroad people throughout were notifying as the train was moving who it is and where it's going.</span> <span id="s704">That was a guerilla unit of a man with a code name Orelek (ph).</span> <span id="s705">He sustained his unit hiding Russians till 1938.</span> <span id="s706">The war was over in 1935, he was fighting still in 1938.</span> <span id="s707">He was finally shot by the Valitsia.</span> <span id="s708">But at that time we, of course, shouted, "Long live Poland.</span> <span id="s709">Long live comrades who liberated us.‚Äù</span> <span id="s710">Disarmed the convoy, gave the Poles in the convoy -- because the commanding officer was Polish, the political officer, second in command, was Russian and he ran away.</span> <span id="s711">And the rest were all conscripts and some AK, so the Orelek say, "Do any of you want to stay in guerrillas?"</span> <span id="s712">A few of them did.</span> <span id="s713">The rest of them, we took their uniforms and let them go in their underwear.</span> <span id="s714">And that's how I joined Orelek's unit.</span> <span id="s715">And Orelek was basically protecting Polish population from the abuse of MKVD and Militia.</span> <span id="s716">The Militia particularly, and they were arresting AK or something like that.</span> <span id="s717">He made them pay for it.</span> <span id="s718">They concentrated so many troops, Russian and Polish, to get rid of him that it was not very comfortable anymore as a unit.</span> <span id="s719">So he went into the old technique of the underground.</span> <span id="s720">People went home and they were on call.</span> <span id="s721">They were coming out on call to do the job which had to be done.</span> <span id="s722">But I decided -- I had at the time a fianc√©e on the other side of Vistula River in Sopot.</span> <span id="s723">People, my family and people thought that I was dead because something I have not mentioned during this interview.</span> <span id="s724">I was taken by Russians in Minsk-Suwatki once and managed to run away from that situation -- and I have to catch my breath.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Let's take a break.</span> <span id="s726">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: So the family thought that I was dead because there was an incident in Minsk- Suwatki from which they deducted that the MKVD shot me.</span> <span id="s729">What it was, myself and one of my soldiers, we were stopped by Soviet patrol and asked for the documents, who asked for documents.</span> <span id="s730">Well, we, of course, didn't have the documents because in the guerilla we didn't documents, but we were fully armed.</span> <span id="s731">So we clash and shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">From that where the Soviet soldiers were killed and my soldier was killed also.</span> <span id="s733">And I was taken alive with the concussion by grenade because we jumped into a house and defended ourselves in the house.</span> <span id="s734">So they accused me of being a German with a radio station who's communicating with the German planes still attacking Soviet troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Because Warsaw was still occupied by Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s736">I managed -- and it's a long story, I will not elaborate too much, but I escaped from that place.</span> <span id="s737">So as you can see, the family and friends and everybody thought I was really after that incident in Minsk, shot by MKVD.</span> <span id="s738">For that reason, when I decided to see my fianc√©e, when I showed up out there, it was a lot of joy.</span> <span id="s739">And at the same time, a lot of worry that something might happen to me.</span> <span id="s740">I stayed there for a few days, recuperated pretty well from the malnutrition I had in prison, and relaxed.</span> <span id="s741">And the girls talked me into going to the movie theater.</span> <span id="s742">Well, I went reluctantly to the movie theater.</span> <span id="s743">And at the end of the film, two , those are policemen, Polish policemen, come to me and say, " ?"</span> <span id="s744">Which means "Are you citizen, and may I have your documents?"</span> <span id="s745">Well, my documents were very good.</span> <span id="s746">They were not in my name, but they were perfect.</span> <span id="s747">The underground had very, very good places to make them.</span> <span id="s748">And nothing was wrong with the documents, but they insisted I go with them to the police station.</span> <span id="s749">I say, "Why?"</span> <span id="s750">"Well, we'll explain to you when we get there.‚Äù</span> <span id="s751">What could I do?</span> <span id="s752">I was not armed at that time.</span> <span id="s753">I left everything behind me.</span> <span id="s754">We go to the station, and I am accused because of my shaved head, I'm accused of being a deserter from the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s755">Well, all the recruits in Polish Army get shaved the moment they start the military, and they keep them that way.</span> <span id="s756">So here for the Militia man looking at my head shaven in prison, it was an indication that he could be a deserter.</span> <span id="s757">I stayed in that prison praying that they don't transfer me to Warsaw, because if they transferred me to Warsaw, that's the end of me.</span> <span id="s758">Managed to notify the girls of a contact in AK, and what they came up with is an ingenious solution.</span> <span id="s759">They have prepared documents calling Mr. Orovski (ph), which is me under that new name to military service.</span> <span id="s760">So the girls took that document to the prison, and explained to the commander down there that "How can you keep him for a desertion from the army?</span> <span id="s761">That's not true.</span> <span id="s762">He just got it today, the document calling him to report to the army.‚Äù</span> <span id="s763">Well, I accepted the cigarette from the commander and from the commander even a little shot of vodka.</span> <span id="s764">And he wished me the glorious service in people's army, and I said to myself at that time, "This is it.</span> <span id="s765">There's no life for me in Poland anymore.‚Äù</span> <span id="s766">I went back, covered my numbers with the Orelek's people, went back to Inowroclaw.</span> <span id="s767">Said good- bye to mother, put a pistol behind my belt and starting moving toward the Polish borders where we have Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s768">And at that time it was the closest to the zone of American occupation because Vienna was in American hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Let me stop you here because there was something that confused me earlier.</span> <span id="s770">When you said that your brother -- your mother and one brother was fighting in a village ...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: And where was your other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: He was -- I don't even know where he was because we were not in the same unit.</span> <span id="s774">He was totally separate from me, and I only noticed him that he was on the concentration.</span> <span id="s775">But he stayed in Warsaw and eventually was in uniform also.</span> <span id="s776">Then got of the uniform ...</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: But he was part of the underground, as well?</span> <span id="s778">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s780">I just wanted to clarify that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: So I was moving towards the southern frontier of Poland, fully armed with good documents.</span> <span id="s782">Managed to get to kind of a railroad important point, .</span> <span id="s783">And at the railroad station I noticed some different uniforms, black uniforms and black beret.</span> <span id="s784">And when I came closer I hear French language being spoken.</span> <span id="s785">Well, it happened that those were the French Shasserdelpen (ph).</span> <span id="s786">Whoops, .</span> <span id="s787">In English, the Alpine Fusiliers or something like that.</span> <span id="s788">And they brought into Poland from the displaced person camps in Germany from the French occupation zone, they brought in Poles back to their own country.</span> <span id="s789">And then they were returning back to Germany.</span> <span id="s790">I, with my high school French, I told the soldier that I would like to have a word with his commanding officer.</span> <span id="s791">A young lieutenant came in, I started talking with him with my high school French.</span> <span id="s792">Told him that I am a Polish guerilla, that if I do not get into the allies in the West, I will be probably sooner or later caught and finished by MKVD.</span> <span id="s793">Would he help?</span> <span id="s794">Would he be a good soldier and help Polish brother?</span> <span id="s795">Well, he happens to be a French marquis also, so he understood the guerilla brotherhood.</span> <span id="s796">And after a while, he came in and I got a black uniform.</span> <span id="s797">Put on the black uniform, and with the French through several Russian controls, as a matter of fact, I got through Czechoslovakia to the American zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s798">And from there I was transferred to the Polish Army in Italy and attached -- or assigned to a Polish commander unit.</span> <span id="s799">And that was how I bailed out of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What was the purpose of this Polish unit in Italy at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Polish units in Italy, they went under British command as part of the Eighth British Army, all the way from the beginning of war almost.</span> <span id="s802">They took part in the -- there was entire corps, Polish corps consisting of some 60, 70,000 men.</span> <span id="s803">They went through the African campaign, they were fighting in Tobruk.</span> <span id="s804">Then they went on landing.</span> <span id="s805">They took, as a matter of fact, Monte Cassino, and when the war was over, they were occupying Italy.</span> <span id="s806">So I stayed, of course, in the unit all the time during the occupation of Italy, except for a few months I was sent to school for young officers, company commanders.</span> <span id="s807">And went through some commander training, additional.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">And then we were just waiting until we returned back home to Poland fully armed, kicked the Russians out of there sooner or later.</span> <span id="s809">And accomplish what we started in 1939, fighting.</span> <span id="s810">Well, it just didn't happen.</span> <span id="s811">It just didn't happen.</span> <span id="s812">The order came in in 1947 for us to leave in Italy all heavy equipment, all the tanks, all the armor, artillery, everything we had and were so proud of.</span> <span id="s813">And with short arms only to go to England where we were supposed to be demobilized.</span> <span id="s814">Well, that didn't go very well with some of the career officers.</span> <span id="s815">There were instances that they shot themselves.</span> <span id="s816">My school commander just couldn't see how we could be betrayed like that and left.</span> <span id="s817">All his dreams were shattered, so he shot himself.</span> <span id="s818">I was too young to do that, and I hoped that one day I will still come to the country of my fathers fully armed and that was to be.</span> <span id="s819">For 50 years Poland was given to the Soviet Union by Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin by Yalta Agreement.</span> <span id="s820">And we suffered 50 years, and the country right now starts to recover.</span> <span id="s821">The best solution for Poland right now is to be admitted to the NATO.</span> <span id="s822">They're willing and ready and they won't shame anybody fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I want to backtrack for a little bit if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s824">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: I have interrupted before, but the underground, I know that you said it was a mixture of people with many political organizations.</span> <span id="s826">Was that a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s828">Not really.</span> <span id="s829">They still tried to -- well, like, for instance -- but that could happen to almost anybody.</span> <span id="s830">In my unit we had the night exercises, and we were shot at by the Akmechet and had two killed, two people killed from my unit.</span> <span id="s831">Because they were having their exercises separately, you know, without communicating properly with each other.</span> <span id="s832">And we just walked into their defensive position and walked out of there minus two people.</span> <span id="s833">But politically, we were not really involved at all.</span> <span id="s834">We were a fighting force.</span> <span id="s835">Politics for us, I didn't care what it was.</span> <span id="s836">I just wanted to defeat the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Were there different approaches on how to go about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: There might have been on the high level.</span> <span id="s839">On my level, which is the front, right there in the trenches almost with maybe a hundred men under my command, there were no</span></p> <p><span id="s840">political problems whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Did you work with the partisans at all?</span> <span id="s842">A: Well, it is partisans; I was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: How important was direction from the organization versus taking your own initiative?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: To prevent chaos it had to be.</span> <span id="s845">I tell you sometimes it clashed.</span> <span id="s846">For instance, in my case, to give you an example.</span> <span id="s847">We had orders not to touch individual Germans because it was bringing retaliation.</span> <span id="s848">That was in the early days, '41, '42.</span> <span id="s849">Well, at that time me and a couple of high school friends, we disobeyed that order.</span> <span id="s850">We were waiting for drunk Germans to get arms, to arm ourselves.</span> <span id="s851">We just killed them and took their arms.</span> <span id="s852">But without direction from up above, you would have chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Were there certain cardinal rules?</span> <span id="s854">Were there certain things that you were taught when you were inducted?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Well, one cardinal rule, and that's in the swearing, in the form of the swearing, even it's mentioned.</span> <span id="s856">That any cooperation with Germany or with the enemy will be punished by death.</span> <span id="s857">Any snitching, you know, against Pole to the enemy or taking Jewish, anything which you do against the Jews, same way.</span> <span id="s858">It was strictly -- and was very clear.</span> <span id="s859">There was no "if" and "but" on that.</span> <span id="s860">We were to help whenever we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: What about secrecy?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Well, secrecy how it worked, you had to keep the secrecy, and that's why to start with, you only knew four people besides you.</span> <span id="s863">The groups were five, five, five.</span> <span id="s864">So if anything happened, only five -- might be a thousand, only five would diminish because you didn't know anybody else.</span> <span id="s865">There were not very many traitors in Poland, not very many.</span> <span id="s866">And if they were, they were properly dealt with.</span> <span id="s867">Went into underground court, executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Was the general population pretty supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Without support of population, you cannot fight a guerilla war.</span> <span id="s870">You have to have a population on your side.</span> <span id="s871">The population, of course, in Poland was frightened, was beaten to the pulp sometimes.</span> <span id="s872">You had to do some convincing occasionally so that they would help you.</span> <span id="s873">For instance, we had some problems with getting horse and buggies to move from one area to another area.</span> <span id="s874">Either wounded or equipment or even go in a quick action where you wanted to be faster than just walking.</span> <span id="s875">Some farmers, you know, we approached.</span> <span id="s876">They said, oh, they would do anything not to do it.</span> <span id="s877">Eventually, I think we took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: How did you know who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Well, you basically didn't trust anyone in those days.</span> <span id="s880">You really didn't know who it was.</span> <span id="s881">So you had to have either someone from your unit with whom you were for a long time or be on your alert with any newcomers you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: You were constantly on alert?</span> <span id="s883">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Now, just in terms of sort of the logistics, of the difficulties in terms of getting -- how you got food, how you got information, how you got supplies, how you got directions, how did this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s886">First of all, the communications.</span> <span id="s887">Girls, young Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts were used for that.</span> <span id="s888">They carried the messages between the towns and the commanders of the units.</span> <span id="s889">Usually the messages were coded.</span> <span id="s890">Couldn't use the radio stations because Germans had very good equipment to detect.</span> <span id="s891">As a matter of fact, in the early days we had a special unit which was protecting the radio station.</span> <span id="s892">That the unit got into clash several times, and we abandoned that and instead, we had three, four people unit moving the radio stations as many times as possible.</span> <span id="s893">As far as logistics, food, we tried as many times as we could to sleep in villages.</span> <span id="s894">We had permanent quarters in forests, deep in forests, but in my area the actions requested from us were such that they were in the different region of the region we operated.</span> <span id="s895">So quite often, you know, after one action, you had to almost the same night jump some 30 miles away somewhere else.</span> <span id="s896">So to do things like that, you had to have friendly villagers.</span> <span id="s897">And most of them were friendly.</span> <span id="s898">A few villages were burned because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: By your people?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: No, by Germans, because somebody said hey, maybe that's where they -- the partisans, as you call it.</span> <span id="s901">The Germans came in, get confirmation from somebody on that from somebody in the village and this entire village was wiped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Did your people have to resort to violent tactics to get food ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s904">Now, we, of course, had other sources besides being fed my villagers.</span> <span id="s905">Some of our actions were not of purely military nature, they were of kind of commercial industrial nature.</span> <span id="s906">Like taking, you know, thousands of liters of vodka or a hundred tons of sugar or the wagon of socks we took in Warsaw railroad station.</span> <span id="s907">And that was a very interesting one because it was in the middle of the German Army almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">On one rail, there was a military transport standing.</span> <span id="s909">The other rails were occupied by the wagons which had the socks, army socks.</span> <span id="s910">An entire wagon.</span> <span id="s911">And there was a guard there.</span> <span id="s912">We came in and we managed to disarm that guard without harming him at all.</span> <span id="s913">Just took the bullets out of his gun, let him have the gun, and we told him, "You just keep walking the way you were walking before.‚Äù</span> <span id="s914">And we were simply loading and unloading from the wagons into the horse and buggies.</span> <span id="s915">And one wagon after another full of socks went in next to a military train.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Why were socks important?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh, you needed a lot of socks in partisans, in guerrillas.</span> <span id="s918">But you could also sell socks.</span> <span id="s919">When you sold them, you had money for food.</span> <span id="s920">We also had parachute drops from England and from Italy, because at that time allies were already in Italy.</span> <span id="s921">As a matter of fact, Warsaw during the uprising for some 40 days didn't get any assistance from anybody.</span> <span id="s922">When Warsaw was already failing -- the insurrection was failing, we got some supplies from Italy.</span> <span id="s923">The U.S. Air Force flew one sortie of supplies.</span> <span id="s924">And we, as a matter of fact, had American flyers whom we could identify decorated 50 years after Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Were there women fighting with you in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s927">Women were mostly -- although they were not the fighting unit, but they were in the Red Cross Corps but with the partisans, with the guerrillas.</span> <span id="s928">They were in communications.</span> <span id="s929">All kinds of axillary situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: And you mentioned one man, but -- and there were also Jews with you in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Not many, but there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: They had their own organizations as well, didn't they?</span> <span id="s933">A: That, I never come across anyone like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Now, the question about when you were in the underground, that you had a conventional job and you were back in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Were you in the factory where they had brought Jewish slave labor?</span> <span id="s937">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s940">Jews in Minsk at that time was -- they were ghetto and the craftsmen were in the Copernicus School.</span> <span id="s941">In that factory, it was maintaining the German cars coming from the eastern front, and that was a hell of a good supply for us of arms.</span> <span id="s942">Because behind the back seats, when you looked carefully there you found all kinds of treasures.</span> <span id="s943">The driver might have been dead.</span> <span id="s944">He might have forgotten what he put out there.</span> <span id="s945">But they had a lot of French slave labor there, and they were left leaning, Communist leaning.</span> <span id="s946">But we talked with them, and they were tipping us off to some things, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Was there sabotage in that factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: There wasn't much to sabotage out there because those were maintenance of cars, and what can you sabotage there?</span> <span id="s949">There were other more important things to sabotage and they all were.</span> <span id="s950">I took part, for instance, in burning the supply depots, and in that we almost had a disaster.</span> <span id="s951">Because the engineer set up the carnotite bombs to fire at two hours, and somebody switched it to 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s952">And as I was cutting the barbed wire to get -- to enter into the supply depot, I see sparks coming out of the pocket, side pocket of a man next to me.</span> <span id="s953">And he managed to take that off and throw out, but got burned on his face, all over his body.</span> <span id="s954">And carnotite is a terrific, 3,000 Fahrenheit temperature.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: We need to change the tape.</span> <span id="s956">You were getting into specifics about what was involved in your close call, the sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Well, for instance, this particular one I was describing, the incident with a carnotite bomb.</span> <span id="s958">We were supposed to put it on the roofs of barracks where they were storing a lot of things, military supplies to go into the eastern front.</span> <span id="s959">Because of this carnotite incident, the action didn't work the way it was supposed to and we had to run.</span> <span id="s960">We had to run under fire because next to it was again German and Continental Guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">But not knowing what the problem with that thing is, I took my carnotite and since there was almost a mountain of the insulating material, like shavings from the wood, I took that and threw it in that direction.</span> <span id="s962">Threw it in that direction and got rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Can we stop for a moment?</span> <span id="s964">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: So as we withdrawing from that action after about three, four kilometers, I suddenly see a red light in the direction or Minsk.</span> <span id="s966">But apparently the carnotite I threw ignited some of the shavings from that wood and started burning that big mountain which till morning.</span> <span id="s967">They had hay there, they had everything.</span> <span id="s968">So part of it was accomplished, but the barracks somehow survived.</span> <span id="s969">Also, on the same night, and we had to walk like -- and here I had a half-burned man with me, taking him -- we suddenly are stopped in a village to which I was going.</span> <span id="s970">The village of Yakutsk.</span> <span id="s971">In a parabook military fashion stopping of someone at night, the military has certain commands and a certain way they do.</span> <span id="s972">So here is a man in a perfect military gives me "Stui, (ph)" which means stop.</span> <span id="s973">Then come closer to give the password.</span> <span id="s974">Again, we are coming closer.</span> <span id="s975">Then he's asking for passport.</span> <span id="s976">I don't have this passport.</span> <span id="s977">I say I don't who he is.</span> <span id="s978">I say, "We don't have your password, but report it to your commanding officer.</span> <span id="s979">This is Cabot Officer Grum," which is my code name, "and I would like a word with him.‚Äù</span> <span id="s980">Then he orders us to lay down and spread, eagle spread.</span> <span id="s981">We lay down eagle spread.</span> <span id="s982">I took a gun and kind of keep it, not zeroed on him, but close so I can.</span> <span id="s983">And finally he managed to call his superior, they came in and it happened that that village was having the night exercises with a password, military.</span> <span id="s984">AK was training, preparing themselves.</span> <span id="s985">So we stayed in a barn that night.</span> <span id="s986">In the morning when I woke up, I was absolutely red.</span> <span id="s987">Trousers, skin, face.</span> <span id="s988">I look at my comrade, he is red absolutely from that carnotite, too, and burned.</span> <span id="s989">So they get a doctor for him out there, and I kept moving to another location.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: What do you consider some of your biggest accomplishments as a fighter with the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Well, I don't -- I can't really tell you.</span> <span id="s992">The ones I would have been proud of were the failures really.</span> <span id="s993">Like we had in the Minsk-Suwatki, we had arrests of AK were 87 people who were arrested.</span> <span id="s994">They were all tortured in Warsaw by gestapo.</span> <span id="s995">Before they were moved to Warsaw, we attacked the place where they held them.</span> <span id="s996">We attacked them in such a way that it was not a surprise for them; they were prepared.</span> <span id="s997">And we just couldn't break to the inside.</span> <span id="s998">We lost a friend of mine right there, but did not accomplish what we went after.</span> <span id="s999">In my opinion the element of surprise was missing.</span> <span id="s1000">What's my biggest accomplishment?</span> <span id="s1001">I think it's a failure, I didn't get what I was fighting for.</span> <span id="s1002">I was fighting for free Poland, for justice, didn't get that.</span> <span id="s1003">I left the war really with the feeling of disgust.</span> <span id="s1004">Looking at the Western politicians, at what happened in Yalta, Tehran.</span> <span id="s1005">How can three persons like Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin on a piece of paper -- piece of newspaper actually, divide the spheres of their influence and divide Europe?</span> <span id="s1006">We had to live with this Berlin Wall ever since.</span> <span id="s1007">I did get some satisfaction for revenging my father because as a 16-year-old boy, I swore that I'll pay them hundredfold, and I think I did.</span> <span id="s1008">But the main objective to free Poland, I didn't get that.</span> <span id="s1009">Poland today among what you see happening out there, in my opinion is not free yet.</span> <span id="s1010">All the oppressors who kept us in prison after Russians took over Poland are still walking the streets.</span> <span id="s1011">They are still occupying positions of power.</span> <span id="s1012">It's only on the surface that they're turning into democracy.</span> <span id="s1013">It's not a democracy yet.</span> <span id="s1014">What would turn them into true democracy really quick is the admission to NATO.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: As an underground fighter, as an effective underground fighter, are there certain personal traits that are important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1017">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1018">Reliance on somebody.</span> <span id="s1019">You have to be absolutely sure that you can rely on whoever is on your left or whoever is on your right, and we had boys like that.</span> <span id="s1020">There was nobody you wouldn't go into a battle with, in my unit anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Courage, how does courage come in?</span> <span id="s1022">Courage, whoever says I'm not afraid is either lying or stupid.</span> <span id="s1023">Going to any action, I was afraid, but somehow I overcame that and came out okay from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Was there something in your background, the way you were brought up, the way you were educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1026">If you look at Poland, for 150 years Poland was nonexistent.</span> <span id="s1027">Was divided between Russia, Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s1028">I am from the first generation born in free Poland.</span> <span id="s1029">Poland became free in 1918.</span> <span id="s1030">I was born in 1923.</span> <span id="s1031">So I was brought in in schools where the patriotism and the country and the flag and the God, too, were the guiding lights, more or less.</span> <span id="s1032">My father was a guerilla man in 1917 and '18, where that part of Poland that Germany thought was theirs said no, it's Polish.</span> <span id="s1033">So there was an uprising, he was in this uprising.</span> <span id="s1034">Then I was raised in the military compound.</span> <span id="s1035">That had something to do probably with some of my behavior.</span> <span id="s1036">Another thing which I think is of extreme importance, if you give a word to somebody, you have to live up to that word.</span> <span id="s1037">Without that, nothing will work.</span> <span id="s1038">If you say you're going to do this, do this no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Is that something you learned from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: That's something I learned from not only family, but also from Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s1041">Boy Scouts was a good training for me, and I was physically very good.</span> <span id="s1042">As a matter of fact, in 1939 I was in a pre-Olympic camp for Polish athletes who were promising for 1940 Olympic Games.</span> <span id="s1043">I had a coach who was European champion at that time and spent like six weeks of camp with him.</span> <span id="s1044">I played basketball for the University of London.</span> <span id="s1045">Played basketball for the Polish Athletic Union.</span> <span id="s1046">I played soccer on almost semi-pro.</span> <span id="s1047">So I was always physically able, and usually in the able body there is an able mind, too.</span> <span id="s1048">Till a couple of years ago, boy, I was climbing mountains.</span> <span id="s1049">I was doing almost everything.</span> <span id="s1050">Today, boom, hit me.</span> <span id="s1051">And that's the irony of it.</span> <span id="s1052">I was supposed be dead so many times in the war, I came out of it.</span> <span id="s1053">And here everything hits me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Was there an excitement in your mission?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: In those day, yes.</span> <span id="s1056">Oh, I was eager, I did more stuff than what my region demanded.</span> <span id="s1057">I was on the, as we called, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1058">I went for -- somebody else was doing something, but I knew somebody in that unit, and I was kind of drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Usually it amounted to oh, protecting them, approaches or as they were doing their job inside.</span> <span id="s1060">One example and that gives you the utmost fear in Warsaw you had in those days, the unit in Warsaw was liberating prisoners from the hospital, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">, which is a big hospital in Poland.</span> <span id="s1062">And I had a friend in that unit, and he pulled me into it, and I got a pre-war machine gun, air-cooled Browning.</span> <span id="s1063">Took it out.</span> <span id="s1064">It's too big to cover, so the passersby could see it.</span> <span id="s1065">Here is a town occupied by Germans.</span> <span id="s1066">Only a kid 20 years old and stupid can do something like that, and that's what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1067">I placed myself on the ruins of a house from 1939, I am looking at the walls of ghetto.</span> <span id="s1068">It was next door to ghetto, also ghetto.</span> <span id="s1069">And my assignment was don't let any German car or truck or anything past your position.</span> <span id="s1070">Just wipe them out.</span> <span id="s1071">That's my only thing in this very assignment.</span> <span id="s1072">Here I am laying on it.</span> <span id="s1073">At first people are passing by.</span> <span id="s1074">After five minutes, then nobody passing by anymore.</span> <span id="s1075">In Warsaw mouth by mouth, Warsaw people talking to each other say, "Hey, something is going on here.</span> <span id="s1076">We better clear out.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1077">And that's precisely what was happening.</span> <span id="s1078">I was praying there for a car to come in, and the damned thing didn't come.</span> <span id="s1079">That's how young people reacted in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Any commanders that you had contact with who were well-known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Most of them are dead.</span> <span id="s1082">Most of them are dead.</span> <span id="s1083">Of course, my commanding officer from the Commander Battalion from Italy is living in Chicago ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Not so much living, but I mean did you have contact with -- or a knowledge of any of these people that ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Oh, well, I was in -- although on the level I was in, I was not in the high echelon.</span> <span id="s1086">I was -- although second in command of a partisan unit, but that confines you to less than a hundred people.</span> <span id="s1087">The people I was touch with was in prison, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Colonel Chaska (ph), his code name, was in the same cell with me, and he was liberated with me.</span> <span id="s1089">His name is Krefski.</span> <span id="s1090">And when I visited Poland a few years ago, I reported to him.</span> <span id="s1091">He was already in his '80s.</span> <span id="s1092">He nearly had a heart attack when he saw me and we started talking.</span> <span id="s1093">This man is one of the first Polish paratroopers dropped in Poland, and he was commander of the region Polisa, which is the southeastern part.</span> <span id="s1094">That's where a lot of Jewish lived.</span> <span id="s1095">A lot of Ukrainians, too.</span> <span id="s1096">And Chaska was given a nomination to the rank of general by General Yurazowski (ph), the one who ran the Communist Poland.</span> <span id="s1097">He sent him back that nomination and told him to stop it.</span> <span id="s1098">From you, I don't want that, which is what any one of us would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: How did you decide to immigrate, to leave your ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Well, frankly I had -- before I started studying in England, I had a notion, I don't like England.</span> <span id="s1101">I cannot return to Poland.</span> <span id="s1102">I have to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s1103">And I had some distant relatives in Michigan.</span> <span id="s1104">I started corresponding with them.</span> <span id="s1105">They said, "Well, why don't you come to the United States?"</span> <span id="s1106">Well, I filed for immigration visa in oh, '37 when we moved to England, moved to the United States and promptly forgot about it.</span> <span id="s1107">In the meantime, I decided, hey, enough soldiering.</span> <span id="s1108">You better get yourself a job of some kind because we were going to stay in uniform, in the foreign uniform forever.</span> <span id="s1109">So I decided that United States will probably be a place for me, but in the meantime - - and promptly forgot about it, that I ever even applied for that visa.</span> <span id="s1110">In the meantime, I got into -- mobilized after leaving British Army because in between we Poles had an option to join British Army, which I did.</span> <span id="s1111">Got a second lieutenant rank in the British Army.</span> <span id="s1112">And then decided no, enough is enough and went into London University to study, to study engineering.</span> <span id="s1113">I always wanted to be in diplomatic service, but I have no country anymore.</span> <span id="s1114">So the next best thing was engineering, and went through London University for a couple of years, halfway through.</span> <span id="s1115">Just about that time, I met my present wife.</span> <span id="s1116">She came into England -- well, it was Olympic Games 1948.</span> <span id="s1117">That's when we met, during that period.</span> <span id="s1118">I proposed to her in Madame Trousseau Museum, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1119">And we got married -- well, actually I said, "Honey, I will go the United States.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1120">Because in late 1950 I got my visa, and I said, "Honey, I think I better to the United States rather than finishing my studies here, because is too slow of a country for me.</span> <span id="s1121">I want to go where there is some action and there are opportunities, challenges to meet and so on.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1122">And I said, "I settle out there and then I bring you in, and we'll get married.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1123">And she said, "The hell you are.</span> <span id="s1124">I'm going with you.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1125">So we got married in September 30th, 1950.</span> <span id="s1126">In February on Queen Elizabeth we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1127">We Statue of Liberty after four or five days on the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s1128">It was so rough that some days in the dining room, there was nobody there but captain and me.</span> <span id="s1129">It didn't bother me, but all the people were so sick.</span> <span id="s1130">And that was it, that's how I landed in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: What were your first impressions over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: I was just about ready to go back to England.</span> <span id="s1133">The little money I had was really going, and we were staying in a motel.</span> <span id="s1134">Then I had an incident I'm lost on the street and asked a man can he tell me where such-and-such motel is, because I'm lost.</span> <span id="s1135">He sized me up from bottom to the top, and said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s1136">Give me a dollar, I tell you.‚Äù</span> <span id="s1137">That was what made a Christian out of me really.</span> <span id="s1138">It told me hey, you better learning a little bit more how, what makes it tick here.</span> <span id="s1139">And that's where I started, realized that one has to use elbows.</span> <span id="s1140">If you just sit and wait for something to drop into your lap, you never get it.</span> <span id="s1141">You have to work for it, work hard.</span> <span id="s1142">And if you do that, there's no other place on earth where you can do it but United States.</span> <span id="s1143">This is the land of opportunity.</span> <span id="s1144">I would not bring my brothers here because they are older, and without language it's tough.</span> <span id="s1145">I was still fairly young, I was 27, I think.</span> <span id="s1146">But for a young person with initiative, with drive, this is the place to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: You had a family and got your engineering degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1149">As a matter of fact, I put aside enough money working in the factory to put me through a semester, and I got admitted to Michigan State University in Lansing, East Lansing.</span> <span id="s1150">Got my bachelor's degree there, and they offered me assistantship where I was practically teaching even, and I was working on my master's degree also in engineering.</span> <span id="s1151">During that time, Claudine was pregnant with her first child.</span> <span id="s1152">And as a matter of fact, it was a race between baby showing up or her finishing my thesis, typing my thesis.</span> <span id="s1153">Well, she finished the thesis before the baby came in.</span> <span id="s1154">We decided to move out of Michigan.</span> <span id="s1155">The climate wasn't what I liked.</span> <span id="s1156">And besides, I had an offer on the West Coast.</span> <span id="s1157">Being one of the top students, the companies were fighting for me somehow.</span> <span id="s1158">Which I wasn't used to, because in England I barely, barely, barely was writing a C grade.</span> <span id="s1159">Here I was A, Bs.</span> <span id="s1160">So Kellogg's out of New York and Fleur out of West Coast and Chesapeake and Ohio out of Richmond, Virginia -- those three outfits interviewed me, invited me to spend some time with them.</span> <span id="s1161">I decided on Fleur because I thought it was close to skiing.</span> <span id="s1162">I never imagined that I would be skiing somewhere else, rather than in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Let me just ask you a quick question.</span> <span id="s1164">Well, your answer doesn't have to be quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">These were pretty -- and I think we only have three minutes on this tape, but traumatic -- there was a pretty traumatic disruption of a normal life.</span> <span id="s1166">Did it have a certain long-term impact on you, on the way you think, your values when you raised your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Oh, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1168">No question about it.</span> <span id="s1169">I tried and incur the same values in my children.</span> <span id="s1170">They are the most wonderful kids you could have.</span> <span id="s1171">We never had any problems with them.</span> <span id="s1172">Stayed away from drugs.</span> <span id="s1173">Stayed away from wild things.</span> <span id="s1174">Each one has a profession.</span> <span id="s1175">Happily married for many years each already.</span> <span id="s1176">No problems at all.</span> <span id="s1177">And when I became sick, they flew in immediately here.</span> <span id="s1178">They wouldn't leave for a second.</span> <span id="s1179">I was the number one for them.</span> <span id="s1180">When I get letters from them on Father's Day or Valentine's, I close the door because I have to cry.</span> <span id="s1181">They are so loving and so thankful for the way they were brought in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: I wish I could put my finger on that.</span> <span id="s1184">First of all, you concentrate on a family unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Family is the number one.</span> <span id="s1186">Job, other stuff has to come secondary.</span> <span id="s1187">So for the kids, we always had time.</span> <span id="s1188">How many times did I have to load the horses on Saturday and go to a show?</span> <span id="s1189">You had to get up almost at midnight to do that and drive some 30 miles to be in a show, horse show.</span> <span id="s1190">How many times can you go through the experience of teaching your kids how to drive?</span> <span id="s1191">My second one reminds me still of how I got her on the freeway when she was barely starting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: We just have like a half a minute left.</span> <span id="s1193">Is there anything else that you want to ... A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1194">But I wish, I wish strongly from the bottom of my heart that something happens to bring the Jewish and Polish people back together a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1195">Poland, for centuries, had Jews.</span> <span id="s1196">For centuries, there was a harmony, and somehow in the last periods with this problems developing by Auschwitz or problems I guess under Communist rule in Radom there was, I don't understand how those things can happen.</span> <span id="s1197">And we have a lot in common.</span> <span id="s1198">We have a lot in common, because Jewish people were without the country.</span> <span id="s1199">They know what it is not be free, so do we.</span> <span id="s1200">So I think -- one day I hope it might happen that we work hand in hand on everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1202">Conclusion of interview</span></p></body></html>
