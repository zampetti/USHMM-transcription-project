id="s11">01:00:15</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Question: Why don't you tell me your full name and your name when you were born, and when and where you were born and then a little about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My name is Lisa Nussbaum Derman.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Raczki Poland in 1926.</span> <span id="s15">I was one of three children.</span> <span id="s16">I had an older sister Pola and a baby brother Busiek.</span> <span id="s17">My parents Herschel and Gittel Nussbaum and an Aunt Sarah that lived with us.</span> <span id="s18">I lived in a very small town.</span> <span id="s19">We were approximately five kilometers from the German border in East Russia, Ostpreussen.</span> <span id="s20">And this is where I grew up until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s21">It was a town with not that many Jewish families, 50 Jewish families, surrounded maybe by a 1,000 or 1,500 Christians.</span> <span id="s22">I grew up in a loving home, a beautiful Jewish home that instilled in all three of us children wonderful values that really kept me through the years and through this entire traumatic experience.</span> <span id="s23">I went to public school as a child, and then I also went to a Hebrew school, and when there were not enough Jewish children for a school, my parents had a private tutor in the house, a Hebrew tutor for myself and my little brother.</span> <span id="s24">My father was an exporter.</span> <span id="s25">He exported geese and lumber to Germany and he was sort of involved within the German world, so to say.</span> <span id="s26">When Hitler came to power, my father's business at Raczki came to a stop.</span> <span id="s27">He was not allowed to trade any more, and conditions had changed.</span> <span id="s28">We lived very close to the border and we knew really, what went on in Nazi Germany by this time.</span> <span id="s29">However, we were not so much yet affected by it.</span> <span id="s30">The town I grew up in was antisemitic.</span> <span id="s31">We suffered from Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s32">Even though, I have to really tell, that my parents were sort of a very special family in this town.</span> <span id="s33">My mother especially was giving of herself to absolutely everybody, Christians especially.</span> <span id="s34">They would come to her to write letters to America because not that many people were educated and literate in the town.</span> <span id="s35">And by the very same token they suffered from Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s36">When my father's business came to – abruptly to an end, my mother too had a business.</span> <span id="s37">My mother had a fabric store, a large fabric store and there were sermons in church given very often to say not to buy from Jews, and especially even mentioned my mother's name – my mother's name was Gittel but in Polish they call it Gitka (ph) – especially to mention not to buy by Gitka.</span> <span id="s38">Shortly after – right after Kristallnacht there was already an influx of German Jewish refugees that came to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">01:04:04 None of them came to my town because we were too small of a Jewish community to accommodate Jews, but however, we heard from them about all the stories.</span> <span id="s40">Also, I wanted to be very much aware, even though I lived in this tiny little town, there are people in America call there a shtetl of the kind people think maybe from the Fiddler on the Roof.</span> <span id="s41">No, it was not.</span> <span id="s42">It was not because we were quite really advanced in a way.</span> <span id="s43">We had a radio in the house.</span> <span id="s44">We had a telephone in the house and my father in his days when he conducted business traveled very far – traveled to Germany and to other places, and we really knew what went on in the world but very little, because my parents have done at the time to change what was coming?</span> <span id="s45">The war broke out in 1939 and Poland was divided between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, and my town, of course, was directly on the German border.</span> <span id="s46">And immediately the Germans came and occupied the town.</span> <span id="s47">I was not in town when the Germans came to occupy.</span> <span id="s48">My mother sent my little brother and myself to my aunt that was only 15 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s49">I don't really know what was the reasoning and such, and low and behold, when they bombed the town, my little brother and I had the measles and we were in a shelter hiding from the bombs.</span> <span id="s50">And not even – we both had such high fever that we didn't even know what went on.</span> <span id="s51">The town was occupied and simultaneously, the Russians came and the two armies sort of met.</span> <span id="s52">And by rectifying borders my town remained under the Nazi occupation and the rest, 21 kilometers away from my town Augustów was already the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">01:06:08 My parents had the foresight to leave with the Russians, because the Russians encouraged anyone that wanted to leave with them were able to leave.</span> <span id="s54">We left.</span> <span id="s55">We took part of our belongings, not everything but part of our belongings and we moved to Augustów, which was a mining town 21 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s56">On there we were already refugees.</span> <span id="s57">We found accommodations.</span> <span id="s58">I started to go to Russian school so that my sister – my sister already at the time was in gymnasium and much higher grades than I was.</span> <span id="s59">My sister was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s60">And very shortly after – I would not say that I myself as a child suffered much under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s61">My parents provided us with everything that they could.</span> <span id="s62">And now we went to school.</span> <span id="s63">We made new friends, and youth has a way of adjusting very fast.</span> <span id="s64">However, my parents had a much harder time, because my father being a businessman had a handicap under their – the Communist regime.</span> <span id="s65">And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the Russian border.</span> <span id="s66">And we moved away from Augustów and we moved away to Slonim, a town which was Poland after 1939, but then in the division of Poland and the Soviet Union – the Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, ended up under the Russians.</span> <span id="s67">We lived on the outskirts of town, the whole family.</span> <span id="s68">And my aunt that lived with us, Aunt Sarah.</span> <span id="s69">We lived on the outskirts of town in Slonim on the river – on the Shchara, and our neighbors were Christians.</span> <span id="s70">Predominantly, Slonim really was a Jewish town.</span> <span id="s71">It was a magnificent Jewish town because it had so many learning places, so many synagogues, Yeshivot – the famous Yeshiva of Slonim, the rabbis of Slonim, two Jewish high schools.</span> <span id="s72">Really, a place that really did not lack of anything one would want to know or really to enjoy in a cultural way as a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s73">I had friends, Jewish friends and Christian friends, too.</span> <span id="s74">and shortly the war broke out between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and it is there that I really met up with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">01:08:57 We lived on the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s76">The town was not bombed much, and we were not at all affected by the war per se from bombs.</span> <span id="s77">Very shortly after the war broke out on the 21st of June, very shortly after, there were announcements that Jews were not allowed to live in certain quarters, in certain parts of Slonim and we had to move right away.</span> <span id="s78">We moved closer in to the town, and it is there where really the first of 1,500 men were selected and taken on this market place, and 1,200 men were sent to their deaths, very shortly, as soon as the Nazis occupied the town.</span> <span id="s79">It was done by Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s80">I am sure we did not by that time – the name.</span> <span id="s81">We called them the chapones in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s82">Chapen means to grab someone, because they literally came; they grabbed men, regardless.</span> <span id="s83">Whoever looked to them – they’re of a certain age, young sort of – grabbed them and killed them.</span> <span id="s84">My family – my father and my little brother were not affected.</span> <span id="s85">They were hiding in a outhouse outside in the house where we really lived.</span> <span id="s86">But they did not come even to this part of town.</span> <span id="s87">Very shortly there was a law, we had to move again.</span> <span id="s88">It was still before the real ghetto was established.</span> <span id="s89">We moved again and again, we had to vacate the place because that too was a spot – it was really the center of town, quite prestigious, sort of to say, and we had to move again.</span> <span id="s90">And we moved to Podgórna, which was the name of the street.</span> <span id="s91">And it is there where we moved that already the ghetto was, even though a little bit larger yet than what it ended up at the end.</span> <span id="s92">But it was already surrounded by – loose, loosely what they call – they prided themselves – loosely barbed wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">01:11:34 And it is there that I witnessed while we lived, still the whole family intact, that I witnessed a massacre.</span> <span id="s94">The Germans called it an Aktion, an action.</span> <span id="s95">What it means is really slaughter.</span> <span id="s96">And I will tell what happened to me on this day.</span> <span id="s97">My father did not work as an artisan, as men that had skills.</span> <span id="s98">He was a businessman so he only went on slave labor, and he wasn't, quote unquote, "one of these desirable Jews" for a while that did certain, like the shoemakers that sewed their boots or that made their uniforms and such, that for a while yet they need them.</span> <span id="s99">On Thursday a sort of strange army came to town, and because the ghetto was so loose yet and you could see the roads on the outside, trucks have been seen and Germans and soldiers – not only the ones that we knew that are Germans, that are the Einsatzgruppen and the chapones, but also auxiliary forces that served the Nazis.</span> <span id="s100">There came armies in black uniforms with sort of sleeves and with certain insignias on their sleeves that were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s101">There were Latvians that served Nazis – not all, but in great number Estonians some.</span> <span id="s102">And the panic started in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s103">What are all these armies invading coming to do in this town?</span> <span id="s104">And on the very same day on Thursday, some people returned from work and they received a – it was called, the German called it a schein.</span> <span id="s105">It means really, a passport, a tiny little card, an I.D. card that had the person's name and number and the stamp from the Gebietskommissar which would be the equivalent to the governor.</span> <span id="s106">And a panic started.</span> <span id="s107">Only very few very, quote unquote, "desirable people" received it.</span> <span id="s108">The rest of us didn't have it.</span> <span id="s109">My family didn't have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">01:14:14 And my mother, before we went to the ghetto, first spoke to our Christian neighbor, that if there is trouble in the ghetto she wants to send her girls to her.</span> <span id="s111">Would she take her girls if there was trouble?</span> <span id="s112">And the woman said, “Yes, send them to me.”</span> <span id="s113">When Mother had first visualized that there was danger, she really wanted to save her girls.</span> <span id="s114">In a haste we were dressed.</span> <span id="s115">She took us to the barbed wires and, you know, it was loosely yet.</span> <span id="s116">They were not charged with any high voltage electricity and any thing of that sort.</span> <span id="s117">Mother took us to the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s118">It was November 13th of 1941.</span> <span id="s119">I was not quite 15 years old.</span> <span id="s120">My sister and I took off our yellow stars.</span> <span id="s121">Mother lifted the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s122">We snuck out.</span> <span id="s123">There were always guard around the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s124">All of us already had to wear marking.</span> <span id="s125">In Slonim the first marking we wore was a round yellow patch, a round patch in the front of the garment and in the back of the garment, and we took it off naturally.</span> <span id="s126">Mother lifted the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s127">She stood inside in the ghetto of the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s128">We stood on the outside.</span> <span id="s129">I turned my head back, and that was the last time I saw my mother because my mother was killed on this November 14th.</span> <span id="s130">My sister and I – it was already getting dark.</span> <span id="s131">I also want to say that other people tried to sneak out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s132">A lot of people tried to do it and many a times people were shot in the process.</span> <span id="s133">I guess you needed some luck too, sometimes not to be shot while you tried to sneak out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">01:16:25 It was already quite – getting dusk, almost dark.</span> <span id="s135">We walked very confidently.</span> <span id="s136">I knew to keep my head up so nobody would pay attention of two girls walking with their heads down – try to identifying them – that maybe they're Jewish and such, because there was a lot of animosity outside.</span> <span id="s137">We walked.</span> <span id="s138">We came to the woman's house.</span> <span id="s139">Nobody saw us walking in the house.</span> <span id="s140">In fact, we made it a point not to walk into the house with nobody noticing us.</span> <span id="s141">We came.</span> <span id="s142">She let us in and she kept us.</span> <span id="s143">She told us to go in the basement to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s144">We did.</span> <span id="s145">Friday morning on November 14th there was a knock on the door and a neighbor came to tell her that they are killing all the Jews in the ghetto, and the woman became frightened and would not keep us as much we begged her.</span> <span id="s146">We cried.</span> <span id="s147">We just begged her to hide us somewhere – to tell her that she is no danger – that no one saw us come into this house.</span> <span id="s148">And also, a Jewish man had a much harder time surviving because only Jewish men were circumcised in Europe, Christians were not.</span> <span id="s149">So this was right away identification that this is a Jew – was a male – was circumcised.</span> <span id="s150">The woman would not keep us as much as we begged her.</span> <span id="s151">I have to tell you that it was already cold.</span> <span id="s152">It was winter.</span> <span id="s153">There was already some snow on the ground, and she told us to go hide into the woods, which we were really on the outskirts, not far away – not really far away.</span> <span id="s154">We had no alternative.</span> <span id="s155">Nothing.</span> <span id="s156">What could we have done, two young girls?</span> <span id="s157">We went to hide in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">01:18:22 We came into the forest and we stayed for a while.</span> <span id="s159">And all of a sudden there were bullets flying all over – flying over our heads, and we ran deeper into the forest to hide from the bullets.</span> <span id="s160">And as we came in deeper to the forest we came to the scene of the massacre.</span> <span id="s161">It is in this forest that on this Friday, 10,000 Jews were killed in open pits.</span> <span id="s162">Shot.</span> <span id="s163">Of course, we ran from the scene – the blood, the screams.</span> <span id="s164">We ran in opposite direction hoping that we will survive this massacre.</span> <span id="s165">As we were sitting there, both of us frightened, shaking, a ranger came in the forest.</span> <span id="s166">He wanted to know what we were doing in the forest and we told him that we came to collect some wood for the winter.</span> <span id="s167">At first he believed us and he let us stay.</span> <span id="s168">He came from the road.</span> <span id="s169">He had with him – he came with a bicycle from the road – he had a rifle slung on his shoulder and an axe behind his belt.</span> <span id="s170">We were in the forest staying and he walked in deeper.</span> <span id="s171">He heard all this shooting.</span> <span id="s172">He became curious.</span> <span id="s173">He walked in deeper and he saw the scene of the massacre.</span> <span id="s174">And he came with a rage to us – that that we are Jewish – we told him a lie.</span> <span id="s175">“You must be shot like the rest of the Jews.”</span> <span id="s176">Nothing had we done to the man.</span> <span id="s177">Nothing.</span> <span id="s178">He was in no danger.</span> <span id="s179">The viciousness of men.</span> <span id="s180">But he didn't take us to the pits.</span> <span id="s181">He took us to the road.</span> <span id="s182">And as he took us to the road – leading us under the rifle – and told us to meet up with the group of the Jews that were being led to be killed.</span> <span id="s183">The women and children were being walked, walked quietly, holding on to their children – some carrying them.</span> <span id="s184">They were surrounded tightly with guards.</span> <span id="s185">By running out they would be shot immediately.</span> <span id="s186">Men were in trucks with machine guns in the back, and as we walked on the little walker’s path, the ranger behind us, at one point my sister turned her head and she realized that he is a distance from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">01:21:14 We ran from the scene to hide in the opposite side of the forest away from the shooting and the screams.</span> <span id="s188">And all of a sudden as we were sitting there – both of us frightened, hoping that we will live through the day – all of a sudden a ranger came into the forest.</span> <span id="s189">He came from the road.</span> <span id="s190">He carried – he came with a bicycle – holding on to a bicycle, a rifle slung over his shoulder and an axe behind his belt.</span> <span id="s191">He wanted to know what we were doing in the forest and we told him that we came to collect the wood for the winter.</span> <span id="s192">He believed us and he let us stay.</span> <span id="s193">He too, came deeper into the forest and he heard all of the shooting.</span> <span id="s194">And he saw the scene of the massacre.</span> <span id="s195">He came with a tremendous rage – that we are Jewish and away from the pits.</span> <span id="s196">We have to be killed like the rest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s197">The viciousness of man!</span> <span id="s198">Nothing have we done to him.</span> <span id="s199">Why not find the kindness to save two young girls.</span> <span id="s200">He was in no danger of anything.</span> <span id="s201">But he did not take us to the pits where they where they were killing the people.</span> <span id="s202">He took us to the road.</span> <span id="s203">He led us under the rifle to the road where the group of women and the children in a great number were being led to be killed.</span> <span id="s204">They were surrounded by guards tightly.</span> <span id="s205">Women holding on to their children, some carrying them, walking very quietly.</span> <span id="s206">And the men on the trucks and the trucks moving very slowly.</span> <span id="s207">In the back a machine gun attached to the truck.</span> <span id="s208">They couldn't run, they couldn't do anything to change.</span> <span id="s209">Nothing at all could they have done.</span> <span id="s210">We walked on a little walker’s path that was bumpy, a lot of ice, thin ice.</span> <span id="s211">As we are putting our feet – walking, it was hard for even to pull for us to get our shoes out.</span> <span id="s212">And when my sister turned her head back and she noticed that the ranger is a distance from us, she grabbed my hand and she told me, “Run, run in the field and run in a zigzag!”</span> <span id="s213">And the two of us ran wildly in the field in all different directions.</span> <span id="s214">Of course, the ranger in his rage threw the axe in the field.</span> <span id="s215">Then he began to shoot at us.</span> <span id="s216">As he threw the axe in the field it hit the back of my sister's leg.</span> <span id="s217">She had a deep cut.</span> <span id="s218">We had to stop in the field.</span> <span id="s219">We had scarves.</span> <span id="s220">We took off our scarves.</span> <span id="s221">We tied her leg and we ran in the field all the way back to the community that we started from.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">01:24:24 And it is for you to know that no one would let us come into their homes.</span> <span id="s223">No one would let us come into their home.</span> <span id="s224">Desperately, we were walking, hoping that we can find a place to hide, a place to hide.</span> <span id="s225">We were practically on the outskirts of town and there were no more homes left.</span> <span id="s226">All of a sudden, we passed by a house and the gate to the house was open, and there was a barn in the back of the house and the door to the barn was open, and we ran to hide in the barn.</span> <span id="s227">And to the side of the house all of a sudden the door opened, and there was a little window in the door, and a woman opened the door and, of course, we thought she would tell us – turn us away.</span> <span id="s228">And this woman with her hands clasped said to us these words; “You do not have to tell me where you're coming from.</span> <span id="s229">I know.</span> <span id="s230">God brought you to the right house.</span> <span id="s231">I will save you.”</span> <span id="s232">A saintly Christian woman opened up her house, took us in, attended to my sister's wound, gave us food, opened up a sleeping sofa.</span> <span id="s233">They took out the inside of the sofa, put us both in, left enough air for us to breathe and kept us there the day of the massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">01:26:02 I am convinced I am alive today because someone cared.</span> <span id="s235">Someone followed their conscience.</span> <span id="s236">Someone had a heart.</span> <span id="s237">Someone did what a human being is to do to the next one that is in kind of trouble that my sister and I were.</span> <span id="s238">The woman said, ‘God, if it should happen to my girls, please somebody, help them, too.”</span> <span id="s239">And in this house there was a father and two daughters.</span> <span id="s240">They were exactly my sister's and my age, and while we were lying in the sofa, people, the neighbors came and sat on the sofa, telling her, telling the woman that they are going to search the Christian homes and they will punish the Christians that hide Jews, which is true, they did.</span> <span id="s241">They did.</span> <span id="s242">But the woman never vacillated.</span> <span id="s243">The woman never told us to leave or anything.</span> <span id="s244">In fact, she told her neighbor, “This is Nazi propaganda.</span> <span id="s245">Don't fall for it.</span> <span id="s246">It is impossible to search the homes.</span> <span id="s247">Don't fall for it.</span> <span id="s248">It is not true.”</span> <span id="s249">And at no time at all did she tell us to leave, no time at all.</span> <span id="s250">When evening came – was my sister's decision – they took us out of the sofa.</span> <span id="s251">And the neighbors – they closed the doors and made sure nobody comes in.</span> <span id="s252">And it was my sister's decision.</span> <span id="s253">She was naturally the older of the two, the wiser of the two.</span> <span id="s254">She said, “We must leave this house in case they do search.</span> <span id="s255">These people were so good to us.</span> <span id="s256">Why endanger them?”</span> <span id="s257">The father of the house took with him a blanket and a pillow and took us to a bombed out house.</span> <span id="s258">We didn't stay in the bombed out house.</span> <span id="s259">As soon as it got dark –because we were afraid in case somebody would find us.</span> <span id="s260">We were not so sure we would meet up with such good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">01:28:21 These righteous Christians are almost like beacons in this darkness, pointing the fingers at others that could have done something too.</span> <span id="s262">There were so few, not so many.</span> <span id="s263">It is our great fortune that we met up with a saintly woman that never knew us, never got paid for it, did it out of the goodness of her heart.</span> <span id="s264">Following her conscience and would expect others to do it, too.</span> <span id="s265">We came to a farm house.</span> <span id="s266">We knocked on the window.</span> <span id="s267">They let us in.</span> <span id="s268">We told them that we are Jewish, that we want to change our clothes with them.</span> <span id="s269">We'll give them our city clothes and we wanted to change into – let us give them our farmer’s clothes.</span> <span id="s270">They gave us.</span> <span id="s271">They consented.</span> <span id="s272">We told them that we will not endanger them, that we will stay in the barn overnight and early in the morning we will leave.</span> <span id="s273">And they let us stay overnight in the barn.</span> <span id="s274">We stayed overnight in the barn.</span> <span id="s275">Early in the morning before sun, we started out just walking in the woods.</span> <span id="s276">And we knew of a woman, a farm woman that used to come during the Russian occupation to sell butter and chickens and eggs to my mother, and she invited us many times.</span> <span id="s277">She said, before the Nazi occupation, “Why don't you girls sometimes come and visit me?</span> <span id="s278">We have a beautiful lake and it's nice and we want to really show them hospitality.”</span> <span id="s279">Do you know I remembered the woman's village?</span> <span id="s280">And we decided that we would go to this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">01:20:21 However, it was such a distance in the winter so we stayed in the woods.</span> <span id="s282">We lived – we never went to a farm to ask for food because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s283">We never knew what kind of people we would meet up with.</span> <span id="s284">So we lived on the berry that we could find, the mushroom that we could find and we finally made our journey to this woman's house.</span> <span id="s285">She took us in.</span> <span id="s286">She kept us there for several days.</span> <span id="s287">I think two days if I recall, and she kept us hidden; she was very smart.</span> <span id="s288">She kept us hidden and she was a very popular woman, a very popular farm house in town with children.</span> <span id="s289">Evidently, they were wealthy so everybody in the farm, all the young people would gather there.</span> <span id="s290">So she told the young people when they asked her, “Who are these two girls?”</span> <span id="s291">She said, “Oh, I hire two maids to spin and to weave for the winter to make wool.”</span> <span id="s292">So, she kept us there, and we begged her if the farmers go to town to Slonim, to see maybe somebody survive.</span> <span id="s293">Maybe they didn't kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s294">And she made it in such a way – she was very clever, very clever – she made it in such a way that there was no suspicion that she's hiding two Jewish girls or anything.</span> <span id="s295">And she told the farmer, “You know, I used to sell eggs and butter to some Jews.</span> <span id="s296">I wonder if somebody still survived.”</span> <span id="s297">The man came back and he told her, “Yes, but they killed 10,000 Jews” – he heard – “but there are still Jews.”</span> <span id="s298">He saw them returning from a nightshift from work.</span> <span id="s299">My sister and I immediately left the farm house and we walked back on foot, back to the ghetto to see if somebody from the family survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">01:32:22 We never asked for a ride because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s301">We would see farmers and such.</span> <span id="s302">We wouldn't approach them.</span> <span id="s303">We would run into the woods to hide.</span> <span id="s304">You must also realize it was winter.</span> <span id="s305">We couldn't live in the woods.</span> <span id="s306">The elements – nor did have we food, nor did we have enough clothing in sub‑zero weather, in cold.</span> <span id="s307">We made our way back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s308">We came back to Slonim, and on the outskirts we saw a group of Jews returning from work.</span> <span id="s309">We joined them.</span> <span id="s310">We sort of ran into their midst.</span> <span id="s311">We asked them if they knew our family.</span> <span id="s312">Nobody knew my family because we were really refugees already in Slonim.</span> <span id="s313">These were most of the people were natives.</span> <span id="s314">Nobody knew my family.</span> <span id="s315">We walked in with them to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s316">We were not counted.</span> <span id="s317">We just walked in.</span> <span id="s318">They kept us in the middle because we didn't have any stars on us and we came into that room where the six of us lived, and as I opened the door my mother was not there to greet me.</span> <span id="s319">So I knew.</span> <span id="s320">My mother was killed.</span> <span id="s321">My aunt was killed.</span> <span id="s322">My father and my little brother survived.</span> <span id="s323">And talking about courage – I'm a parent now.</span> <span id="s324">I'm a grandparent already.</span> <span id="s325">Imagine my mother taking two girls, sending them into the unknowns so they would live.</span> <span id="s326">Imagine what went through her mind.</span> <span id="s327">My father and my little brother were hiding outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s328">My mother remained.</span> <span id="s329">My aunt was sick and my mother would not leave my aunt.</span> <span id="s330">She stayed with her.</span> <span id="s331">That doesn't mean were she outside of the ghetto my mother would have survived, but at least her chances would be better.</span> <span id="s332">Both of their chances would be better.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">01:34:35 They shrank the ghetto.</span> <span id="s334">They made it smaller and we moved in on the street Operowa.</span> <span id="s335">We moved in.</span> <span id="s336">We had one room.</span> <span id="s337">There were two rooms, a very rundown place, but – however it was a little brick house and it was close to the gate where the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s338">In one room the four of us lived, a tiny little room.</span> <span id="s339">We had a bed, one bed where the three of us, the children slept and Daddy slept on a little bed cot, sort of.</span> <span id="s340">Next door, the other room was a family, a young family, newly married and a brother that lived with them and they were wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s341">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s342">They did not have children of their own.</span> <span id="s343">They shared absolutely everything with us.</span> <span id="s344">The little bit of extra food, the extra hot water to wash.</span> <span id="s345">They sort of thought that maybe, maybe one of us will survive or something.</span> <span id="s346">I don't know.</span> <span id="s347">It wasn't told to us but I somehow had the feeling.</span> <span id="s348">And my father went to a slave labor.</span> <span id="s349">I did not work in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s350">I was too young.</span> <span id="s351">In fact, my little brother would run out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s352">He was blond and really, his Polish was so very good, and he did many, many times run out on the Christian side, come back, would bring some food.</span> <span id="s353">And it is in this ghetto where we first moved in.</span> <span id="s354">In December of 1941 a young man came into the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">01:36:51 Next to our house was a wooden house, larger, with more rooms and naturally more people lived there – crowded, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s356">And there was a young man that I knew that I really knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same school that I did, but he was older.</span> <span id="s357">He was in a higher grade – came in one evening and he brought with him a fellow that was, I thought, so much older than I was, and he introduced me and he was a young man.</span> <span id="s358">He said his name Aron Dereczynski.</span> <span id="s359">They called him Arkie and he kept on coming, and there was a friendship that developed.</span> <span id="s360">He worked in the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s361">Did he have a chance really to have food?</span> <span id="s362">Do I really need to explain and to tell the value of food in the ghetto when there was such hunger?</span> <span id="s363">When a slice of bread meant – when everyone aspired to have enough.</span> <span id="s364">And my sister liked him right away.</span> <span id="s365">My father sort of – since my mother was killed, my aunt was killed, my sister really sort of took the motherly part, even though she wasn't that all – she was so wonderful to us, so caring.</span> <span id="s366">She was a student before the war and I never expected her to come in and to this role, but how beautifully she did it.</span> <span id="s367">How kind and nice she was to us.</span> <span id="s368">She wasn't really that much older than we were.</span> <span id="s369">And as a friendship developed, Aron would come.</span> <span id="s370">You know, there was curfew.</span> <span id="s371">Nowhere could you have gone or do anything.</span> <span id="s372">And meanwhile, terrible things were happening in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">01:39:07 People were being killed.</span> <span id="s374">Not in mass but they would hang somebody for bringing in food.</span> <span id="s375">They would kill somebody.</span> <span id="s376">They found a bottle of milk in his possession, and the ghetto was tense at the killings.</span> <span id="s377">And then – I guess it's a human quality – people would sort of like relax and it was almost like normalcy.</span> <span id="s378">I really don't know why they thought it was normalcy, but the tragedy was a community tragedy.</span> <span id="s379">Everybody was in the same shoes.</span> <span id="s380">There was no family that wasn't touched.</span> <span id="s381">Everybody lost someone and maybe it was at this particular time easier to share the grief because everybody cried.</span> <span id="s382">Everybody was in the same position losing their loved ones.</span> <span id="s383">And I developed a friendship with Aron.</span> <span id="s384">It was more than a friendship, really – more than a friendship.</span> <span id="s385">It was “boy and girl,” even in this abnormal circumstances.</span> <span id="s386">As time went on in the ghetto and it was quasi‑quiet.</span> <span id="s387">The Judenrat had problems all the time with the slave labor.</span> <span id="s388">The Judenrat had problems with the terrible demands always being made on delivery.</span> <span id="s389">Deliver them that much gold and that much silver and the valuables.</span> <span id="s390">Slave labor in great numbers also the Judenrat also was faced.</span> <span id="s391">People did not want to go to work.</span> <span id="s392">They really – I'm talking about Slonim – they try to cope with it as best as they could.</span> <span id="s393">And I – when I think back and I reflect and a lot of really thinking, intellectualizing and such, we always must put the blame on the enemy.</span> <span id="s394">They were forced to do it.</span> <span id="s395">When they did not do it, they were killed for it.</span> <span id="s396">How many of us have the fiber really to say to a stand, to take death instead of doing what you are told to do.</span> <span id="s397">There was no suicides in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s398">People did not have the means.</span> <span id="s399">They did not have the poison to do it with, no guns, but yet there was a tremendous urge to live, to live, that tremendous self‑defense to live.</span> <span id="s400">People did everything that they could at the time, in their power.</span> <span id="s401">Whatever they could was possible for them to do to survive and it was so hard to survive.</span> <span id="s402">It was almost impossible to survive – almost impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">01:42:19 This is why so few people survived.</span> <span id="s404">And again, when a government, an organized government – they have to have power, an army, the money, an unfriendly population that does not want to help for most part except for the righteous, and there were not so many numbers.</span> <span id="s405">They can do it to any people, not only to Jews.</span> <span id="s406">Time went on.</span> <span id="s407">Time went on and meanwhile, there was – people began to think of survival.</span> <span id="s408">The young, some of the young were involved in joining together in the underground.</span> <span id="s409">I was only not part of it.</span> <span id="s410">I was too young.</span> <span id="s411">We were refugees.</span> <span id="s412">I guess an underground you really have to develop strong roots to be able to trust the group as a unit together.</span> <span id="s413">I was too young and we were refugees and my sister was not part of the underground.</span> <span id="s414">Neither did she know anyone that was because also it was so terribly secretive.</span> <span id="s415">How would one know unless you were approached and asked and really become part of this unit?</span> <span id="s416">People in the ghetto began to build hiding places.</span> <span id="s417">They called them malines.</span> <span id="s418">It was probably a Jewish word for a hiding place.</span> <span id="s419">In every ghetto that we lived everybody called it a maline, a hiding place.</span> <span id="s420">Where were these hiding places?</span> <span id="s421">People imagined every possible place that they could build a place where they could hide, where they could hide.</span> <span id="s422">Is it in the yard, in a hovel dug out?</span> <span id="s423">Is it under the floor?</span> <span id="s424">Is it in an attic?</span> <span id="s425">Is it some place in a shack, or is it even in the room concealed with a big credenza or something?</span> <span id="s426">People didn't have already, this.</span> <span id="s427">The furniture was taken away because periodically there were the men from the Gestapo for furniture.</span> <span id="s428">So everything that had any value of any was taken out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s429">But people have these old armoires yet, broken up yet.</span> <span id="s430">So some people built hiding places beneath, concealed it with an armoire or with something of that sort – anything imaginable that people could think.</span> <span id="s431">They did everything humanly possible to find a place to hide, because it sort of taught to the people – the first massacre – were people to hide even under the bed.</span> <span id="s432">When we came in back from the massacre, my sister and I, how much I cried and screamed.</span> <span id="s433">“Why didn't mother hide?</span> <span id="s434">Why didn't mother hide?”</span> <span id="s435">Little did I know that maybe it was impossible for her to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">01:45:55 But I was a child.</span> <span id="s437">I needed my mother.</span> <span id="s438">And time went out.</span> <span id="s439">Everybody in the ghetto had a place to hide.</span> <span id="s440">Everybody in the ghetto had a place to hide.</span> <span id="s441">In fact, between the two homes where we lived, we had a hiding place for 30 people – for everybody there to hide.</span> <span id="s442">It wasn't anything so very intricate.</span> <span id="s443">It was under the floor.</span> <span id="s444">And all of a sudden on a Sunday there were already signs that something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s445">In between when Aron used to come to the house – all the time, you know, he was such a wonderful spirit.</span> <span id="s446">He was so confident and he would tell me things.</span> <span id="s447">That he belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir.</span> <span id="s448">I, in my town, did not belong to a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s449">There were not enough really children for a group – for a Zionist group – but I knew about it.</span> <span id="s450">I read about it and I knew very well, because in the town in Suwalki where my sister went to gymnasium there were Zionists’ organizations.</span> <span id="s451">And my cousins belonged to the Zionists’ groups, so this was not strange to me.</span> <span id="s452">But he always – and he told me that just before the war he was supposed to go to agricultural school in Palestine and it didn't work out for him.</span> <span id="s453">But one day, one day, maybe he still will get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">01:47:48 And I would listen to him and it would give me confidence.</span> <span id="s455">I sort of looked so much forward to his visits – to his visits.</span> <span id="s456">And he always also knew a little bit of news, because in the Verpflegungsamt, out by the Germans where he worked – this was the Wehrmacht, the army, the German army that he worked for in this huge, huge depository of food.</span> <span id="s457">They would sometimes listen to the radio to German radio, so they approximately knew where the Front was.</span> <span id="s458">And then they even had, he said, they even have a clandestine radio, which was to me like something like a fairy tale thing.</span> <span id="s459">And our friendship grew.</span> <span id="s460">Our friendship grew and we really became a boy and a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s461">By this time June rolled around, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden on a Sunday, a strange army rolled around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s462">The ghetto by that time was sealed – was closed with barbed wires.</span> <span id="s463">There was not loose at all – the gate and the people counted.</span> <span id="s464">Always guards around the perimeter of the ghetto, much smaller after the first massacre.</span> <span id="s465">They shrank the ghetto, made it much smaller and the congestion was much more.</span> <span id="s466">And a terrible panic in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s467">What could these people have done?</span> <span id="s468">Very, very little.</span> <span id="s469">Only to hide – keep them there.</span> <span id="s470">There weren't as many Christians that would accept Jews to hide, keep them there.</span> <span id="s471">With an exception, I say again, of the righteous.</span> <span id="s472">The idea was to hide and to try and see maybe we will survive by hiding.</span> <span id="s473">By Sunday night the panic grew and Monday morning, early in the morning, we heard shots.</span> <span id="s474">We lived very close to the gate.</span> <span id="s475">We lived on the Operowa and the gate was on a Operowa and I learned later that it was the head of the Judenrat, Gershon Kwint that came in when this Einsatzgruppen group, and this army of killers came in to the gate to march into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">01:50:49 He asked them, “What are you doing with my people?”</span> <span id="s477">He was shot and this is the shots that we heard because we were close to the gate.</span> <span id="s478">We were already by this time in hiding and the rest of the ghetto was hidden.</span> <span id="s479">The ghetto was hidden and we separated with my sister.</span> <span id="s480">The place for us, all of our neighbor, the two neighboring homes to hide was in the middle – was under the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s481">And my father walked in to see at this place and he said there were children and also he said the children might start to cry, and he felt that he couldn't breathe.</span> <span id="s482">He said, “I don't have enough air there to breathe.</span> <span id="s483">I will not go there.</span> <span id="s484">I'll choke to death.</span> <span id="s485">We will not go.”</span> <span id="s486">My sister ran across the street to find out the house, which was by the name of the Jachwidowicz house across the street from us.</span> <span id="s487">Well, she was never able to return because the massacre – because the Aktion started.</span> <span id="s488">My father, my little brother and I remained in the house and my father, the three of us, tried to hide in the house.</span> <span id="s489">Where were we hidden?</span> <span id="s490">The kitchen had an old‑fashioned oven where before – for baking bread.</span> <span id="s491">To the side it was a deep oven.</span> <span id="s492">To the side was a little opening for three people just to squeeze in where wood was kept in normal times.</span> <span id="s493">In normal times wood was kept.</span> <span id="s494">Of course, we didn't have any wood in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s495">The kitchen was wallpapered and it was really shreds sort of hanging.</span> <span id="s496">When they used to come to take people on slave labor, my father used to hide in this spot.</span> <span id="s497">How did he hide there?</span> <span id="s498">He had a piece of cardboard that he held almost, held from the inside that matched the rest of the wallpaper in the kitchen, torn the same way as the rest to conceal this entrance into this little place next to the oven.</span> <span id="s499">And my father said the three of us run and hide there.</span> <span id="s500">Monday morning when we heard the shooting already in the house, we ran in to hide behind this oven in this little space that was open.</span> <span id="s501">They came in.</span> <span id="s502">The killers came in to the house.</span> <span id="s503">They searched the house.</span> <span id="s504">They knocked on the walls.</span> <span id="s505">They never came to this spot.</span> <span id="s506">“Raus, raus, raus!”</span> <span id="s507">And then we heard cries and we heard shooting and we realized that the people next door were discovered.</span> <span id="s508">We remained in this place, frozen.</span> <span id="s509">There was no place to move.</span> <span id="s510">For one of us to make a turn – all three of us had to move to be able for one of us to make a turn.</span> <span id="s511">My little brother was a child.</span> <span id="s512">It was so hard on him.</span> <span id="s513">It was very hard on all three of us.</span> <span id="s514">We stayed there the day.</span> <span id="s515">We survived the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">01:54:26 At night my father said that we cannot stay there.</span> <span id="s517">It's not safe.</span> <span id="s518">We'll be found there.</span> <span id="s519">We must hide somewhere else.</span> <span id="s520">We did not hide any more in this place.</span> <span id="s521">It was open because we couldn't cover it.</span> <span id="s522">It was all open.</span> <span id="s523">The part that covered this entrance was broken.</span> <span id="s524">So we went in the yard.</span> <span id="s525">There were shacks on the side and as we went out of the house in the shacks, we realized that the ghetto is burning while we stayed in the house.</span> <span id="s526">We didn't know, hidden in the house.</span> <span id="s527">We didn't smell anything.</span> <span id="s528">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s529">All of a sudden we went in, in the yard and we saw that the ghetto is burning.</span> <span id="s530">But we had no alternative, so we went to the last shack.</span> <span id="s531">There were a row of shacks.</span> <span id="s532">The last shack we walked in and we saw that there was a ladder and there was a trapdoor, and we crawled up the ladder and we opened up the trapdoor.</span> <span id="s533">There was a loft that hardly you could squeeze in and we found two old Jewish men, the old Mr. Margolis(ph) and Mr. Fink(ph).</span> <span id="s534">And we asked them, “What, what – where are all the rest of the people?”</span> <span id="s535">They said they did not hide in with the rest of the people, because they knew they couldn't breathe there.</span> <span id="s536">They were coughing and they didn't want to endanger the other people, so they did not hide with the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s537">They were hidden in this shack and we came to this shack.</span> <span id="s538">We walked up and threw the ladder away so it wouldn't be a sign that some people are hiding in the shack there on top in the loft and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s539">We stayed there.</span> <span id="s540">We didn't have any food at all.</span> <span id="s541">Daddy went at night and he brought water.</span> <span id="s542">He found he could not find any bread in the house.</span> <span id="s543">Nothing was in the house.</span> <span id="s544">He brought water so we still had water, and we stayed there Monday night, Tuesday and Wednesday and we watched the fire, the ghetto burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">01:56:58 I do not know how it was possible that this shack did not catch on fire.</span> <span id="s546">I do not know but it didn't.</span> <span id="s547">And we survived in this shack.</span> <span id="s548">And while we were lying in the shack, my father said, “What even if we survive?</span> <span id="s549">All the Jews are killed.</span> <span id="s550">What are we going to do even if we survive?</span> <span id="s551">What am I going to do with my two children?</span> <span id="s552">Where are we going to go?”</span> <span id="s553">But we didn't.</span> <span id="s554">We stayed.</span> <span id="s555">We stayed in the shack hoping for a miracle.</span> <span id="s556">On Thursday afternoon we heard noise in the front and we – all of a sudden we heard steps in the back and somebody calling in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s557">“Lisa, Lisa,” and, “Jews, if anybody's hiding, answer, answer.”</span> <span id="s558">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s559">I could not believe it, that this was possible, and I wiggle my father.</span> <span id="s560">“That sounds like Aron, that sounds like his voice.”</span> <span id="s561">My little brother opened the trap and I answered, I answered.</span> <span id="s562">Aron came into the shack.</span> <span id="s563">My little brother opened the trap and he leaned over and he said, “Yes, the three of us are here.</span> <span id="s564">We survived the fire and we're still here.”</span> <span id="s565">So Aron said that the massacre – they are still purging people but it is already much quieter and it looks like they will leave some people.</span> <span id="s566">They will let some people live, survive.</span> <span id="s567">So all of a sudden a ray of hope sort of came in and then Aron tells me, “Go down.</span> <span id="s568">Climb down from the loft, from the shack.”</span> <span id="s569">I jumped down.</span> <span id="s570">He took me—</span></p> <p><span id="s571">01:59:35 End of Tape Number One.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Tape Number Two</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Why don't we start with hearing the voices calling in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: As we were sitting there, it was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s575">In fact, I'm sure it was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s576">All of a sudden we heard footsteps.</span> <span id="s577">Of course, we froze.</span> <span id="s578">We thought that it's Germans again coming to find us.</span> <span id="s579">All of a sudden there were voices in Yiddish – in Jewish and I heard, “Lisa, Lisa.”</span> <span id="s580">At first I couldn't believe it and then I also heard in Yiddish saying “Jews, Yidden, Jews!</span> <span id="s581">If anybody is hiding, please answer, please answer.”</span> <span id="s582">And I nudged my little brother and I said, “Daddy,” I said, “it sounds like Aron.</span> <span id="s583">Could it be?”</span> <span id="s584">And I answered and as I answered, Aron walked into the shack.</span> <span id="s585">My little brother opened up the latch and, of course, can you imagine the kind of feeling that went through me?</span> <span id="s586">My wildest dream would I ever imagine that I am ever going to see Aron again?</span> <span id="s587">And here he came really to the rescue like.</span> <span id="s588">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s589">By this time we were sitting there already three or four days without food, only with water, being so cramped in that there was no room to turn.</span> <span id="s590">And it was a very hard on my little brother.</span> <span id="s591">He was so restless and every time he had to move all of us had to turn.</span> <span id="s592">I jumped down.</span> <span id="s593">Aron took me to the house, to the empty house.</span> <span id="s594">Of course, all the houses were empty.</span> <span id="s595">The people were gone already by this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">02:03:22 He took me upstairs to an attic and he looked around for a while.</span> <span id="s597">He looked for some clothes and he came in and he brought with him a boy's jacket and a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s598">Women in Europe at the time, this particular time, never wore pants, and he found a scissor and he stood there.</span> <span id="s599">And I was in shock, in complete shock and he said to me that he's going to dress me like a boy because women are not allowed to live.</span> <span id="s600">He found the scissor and he cut my hair completely.</span> <span id="s601">He left a little stubs on my head and I did everything that he told me to do.</span> <span id="s602">He put on a cap on me and as I walked down, there was a mirror and I took a look.</span> <span id="s603">I took off the cap and I took a look at myself.</span> <span id="s604">I was frightened to see what I look like without – shaven, not shaven but practically shaven – without hair.</span> <span id="s605">But I followed him and I walked out.</span> <span id="s606">We came to the street and four Jewish men were waiting there.</span> <span id="s607">They were the men that Aron worked with and already he had enough time to tell me that he has kept Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt that he works for, asked him to come into the ghetto and to find some valuables – I don’t know – riches, riches to enrich himself on this tragedy.</span> <span id="s608">And he said – Aron said, “It was my idea because I wanted to come to the ghetto to see if I can still find someone alive.</span> <span id="s609">And maybe he has had an opportunity to take you out with me.”</span> <span id="s610">He told me that his mother and his three sisters are alive, that he left them in the hiding place because he says he could not take four people out.</span> <span id="s611">And he says, “I could not even decide; who would I take out of the four?”</span> <span id="s612">They put in – they were carrying, – all the men had on them it looked like chandeliers, really nothing fancy to speak about.</span> <span id="s613">Maybe it was old something with some wires.</span> <span id="s614">They took off – one man gave me a chandelier sort of – I don't know, you call it a chandelier – something that resembles a chandelier, and he put it over my shoulder and he put some wires around my neck, and we walked out.</span> <span id="s615">All of us walked out.</span> <span id="s616">We came to the gate and the guard was at the gate and Aron very confidently – all of us carried something.</span> <span id="s617">Some of the men carried something in pillowcases.</span> <span id="s618">I didn't even know what they carried there.</span> <span id="s619">I learned later that all of it was for Miller, and all of us walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">02:06:44 Aron waved confidently his slip of paper that Miller gave him to come into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s621">They came in into the ghetto with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht, regular soldiers that worked in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them.</span> <span id="s622">Across the way from the ghetto directly across was the house where the men that the German Wehrmacht that ran this Verpflegungsamt lived there.</span> <span id="s623">It was Captain Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt and Bauer also a captain and one more, a German, and two regular German men.</span> <span id="s624">So I was absolutely numb.</span> <span id="s625">I didn't really know except to follow and to do what I was told to do.</span> <span id="s626">Aron took me into the German's house.</span> <span id="s627">I could not believe why he would do it, but he didn't take me to the upstairs.</span> <span id="s628">He took me to the basement.</span> <span id="s629">He left me in the basement within a pile of old furniture that was lying there and I hid behind the furniture.</span> <span id="s630">All of a sudden a young Jewish boy came down and he searched for me.</span> <span id="s631">And he said to me, “Don't be frightened, don't worry.</span> <span id="s632">I will help you.</span> <span id="s633">I will do everything that needs to be done for you,” he said.</span> <span id="s634">And the first thing what he did is he brought me food.</span> <span id="s635">He brought me food.</span> <span id="s636">And when I looked at him, he was a child.</span> <span id="s637">He looked to me like he was not older than 12 or 13 years old.</span> <span id="s638">And he said, “Don't worry, I'll take care of you.”</span> <span id="s639">And he did.</span> <span id="s640">He did everything what he could.</span> <span id="s641">He said to me, “There are maids working here, but I will not let them go in the basement.</span> <span id="s642">Everything that they need, I will run and get it so that they won't come down in the basement to find you.”</span> <span id="s643">And he did.</span> <span id="s644">But all of a sudden as I was sitting there hidden, Bauer walked in.</span> <span id="s645">I didn't know anything about Bauer.</span> <span id="s646">Can you imagine how frightened I was?</span> <span id="s647">Here was a German came in and he found me.</span> <span id="s648">I was sure he was going to shoot me right there on the spot, but behind him was Aron.</span> <span id="s649">And Bauer tells me, “Stand up.”</span> <span id="s650">And I stood up.</span> <span id="s651">I stood up and he said, “Do you have girl’s clothes?”</span> <span id="s652">And I said “Yes, underneath I have girl’s clothes.”</span> <span id="s653">Because I still had the clothes that I went into hiding.</span> <span id="s654">And he said – then the little boy ran down, the Jewish boy, and he brought me a babushka.</span> <span id="s655">He said, “Take off your Boise’s clothes.</span> <span id="s656">Put on this babushka and come with me.</span> <span id="s657">I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt.”</span> <span id="s658">And he walked – we walked out.</span> <span id="s659">I learned later that Aron asked Miller – he said, “I'm hiding – I brought here my sister.</span> <span id="s660">Please do something for her to save her.”</span> <span id="s661">And Miller pounded on the table saying, “My place is no place to hide Jews.</span> <span id="s662">Take her out of here immediately.”</span> <span id="s663">So then Aron approached Bauer, evidently while the ghetto was burning, and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting and the killing…he was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset.</span> <span id="s664">And he said, “How could I believe it that my people can do something like this?”</span> <span id="s665">And so Aron approached Bauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">02:10:31 He had no alternative.</span> <span id="s667">He had to take me out of this German house.</span> <span id="s668">He approached Bauer and Bauer walked with me.</span> <span id="s669">Do you know the house where they lived was across the street from the school, the high school that I went to before the invasion?</span> <span id="s670">It was recess and the children were walking out of school during recess and I thought to myself, “Why am I so cursed?</span> <span id="s671">My parents were such good people.</span> <span id="s672">I am equal to all of these children.</span> <span id="s673">Why is it done to me?</span> <span id="s674">What have I done?</span> <span id="s675">Then this befell me.</span> <span id="s676">What have I done?</span> <span id="s677">They are free and here I am being taken to the unknown, maybe to death for nothing that I have done.”</span> <span id="s678">I always thought the Jews were good people.</span> <span id="s679">All the people that I knew were Jewish were good.</span> <span id="s680">I am sure there some maybe that were not so good, but maybe I didn't know them as a child.</span> <span id="s681">I walked with Bauer.</span> <span id="s682">He told me to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s683">I did not have my yellow stars.</span> <span id="s684">I walked with him.</span> <span id="s685">We came to the Verpflegungsamt and there already the man that worked the Verpflegungsamt waited for me to come and to hide me somewhere.</span> <span id="s686">They made a hiding place for me.</span> <span id="s687">The hiding place was; they took out two sacks or three sacks and they covered it.</span> <span id="s688">They found a piece of plywood, put a piece of plywood – put a sack to cover the plywood or two sacks to cover the plywood and marked it because it was a huge warehouse, with hundreds and hundreds of sacks of flour, of corn, of oats, of everything.</span> <span id="s689">It really supplied the entire area around Slonim – that there rations were given out to the Germans, to the Pole, to everybody from this warehouse.</span> <span id="s690">They marked it in such a way so that they would know where I was hidden.</span> <span id="s691">They made just enough space in this little tiny place where they took out the several sacks for me to crawl in and to lie there, and they left enough space of air to come in so I could breathe and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s692">I stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">02:13:06 When night came everybody left, and I remained all by myself in this warehouse, hidden.</span> <span id="s694">And as I said, I remained in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s695">All of a sudden I was being scratched by rats, lying there.</span> <span id="s696">And I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by them, that they will scratch me, eat me practically.</span> <span id="s697">And with all my might that I possessed, I pushed the sacks back and I crawled out of this space.</span> <span id="s698">And all night long I was sitting on top and running away from the rats.</span> <span id="s699">Then when morning came and I knew that they were going to open up the warehouse, I was afraid for them to find me.</span> <span id="s700">Maybe the Germans would come before the Jews would come into this warehouse.</span> <span id="s701">I crawled in again and I was able, not very well, but to cover myself again, pulling that sack to cover as I entered.</span> <span id="s702">It wasn't very well concealed but enough not to notice.</span> <span id="s703">And anyway, if the Germans didn’t know that I was hidden some place where they would go and check thousands of sacks of flour to find me.</span> <span id="s704">The next day they already allowed for people to live.</span> <span id="s705">They allowed for people to live.</span> <span id="s706">The people that still remained hidden were told to go out from the hiding place.</span> <span id="s707">They took them all to the jail, the people, and they started there the selection left and right, who to live and who to die.</span> <span id="s708">To the left and to the right and to the left and to the right.</span> <span id="s709">I was not there but I learned about it from my father and my little brother, because my father and my little brother still remained hidden.</span> <span id="s710">And then they heard that there was a reprieve and you can really go out.</span> <span id="s711">They came out and were told that they were going to be given a Schein, this certificate to live – this I.D. card to live.</span> <span id="s712">But they were taken to the jail first and there they would be given the certificate.</span> <span id="s713">And there they started the selection and somehow, somehow my father was given the card, was sent to the right side to live and my little brother remained on the other side, and he ran and he tried to beg this Nazi, to beg him that he wants to be with his father.</span> <span id="s714">He wants his father and I guess in his, with all of his viciousness and with all of his thoughts of inhumanity, he found really a trace of caring.</span> <span id="s715">He threw my little brother.</span> <span id="s716">He grabbed him and he threw him to my father, and he survived.</span> <span id="s717">He was let out of the jail with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">02:16:40 And I knew about it because one of the men came to the Verpflegungsamt and told me, “I saw your father and I saw your little brother and they were alive, and they survived the selection in the jail and they are alive.”</span> <span id="s719">And here they said that women already can live, too.</span> <span id="s720">Women already can live, too.</span> <span id="s721">I did not stay in the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s722">They put us up in the Beutelager.</span> <span id="s723">It was a really a huge army barracks that were built for the Polish Army way before the war, and there they collected all the surplus of broken up, damaged arms from the war, Russian arms that they collected.</span> <span id="s724">And this is really where the young Jews that were involved in the underground work were able to steal the arms and to smuggle them in piece by piece into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s725">Or in some way, Germans that were – some of them that were bartering with Jews even brought it in under boxes of soap, hidden under soap that was brought in into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s726">Approximately, not more maybe between 800, 900 maybe 1,000 people remained from the entire ghetto, from 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s727">And they left a little small little ghetto, besides the people that lived in the Beutelager.</span> <span id="s728">The Beutelager where were all the young people that still worked in the Beutelager or the Verpflegungsamt, and every day, every morning there was an appell, we had to go out to be counted.</span> <span id="s729">They would come in the middle of the night with lights, have us all come out and to be counted.</span> <span id="s730">The people that lived on the last ghetto, the several homes around the river on the street that's called Mostawa were given an identification, a little tiny piece made out of clay with a number that you had to wear around your neck all the time – all the time besides your round badge.</span> <span id="s731">I stayed at the time in the Beutelager, and my father and my little brother stayed on Mostawa.</span> <span id="s732">I used to go – I too had this badge that I wore and you were allowed to go from the Beutelager to Mostawa.</span> <span id="s733">Already my father was thinking that we must leave this ghetto, we must run away from here.</span> <span id="s734">And my father evidently went out of the ghetto and found a farmer, a woman, a farm woman that he still had some means to pay her with.</span> <span id="s735">I really do not know what he gave this farm woman.</span> <span id="s736">I don't remember what daddy still had but he still had some valuables.</span> <span id="s737">I know because he still had it in Wilno – the ghetto that he managed to hide.</span> <span id="s738">And this woman, we traveled by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s739">We went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s740">We were not caught of course, otherwise I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.</span> <span id="s741">And we were hidden under a big wagon with hay.</span> <span id="s742">We were under the hay until we came out of the outskirts of Slonim.</span> <span id="s743">Then she told us that we can be in the open.</span> <span id="s744">Neither of us looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s745">My little brother was blond with blue eyes.</span> <span id="s746">He was almost a towhead.</span> <span id="s747">I was blond with blue eyes and my father did not look Jewish either.</span> <span id="s748">No, he didn't.</span> <span id="s749">So, she really relaxed and told us we can even be on the open and we came in.</span> <span id="s750">We came into a village to a farm house and we were hidden.</span> <span id="s751">We were hidden, and while we were hidden Partisans came into the village and my little brother begged, “Daddy, let's go with the Partisans.”</span> <span id="s752">But my father said to him, “My child, I am too old.</span> <span id="s753">They won't take me.</span> <span id="s754">They won't take you either.</span> <span id="s755">You are a child and your sister is a girl.</span> <span id="s756">You entertaining an idea that is just a dream.</span> <span id="s757">They won't take us.</span> <span id="s758">We must continue to another ghetto.”</span> <span id="s759">We came to Volkovysk.</span> <span id="s760">We came to the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">02:22:08 We told them that we want to go to Grodno.</span> <span id="s762">The whole idea of Grodno –because Grodno was still annexed to the Third Reich, and the killings in 1942 in the summer of '42 they were unheard of in the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s763">And we somehow heard by way of people coming – I don't know really – Daddy heard that they are not killing people in – the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s764">The Jews are still going to work in the Third Reich and maybe they are not going to kill the people in – the Jews in the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s765">In the beginning Daddy thought so.</span> <span id="s766">Then we finally came to Volkovysk and we got passage and we came to Grodno.</span> <span id="s767">We came to Grodno to a world that already for us did not exist – already since occupation.</span> <span id="s768">Everybody was killed in pits.</span> <span id="s769">And here the ghetto was quasi – sort of free –the first ghetto, the second ghetto – the working ghetto – the ghetto that people did not work.</span> <span id="s770">You were able to walk from one ghetto to another.</span> <span id="s771">In fact, my mother had a cousin that lived in Grodno.</span> <span id="s772">She was in the second ghetto with a husband and wife and two children that my brother and I adored.</span> <span id="s773">And as soon as we came we ran.</span> <span id="s774">We found out that they lived in the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s775">We ran to them to see the family, to tell them about our misfortune, that my mother was killed.</span> <span id="s776">My sister was killed.</span> <span id="s777">I didn't mention really that my sister was killed in the second Aktion.</span> <span id="s778">In June of 1942 they found the place where she was hiding.</span> <span id="s779">They took all the people out and my sister knew what to expect, and she ran to the barbed wires to run out on the Christian side and she was shot on the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s780">I lost my wonderful sister, the one I loved so much.</span> <span id="s781">We shared with them our misfortune, telling them what happened.</span> <span id="s782">And we lived.</span> <span id="s783">We came back to the first ghetto.</span> <span id="s784">We came back to the first ghetto.</span> <span id="s785">I had – my mother had another cousin in this ghetto but they did not have enough food for us.</span> <span id="s786">They lived in – they had one bed for three people; husband, wife and a child.</span> <span id="s787">We were assigned a room.</span> <span id="s788">We came to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s789">We told them that we are survivors of Slonim, that everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s790">They sort of took it, almost, they didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s791">And when my father used to retell it and we retold, they say, “Enough already.</span> <span id="s792">Enough already.”</span> <span id="s793">And you know we were sort of convinced that this would happen here too.</span> <span id="s794">We were convinced and we tried to – Daddy especially, tried to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">02:25:39 To do what he can do with the children to survive but what could he have done?</span> <span id="s796">He was considered an old man.</span> <span id="s797">My father was in his early 50's, not quite 50, I think.</span> <span id="s798">And we were assigned a room in the ghetto with a family.</span> <span id="s799">There were two rooms.</span> <span id="s800">Three families in two rooms.</span> <span id="s801">In one room there lived a family – Lipszyc.</span> <span id="s802">Herschel Lipszyc with his father that was very orthodox, and a cousin of his, that her family was already killed in a small town.</span> <span id="s803">They drove in all the Jews from a small town in a barn and they set the barn on fire.</span> <span id="s804">She was visiting grandparents in another place and she escaped.</span> <span id="s805">So she lived with them.</span> <span id="s806">In the next room lived a family with two children and they assigned us to live in this room.</span> <span id="s807">We had a bed.</span> <span id="s808">That was the extent of the living that we had in this house in Grodno in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s809">And shortly after we came to the ghetto, all of a sudden, one day Aron showed up.</span> <span id="s810">Aron showed up.</span> <span id="s811">I parted with him thinking I will never see him again.</span> <span id="s812">I left with my father and my little brother and he – all of a sudden Aron showed up and he told me – we discussed.</span> <span id="s813">In fact, when we left I told him that my father knows of a farm woman that would take us.</span> <span id="s814">He said that he knows somebody, a neighbor of theirs that he was very, very good friends with told him of a woman that is going to take them and then he'll give me the names so he can come too – run away with his mother and three sisters.</span> <span id="s815">And then he told me in tears that he parted with them in Volkovysk, because he said, “By staying together we only perish together.”</span> <span id="s816">He said, “If I want to have any hopes of survival it is only in the underground – the woods, and if I will stay with my mother and my sisters, all of us will perish.</span> <span id="s817">So I decided to run away to come to Grodno.”</span> <span id="s818">And in Grodno we lived with the Lipszyces, and Herschel Lipszyc was wonderful.</span> <span id="s819">He would sing.</span> <span id="s820">He would bring a little bit of respite and life.</span> <span id="s821">It was not terrible hunger at the time yet.</span> <span id="s822">No, it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">02:28:35 I couldn't believe it, that something like this still existed under Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s824">And Aron went to slave labor with Herschel.</span> <span id="s825">My father did not go to slave labor outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s826">He worked in the ghetto, but my little brother would run out all the time, back and forth.</span> <span id="s827">He really had a tremendous courage and sense of adventure, running out all the time.</span> <span id="s828">And it is in this ghetto while Herschel Lipszyc took Aron on slave labor to remodel a house for the Gestapo that Aron befriended a Pole.</span> <span id="s829">His name was Tadek, they called him, but his real name really was Tadeusz Soroka.</span> <span id="s830">Tadeusz Soroka came very often to barter with them.</span> <span id="s831">He would bring them food and they in turn would take out – they would wear an extra pair of pants and extra jacket on them and trade for food.</span> <span id="s832">He was a good friend of Herschel Lipszyc.</span> <span id="s833">Herschel knew him much longer than Aron.</span> <span id="s834">And all of a sudden, all of a sudden November first rolled around and they sealed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s835">They sealed the ghetto and transports started to resettle it, to resettle people in the East supposedly.</span> <span id="s836">And rumor started in the ghetto where are they resettling the people.</span> <span id="s837">No one at the time thought of gassing people.</span> <span id="s838">No one at the time thought of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek – merely fear of resettlement.</span> <span id="s839">You were told to take a certain amount of clothes, to take your toothbrush, to take all your necessary things that you would need to go and to be resettled.</span> <span id="s840">And you will even get better rations and better food.</span> <span id="s841">People tended to believe it because they thought maybe they'll be better.</span> <span id="s842">By this time already there was more hunger in the ghetto and anyway, the Jewish – the Judenrat was forced to make a list of so many people for resettling.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">02:31:17 And it was a sign of resettling much more so only the ghetto because they start to bring all the Jews from the small towns from around Grodno.</span> <span id="s844">And Grodno had really hundreds of small little towns and villages where Jews lived, surrounded with small towns and little villages where Jews lived.</span> <span id="s845">They took them all in and brought them into a detention camp in Kelbasin and from there the people from Kelbasin were sent first to Auschwitz and to Treblinka and Majdanek, beknown to them where they were going, beknown to them, lists were being made and transports.</span> <span id="s846">They finished with Kelbasin and they started with the ghetto.</span> <span id="s847">Naturally, we were outsiders.</span> <span id="s848">We were not natives and we were always the first people on the lists.</span> <span id="s849">But to our advantage was our past.</span> <span id="s850">By being in Slonim and being in the ghetto and surviving two kinds of massacre and surviving practically – sole survivors in a ghetto of thousands, of close to 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s851">Out of 20,000 people, eight – 900 people survived.</span> <span id="s852">We really realized that we have to do everything that we already learned and the first thing is hiding.</span> <span id="s853">And we started to make places to hide and decided that we would just hide.</span> <span id="s854">We would not come with a suitcase to be taken to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s855">Aron helps people find – build hiding places.</span> <span id="s856">They knew that he came from Slonim and he knows, and the word traveled.</span> <span id="s857">It spread by word of mouth.</span> <span id="s858">So here he knew of a lot of places that he helped to build.</span> <span id="s859">So when we knew that we were on the lists, we began to hide.</span> <span id="s860">And we would come to one place and try to hide and all of a sudden, “No, this is not safe.</span> <span id="s861">No, no, no, we must leave the place right away.</span> <span id="s862">It's not safe.”</span> <span id="s863">We went to another place and we didn't stay – to a third place – I remember one night we changed five places.</span> <span id="s864">It was – we were going crazy from fear not to be caught while running out from one place to the other, four people, the three of us and Aron.</span> <span id="s865">We survived this transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">02:34:06 After we survived this transport again it was sort of quite for a while.</span> <span id="s867">Respite came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s868">And Herschel Lipszyc with a very dear friend – oh, my God, I forgot his name – Lutek.</span> <span id="s869">Lutek were approached by Tadek and he told them that, “You know, you don't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s870">I know of a Polish family or a Lithuanian family in Wilno that will keep you as Christians.</span> <span id="s871">I will take you to Wilno.”</span> <span id="s872">And Herschel consented to go with Tadek and Lutek to Wilno.</span> <span id="s873">What were the alternatives?</span> <span id="s874">Another transport?</span> <span id="s875">If you have a chance you do it and it is for really to know that people tried to do it.</span> <span id="s876">They took every possible chance.</span> <span id="s877">The chances were so few, so few.</span> <span id="s878">You needed the looks.</span> <span id="s879">You had to look Aryan to be able to survive on the Christian side.</span> <span id="s880">You had to meet the right people what would keep you.</span> <span id="s881">You have to think about years, it's not days.</span> <span id="s882">This is why the righteous that saved, that kept Jews, some of them for years, are really people that are an exception in this society.</span> <span id="s883">They're giants.</span> <span id="s884">They are giants.</span> <span id="s885">They are to emulate – a whole world must learn to emulate.</span> <span id="s886">They were the people with morals with consciousness and they wanted to help and to do – do not kill.</span> <span id="s887">Do not kill.</span> <span id="s888">Be your brother's keeper.</span> <span id="s889">Aron – Herschel parted with his father and his niece and his cousin.</span> <span id="s890">Aron went with him to the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s891">By this time already Aron knew Tadek, and the idea was when Herschel and Lutek will arrive to Wilno that they will send back a note with Tadek to tell everyone that they had arrived safely.</span> <span id="s892">Well, they arrived safely but they did not send the note, and Aron didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s893">So he was reluctant to believe Tadek.</span> <span id="s894">Tadek gave him the kind of story that either you want to believe it or not.</span> <span id="s895">He said he took them to the Polish family.</span> <span id="s896">They were afraid to keep them because even though Lutek, his Polish was perfect, but he had Semitic looks, which is true by the way.</span> <span id="s897">It was true.</span> <span id="s898">And the family was afraid to keep them.</span> <span id="s899">So he said, “I took them to the ghetto, to the perimeter of the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s900">He says, “I show them where the ghetto is and they walked into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s901">They told me that they would come and give me a note to give back to Aron.”</span> <span id="s902">Says, “It poured, it rained.</span> <span id="s903">I waited and waited for the note and they never showed up.</span> <span id="s904">Here I come to tell you that they are in the ghetto but I don't have a note.”</span> <span id="s905">Well, Aron already had hesitations, “Should I believe him or should I believe him?”</span> <span id="s906">But he left it.</span> <span id="s907">Tadek kept on coming and kept on coming and bartering and the ghetto was not quiet any more.</span> <span id="s908">There were talks about transport and people already expected this transport, and already they begin to loom that these people are not going to be resettled.</span> <span id="s909">That there is some thought, “They’re sending them some place, to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s910">And do you know what they do to most of them?</span> <span id="s911">That they gas them.</span> <span id="s912">Gas them in 20th century?</span> <span id="s913">It must be.</span> <span id="s914">How could it be?</span> <span id="s915">How could it be?</span> <span id="s916">Yes, yes, yes, yes, it can be, it can be.”</span> <span id="s917">And it already begin to work on people and people already begin to believe.</span> <span id="s918">But so little could they have done to avoid the transport.</span> <span id="s919">So little could they have done to avoid the transport.</span> <span id="s920">One day Tadek came and tells Aron at work, “Aron, the ghetto is sealed.</span> <span id="s921">They are taking out the ghetto – the Jews.”</span> <span id="s922">We escaped the first transport of 5,000.</span> <span id="s923">“They are taking the Jews to resettlement and I doubt if you will have a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s924">Come with me to Wilno.</span> <span id="s925">I'll take you.</span> <span id="s926">I'll take you today.</span> <span id="s927">Come with me.</span> <span id="s928">Don't go back to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s929">Well, Aron listen to Tadek and he said, “What should I do?</span> <span id="s930">I have nobody in the world left.</span> <span id="s931">I left a mother and three sisters in Bialystok – on the way to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s932">The only person,” he says, “that I really have ties to is Lisa.</span> <span id="s933">Should I leave her too and go to Wilno, to go to the unknown?”</span> <span id="s934">By this time already he almost has said he resigned.</span> <span id="s935">He said, “What is life altogether?</span> <span id="s936">What if I survive?</span> <span id="s937">I have no one.</span> <span id="s938">All the one – all my dear ones are gone.</span> <span id="s939">They are killed.</span> <span id="s940">What is – I still – I think I'll go back to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s941">And by this time already the people that he worked with sort of were suspicious that he might go away with this Christian, and they worried because they were counted.</span> <span id="s942">And this too – was a tragedy that we are responsible one for another.</span> <span id="s943">If 10 people walked out of the ghetto, 10 had to return.</span> <span id="s944">If nine returned, they took hostages and they killed people.</span> <span id="s945">And you had this tremendous responsibility of the whole community, and it's not only said that they would take hostage.</span> <span id="s946">They did take hostages and they killed people.</span> <span id="s947">They killed people.</span> <span id="s948">They came to a house and they didn't find a person.</span> <span id="s949">They found this woman outside of the ghetto in Grodno.</span> <span id="s950">They dragged her into the ghetto and they took out the people, the person in the room that she lived with.</span> <span id="s951">And both of them were hanging on the gallows for days for the Jews to see what's being done when they catch Jews outside of the ghetto and if they're not reported that they are missing.</span> <span id="s952">So there was a communal responsibility.</span> <span id="s953">You were responsible not only for yourself but for others.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">02:41:09 That too kept a lot of people from maybe running away or doing something.</span> <span id="s955">Families clung together and they perished together.</span> <span id="s956">Tadek came and told Aron that he – the ghetto is surrounded.</span> <span id="s957">He better go with him, as I said.</span> <span id="s958">But Aron decided to go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s959">He came into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s960">He was immediately arrested, taken into the Synagogue, and he looked for me.</span> <span id="s961">He didn't find me, because when this came – that the transport that are coming to grab people again, my father, my little brother and I went to hide again.</span> <span id="s962">We really did not have a very good place to hide.</span> <span id="s963">So in our yard where we were living was a courtyard.</span> <span id="s964">Again, there were shacks where before the war people kept wood.</span> <span id="s965">And again, my father and my little brother and I crawled up in a little shack, in a wooden shack and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s966">Police came and knocked, “Your number is up.</span> <span id="s967">Come out.</span> <span id="s968">Come out.</span> <span id="s969">Anybody hiding come out.”</span> <span id="s970">Of course, we froze.</span> <span id="s971">We didn't answer.</span> <span id="s972">The Germans came in and knocked and searched around.</span> <span id="s973">They did not come with sniffing dogs.</span> <span id="s974">Were they come to sniffing dogs though, they would probably would find us.</span> <span id="s975">And we remained there.</span> <span id="s976">Aron searched for me in the Synagogue, in the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s977">He didn't find me in the Synagogue so he didn't know – either I was killed or hiding or whatever had happened to me.</span> <span id="s978">The massacre – the transport went on for quite a few days and finally, it came to a stop.</span> <span id="s979">A handful, about 800 maybe, people survived, maybe close to a 1,000 people, and as we were sitting – you see the shack where we were sitting faced the Synagogue and we saw all the thousands of people being led to the trains, being led, this march, this endless march of people being taken to the trains, to Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek.</span> <span id="s980">We – all of a sudden we saw Jews running and carrying a little bundle and we realized – and they were talking loud and we could hear.</span> <span id="s981">We realized that it's over and, you know, the talk was – evidently – people that wanted for other people that were hiding, to know that it's safe to come out.</span> <span id="s982">So in Yiddish they would say, “Come out.</span> <span id="s983">Come out.</span> <span id="s984">It's safe, it's safe.</span> <span id="s985">Git aroys, Yidden.</span> <span id="s986">Git aroys, git aroys.</span> <span id="s987">Come out, come out.”</span> <span id="s988">When we heard this, my father said, “It's safe to come out.”</span> <span id="s989">And we came out.</span> <span id="s990">We were practically numb for lying like this all curled up.</span> <span id="s991">We came down and we came and we realized that the house where we lived in – it was a two story, it was a building really.</span> <span id="s992">There were two buildings together – that people were running to these buildings.</span> <span id="s993">So we realized evidently that these are the buildings they left for the Jews.</span> <span id="s994">Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s995">There were three buildings that were left and one of the buildings was our building, where we lived before.</span> <span id="s996">So we went upstairs and as I came in upstairs, I found Aron there.</span> <span id="s997">I could not believe that it could be true.</span> <span id="s998">I could not believe.</span> <span id="s999">For sure I thought that he is already taken in a transport and I never, ever see him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">02:45:20 He came with another man, that he told me the story how he was saved when this man let him build a hiding place under the coal.</span> <span id="s1001">And that now we have to do something very fast, to run away from here and our only salvation is Tadek, that we must get in touch with Tadek and run out of here.</span> <span id="s1002">Well, my little brother went out and made – Aron had the address.</span> <span id="s1003">He was always ahead in his thinking so he knew where Tadek lived and the address.</span> <span id="s1004">And my little brother went out to meet Tadek, and Tadek told him that he would take him and my father to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1005">He would take them on freight cars that are traveling between Grodno and Wilno and he would let them – if they arrived safely, hoping that they would arrive safely, he would bring them into the gates of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1006">Let them walk into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1007">And it was a designated day that my little brother and my father left the ghetto to go and to meet Tadek.</span> <span id="s1008">They came to Tadek and Tadek said that on that day he could not take them.</span> <span id="s1009">That he would take them the next day, that there was no transport going.</span> <span id="s1010">So they went to hide.</span> <span id="s1011">They were hiding in the second ghetto that was completely empty overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">02:47:00 And the next day they met Tadek as he told my little brother where he would be and they would travel to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1013">Tadek again told them to stay in a ditch – to stay in a ditch that was right next to the yard to the railroad yard, and then when the train begins to move a little bit to jump on and to try to crawl on to the roof.</span> <span id="s1014">Well, my father listened and when it was time to run out, he did.</span> <span id="s1015">He did as he was told, but he would not step on to the two couplers and try to go up to the top of the roof, and he said, “Even if I have to be caught and killed, I cannot go to the top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1016">I cannot do it.”</span> <span id="s1017">So they were hidden on a flat car that had a tank that was traveling to the front – German tanks that were going to the Russian front and covered with tarps, so they were hidden under the tarps and they somehow made it.</span> <span id="s1018">They somehow made it.</span> <span id="s1019">They were searched.</span> <span id="s1020">They searched – there were stations where the trains – the flat cars were being searched to see if there was anybody.</span> <span id="s1021">By this time already there were Partisans.</span> <span id="s1022">There was already danger of Partisans.</span> <span id="s1023">But they didn't find them.</span> <span id="s1024">They arrived to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1025">They got in into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1026">They found Herschel and Lutek in the ghetto and my daddy send a note with Tadek to Aron to tell that he found Lutek in the ghetto and Herschel and that Tadek is for real and to come to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1027">And then it was our turn to go to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1028">I went out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1029">By this time the ghetto was very small and guarded, and I went out of the ghetto to establish a contact with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1030">I came – I found him and he told us to come on a designated day, on a Sunday and then he would take us.</span> <span id="s1031">I came back to the ghetto and I told Aron that I met Tadek.</span> <span id="s1032">He consented to take us and we'll go out to meet Tadek.</span> <span id="s1033">But not only Aron and I, but we were eight or nine people.</span> <span id="s1034">One of the people that we met was Elkie Jezerski, that knew – he said that he knows of a janitor that used to be a janitor in their building where he lived, and maybe we can hide there and wait until Tadek can take us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">02:50:11 Eight people went out, not with the idea of all of us to go but maybe Tadek would take them one‑by‑one.</span> <span id="s1036">Meanwhile, they would establish a contact and they know Tadek and they will stay with this janitor.</span> <span id="s1037">Elkie had a feeling that the janitor is fine and he would keep us.</span> <span id="s1038">All of us came to the janitor's house, and at midnight the janitor decided that he does not want to keep that many Jews.</span> <span id="s1039">It is dangerous.</span> <span id="s1040">We must leave his house.</span> <span id="s1041">He said, “But I'll keep the girl.”</span> <span id="s1042">He wanted us to leave right away and it was curfew so we begged him.</span> <span id="s1043">We begged him to let us stay until it gets a little in the morning before sunrise, while it is still dark.</span> <span id="s1044">And he kept – he let us stay and all of us went out of this house.</span> <span id="s1045">He took us – the janitor took us to a bombed-out house.</span> <span id="s1046">I went with them with the idea that I can stay in the janitor's house.</span> <span id="s1047">I stayed in the janitor's house.</span> <span id="s1048">I met Tadek at church.</span> <span id="s1049">Tadek told me that he would take us on a Tuesday.</span> <span id="s1050">Here it was Sunday.</span> <span id="s1051">I came back to the janitor's house and the janitor sent out his wife and the children, and I was not thinking at all, not knowing.</span> <span id="s1052">I was a child yet.</span> <span id="s1053">He wanted to rape me or to kill me because he was sharpening knives.</span> <span id="s1054">I had the presence when I heard knives being sharpened, that even though I was locked in a room – I was locked in a room when he sent out his wife and two girls, I had the presence to run out.</span> <span id="s1055">I ran from the house, and in my chase running out of the house, the doors were flimsy even though the door was closed and with a latch, but I went out with all my strength.</span> <span id="s1056">And I slammed the door in such a way that by the time he opened the door, I was already a distance from him, from the janitor, and my luck was that there were stairs.</span> <span id="s1057">It's hilly.</span> <span id="s1058">It was very – it was hilly and there were stairs and there were homes on the sides of the stairs.</span> <span id="s1059">He ran to chase me.</span> <span id="s1060">I was faster than he and when he came about the middle like, of the stairs and where there were homes, he was afraid because they shouldn't tell that he's chasing a girl or maybe it's a Jewish girl or something, so he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">02:53:21 I ran to the house where the rest of the Jews – Aron and the others were hidden – to tell them what happened.</span> <span id="s1062">That we cannot leave tonight.</span> <span id="s1063">That Tadek will take us Tuesday and that the janitor, either he wanted to kill me – I did not realize that he wanted to rape me – that he wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s1064">And I ran away, and what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s1065">We decided that we have to return to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1066">We cannot stay there until Tuesday, until Tadek would meet us.</span> <span id="s1067">We had to return to the ghetto because there was an empty yard and children were playing ball.</span> <span id="s1068">It was a bombed out house and the windows were open and we were about to fall in into this basement, into this hovel where we were all of us hiding.</span> <span id="s1069">The children would run home and say, “The Jews are hiding there, so many of them.”</span> <span id="s1070">We were afraid that they would give us out.</span> <span id="s1071">We had to wait until night came and we went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1072">We could not remain one day of the danger that loomed outside.</span> <span id="s1073">We came in back to the ghetto and Tuesday as Tadek told us to meet him – told me – to meet him in the public washroom at seven o'clock at night in the evening, and he would take us – when he said would take us, he only meant Aron and myself but five people went out – not, not two.</span> <span id="s1074">One of them was Ruby Loren, the man that Aron was saved in the synagogue, his cousin, and another young man.</span> <span id="s1075">And the reason the five went out, because we wanted the other people to have this contact to be able to go with Tadek another time – to know him and where he lives and so forth – to establish a contact.</span> <span id="s1076">Five of us came.</span> <span id="s1077">It was dark.</span> <span id="s1078">We came to the public washroom.</span> <span id="s1079">Dark, seven o'clock.</span> <span id="s1080">Tadek was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">02:55:43 He told me that he would be dressed in a uniform like a railroad worker.</span> <span id="s1082">He would have a flashlight.</span> <span id="s1083">He would light the flashlight so I would know that that was the man.</span> <span id="s1084">Exactly there, seven o'clock, the men were in a public washroom in the middle of Grodno on the Christian side, naturally.</span> <span id="s1085">I waited for Tadek.</span> <span id="s1086">Tadek came and I tell Tadek that we are five people.</span> <span id="s1087">When they were hidden in the public washroom, they looked out of a little window and when Aron saw that Tadek is there, he went out to talk to Tadek and he begged Tadek to take another person.</span> <span id="s1088">He tell them that, “I was saved with this man.</span> <span id="s1089">I really don't want to part with him.</span> <span id="s1090">He was good to me.</span> <span id="s1091">I want to be good to him.</span> <span id="s1092">I want to take him with me.”</span> <span id="s1093">But Ruby didn't want to go because he tells Aron, “The only person in the world is left is my cousin.</span> <span id="s1094">I don't want to leave my cousin.</span> <span id="s1095">I want to be with him.</span> <span id="s1096">I have no one left in the world.</span> <span id="s1097">Everybody in my family is gone already.”</span> <span id="s1098">Aron tells him, “Look, Ruby .</span> <span id="s1099">They will come Thursday.</span> <span id="s1100">Tadek promised to take them Thursday.</span> <span id="s1101">You have an opportunity.</span> <span id="s1102">Come.</span> <span id="s1103">They will come.</span> <span id="s1104">You'll be in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s1105">Come.”</span> <span id="s1106">And Ruby was standing there sort of halfway with his cousin, halfway, when Aron grabbed his hand and took him with and he went with us.</span> <span id="s1107">The others returned to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1108">They never were able to make the trip because for them, death came.</span> <span id="s1109">Resettlement came before they were able to go out of the ghetto and to meet Tadek again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">02:57:21 I walked with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1111">Aron and Ruby followed.</span> <span id="s1112">They were both very Semitic looking.</span> <span id="s1113">They wore Polish looking hats called maciejówka, a kind of hats that Poles wear.</span> <span id="s1114">We were not stopped.</span> <span id="s1115">We came to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1116">Tadek pointed out to us the train, the freight train that was going to Wilno – from Grodno to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1117">Within the freight train, also there were passenger cars that the Wehrmacht – that the Germans traveled.</span> <span id="s1118">But we were to travel – Tadek told us that when the train began to move already at a little speed to jump out, to try and grab, to run up between two boxcars and the couplers and find a little ladder and try to crawl up to the top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1119">I listened and I had it all in my mind to do it the way Tadek said.</span> <span id="s1120">Aron went out first and he was able to do it and went up to the top of the roof, I learned later, and Ruby, I guess, did the same.</span> <span id="s1121">I remained in the ditch, or lying in the road, I remained in the ditch.</span> <span id="s1122">I turned my head and I saw so few cars left.</span> <span id="s1123">“Oh, I will remain.</span> <span id="s1124">It's the end.</span> <span id="s1125">It's the end.</span> <span id="s1126">I survived until now but I won't survive anymore more.”</span> <span id="s1127">I ran out and I have not been able to find the two box cars with the couplers, but I saw a boxcar with a door and, you know, it had a handle, a little ledge, and I grabbed on and I stood on the ledge.</span> <span id="s1128">I held on to the handle.</span> <span id="s1129">I have not been able to go on to the top of the roof, and there I was standing with my feet, wearing mittens in sub‑zero weather, holding on.</span> <span id="s1130">The train began to accelerate, add speed.</span> <span id="s1131">I was already frozen.</span> <span id="s1132">The wind tore off my babushka and I couldn't hold on much longer.</span> <span id="s1133">I couldn't and I couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1134">By this time already I wish to be killed so it would be over with.</span> <span id="s1135">And all of a sudden I heard a noise on top.</span> <span id="s1136">I heard a noise and it sounded like somebody is sort of on top.</span> <span id="s1137">And then it got quiet and I still was holding on.</span> <span id="s1138">I learned later that Tadek came to find his passengers on top.</span> <span id="s1139">He found Ruby and he found Aron lying on one roof on the same boxcar.</span> <span id="s1140">He didn't find me.</span> <span id="s1141">He asked, “Where is the girl?”</span> <span id="s1142">They said they don't know.</span> <span id="s1143">They still left her in the ditch and they don't know what happened to the girl.</span> <span id="s1144">Tadek did not give up.</span> <span id="s1145">As the train was moving and moving very fast already, he jumped from one boxcar to another until he came almost to the end of the train, the almost of the end, and he saw me standing there holding on yet.</span> <span id="s1146">He ran for the car where Aron and Ruby were on.</span> <span id="s1147">The three of them jumped boxcar after boxcar.</span> <span id="s1148">Youth was with them.</span> <span id="s1149">They were young.</span> <span id="s1150">They were able to do it.</span> <span id="s1151">My father could not do it and a lot, a lot, a lot, of people could not do.</span> <span id="s1152">Children and woman could not do it either.</span> <span id="s1153">You had to be young to be able to do it and to know that there was a Tadeusz Soroka.</span> <span id="s1154">This were not that many Tadeusz Soroka.</span> <span id="s1155">They came to the boxcar that I was still standing and Tadek leaned over, gave me a hand and told me to hold on to his hand, that they will pull me up.</span> <span id="s1156">I had a vision that he will grab my mitten and not my hand.</span> <span id="s1157">And I said “I must do everything that I possess not to lose his hand.”</span> <span id="s1158">And I managed.</span> <span id="s1159">The three of them pulled me up to the top of the train on the roof and I traveled with them, the three of us on this boxcar for 180 kilometers in sub‑zero weather.</span> <span id="s1160">I was at the time 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: We're going to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">03:02:24 End of Tape Number Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Tape Number Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Now, you're just about to arrive in Wilno.</span> <span id="s1165">So tell me what happens then and how you end up in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: We arrived in Wilno and we were able to go in into the ghetto without any problem.</span> <span id="s1167">Tadek walked with us.</span> <span id="s1168">He told us to cover our faces with soot so we would look like railroad workers coming from work or something, and he said, “As soon as you see a group of Jews returning from the nightshift, from work, try to jump in, in their midst and walk into the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1169">And we walked with Tadek for awhile and all of a sudden we see a group of Jews.</span> <span id="s1170">Of course, worker Jews because they walked in the street, not on the sidewalk and they all had yellow stars.</span> <span id="s1171">We went into their midst and we walked in into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1172">This was the last time on this voyage that we saw Tadek.</span> <span id="s1173">We came in into the ghetto and Jewish police immediately took us over.</span> <span id="s1174">And as the Jewish police took us over they took us into Dessler and to Gens in order for us to receive rations, a piece of bread that everybody needed and a bowl of soup and also, a place where to put your head down.</span> <span id="s1175">I'm not talking about a room, but a place, a piece of floor to put your head down.</span> <span id="s1176">You had to be registered within the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1177">Dessler cautioned us not to tell anyone.</span> <span id="s1178">Of course, we told him the story, that we are – about the transports and we still had a story to tell him about Slonim and then Grodno about the transports.</span> <span id="s1179">Also, he said, “You have to be very quiet, not to tell people, not to put the ghetto in a panic.</span> <span id="s1180">Not to put the ghetto in a panic.</span> <span id="s1181">Here it's different.</span> <span id="s1182">Here it's different, and don't jeopardize your ration cards and do as we tell you to do.”</span> <span id="s1183">Needless to tell you, neither of us listened to what he had to say.</span> <span id="s1184">We spoke our mind and told people exactly what happened in Slonim, what happened in Grodno, and by this time already people in Wilno knew too, because it was already after Ponar and a lot of killings in Wilno but the situation there was still different.</span> <span id="s1185">The ghetto was still vital.</span> <span id="s1186">There was still quite a large ghetto.</span> <span id="s1187">I came in.</span> <span id="s1188">I was immediately – I was told where my father and my little brother are and I immediately ran there to be with them.</span> <span id="s1189">Can you imagine the joy of my father to have me come to Wilno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">03:07:01 Now, Aron immediately found a group of people that came from Grodno.</span> <span id="s1191">They were together with me.</span> <span id="s1192">There were nine men and a girl.</span> <span id="s1193">I was the only girl.</span> <span id="s1194">So they all lived together and they were called in the ghetto “The Grodno Group.”</span> <span id="s1195">They all sort of were dressed the same and they were called “the Grodno Group” and they all lived in a room.</span> <span id="s1196">They had one room with another married – with a couple and the couple's sister.</span> <span id="s1197">So you can imagine how many people in one, in one room lived.</span> <span id="s1198">The ghetto – people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in the ghetto that came to me as a total surprise.</span> <span id="s1199">There was a library where you could go and take out books or sit and study.</span> <span id="s1200">There were children playing ball.</span> <span id="s1201">There were competition and there was a theater in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1202">I couldn't believe it, that this was possible.</span> <span id="s1203">There was a restaurant in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1204">This was such an unknown experience to me that I felt like it was a different world.</span> <span id="s1205">My father worked outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1206">So did my little brother – used to go out and I too, for the first time went out to work outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1207">I worked in hothouses where they raised vegetables for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1208">For – I guess for the German elite, whoever, the Gestapo, or whoever.</span> <span id="s1209">The leader there was a – the foreman there was a Lithuanian man and he knew some of the Jews that worked there, so he wasn't very harsh on us.</span> <span id="s1210">And the Germans didn't watch us.</span> <span id="s1211">We somehow could always, always finagle a little bit, where we could steal a radish or a carrot and eat it real fast and try to get rid of the green part of it.</span> <span id="s1212">And it is there where I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">03:09:26 The man that was our foreman, the Jewish foreman, always used to go away and leave us.</span> <span id="s1214">I was very, at times, angry.</span> <span id="s1215">I say, “Why does he do it?</span> <span id="s1216">Why does he do it?”</span> <span id="s1217">Little did I know.</span> <span id="s1218">Much later in the underground where I met him that he was part of the Jewish resistance.</span> <span id="s1219">But I didn't know when I worked with him.</span> <span id="s1220">The man never told us or anything.</span> <span id="s1221">He evidently was trying to do something for the resistance on the outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1222">So I worked – Aron worked inside of the ghetto and very much our hope was only the resistance and the underground.</span> <span id="s1223">We knew that we can not survive in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1224">And because it was still a large ghetto in numbers and there was still quite a young people in the ghetto, we tried to look every possible way to get in touch with the resistance.</span> <span id="s1225">Do you know, before the war was known for this – it was called “the Wilno Jerusalem of Lithuanian.”</span> <span id="s1226">There was such a strong nucleus, culture in Jewish and in every, every aspect of Jewish life in Wilno that we were convinced that there must be an underground there.</span> <span id="s1227">And when Aron worked with one of the men in the shop in the ghetto he realized that he's – that they do something there.</span> <span id="s1228">That it's always producing a part, a part, a part and the minute the foreman, the German foreman, would walk in they would immediately hide.</span> <span id="s1229">He learned later that they were making some parts for armaments in this shop, that they were really working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1230">And besides Aron there was another man that had contacts in Wilno and from both sides, somehow, they contacted the Jewish resistance and the resistance took us in because they were all young men, unattached with no families, and we became part of the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">03:11:43 It was very, very secretive.</span> <span id="s1232">I could not tell my father, neither I could tell my little brother.</span> <span id="s1233">And then the story of Wittenberg developed in the ghetto where a Communist, a Polish Communist was caught on the outside of the ghetto and within his torture he gave out Wittenberg as the leader of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1234">Now, the Judenrat played both ends of the picture.</span> <span id="s1235">They were with the resistors and they were with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1236">Gens had a notion because in 1943 when we came to Wilno in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the Russian Front already and Gens had a thought that if the resistors do not bring in the destruction of the ghetto, the people might survive.</span> <span id="s1237">Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors.</span> <span id="s1238">So he wanted to convince the resistance to “don't rock the boat.”</span> <span id="s1239">And even though he knew there was resistance, so he played both ends.</span> <span id="s1240">But he convinced the population of the ghetto that, “the resistors will bring down your end.”</span> <span id="s1241">And the population of the ghetto was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors.</span> <span id="s1242">And then this tremendous play with Wittenberg developed and as we know from history now from the Wilno ghetto that Wittenberg was turned over to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1243">He committed suicide and Abba Kovner took over the leadership, but at a time when the leadership decided not to give out Wittenberg.</span> <span id="s1244">They called us to come in the barricades and to fight, to raise a fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1245">Of course it was futile.</span> <span id="s1246">We all would have been killed.</span> <span id="s1247">And when we came to this designated place I realized the strength that the resistors had because they were so big in numbers.</span> <span id="s1248">They really did not have much to fight with in arms.</span> <span id="s1249">Of course not.</span> <span id="s1250">It's a David and Goliath fight.</span> <span id="s1251">I mean there was an army with tanks, with all the supplies in the world, and we only had our bodies, a few grenades and something that we wanted to give our lives – to show the Jews fought back, that we fought back, that we achieved at least something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">03:14:36 And as history tells, Wittenberg and I tell, Wittenberg was given – there was a big discussion among the leadership.</span> <span id="s1253">We learned all of it later after it was over.</span> <span id="s1254">We were not in the leadership position.</span> <span id="s1255">I was a 16‑year‑old girl doing what I was told to do and really being so grateful that I was part of the resistance and did absolutely everything that I was told to do, and I knew very little except what I was told to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">03:15:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: This time when you all came together, tell me more about when and where that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: That was in Wilno in the ghetto that faced the outside of the ghetto, and it was at midnight like, late at night.</span> <span id="s1259">From all sides group start to converge to this place, and as we came it was dark.</span> <span id="s1260">Maybe there weren't as many numbers, but I conceived it as a tremendous number, two – 300 young people that came there and some of them were walking.</span> <span id="s1261">Some of them had a grenade and somebody had a pistol.</span> <span id="s1262">And we already, our group, too already possessed couple of pistols that we really bought on the outside of the ghettos, smuggled it in and paid with hunger by not eating, by not having that slice of bread to be able to obtain the pistol.</span> <span id="s1263">It was an exhilarating experience to be there, even though that we knew that we would all die, because we were no match, we were no match.</span> <span id="s1264">All of a sudden we were sent home, to go back home.</span> <span id="s1265">We didn't know the drama at the time until the next day when it developed that Wittenberg decided that – they came to him with the thought and told him what it entails.</span> <span id="s1266">And Gens told the leadership, the resistance leadership, that if he doesn't give himself up, they are going to come and destroy the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1267">And there was a lot of people, Jews, running in the ghetto screaming “Wittenberg, Wittenberg,” for him to give up.</span> <span id="s1268">“He's bringing the end to us.</span> <span id="s1269">He's bringing the end to us.”</span> <span id="s1270">Little did they know that the end was coming anyway.</span> <span id="s1271">But when I was in the ghetto, my thoughts were altogether different.</span> <span id="s1272">I was the enemy of these people that said for Wittenberg to give up and to – not to rage and to fight, not to fight back because the ghetto will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1273">I thought they would be destroyed anyway.</span> <span id="s1274">The end will come anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">03:17:42 But for the ones in the ghetto that still had children, every day meant something and Gens kept on saying, “If we live through this period, maybe we can still live through the liberation.”</span> <span id="s1276">I began to appreciate it many years later when I had a family and children.</span> <span id="s1277">And I know that you were to be responsible, not only for yourself but you're responsible for your family too.</span> <span id="s1278">You cannot run out.</span> <span id="s1279">You can only do it when you are a youngster, leave your parents.</span> <span id="s1280">You cannot do it when you are a parent.</span> <span id="s1281">There is much more responsibility expected of a parent.</span> <span id="s1282">And then the decision was, after the Wittenberg affair, of course, Wittenberg was taken into the Gestapo and he was given poison and he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1283">So they really got nothing out of Wittenberg as far as questioning him and for him to give out secrets or anything.</span> <span id="s1284">And then the thought was that we cannot wage a war – warfare – in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1285">The population is not with us, is not with us, and the only solution would be to send the resistors into the underground in the woods in the forest to fight from the forest.</span> <span id="s1286">And little by little, groups began to leave.</span> <span id="s1287">How did they go?</span> <span id="s1288">It was a 180 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1289">The closest the Naroch woods where we went to.</span> <span id="s1290">Groups of 25, 28 or so were sent with guides.</span> <span id="s1291">Who were the guides?</span> <span id="s1292">The guides were Jewish Partisans already that were in the underground and were already, so to say, “free people.”</span> <span id="s1293">They took upon themselves the risk of being killed to go into the ghetto and to lead groups of Jews out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1294">What courage!</span> <span id="s1295">What heroism to do the kind of, really, thing that you risk with your life to do it.</span> <span id="s1296">They were giants, giants of men.</span> <span id="s1297">Giants, lions, young dedicated, fearless, that came to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1298">Some of them were even arrested in the ghetto and then let out.</span> <span id="s1299">And they took groups.</span> <span id="s1300">Some of the groups that went out before us met up with an ambush and were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">03:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Why don't we actually start with, let's start with the resistance to take taking you with them because you were a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: After we contacted the resistance, I really was not one of the people that contacted the resistance, but it came from two different sides.</span> <span id="s1304">Aron knew somebody and our friend – another friend of ours that was from Grodno, that knew the resistance, knew somebody in the resistance already, and finally we were able to join the resistance.</span> <span id="s1305">When it came the time to really go to the forest, there was a discussion that among the Grodno group there was a girl and they were not so keen of taking the girl, to leave the girl behind.</span> <span id="s1306">Little did they know that I could do everything that these men were doing, even more, and I was really at no time at all any liability to anyone in the underground – just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1307">But Herschel Lipszyc, our dear friend Herschel Lipszyc, stood up and he say – they call me Liska(ph) – “If Liska doesn't go, none of us are going.</span> <span id="s1308">All of us are going and Liska is going too, and this is the way it is going to be.”</span> <span id="s1309">And because he was so very positive and naturally, Aron very much wanted me to go, no question.</span> <span id="s1310">I mean, I joined in group because Aron was part of it.</span> <span id="s1311">On my own, I don't think I could have reached the underground.</span> <span id="s1312">So finally they consented that they'll take me too.</span> <span id="s1313">We would be going to the underground to Naroch and we would go with a group of 28 people.</span> <span id="s1314">So on a designated day there came a call that it's time for us to leave for the underground.</span> <span id="s1315">All the Grodno people, the 10 of them lived together, so the call came to them.</span> <span id="s1316">And early in the morning, about three or four o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the little window.</span> <span id="s1317">In Wilno we lived in a room with three more families.</span> <span id="s1318">There were practically corpses all over the floor, to walk out.</span> <span id="s1319">It was time for me to go to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">03:23:15 I have not been able to walk out because I would wake up all the people that want to know, “Where are you going in the middle of the night at four o'clock in the morning?</span> <span id="s1321">You can't go to work that early.”</span> <span id="s1322">I slept in the bunk with my brother, and Aron knocked on the window and he said, “It's time to go.”</span> <span id="s1323">I have not been able to go through the door, so I had to slip out in the tiny piece of the window, the little window that opened up for air.</span> <span id="s1324">Luckily, I was so thin and so small that I was able to get out.</span> <span id="s1325">I have not been able to tell my father.</span> <span id="s1326">Neither did I tell my brother.</span> <span id="s1327">I only told him, “When I am gone, tell daddy that I have left – that I left.”</span> <span id="s1328">And he says daddy will know where I went.</span> <span id="s1329">So that my little brother was intelligent enough to know.</span> <span id="s1330">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1331">I left without telling them because it was so secretive.</span> <span id="s1332">I wasn't able to tell them.</span> <span id="s1333">Were I to remain, who knows if I would have survived and I wanted to go so much.</span> <span id="s1334">The leaders were the two men.</span> <span id="s1335">It was Shlemke Hilczyk and Motke de Geller – Motke the Red.</span> <span id="s1336">Really, I can only speak about them in superlatives.</span> <span id="s1337">Only super giants, men that were ready to give their lives to help other Jews in need.</span> <span id="s1338">They were already free people when they were in the underground.</span> <span id="s1339">Of course, they could have been killed but they were not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1340">Their dream was already accomplished.</span> <span id="s1341">They were there.</span> <span id="s1342">They were fighters.</span> <span id="s1343">They came to take out groups of Jews from the ghetto to lead them in into the underground.</span> <span id="s1344">It took us seven nights to walk to the underground.</span> <span id="s1345">Twenty-eight people left.</span> <span id="s1346">Among them were women too.</span> <span id="s1347">I wasn't the only woman.</span> <span id="s1348">I was the youngest, that much I'll say.</span> <span id="s1349">I was the youngest in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">03:25:26 The first night when we came out we went out of the ghetto as a group going to work.</span> <span id="s1351">We came to the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s1352">We were hidden in a little wooded area, hardly wooded enough not to be seen.</span> <span id="s1353">There were shepherds with the flock.</span> <span id="s1354">We took them with us.</span> <span id="s1355">We kept them the whole day.</span> <span id="s1356">We did not harm them.</span> <span id="s1357">We blindfolded them and we kept them there, and when night came, when we left this little forest, we let them go home.</span> <span id="s1358">And we told them under no circumstances are they to tell that they were in the woods with some Jews, because they will be punished severely.</span> <span id="s1359">We showed them that we had weapons, and we left.</span> <span id="s1360">We walked with this man that took us – that supposedly knew the road and they got lost.</span> <span id="s1361">They had no compasses, only by the sight.</span> <span id="s1362">We tried to go with side roads, so we would not be seen and identified.</span> <span id="s1363">But as we were going on the side roads we only got lost.</span> <span id="s1364">We got lost and we had to cross a railroad track on the other side of the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1365">So he decided to go on the main road where Germans were traveling, and every time, he told us, we see approaching cars with lights to drop in the ditches and to hide.</span> <span id="s1366">And one by one we crossed the railroad tracks while German guards were standing.</span> <span id="s1367">Every time the guard would turn to the back towards us, one of us would slip out.</span> <span id="s1368">Twenty-eight people had to cross.</span> <span id="s1369">Imagine the danger.</span> <span id="s1370">And all of us crossed safely.</span> <span id="s1371">Part of the way when it began to get light we were running, not walking, but running to hide.</span> <span id="s1372">The day we hid in a little forest we started out walking again and we had problems again.</span> <span id="s1373">The road wasn't so clear to them.</span> <span id="s1374">They came back from the forest.</span> <span id="s1375">Somehow they knew their way but they had to – maybe –had to change the way.</span> <span id="s1376">They took another road and two nights in a row we were lost.</span> <span id="s1377">They never lost their cool.</span> <span id="s1378">They always kept us convinced that they know what they're doing and they will bring us in a safe place.</span> <span id="s1379">And we had the total confidence, total confidence, in these two young men.</span> <span id="s1380">Finally, they decided after the second or the third day they decided to take farmers to lead us, to be our leaders.</span> <span id="s1381">And the farmers knew the way and we told them to bring us to the next stop.</span> <span id="s1382">They told them to bring us to the next stop, and the farmers listened.</span> <span id="s1383">The farmers listened and brought us to the next stop.</span> <span id="s1384">They were cautioned not to give out the Jews, that this is a pack of Jews.</span> <span id="s1385">The farmers knew very well and somehow we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">03:28:37 We had to cross two rivers, and one river a farmer took us and we were all walking all the way up to our waists.</span> <span id="s1387">Some of them didn't know how to swim.</span> <span id="s1388">They were worried that they would drown.</span> <span id="s1389">And we made it.</span> <span id="s1390">The farmers said, “The river is not very deep.</span> <span id="s1391">You will make it.”</span> <span id="s1392">And he was right, we made it.</span> <span id="s1393">We came to cross the big river, the Viliya, and the Germans were standing guard on the bridges, and when they heard the splashing of the water from so many people walking.</span> <span id="s1394">They began shooting at us.</span> <span id="s1395">Fortunately, their aims were poor.</span> <span id="s1396">Nobody was killed and we crossed, and finally the two leaders start taking wagons with farmers, wagons, and they put us up on the wagons.</span> <span id="s1397">And we traveled on wagons already, until we came to what is called “Partisan Territory” where there was a tremendous number, already, of Partisans and it was safe.</span> <span id="s1398">This was Partisan Territory so it was safe.</span> <span id="s1399">And it is there, while we were on the wagons traveling, all of a sudden we were stopped.</span> <span id="s1400">We were stopped by a Jewish Partisan riding on a horse with an automatic rifle.</span> <span id="s1401">Can you imagine our joy?</span> <span id="s1402">I will never forget this moment.</span> <span id="s1403">Never, never.</span> <span id="s1404">Leibke Gordon on a horse with a rifle, with a machine gun, greeting us, falling all over us, kissing us, we kissing them.</span> <span id="s1405">He was like Messiah.</span> <span id="s1406">We came to the Promised Land and they brought us into the truck.</span> <span id="s1407">The guides waiting for permission.</span> <span id="s1408">They didn't know the password.</span> <span id="s1409">You had to know the password.</span> <span id="s1410">They didn't know the password.</span> <span id="s1411">They were stopped.</span> <span id="s1412">They told they are going to the ghetto to bring Jews to the Partisans, so they were let in and then we were let into the base.</span> <span id="s1413">We came to a place that it's – how could I describe this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">03:30:58 It was like Robin Hood.</span> <span id="s1415">There's people walking around with rifles.</span> <span id="s1416">Sides of cows are hanging that were being slaughtered for the food.</span> <span id="s1417">Huts – we lived in huts that were built.</span> <span id="s1418">It was hilly so they were built in the hills made out of logs, dug out, you know, made out of logs.</span> <span id="s1419">And there were bunks.</span> <span id="s1420">A long bunk that was not for twelve – how could I describe to you the scene as we came down the hill.</span> <span id="s1421">I seen a Robin Hood.</span> <span id="s1422">People walking around with rifles, sides of beef hanging, huts, people coming out of the huts milling great number of people.</span> <span id="s1423">I never could have believed that this is the way the underground, the resistors, worked.</span> <span id="s1424">I thought they lived hidden in some kind of a small little place away where nobody could ever find them or such.</span> <span id="s1425">This seemed to be so open.</span> <span id="s1426">It seemed so open and we were welcomed right away.</span> <span id="s1427">The leader – we came to a Jewish unit that was called “Revenge” – “Nekamah” in Hebrew – and the leader was Joseph Glazman.</span> <span id="s1428">He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know who we saw, the last people that we saw in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1429">And we learned that it wasn't that simple for Jews to be in the underground, in the Jewish unit.</span> <span id="s1430">That the Russians would not give them any arms, enough in the unit, and the thought was they met up – they told us they already met up with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separately, and they look down upon these Jews that came from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1431">After all they are ghetto Jews.</span> <span id="s1432">Little did they know that these ghetto Jews knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">03:33:46 And very shortly, very shortly – the spirit was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1434">It was sort of free.</span> <span id="s1435">You felt free even though you knew there were dangers, that there were Germans all the way around.</span> <span id="s1436">But you felt free and I kept on thinking, “If people in the ghettos would only know that something like this existed, they would all run, they would all come.”</span> <span id="s1437">But I knew very well that they couldn't run and they couldn't come.</span> <span id="s1438">It's only the select youth that were able to do it.</span> <span id="s1439">I knew it but you thought both ways.</span> <span id="s1440">Very shortly, very shortly this Jewish unit was disbanned, was disbanned under the pretext they are training the Soviet Union, all the nationalities mixed together.</span> <span id="s1441">There isn't such a thing as a Jewish unit – it must be integrated unit.</span> <span id="s1442">And, of course, they sent away most of the group to be in a family camp.</span> <span id="s1443">Actually, it wasn't so much a family camp because there were hardly – we did not have any children in this group.</span> <span id="s1444">But also the artisans are people that knew how to sew.</span> <span id="s1445">They made them because this was the Jewish elite that came from Wilno, the Jewish elite.</span> <span id="s1446">They send them in to bake bread, for the woman to peel potatoes and to sew, to make boots for the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1447">I don't know – sew their uniforms.</span> <span id="s1448">I really don't know and there was a tremendous anger among the group.</span> <span id="s1449">Tremendous.</span> <span id="s1450">People felt so rejected.</span> <span id="s1451">They felt it was so unjust to do it.</span> <span id="s1452">Here people came to fight and they were sent to be in a group.</span> <span id="s1453">They gave some of them weapons so they can defend themselves in case they are attacked and also to go out to the farmers and get food – to get food.</span> <span id="s1454">After a while there was no alternative.</span> <span id="s1455">People got adjusted, but they felt it was a tremendous injustice.</span> <span id="s1456">All of us felt it was a tremendous injustice.</span> <span id="s1457">We remained in the unit and we were the first among the Russian units, in a lot of Russian units.</span> <span id="s1458">But our group, that were in this Jewish otriad, remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and, of course, we met up with Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1459">With Antisemitism women had a very special strike against them.</span> <span id="s1460">Nobody thought, the leadership and even the soldiers, the resistors, did not think that women know how to fight, know how to do – when you need to go on a mission or something of this sort.</span> <span id="s1461">And they told them, you know, to do kitchen work, to do this and all sorts of menial jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">03:37:16 And some – then Glazman took a group of really the most outstanding young men and women and they left.</span> <span id="s1463">They were so really hurt that this could happen to a group that was so dedicated, that was so knowledgeable, that had all the potential to do everything that was asked of resistors to do, that they left.</span> <span id="s1464">They left to go to the other groups that left Wilno and went to Rudniki to the forests, to the “Pushcha Rudniski” it was called.</span> <span id="s1465">In English they call it Rudniki.</span> <span id="s1466">And on the way they ended up, they met up with an ambush and they were all killed.</span> <span id="s1467">One young woman escaped and she came back and told us what happened.</span> <span id="s1468">How they were killed and things and exactly what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1469">Very shortly after, we were dispersed within the groups.</span> <span id="s1470">I was always within the Russian unit with the Jews that were remained in the Kalininski Otriad and whatever it was asked of us to do, we did.</span> <span id="s1471">We did it very well.</span> <span id="s1472">What do the Partisans do?</span> <span id="s1473">They really made it impossible for the German Army to move.</span> <span id="s1474">We cut down trees and blockaded the roads.</span> <span id="s1475">We mined the entrances to where the resistors lived and this was called an otriad, the units where they lived.</span> <span id="s1476">They cut down telephone wires and they made ambushes at times; dynamiting the roads, dynamiting also trains that went to the front.</span> <span id="s1477">In the very same token, we helped Jews that were hiding in the woods because there were Jewish, young children and also elderly people, women that escaped, wanting a family that ran out of a ghetto that either burning or everybody was being killed, and quite a few children.</span> <span id="s1478">I mean not in large numbers, no.</span> <span id="s1479">And we saw – they lived at first almost like wild – running from place to place and hiding and never having enough food.</span> <span id="s1480">Some of them even died.</span> <span id="s1481">But when we came into the forest, we made sure that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers.</span> <span id="s1482">If something will happen to their safety, you will be punished and punished severely.</span> <span id="s1483">And you'd be surprised, they listened.</span> <span id="s1484">Because they knew that we had power.</span> <span id="s1485">There were sieges every so often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">03:40:32 There was one tremendous siege in the fall, a little bit later in the fall in 1943, where the Germans that were going to the front had to come through the woods, and we lost a lot.</span> <span id="s1487">A lot, a lot of Partisans were killed.</span> <span id="s1488">A lot of them were killed.</span> <span id="s1489">They systematically walked through.</span> <span id="s1490">We were hiding on an island that was covered.</span> <span id="s1491">We thought was safe.</span> <span id="s1492">It wasn't at all.</span> <span id="s1493">After we came out of there we realized that we could even be seen from the road.</span> <span id="s1494">But somehow we survived, but 20 – we survived but at least between 20 and 30 percent of the Partisans we lost in the siege that were killed, that were lost.</span> <span id="s1495">We returned back to the base.</span> <span id="s1496">The base was not touched.</span> <span id="s1497">They never came to the base and nobody was on the base.</span> <span id="s1498">Now, the leadership, the leadership took it first a group of Jewish young men and I was left to guard, to stand guard for the leadership.</span> <span id="s1499">And after the danger really came that they realized that they cannot travel in a group with more than two or three of them.</span> <span id="s1500">They ran away hiding some place with farmers.</span> <span id="s1501">They changed their clothes.</span> <span id="s1502">They were after all, they were Russians.</span> <span id="s1503">They were Christians so they didn't have this danger of being Jews and hiding among farmers.</span> <span id="s1504">They left.</span> <span id="s1505">They left, disbanned all of us, and told us each and everyone to go and look out for ourselves and it will be over to come back to the base.</span> <span id="s1506">We came back to the base and we found, for a while, no one.</span> <span id="s1507">After a while the leadership came and they start dropping now leaders from behind the enemy lines to be our leaders, and we begin to grow in numbers and everybody was armed because the arms were being dropped from behind the enemy lines.</span> <span id="s1508">We made an airport and air drone like where we cleared out part of a forest.</span> <span id="s1509">And at night on four corners of this meadow, we would light fires for the planes to identify where to drop the shipment of arms.</span> <span id="s1510">So Jews and no Jews, everybody got armed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">03:43:18 The others always were armed.</span> <span id="s1512">It's just Jews, always the Jews.</span> <span id="s1513">And time went on and at big battles they would organize two or three or four units to come out together.</span> <span id="s1514">At times we just walked and walked for days not knowing what they were doing and what was going to be done.</span> <span id="s1515">But somehow we always came back to the base, and later we would learn that this was sort of an exercise of a sort.</span> <span id="s1516">Nobody questioned.</span> <span id="s1517">Nobody questioned.</span> <span id="s1518">We did what we were told to do.</span> <span id="s1519">Time went on and I have to tell you that one day as I was on the base, somebody came running to me to tell me that my father came into the woods.</span> <span id="s1520">I left my father and my little brother in Wilno.</span> <span id="s1521">When one of the groups went – guides went to Wilno I begged one of them, begged to tell my father that I am alive and that I am in the Naroch woods.</span> <span id="s1522">He told my father; he went to my father.</span> <span id="s1523">I told him the floor.</span> <span id="s1524">I told him the house where we were, and my little brother was caught in the street in Wilno while they were grabbing the people and was sent to a labor camp in Estonia, and then added up in Stutthof concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1525">My father was home and he remained all alone, and when he learned that I was in the underground in Naroch, he walked all by himself, dressed as a Pole.</span> <span id="s1526">Luckily, he came to the underground.</span> <span id="s1527">He lived in a hut that we provided him.</span> <span id="s1528">He and three, four more people that lived there.</span> <span id="s1529">We provided food for them and safety.</span> <span id="s1530">They knew that they were safe as long as we are in the woods around them.</span> <span id="s1531">And my father lived there until liberation and he was liberated together with me.</span> <span id="s1532">Liberation came.</span> <span id="s1533">There were battles.</span> <span id="s1534">I did not participate in the battles because it was really the big units that it was done, combing through the woods.</span> <span id="s1535">We remained on the base and the last time before liberation some of our closest friends were killed, while they were combing the woods, to put up, to catch some of the Germans that were escaping from the front or something.</span> <span id="s1536">And we lost quite a number of men, and the men that we lost were our close friends.</span> <span id="s1537">There were battles that the Russian Army waged and summer of 1944 we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">03:47:04 We were liberated and we immediately – most of the men were drafted into the army, to the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1539">We – my father and I and Aron asked for permission just to go to Slonim to see somebody survived maybe from his family.</span> <span id="s1540">He was granted the permission.</span> <span id="s1541">In the Soviet Union you couldn't travel as you wished.</span> <span id="s1542">You needed a permit and you had to show the permit everywhere you went.</span> <span id="s1543">We were given the permit and we came to Slonim.</span> <span id="s1544">I knew that I would not find anybody in Slonim but we still had hoped.</span> <span id="s1545">Daddy told me that my little brother was caught on the street, that maybe he survived.</span> <span id="s1546">Maybe he's alive somewhere.</span> <span id="s1547">Maybe he wrote to the house that we lived in Slonim.</span> <span id="s1548">So we came to the house and the man of the house that we lived in was killed by the Nazis because he was a Communist.</span> <span id="s1549">The wife and the two children survived.</span> <span id="s1550">We left a lot of our belongings – when we went to the ghetto – was left there.</span> <span id="s1551">We were absolutely, penniless, without anything to change – anything to wear, only what we had on our backs.</span> <span id="s1552">And we asked to try and give us something that was left in the house that belonged to us.</span> <span id="s1553">The landlady, the woman of the house said, “Nothing at all is left and everything was taken away.”</span> <span id="s1554">The only thing she gave me is a slip, an embroidered slip of my mother's that I treasure ‘til this day.</span> <span id="s1555">It was the only thing that I remained with, the hand‑embroidered slip.</span> <span id="s1556">We left Slonim immediately.</span> <span id="s1557">There were no Jews in Slonim.</span> <span id="s1558">However, I found a note from a cousin of mine that was saved deep in Russia, in Kazakstan, looking for us, if anybody survived from the family.</span> <span id="s1559">So I immediately was able to get in touch with my cousin Harold Brenner that lived, that was still survived in deep in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1560">We left Slonim.</span> <span id="s1561">We stayed in Baranovichi for a short while.</span> <span id="s1562">We were taken in by Jews that survived and all the survivors became like a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">03:49:42 Everybody took in everybody.</span> <span id="s1564">Everybody shared with a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1565">You were so happy that somebody survived, because whoever survived thought that he was the only person that survived – that everybody's killed.</span> <span id="s1566">The joy that you found something.</span> <span id="s1567">I came to Baranovichi and my Hebrew teacher survived and he met us on the street.</span> <span id="s1568">The joy of having Meyer Chalasnowicz survive.</span> <span id="s1569">He took us into his room.</span> <span id="s1570">He shared his food with us.</span> <span id="s1571">And as Poland was liberated, we left the Soviet Union as Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s1572">We were allowed to do it.</span> <span id="s1573">Aron left first on New Year's Day of 1945.</span> <span id="s1574">My father and I followed right after, right after, and we came to Bialystok and in Bialystok there was danger again of being killed, again, after the war by pogroms.</span> <span id="s1575">They talked about pogroms.</span> <span id="s1576">They talked about killing.</span> <span id="s1577">It didn't materialize in Bialystok but it was in other places that we knew.</span> <span id="s1578">And it is in Bialystok that we start searching a way how to get out.</span> <span id="s1579">There must be a way to get out and to get to the West.</span> <span id="s1580">And Aron especially, we met in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s1581">We came right after and Aron had a room, a house, a room in a house and he took us in and we stayed there and Herschel Lipszyc stayed there, and whoever survived from the Grodno guys stayed with us and we were like family, like family.</span> <span id="s1582">What I wanted to add that before we came to Bialystok we went to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1583">We went to Grodno to tell Tadek that we survived.</span> <span id="s1584">When we came to Grodno, my father, Aron and I – Herschel Lipszyc was already in Grodno – and Herschel Lipszyc said, “Well, we came to Grodno.”</span> <span id="s1585">We said, “We came really to tell Tadek that we survived.”</span> <span id="s1586">He said, “Yes, I already talked to him and he knows.”</span> <span id="s1587">He says “imagine.”</span> <span id="s1588">So we made a party.</span> <span id="s1589">A party, really a reunion.</span> <span id="s1590">Tadek came.</span> <span id="s1591">We kissed and we hugged and the men drank.</span> <span id="s1592">There were other people.</span> <span id="s1593">He brought some vodka and there and the men drank, and there were other people, the Jews that survived, that everybody really shared in our joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">03:52:37 And everyone made a tremendous to do over Tadek, to tell him how much we appreciate what he did, even though it was only one night in the chain of events.</span> <span id="s1595">If it weren't for this night, who knows if we would have survived.</span> <span id="s1596">The same goes for the first woman that kept my sister and myself in the couch.</span> <span id="s1597">If it weren't for her, I don't know if I would survive.</span> <span id="s1598">If I would be here to tell you all this.</span> <span id="s1599">Was only one day, and by Tadek it was only one night.</span> <span id="s1600">What are the other nights and the other years that it took to survive?</span> <span id="s1601">Yet, without this chain, were the little link broken, I probably would not maybe be here.</span> <span id="s1602">You needed somebody to give you a helping hand.</span> <span id="s1603">The tragedy was there were not many helping hands, and the ones that helped, again, are the giants in society.</span> <span id="s1604">They had the moral fiber.</span> <span id="s1605">They had the conscience, the feelings.</span> <span id="s1606">They were real people.</span> <span id="s1607">The way I would expect people to do in case of need.</span> <span id="s1608">And in general, to have morality because were the Germans moral, this would not have happened.</span> <span id="s1609">And it is in Bialystok that we began to look a way to come out.</span> <span id="s1610">And again, there were rumors that there is an organization that came, people came from Palestine.</span> <span id="s1611">They're trying to lead the survivors, get the other survivors and see if they can takes them to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1612">This was something sort of unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1613">How could it be possible?</span> <span id="s1614">But you know, after a while we learn that it is true.</span> <span id="s1615">People told us by word of mouth and it wasn't that, really, secretive.</span> <span id="s1616">It wasn't announced in the opening, but neither was it secret because they were very anxious to help.</span> <span id="s1617">And Aron through Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, again contacted the B’richa and with the help of B’richa we start to getting out, to getting out.</span> <span id="s1618">We left Poland.</span> <span id="s1619">My father remained behind for the simple reason that he had still hopes to find my little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">03:55:05 He said, he will stay and see what he can humanly possible to see if he can find his little brother.</span> <span id="s1621">He said already, “I will manage to get to you later.”</span> <span id="s1622">We came to – from Bialystok we came to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1623">In Lublin we met a greater number of young men and women that Aron knew that were members of the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and that were friends of his and his sister's friends.</span> <span id="s1624">And we traveled with them.</span> <span id="s1625">We were given passports as Greek Jews, and we began to travel from Lublin to Kraków, from Kraków we went to Czechoslovakia to Bratislava, from Bratislava we went to Hungary and where ever we went we met by the B’richa.</span> <span id="s1626">They somehow arranged.</span> <span id="s1627">There were other trains.</span> <span id="s1628">The entire European continent, people were traveling in en masse, going home, going home.</span> <span id="s1629">Everybody had a place to go, but the Jews.</span> <span id="s1630">They were going home to Italy, to Czechoslovakia, to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1631">Everywhere people were traveling.</span> <span id="s1632">The trains were full.</span> <span id="s1633">You grabbed on.</span> <span id="s1634">People were hanging on the outside of the boxcars and in the passenger cars.</span> <span id="s1635">There were no tickets.</span> <span id="s1636">People just traveled.</span> <span id="s1637">The Red Cross announced, too that they had facilities, whatever.</span> <span id="s1638">We were given really passports by Red Cross as refugees, and we came to Graz.</span> <span id="s1639">From Hungary we came to Graz and in Graz we had to cross the river, and to cross to get to the western zone of occupied Europe.</span> <span id="s1640">We did it with the help of the B’richa.</span> <span id="s1641">They led us.</span> <span id="s1642">A group before us when to go through to swim through the river.</span> <span id="s1643">Some of them drowned and they decided to hold off and to send the rest of the groups through the Alps.</span> <span id="s1644">And we went through the Alps with leaders that led us.</span> <span id="s1645">And we came to Tarvisio.</span> <span id="s1646">Tarvisio was already Italy.</span> <span id="s1647">It is in Tarvisio that we met up with the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s1648">The Jewish Brigade was part of a Palestinian Jews that volunteered and they had a hard time to be accepted as a unit to the British Army.</span> <span id="s1649">And they were wearing these insignias here, the English insignias, but here on the sleeve they had a Magen David – a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s1650">Can you imagine from wearing the star in the ghetto to come to Tarvisio and to see Palestinian Jews wearing it proudly on their sleeve?</span> <span id="s1651">The transition that it took in us.</span> <span id="s1652">They were absolutely – they did everything humanly possible to do everything for us.</span> <span id="s1653">They fed us to the point where all of us were sick, because we were not accustomed to the rich foods that they tried to feed us.</span> <span id="s1654">And they did everything possible that they could to alleviate our worries.</span> <span id="s1655">I immediately found somebody that knew my sister that came from the town rejoining me, Slovaki (ph) and he was able to send a telegram to my grandmother in America and my aunt and uncle and my aunts and that I survived and my father survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">03:58:54 And we did not stay long in Tarvisio because it was like a detention place.</span> <span id="s1657">Groups were coming and leaving further into the coast, into Italy.</span> <span id="s1658">We went to Bologna.</span> <span id="s1659">From Bologna we didn't stay there long at all.</span> <span id="s1660">We came to Florence, and the first night when we came to Florence we slept in that magnificent Synagogue, but we slept in the Sunday school that was adjoining the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1661">They took the benches that the children used for sitting on, people used for sitting.</span> <span id="s1662">We put the benches and they brought something to lay on top and the first night in Italy we slept in Florence on the benches.</span> <span id="s1663">Besides Tarvisio was Italy too but really already away from it.</span> <span id="s1664">And we were immediately helped by UNRRA by the United Nations, where they gave us food, and we were registered with UNRRA and the struggle started how to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1665">The shores of Palestine were closed and you couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1666">Meanwhile, my family in America contacted me and they very, very much wanted me to come to the United States, even if I don't live there merely to come to see them.</span> <span id="s1667">They wanted to see me.</span> <span id="s1668">And since we could not go to Palestine, we decided to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1669">My uncle and Aron's made affidavits for us to come.</span> <span id="s1670">They send us passage and everything and we came under the Refugee Act in 1947.</span> <span id="s1671">We came out to America.</span> <span id="s1672">We were married in Rome.</span> <span id="s1673">We lived from 1945 to '47, we lived in Florence and in Rome.</span> <span id="s1674">And Aron and I lived with an Italian family, a Christian family in Rome that took us in as a family.</span> <span id="s1675">And we shared our food with them because it was hunger in Italy at this time.</span> <span id="s1676">And we remained close friends until today.</span> <span id="s1677">Shortly we were married in Rome in this magnificent Synagogue with 10 witnesses that we brought with us so the Rabbi could marry us, and we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1678">We came to a loving family that could not do enough for us.</span> <span id="s1679">We settled in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1680">First we came to New York.</span> <span id="s1681">My father's brother and sister lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1682">We visited with them and then we came.</span> <span id="s1683">We stayed for a while in Indianapolis and then we settled in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1684">The families were absolutely wonderful, loving, caring and giving to help us in any possible way.</span> <span id="s1685">We had a wonderful life and we're so grateful, because we raised three sons that are wonderful human beings – Howard, Gordon and Daniel –that are married.</span> <span id="s1686">We have three lovely daughter‑in‑laws; Barbara, Carol and Miriam.</span> <span id="s1687">And we have eight magnificent grandchildren; Courtney, 17, that is a Merit Scholar on the way to college.</span> <span id="s1688">Lindsey, charming and beautiful and lovely and giving, that told me they went on Thanksgiving Day to serve the hungry dinner, and the homeless.</span> <span id="s1689">Ari, Benji and Yalie, the joy, all of them.</span> <span id="s1690">Evan, bright, wonderful.</span> <span id="s1691">Rachel, beautiful, gorgeous to look at, and Gabie, our little Gabriel that is going to be two years old in December.</span> <span id="s1692">We tried to instill in them consciousness, good values, morality.</span> <span id="s1693">And our sons are physicians, try to prolong human lives, not to take away human lives.</span> <span id="s1694">Try to help.</span> <span id="s1695">Aron and I are both very active with the Holocaust Memorial Foundation in Skokie.</span> <span id="s1696">I am the chairperson of the speakers bureau and I truly do what I think I can do to see as a survivor that this never happens to any people on earth.</span> <span id="s1697">I feel only by education and only by perpetuating what we experienced and what we know to leave a legacy for future generations to come.</span> <span id="s1698">And I very much felt that this Museum really, truly will do the job when we will not be here anymore.</span> <span id="s1699">This is why we came and we want to give this testimony so it remains for generations to come.</span> <span id="s1700">For that, I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Thank
