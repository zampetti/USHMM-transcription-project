id="s4">Let’s start with your father.</span> <span id="s5">Would you tell me your father’s full name and his date of birth and where he was born, and anything you might know about his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: My father’s name was Abraham Soep, the Dutch word for soup, which was not a nice name to go out with as a child, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s7">He was born on April 17, 1892.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Anything else?</span> <span id="s9">Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I don’t know too much about his childhood.</span> <span id="s11">I know that his mother was very young when she married.</span> <span id="s12">His father started a diamond factory which was built, I guess with money from his father.</span> <span id="s13">Before that as far as I know, they were cigar makers.</span> <span id="s14">They were out of poor Ashkenazi background.</span> <span id="s15">But the diamond factory was a success and they became well to do later.</span> <span id="s16">My grandmother I remember very well.</span> <span id="s17">She was a very wise person but very uneducated.</span> <span id="s18">She had an inner wisdom but she didn’t know much about anything.</span> <span id="s19">My grandfather died when I was four so I don’t remember him too well.</span> <span id="s20">I think he was quite a bit more intelligent.</span> <span id="s21">My father was the oldest.</span> <span id="s22">He was born ten years after his parents were married.</span> <span id="s23">They couldn’t have children.</span> <span id="s24">They adopted or took in a niece, a sister of my grandfather had one child after the other and did not know how to take care of them, so they took one of those children as a child, who I consider my aunt and my father who was born after ten years of marriage after the adoption, considered her his sister.</span> <span id="s25">She was quite a bit older.</span> <span id="s26">Then they had four other children who all died before age one for different reasons.</span> <span id="s27">One had diphtheria, another was dropped by somebody else and horrible stories that never really was talked about because in those days a lot of people lost a lot of children.</span> <span id="s28">And then my uncle was born who was ten years younger than my father.</span> <span id="s29">His name was Hans Soep and he was a very sickly child.</span> <span id="s30">They thought they were going to lose him, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s31">Where my father was this tall, broad heavy person.</span> <span id="s32">My uncle was the opposite.</span> <span id="s33">He was small and very small boned and small build.</span> <span id="s34">They got along well.</span> <span id="s35">My uncle looked up to my father a lot and really was always a little bit in the shadow.</span> <span id="s36">He went into business, after schooling he went into business with my father, as a partner, or a junior partner.</span> <span id="s37">My father had three years of high school, which at that time was really quite a bit.</span> <span id="s38">It was an official three-year course high school and after he finished he went into business with his father.</span> <span id="s39">His father died at the age of 64 and his mother died in the beginning of the war in 1942, I think.</span> <span id="s40">What else do you want to know about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: I think we have most of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A My mother was from a family of six children.</span> <span id="s43">She was born on December 8, 1895, her name is Toni Fredrika Kauffman was her maiden name.</span> <span id="s44">Everybody called her Toni.</span> <span id="s45">She came from a very liberal family.</span> <span id="s46">My father came from an orthodox family, but when he married my father, she became a dutiful kosher housewife and later on took an interest in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s47">She took Hebrew lessons conversation lessons to learn the language.</span> <span id="s48">Her parents were German but they had moved to Holland in the 1880’s and the six children were all born in Holland.</span> <span id="s49">The oldest one, I think, in ’87, and there was a span of twenty years between the oldest and the youngest.</span> <span id="s50">One of my aunts is still alive and lives in Israel, the youngest one who is going to be 85 in May.</span> <span id="s51">And we are all going to Israel, all the nieces and nephews that are still there for a reunion.</span> <span id="s52">.</span> <span id="s53">She was a dutiful housewife, it was a very good marriage, but my father was a very dominant person, not of many words but his whole being was a little authoritarian.</span> <span id="s54">But my mother was perfectly happy in her role and not until after he died, which was in 1953, and she lived until 1980, not until a few years after he died did she become her own person and showed a lot more personality and initiative and everything than I had ever seen before.</span> <span id="s55">We were on very good terms all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: How was she as a mother when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, when we were growing up she was, you know, like a mother should be.</span> <span id="s58">Very nurturing, but we lived in a fairly big house and we had two maids and one of them was more or less what they call a “kinder fraulein.”</span> <span id="s59">They all came from Germany.</span> <span id="s60">They took care of the children.</span> <span id="s61">And there was a cleaning woman and there was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s62">There were a lot of people to take care of us.</span> <span id="s63">My father traveled a lot because in the diamond business he went every other week to Belgium to sell.</span> <span id="s64">Once a month to England, to London, to buy.</span> <span id="s65">He was on lots of committees, so my mother was often alone with us.</span> <span id="s66">But she was kind of a, she doesn’t stand out in my mind as a child.</span> <span id="s67">I always used to say as a child, I’m not being brought up I’m just growing up by myself.</span> <span id="s68">I felt kind of independent, I guess, from my young years on.</span> <span id="s69">But not realizing it I probably wasn’t, but it seemed that way.</span> <span id="s70">But she was very sweet.</span> <span id="s71">Everybody loved her.</span> <span id="s72">She was a real lady.</span> <span id="s73">She looked like a lady, and she was cultured.</span> <span id="s74">She came from a cultured background than my father.</span> <span id="s75">She was fond of music, she played the piano quite nicely.</span> <span id="s76">She spoke beautifully French.</span> <span id="s77">My father took an interest later in music and became very musically inclined.</span> <span id="s78">I think he played the violin when he was a young boy so there must have been something there already.</span> <span id="s79">They traveled quite a bit without us, which we resented when we were children.</span> <span id="s80">When we used to complain, my mother used to say in a German expression which her mother used to say to her, you just travel with your own husband.</span> <span id="s81">That’s about all I can say about my mother from the early years.</span> <span id="s82">About my sister, she is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: In that case, I need to talk to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Do it yourself.</span> <span id="s85">She has lots and lots of problems.</span> <span id="s86">I don’t think they relate to the war.</span> <span id="s87">She’s been a problem her whole life.</span> <span id="s88">She doesn’t have a very happy present life.</span> <span id="s89">She lives in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s90">She’s a very strong, determined person, but it’s lots of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Can we go on a talk about these two friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, let’s talk about these two friends.</span> <span id="s93">One of them Rudi Acohen who was really my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s94">I met him when he was 13 and I was 12.</span> <span id="s95">We lived next to each other during the summer at the summer resort.</span> <span id="s96">Our parents had rented homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What was the name of that resort?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Zandvoort and it’s very close to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s99">My father commuted every day from business by car, because the chauffeur came and picked him up and brought him.</span> <span id="s100">That’s what was done in those days.</span> <span id="s101">He also went to Montessori High School, but a different one from mine, and I remember hearing his name when in June ’35 we went to visit our Montessori High School for the first time just for orientation and everybody’s name was mentioned.</span> <span id="s102">I thought what a strange name this boy has.</span> <span id="s103">And then we went a few weeks later to Zandvoort and who lives next door, the boy with the strange name, and we were very crazy about each other, even when that young, and you know, like children are we played together.</span> <span id="s104">We played ball, we went to the dunes, we went swimming and then he was in my class for several years and then he was transferred to another school.</span> <span id="s105">He wasn’t entirely a good student and couldn’t stay in our school.</span> <span id="s106">But I stayed very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s107">Actually ‘til he was arrested also in a raid.</span> <span id="s108">Again a reprisal raid in July ’42, just before the deportation started.</span> <span id="s109">Also a German soldier had been killed and they emptied that whole street of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s110">One very long street, very nice residential street, went in every home where there were Jews and arrested them.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Do you know what year Rudi was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s113">His birthday was June 4, and he was born in 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did he have any other interests, did he have musical interests?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No.</span> <span id="s116">He also played tennis and he played the violin, he had violin lessons.</span> <span id="s117">He liked popular music, records.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you remember any in particular, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, we listened a lot to French songs, like Charles Trunet (?)</span> <span id="s120">You probably don’t even know that name.</span> <span id="s121">He was very popular then, and also Austrian songs like Marta Keller, I think that was her name.</span> <span id="s122">No, that was not her name.</span> <span id="s123">We listened to American songs.</span> <span id="s124">Frank Sinatra was big.</span> <span id="s125">We played a lot of classical records.</span> <span id="s126">We had an old fashioned player.</span> <span id="s127">For his Bar Mitzvah he got a record player, you know, that you turned a handle to play, and we played a lot of classical music.</span> <span id="s128">What else?</span> <span id="s129">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s130">We did what young people do.</span> <span id="s131">We went on trips, bike trips and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s132">He was caught in one of those raids and that was the end of him.</span> <span id="s133">The day after he was arrested, he was sent on o Auschwitz or wherever.</span> <span id="s134">I never heard from him.</span> <span id="s135">With his parents and his brother.</span> <span id="s136">I even went in a day or two after because I worked for the Jewish Council in that department that was called Aids to Departing People and I was able to send some stuff to Westerbork because most people stayed.</span> <span id="s137">But later on I heard they weren’t even there.</span> <span id="s138">And, of course, he never came back.</span> <span id="s139">And I didn’t know that at the time during all those years, all of the sudden he might be back.</span> <span id="s140">He was young and everything, of course we realized that he probably didn’t live three days afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What month was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: It was June 1942 and it was just after his birthday.</span> <span id="s143">It was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s144">And I am trying to look back, his birthday was on June 4, 1942 and whatever the Sunday was after that; I think it was June 9th, it was that date.</span> <span id="s145">He had just turned 20.</span> <span id="s146">He had a younger brother who was very, very bright and very, very musical, was about three or four years younger than him.</span> <span id="s147">Of course, he went, his parents, everybody.</span> <span id="s148">And then, after that I had some sort of a boyfriend, his name was Hans Rudelshim, and he was born in Kampen, which was near ___________, __________.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know when his birthday was.</span> <span id="s150">He was very interesting.</span> <span id="s151">He went into hiding a lot.</span> <span id="s152">His father was a tailor, and he was a good tailor too.</span> <span id="s153">AS a matter of fact he remodeled some sports clothes of my father for my sister and me into skirts and little top and he was also a very gifted pianist and he took some piano lessons from a blind Hungarian pianist who lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s154">Was also caught in Holland and who used to practice when he couldn’t play concerts anymore.</span> <span id="s155">He used to give house concerts of the piano and he practiced at my parents’ house.</span> <span id="s156">We had a grand piano.</span> <span id="s157">And he got to know this friend of mine and he taught and gave him lessons</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Do you know what year Hans was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I think probably also in 1922, it may have been ’21.</span> <span id="s160">He may have been a year older, and he had to leave Kampen ________, like all the people from the Provinces were sent.</span> <span id="s161">He looked very Jewish.</span> <span id="s162">He dyed his hair blond and went into hiding and did all kinds of reckless things, traveled and went everywhere.</span> <span id="s163">And, of course, they were betrayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Do you know when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I don’t know exactly when that was.</span> <span id="s166">We were still in our house and we left there in May ’43, so it must have been February or March ’43.</span> <span id="s167">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s168">Never heard a word.</span> <span id="s169">He was sent away.</span> <span id="s170">And then this other picture here is of a young man named Gideon, we called him in Dutch, it’s called “Chideon”, and we called him “Chi.”</span> <span id="s171">He was from a very prominent Dutch gentile family.</span> <span id="s172">They were originally Huguenots, therefore the French name.</span> <span id="s173">We were very good friends.</span> <span id="s174">We were in the same grade.</span> <span id="s175">He was a very good friend of my boyfriend, Rudi .</span> <span id="s176">In the very beginning I hear of the Dutch National Socialist Movement in the early ‘30’s, a lot of people became members of this Nazi group.</span> <span id="s177">Even Jews, because they thought, you know, it was a good system and very orderly and everything.</span> <span id="s178">Before we knew all the stuff that was going to happen, but his family eventually, of course, totally abandoned this and they were very, very good and had many Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s179">He went into the Resistance and hid Jews.</span> <span id="s180">His father was sent away and died in, I think it was Buchenwald or Dachau, one of the two.</span> <span id="s181">His mother was in Ravensbruck, survived, came back a wreck and lived for quite a few years as a wreck, and never really got over all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Can you tell us anything about either Gideon or Hans, or both, and Rudi, what were they like?</span> <span id="s183">What was their personalities like?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, you know when you grow up together as children you don’t delve that much in the personalities or whatever.</span> <span id="s185">He was just also not the greatest of students, but a very sweet guy and fun.</span> <span id="s186">We had a lot of fun together.</span> <span id="s187">We were young, we had parties.</span> <span id="s188">We organized our own parties.</span> <span id="s189">We decided whether we would go formal to this party or should we go another way.</span> <span id="s190">Everybody brought their best records and we played and we danced.</span> <span id="s191">We had very happy teenage years.</span> <span id="s192">It was mostly for fun.</span> <span id="s193">Although I do remember though once we were in high school that we had very deep conversation subject about the incarnation or vivisection, you know, experiments on animals.</span> <span id="s194">Who was for and who was against.</span> <span id="s195">You know, like teenagers who go to a decent school do.</span> <span id="s196">But it was mostly just friends together all the time.</span> <span id="s197">I spent really all my years in high school with my friends rather than with my family.</span> <span id="s198">We did our homework, but it had to be done quick because then we would get together and play records and talk and have fun.</span> <span id="s199">Of course girls were involved.</span> <span id="s200">He had a girlfriend too.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Hans, how did he fit in with the circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: No, Hans really didn’t move to Amsterdam until the war was already on, and his uncle was a physician in Amsterdam and they were the best friends of Rudi’s parents.</span> <span id="s203">So I knew him really through Rudi.</span> <span id="s204">And then Rudi was deported, you know, he went after me, because he liked me from the beginning.</span> <span id="s205">So somehow that’s how all these people fit in.</span> <span id="s206">I mean these are just three of them.</span> <span id="s207">I showed you a little tennis picture, there were several more we were always together with.</span> <span id="s208">These were really after school friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What was Rudi like?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather simple kind of guy, I think.</span> <span id="s211">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s212">I sometimes wonder what would he have been or become.</span> <span id="s213">He was as I said he didn’t have very good head for learning, but his father was a stockbroker and I think he could have become that too.</span> <span id="s214">He was interested in business and everything.</span> <span id="s215">But there wasn’t much time for development yet.</span> <span id="s216">You know, we were both 16 when the war broke out in Europe and 17 when Holland was invaded.</span> <span id="s217">We were kids.</span> <span id="s218">I mean even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are much more sophisticated than we were, but even they are little kids, while they know more of what goes on in the world, you know, with television.</span> <span id="s219">We didn’t have television, of course.</span> <span id="s220">We didn’t have a radio in the house until I was 14.</span> <span id="s221">If I wanted to hear children’s programs on the radio, I walked 25 minutes to my grandmother’s every Tuesday afternoon to hear children’s programs.</span> <span id="s222">We were not really spoiled kids.</span> <span id="s223">It wasn’t that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Is there anything else?</span> <span id="s225">I know I’ve picked your brain and put you through the wringer.</span> <span id="s226">Is there anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: There’s probably a million things I can add, you have to stop somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
