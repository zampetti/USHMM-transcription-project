religious.</span> <span id="s161">But you know, wanted that the kids, you know, be religious.</span> <span id="s162">I myself, you know, I – I – I served as a – as a altar boy, and – but I was not too religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What kind of atmosphere do you remember from your family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s167">Although we were – we were not rich.</span> <span id="s168">The father did not make much money, and the mother was working too; she was working in bakery.</span> <span id="s169">On market days she was selling baked goods, some – some – some baker.</span> <span id="s170">And so they – they – they – little struggle.</span> <span id="s171">But we, as kids, I remember that one ladies, when I met later, said, you kids, you were so nice dressed, that the best dressed kids is Jurkus family.</span> <span id="s172">Because the mother was kind of

three I remember, that that taxi was rented for the bapt-baptist of my younger sister.</span> <span id="s318">This was something.</span> <span id="s319">So – and then there were – there were some – some people that they had the private opel(ph) cars.</span> <span id="s320">And then there was the grafas, th – th –</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: The grafas is the Count.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s325">He had the old – old car, and when he used to drive, we kids, we wou – used to run after.</span> <span id="s326">But the speed was that we were even faster than –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Than the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: – th-the car.</span> <span id="s329">And then after I – ’38, he acquired a new car from America.</span> <span id="s330">That was, I think

<p><span id="s340">Q: I see, so he wasn’t somebody the kids would –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: That’s i – my subjective opinion.</span> <span id="s342">And then, when the – we were – I kno – you

id="s349">Q: Cause it’s – I’m – excuse me for interrupting for a second.</span> <span id="s350">It’s very unusual that there would be a town in Lithuania that has 7,000 people, that would also have somebody who is truly from the old aristocracy, the Polish-Lithuanian aristocracy.</span> <span id="s351">Not every town had such members.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yeah, but that – that was a – considered a big one.</span> <span id="s353">They had the ponds, they had their – their own electricity.</span> <span id="s354">They had the big – and these were like serfs, all over.</span> <span id="s355">He controlled that, and there was the palace.</span> <span id="s356">Now they have [indecipherable] and – and museum and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: So the town had a palace?</span> <span id="s358">The town had a manor?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s360">The skabatches(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Okay, so he had actually –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: They never stayed in winter, they used to go to Germany, I assume.</span> <span id="s363">And when the – when the – the first occupation, Soviet occupation, he was chased out, he left, and it was occupied by Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So his house, his estate, was taken over?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, were taken over, the – the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: But let’s – before we get to the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: – let’s just stay in pre-war Kretinga a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yeah, pre-war.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So you have Count, Grafas di Skabatches(ph), who sounds to me like probably the – the – the highest ranking, if there is a high ranking person –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: He – He was a – he – I would say so subjectively, that he was probably – considered himself higher than [speaks Lithuanian] tha – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: District –</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: The region – the region director.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And was the regional director like a mayor, or was he –</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, may – no, mayor of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: But [indecipherable] was.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So was even higher than the mayor.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s380">That comprised Polanga, Kartena and all around, that was like a – like Siauliai, like Taluciai, so-something like that.</span> <span id="s381">And so that is my opinion, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did he have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: He – he had the children.</span> <span id="s384">He had the – I think two sons and one – and one daughter.</span> <span id="s385">I cou – I could go later, you know, how we interfaced with that – with the daughter, but that was already after – after the Germans occupied us.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And do you know whether or not they spoke – what language they spoke amongst themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Not Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s388">Not Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s389">But I thought that he knew Lithuanian, but the documents which – when Soviet Union took over there aur – Russians took over the palace, some parts were transported to Kretingos muziejus, Kretinga museum, like music – mu – written music, and some other items, which nobody took.</span> <span id="s390">They were delivered to mus – museum, where we happened to live, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s392">So, did you live in the center of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Wa – not exactly center, little bit – little bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: – further on a – on a east –

east, south.</span> <span id="s398">And probably we go later –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: – because I have mentioned in my – in my article, how the ci-city consisted.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Were – was it such that within Kretinga – ah, I know what I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s404">What was the main economic basis for life in Kretinga?</span> <span id="s405">You mentioned that the Count had an estate and that people worked there.</span> <span id="s406">Did – did that estate produce anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: They produced for the – for – for the Duke, for the grafas, and they were very independent.</span> <span id="s408">He sold the goods, and whoever worked there, they had no land, no nothing, just work.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Well, what kind of goods were produced?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Crop.</span> <span id="s411">Vegetables –</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Agricultural [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s415">So the estate was self-sustaining?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Self-sustaining.</span> <span id="s417">E-Exactly the same like the Catholic church.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Also self-sus –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: It was a big Catholic church, it was a cloister, it was a seminary.</span> <span id="s420">They were independent, too.</span> <span id="s421">They – actually they – you could say now that were three entities.</span> <span id="s422">There was the ci – the town, the church and the grafas.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s424">Well, that’s unusual.</span> <span id="s425">Not every town would have so many – you know, would have –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s428">And the town itself, what was the economic basis for the town?</span> <span id="s429">They – what did the town –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: There –

id="s433">Bricks.</span> <span id="s434">The brick factory was a big one.</span> <span id="s435">And then agriculture.</span> <span id="s436">All around the town there were that – farmers, who lived in a – in a town, but had the land all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Well tell me then now – let’s go to another aspect of life; and that would be the different groups and nationalities.</span> <span id="s438">We already mentioned a little bit that the – the Count, or the Duke was high nobility and the family did not speak Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s439">How would you describe the nationalities that lived in the town, was there more than one?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: There were –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: – tell me wa – about those.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: – that – the – the first wa – the Lithuanians –</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: – that I already mentioned, the grafas.</span> <span id="s447">There was out of – they did not participate in any events with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: With Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s450">Then the second was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Was a big, big

synagogues.</span> <span id="s457">School.</span> <span id="s458">Grammar school, and stores.</span> <span id="s459">And drugstore, or two drugstores, at one time.</span> <span id="s460">And the part was, their part was west, and south.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: That’s where most of the Jewish community lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s463">All told they – they were – all were with stores, all manufacturing stores, and competing with – you know, with the Lithuanian stores.</span> <span id="s464">Now, that was a Jewish.</span> <span id="s465">The second was Lutheran Protestants.</span> <span id="s466">They had their church on the west side – on the east side of – of that – of the one square.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Were there many Lutherans in

what – how would you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Lutherans.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: But Prussay(ph) would probably mean Prussian, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Prussian, but this – we-were called in Lithuania, even that, who was a Lutheran Evangelical.</span> <span id="s475">It was Prussas(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So that meant – does that meant

id="s774">But with the father, about the violin, about the instruments, and how he used to tell what Mortkas(ph) is telling.</span> <span id="s775">A – Mortkas(ph) was probably more educated, and he used to give hints to my father.</span> <span id="s776">I know that one time, he wa – already ending that, he had to take the head off of that, and make another head.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: For the violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Wi – yeah, only because Mortkas(ph) found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: So their – okay, so in other words, did they have a friendly

angry that he stopped sometimes.</span> <span id="s791">Jewish people I have not seen drunk.</span> <span id="s792">So that – we knew that.</span> <span id="s793">And so – but the Lithuanians used to [indecipherable] to drink.</span> <span id="s794">And we, the kids, we – we didn’t had much.</span> <span id="s795">Playing, I know that my friends used to play there, because they lived together.</span> <span id="s796">There was a Jewish family living – couple Jewish families on – on the Kestucio gatvės.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Mm-hm, Kestucio Street.</span></p> <p><span

us, the kids, to slaughter their chickens, because they couldn’t do that themselves.</span> <span id="s807">So they say, hey, come on and make that.</span> <span id="s808">And I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Have you slaughtered a chicken?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I have not, but my friends there, they did.</span> <span id="s811">They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Oh,

take that – that as – as – as cruel or so.</span> <span id="s814">And then – and th-that was the same – the same backyard, with Petrauskas(ph).</span> <span id="s815">And Petrauskas(ph) were Lutheran.</span> <span id="s816">Lutheran communicated much better with – with – with the Jewish than the Catholics.</span> <span id="s817">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Why would you say – why would that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: The religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: You think, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Religion.</span> <span id="s822">Religion is the – you see, I’m [indecipherable] Katalikas and I – from the beginning I – I – very early I recognized that the religion is very detrimental to our relationship with every – everyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: How sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: How very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Because that is – that – that’s – that – you cannot associate.</span> <span id="s827">My first wife was Lutheran, my daughters are Lutheran, and my cousin said, I cannot be cuma(ph), I cannot be godfather.</span> <span id="s828">He went to priest and asked, the priest said no way.</span> <span id="s829">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s830">But that was later, now, in the United States –</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q:

things that sounded bi –</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Altar boy I was until ’37 - ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: So you were 10 - 11, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Altar boy.</span> <span id="s840">Because everybody was, my best friend was, they were very religious you know, to go in a – in a – in a evening mac – evening s-service, which I didn’t want to go, and father did not – or mother did not push me.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: So

know that the father and friends used to talk.</span> <span id="s1014">They used to talk politics, and even argue.</span> <span id="s1015">We had relatives in Klaipeda [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1016">My mother’s sister was married with a Grigolyte(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And what’s that?</span> <span id="s1018">Who’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: That the name, Grigolyte(ph).</span> <span id="s1020">And he was very much Nazi.</span> <span id="s1021">And I remember that, even that – the Smetonas(ph) like I – ’39, before the Hitler took over, he used to argue with my father – my father.</span> <span id="s1022">They were already their time.</span> <span id="s1023">And my mother’s sister suffered very much.</span> <span id="s1024">They didn’t speak Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1025">In Klaipeda, in that time, the kids were almost the same age like my family, and they really – and I used to – we used to go to Klaipeda very often.</span> <span id="s1026">You know, Klaipeda was the – the – that was the city of – of envy.</span> <span id="s1027">Everything was in Klaipeda.</span> <span id="s1028">Even the smell was the – the factory smell was g – was good, the smell.</span> <span id="s1029">And I used to argue with that – that villis(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: My cousin.</span> <span id="s1032">He was a year older, and we used to sleep in one bed and kick each other, one for Smetona, one for Hitler.</span> <span id="s1033">That time I already knew Germany, what is going in Germany, because Klaipeda was very much for Adolf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Tell me, how far was Klaipeda from Kretinga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: 24 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: So it’s like 15 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Isn’t it something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Oh, what – half an hour with the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Half an hour with the train.</span> <span id="s1041">So, very close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: And what kind of a city?</span> <span id="s1044">Tell us a little bit about the city of Klaipeda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Was a harbor city.</span> <span id="s1046">Was fisherman city.</span> <span id="s1047">Was – everything was subsidized by Smetona.</span> <span id="s1048">Smetona give so much money to every Nazi, to appease them.</span> <span id="s1049">And even the Grigolytes(ph) got the place, new house.</span> <span id="s1050">So that was – was odd thing going, what Smetona did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Well, do you know about those policies?</span> <span id="s1052">I don’t know anything about them, what were these monetary policies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Well, because they – Klaipeda –</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: – for Lithuania was like a punishment for all intelligentsia when they – in Kaunas they do not fit.</span> <span id="s1056">So they will – will send to Klaipeda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: You mean if you’re a government official?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: A government official, a professor or teacher, or some other activist against Smetona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: They – they sort of exiled them to Klaiped –</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: They exiled to Klaipeda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And why is it a punishment?</span> <span id="s1062">Why would it be a punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Because Klaipeda was little bit odd.</span> <span id="s1064">Klaipeda was not Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1065">Was more German.</span> <span id="s1066">The culture, everything.</span> <span id="s1067">Lutheran.</span> <span id="s1068">All of Klaipeda was Lutheran.</span> <span id="s1069">So that’s my – that’s my – that I – I didn’t mean anything – that’s my impression, and I think I am right.</span> <span id="s1070">There were the – the – the – a friction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: So was it German Lithuanian friction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: The German, Memelland.</span> <span id="s1073">Memel – [indecipherable] minor Lithuanian friction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Because the Lithuanians, they do not accept the kla – the Memellander as a full Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And why wouldn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1079">And is that why they were more pro-Nazi than Memellander?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: And then many, many –</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: – Klaipeda ci – Klaipeda citizens were sympathizing with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1083">Hitler promised many, many things, and it was easy for him to take over the Klaipeda 1939, what was March, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Do you remember that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Oh, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Where were you when it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I was in Lithuania, but I think I was in Klaipeda not lo – not long before that.</span> <span id="s1088">Klaipeda was – because we had the relatives, we always associate, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: So, you – do you remember the day when you heard Hitler took over?</span> <span id="s1090">Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Oh, you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Oh, the day I don’t remember, but to – it was uproar in a – in a – all Lithuania, especially in Kretinga.</span> <span id="s1094">There were exodus from all the Lithuanians, who ran with the buses, with cars, with – with horses, ran to Kre-Kretinga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: So you had this onslaught of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And did they tell you about what was going on?</span> <span id="s1098">Did they tell stories of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: We knew that.</span> <span id="s1100">We knew that, we didn’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: What did you hear, what did you know?</span> <span id="s1102">Because we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: So that Hitler took over Lithuania, part of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1104">That’s like – like Polish and Vilnius, exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1105">We in school – you know, in school in ’37 - ’38, we were already enlightened about the politics with Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1106">Every morning in – in grammar school, we stand up, we look at east, and we say [speaks Lithuanian].</span> <span id="s1107">We will not be satisfied without Vilnius.</span> <span id="s1108">So with Klaipeda, when Klaipeda was taken over, Klaipeda is ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And yet it was taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: It was taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: And what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: And my mother’s brother stayed there.</span> <span id="s1113">And then repat – repatriated when then was exchange between Lithuanians who were German descent went to Germany, there was th-the – the treaty between Soviet Union and Hitler –</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Okay, tell us a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: – where they exchanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Well see, I don’t understand any of that.</span> <span id="s1117">Please explain it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1119">It was 1940 - ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Already Hitler took – no, 1940.</span> <span id="s1122">1940, when the first Soviet occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: At one time, Germany agreed with Soviet Union, they will exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Exchange what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: The Lithuanians from Klaipeda or from Germany, who are Lithuanians patriots, want to come – [break] – Lithuania back, who stayed there.</span> <span id="s1127">They didn’t like the Hitler regime, they wanted to come to – to Lithuania, and the Lithuanians, whoever knew what the Soviet Union brought us, they claimed that they are Lutherans, they are Germans, they claim that they have relatives someplace, and they could prove to the Soviet government, they were let out.</span> <span id="s1128">And that was the exchange, repatriation, what you call in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1129">And my mother’s brother, Tarmynas(ph), came from Klaipeda to Kretinga.</span> <span id="s1130">And then he was – because then he was trusted Soviet citizen, let’s say, he was given a position in kedainai(ph) or someplace.</span> <span id="s1131">And we say, why do you do that?</span> <span id="s1132">He couldn’t understand, he didn’t want to live under Hitler.</span> <span id="s1133">But we knew already that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: So you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: There are two devils; one is brown, one is red.</span> <span id="s1136">And to choose between two devils, you rather would choose the brown.</span> <span id="s1137">That time, really I’m not lying, that time was already evident that the Soviet Union was cruel.</span> <span id="s1138">Because immediately, you remember, when they took the – immediately they de-deported so many people and everything, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Okay, we’ve gotten ahead of ourselves a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Oh yeah, little bit, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: But – so the first time that I sense that their – that this world that you describe to me in Klaipeda has a huge change, is when Hitler takes over Memel and klai – the first time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: – yeah, that Kretinga, the world that you lived in gets changed, is when Hitler takes over the port city of Memel and klai – Memel and German Klaipeda, and Lithuanian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: – and there’s an exodus of Lithuanians coming to Kretinga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: The first exodus –</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: The first exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: – before Hitler’s army marched in, they knew that they will march in that and that day, so that all the Lithuanians, where they could, they got everything – they could take everything what they wanted, they went to Lithuanian side because they knew that after Hitler will take over, or that Germany will take over, that you have no choice then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Okay, so here’s another question, when those Lithuanians came, and I said, well what did they say, and you – you said, well, that Germany’s taken over, I’m going after more of, let’s say their experiences, their details, where they were, did they have discrimination in work, did they ha – were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: On what time?</span> <span id="s1151">What – what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Before Hitler takes over ger – Klaipeda, what was the experience of the Lithuanians living in Klaipeda –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: In Klaipeda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Yeah, with Germans who were so pro-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: That there was division already in the town.</span> <span id="s1156">There was already, probably year before, was known for politicians that Klaipeda will be taken away because the war around, they were taking Czechoslovakia, they’re taking there and there and there, that Klaipeda will fall anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: It was known.</span> <span id="s1159">What the people there – and there were already th-the Lithuanians were discriminating – the Germans were discriminating, the Lithuanians already in Smetona’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: A – not talking Lithuanian in stores, and the government was quite dominated by – by German – by [indecipherable] that – that means the – the administrators.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1163">What about – did you hear about how Jews were being treated in Klaipeda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1165">Ma – I think that Jews had better time in Klaipeda than probably in Lithuania in – in the gross Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: In larger Lithuania, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Because Jews integrated very, very nice with the Germans, because they speak the language – they spoke the language.</span> <span id="s1168">Now, you would not recognize, is he a Jew, or is he a – a German, because they spoke perfect German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: But when Hitler came, was there a change there?</span> <span id="s1170">Did you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Oh definite – definitely there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: There was – I – I think every Jew ran out.</span> <span id="s1176">Oh, I don’t think that anyone – anyone stayed.</span> <span id="s1177">They knew what – what is to become.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: They knew that, th-there’s no – no – there is no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: And do you know how Jews in Kretinga were reacting to all of these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: With fear.</span> <span id="s1182">With fear.</span> <span id="s1183">It was – we knew that – and I think that the grown-ups knew already that – that wartime, that we will not exist from one, or from another.</span> <span id="s1184">From one side or another si – east or west.</span> <span id="s1185">But we kids, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1186">We kids, we didn’t know, we just sensed that there is a tension, there is a tension, there is a tension.</span> <span id="s1187">The parents always talk, what will happen to the kids, what will happen to us, how they will live, how they – how their future is.</span> <span id="s1188">Like always they – they are elderly, they are

1940, we knew.</span> <span id="s1227">And when we saw the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1228">There is so much written about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Yeah, but tell us, tell us what you

didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1302">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did he say anything about it when he came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: He didn’t talk much, he said he was interviewed, everything was fine, because he spoke with Russian.</span> <span id="s1305">He could express himself in the – yeah.</span> <span id="s1306">I’m not against you, I’m just a working man and

Šventoji.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Šventoji.</span> <span id="s1746">We – we spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: But th-that was you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Some – some couldn’t even walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Okay, what I want to know is, is it because there were leaders who were telling you you have to go here, you have to go here, or was there mass

getting – and it’s a very macabre, also horrifying sense, but there’s this juxtaposition – you talk about yourself as a young boy as being very curious, you know, that you like to go out into – into the town, into the – into the area, kind of see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2160">And – and you’re 13 years old, 14 years old when – when you see the – the remnants of what the Soviet prison had, and you see this hand, and you see the chains.</span> <span id="s2161">How much of the – were you frightened, or were you more intrigued, or were you terrified?</span> <span id="s2162">How did

id="s2166">Although, I had the feeling that if you inflict pain to somebody else, think about yourself.</span> <span id="s2167">How would you like if somebody takes you with the hand, and turns around?</span> <span id="s2168">I was always aware, cognizance of that – that I don’t want inflict pain to anyone, because I know that it will hurt me.</span> <span id="s2169">So that I was just indifferent looking.</span> <span id="s2170">And I was not alone, there were some other people.</span> <span id="s2171">Sunday they go and look, because that – the Germans encouraged us, or the – the local government encouraged, look what the Soviets has – have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2174">And that was like a

i-imprisoned.</span> <span id="s2231">You see how that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Same place.</span> <span id="s2234">Now they said people come

Jewish cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: So they’re ordered to do so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: They were ordered.</span> <span id="s2329">And we knew that – that – that in the morning early, we were – [break] – we were there already looking.</span> <span id="s2330">What – what they – how they will do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span

id="s2340">He wanted to choke.</span> <span id="s2341">Now I am thinking that could be true, because in the evening, we saw some breathing, but we didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2342">I – I saw some – some like breathing.</span> <span id="s2343">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: The evening before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Even before, in the evening.</span></p>

him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: Well – well, yeah, to choke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: Or reflex or whatever –</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: I was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: There was a rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: But I did – did – deducted or detected –</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: The – only – only I, that yes, we saw that one was – or two were breathing, were still alive, although was already put in that with all the lime and – and everything.</span> <span id="s2360">That could have been.</span> <span id="s2361">That could have been.</span> <span id="s2362">But this is – the fact can tell only that the farmer who was – no – and – and that was – was quite – and the city was terrible – terrible atmosphere in the city, and – and just depressed, people depressed.</span> <span id="s2363">People could not believe that the Germans could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: And were they – did they talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: They talked just – just very mute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Very quietly then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Very quietly.</span> <span id="s2368">They – they didn’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s2369">Nobody wants to talk about anything that time.</span> <span id="s2370">The kids, we talked that we saw that and that and so on.</span> <span id="s2371">Now, that time when they ended, they announced that next Sunday the same.</span> <span id="s2372">Now, not to extend th-the story, next Sunday was the same.</span> <span id="s2373">The same people down.</span> <span id="s2374">There is an-another probably 30.</span> <span id="s2375">They caught another bunch of hidden people.</span> <span id="s2376">And the ones who were already dirty, with – with – w-with the – with the wounds, with everything, and I saw how the German, with – with – with sword, cut one, the ear was hanging here, I saw that.</span> <span id="s2377">You imagine, how could I live not – not putting this to history?</span> <span id="s2378">Was hanging.</span> <span id="s2379">I don’t know if th – he survived or not, but that time when they ran around.</span> <span id="s2380">Now the people came and you could detect which one was torture already, which came with the nice suit, nice shirt and everything.</span> <span id="s2381">And after a half an hour, they all looked the same.</span> <span id="s2382">The same scenery, the same torture, the same beating.</span> <span id="s2383">Now, if the same soldiers beat, I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s2384">I don’t recognize that – that – the Germans.</span> <span id="s2385">All uniforms, and only was summertime, and you know how they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: What color were the uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Greenish.</span> <span id="s2388">Infantry.</span> <span id="s2389">Infantry SS.</span> <span id="s2390">Not the black.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Okay, and so they weren’t – and they weren’t regular Wehrmacht?</span> <span id="s2392">As far as –</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: Not the regular wehr – regular Wehrmacht, only about five were guarding around, because, you know, they feared that could escape, could run or – or – or jump someplace.</span> <span id="s2394">And second time.</span> <span id="s2395">Now, second time, there were no people looking.</span> <span id="s2396">Germans were angry, and I think they told through the translator that – why people don’t want to see those vertrai – those –</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Say it in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: Those what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: Those [indecipherable] that – that’s – no – criminals –</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: [indecipherable] okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: – or criminals or whatever, who – you know, who – who e – ate you before, who torture you there.</span> <span id="s2403">And so kids came, some other came, we would watch again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: You were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: I – yeah.</span> <span id="s2406">We ah, kids or – or – or teenagers, or – and the same, little bit shorter – [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Excuse me for a minute.</span> <span id="s2408">I’m so sorry.</span> <span id="s2409">I should have turned it off, but I will – Q2: Do you want me to pause?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q2: Okay, pausing.</span> <span id="s2412">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: I’m sorry for the interruption.</span> <span id="s2414">Can you tell me the second time you saw these events, you say the Germans were angry that no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: There were no spectators.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: Or lack of spectators what they expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: They expected – that is my assumption – they expected there would be, you know, enjoyment to everyone.</span> <span id="s2420">Enjoyment?</span> <span id="s2421">You see what enjoyment, you know.</span> <span id="s2422">You torture animals, you don’t have enjoyment.</span> <span id="s2423">Anyway, and the same procedure.</span> <span id="s2424">Reviving was dragged into the pond and back, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten until they couldn’t walk or so.</span> <span id="s2425">And I remember that time, I don’t know if I was until the end or not, they were again put in the prison, and supposed to be third Sunday.</span> <span id="s2426">You imagine, every Sunday was spoiled for all the Kretinga that – that walk, the people’s enjoyment, with that kind of things.</span> <span id="s2427">And I didn’t see that – the third one, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2428">And if I would remember, I would repeat the same.</span> <span id="s2429">Is irrelevant now, that – that – that – but some told me that even was just a few people, the fourth Sunday.</span> <span id="s2430">I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2431">I mention in my writing that – that somebody claims, but I – I don’t – I don’t want.</span> <span id="s2432">No – and – and that was over, and all what I have seen.</span> <span id="s2433">But I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: And then – and then you as – do you assume that then if they weren’t killed during this kind of torture, then they – tho-tho-those who survived were simply shot later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Shot later.</span> <span id="s2436">No – no one survived.</span> <span id="s2437">No one.</span> <span id="s2438">If they didn’t die there at the place, the torture place, they died in the prison.</span> <span id="s2439">They – they were not fed, they were not – not – no – not care, nothing.</span> <span id="s2440">[indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: And did you n – did any of the people look familiar?</span> <span id="s2442">Would they – did you know to – nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Not one man, not – not one.</span> <span id="s2444">Probably some – some recognized, but I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: I – I didn’t recognize any one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: The second time when you were there, you say it was only kids, and maybe some teenagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: There were some people too, there were some people, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Grown-ups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: – not that masses, not like the first time –</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: – that everybody do – what – what – what will be there.</span> <span id="s2453">Because that – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Was this –</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: – sa – sane people cannot stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: Well, here’s another question.</span> <span id="s2457">You say that – you say that – that they ruined the Sunday, you know, the – the Sunday walk.</span> <span id="s2458">But was that the reason why people didn’t talk, or – or was it that they were horrified?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Horrified.</span> <span id="s2460">I – I would assume.</span> <span id="s2461">The – now I’m just speculating, I’m guessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: They were – they were stunned that why they should do that?</span> <span id="s2464">The first [indecipherable] they were put in the – in the – in the ditches and shot, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2465">You know, that – that’s something else, but the torture.</span> <span id="s2466">And you know, like si – little bit – little bit e-e-ex-ex-exploring that, the NKVD, or the – the Russians tortured, but Germans don’t torture.</span> <span id="s2467">They exterminate, but they don’t torture.</span> <span id="s2468">But why they – why they wanted this one – and I don’t believe that such a – such a program was anyplace else.</span> <span id="s2469">I have not heard, and like Eidintas did not write?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: He’s an historian, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2472">And nobody else has published like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: Have you ever heard –</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Why someone who was, that time of – in the 20’s, in 25 or so, they knew that, Kretinga knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s2475">I’m not the only one who witnessed that.</span> <span id="s2476">Why nobody else comes?</span> <span id="s2477">Why nobody el – calls Pranas, your article is interesting, I – I have seen.</span> <span id="s2478">No.</span> <span id="s2479">No one.</span> <span id="s2480">It seems that I’m li – like a – like a liar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: You feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: You know, I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s2483">I was disappointed with you a little bit, you know, that you don’t call.</span> <span id="s2484">Because I said why?</span> <span id="s2485">Because no Lithuanian was participating.</span> <span id="s2486">This atrocity, done in Lithuania, in my hometown, and done by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Ca – to show Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2489">You know Lithuanian, there were Lithuanian tortured my Germans, too, oh, concentration camp and everything.</span> <span id="s2490">Oh yeah, Lithuanians, especially in Memelland, in – in – in – who had something to do with the – the process.</span> <span id="s2491">That was in 1936 –</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Oh, you mean the trial against the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: The trial a-a-against Neumann and Sass, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: What do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: I know from history only.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2498">But from – they – somebody could have responded to me more.</span> <span id="s2499">Couple guys call me and say, ah Pranas, you know, oh, everyplace happened that.</span> <span id="s2500">So I know, tell me.</span> <span id="s2501">And I – I – I showed the big book.</span> <span id="s2502">And the big book, nothing.</span> <span id="s2503">And I – I think you s – you told that there is something about Kretinga in the museum archives, something similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Well, I heard – I saw some information.</span> <span id="s2505">There’s not much.</span> <span id="s2506">There’s not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: No, but not s – not such a thing which I’m telling now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: No, not that</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Not that, not that.</span> <span id="s2511">Now –</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: And I – I – I – I want to tell that.</span> <span id="s2513">I want to tell that – that, you know, somehow is a part of that tragedy which we have not solved yet between us, between Jews and Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2514">And I always see still the articles, or the accusations and this and that.</span> <span id="s2515">No comment.</span> <span id="s2516">I want to give what I have seen.</span> <span id="s2517">You judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: I want to find out from you, after these events – after these events, ho-how is the atmosphere in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: Just terrible.</span> <span id="s2520">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: Just terrible.</span> <span id="s2523">You imagine that Kretinga should be the now atop of the world in such atrocities.</span> <span id="s2524">Well, there’s not.</span> <span id="s2525">There’s a Kaunas fort, Fort Five, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: The Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2528">Was there more?</span> <span id="s2529">Was there more?</span> <span id="s2530">No, they were shot, were shot.</span> <span id="s2531">But not such a thing.</span> <span id="s2532">And I could give you the – the – the place, the – where the people were, where the torturing were, how it was, how the pond is.</span> <span id="s2533">I could draw you a – a map.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Tell me, when – the second time you went, and you came home, did your parents still not want to talk about it?</span> <span id="s2535">Did you tell your parents what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: They didn’t ask me, they didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s2537">Becau – I – we were very free Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2538">We – the parents used to tell, be for lunch, but where you go in summertime, what you do – we didn’t work, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: School, we didn’t ne-need to work.</span> <span id="s2541">Soviet time, we had to work in a – in a – the Skavaches(ph) – the Skavaches(ph) garden.</span> <span id="s2542">But by Germans we didn’t have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: So you could run around and play?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: We – we play, yeah.</span> <span id="s2545">Teenager already, 13 - 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: Did you talk amongst your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s2550">Not much.</span> <span id="s2551">It was – it was assumed that you saw, I saw, there is nothing m – no-nothing more to talk.</span> <span id="s2552">Nothing more to talk.</span> <span id="s2553">A tragedy.</span> <span id="s2554">I don’t know how – how to describe the tragedy.</span> <span id="s2555">In this age, when – oh, when I tell you, I – I could say that tragedy the top of the world, but that time?</span> <span id="s2556">Event of the day.</span> <span id="s2557">Event of the day.</span> <span id="s2558">Cruel, yes.</span> <span id="s2559">Like I say, if somebody h-hits me or – or – or pokes me, it hurts me.</span> <span id="s2560">I know that people hurt.</span> <span id="s2561">The people hurt, but there was such a notion that guilty, guilty.</span> <span id="s2562">Who is guilty?</span> <span id="s2563">No one is guilty, guilty ta – the one who is doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: What I’m trying to get a sense of, is how did it work inside of you when you see this?</span> <span id="s2565">Were you numb, were you sh – were you terrorized, were you stunned, were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: I was terrorized, I was – at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: At that time I was neither terrorized nor stunned.</span> <span id="s2569">Astonished little bit that I – I witnessed such a thing, and it was inside me which I carried when I – I said I carried so many years.</span> <span id="s2570">So many years, I had no one to talk, no one would actually – would listen that.</span> <span id="s2571">They would say, like I repeating, they would say, yeah, everyplace was.</span> <span id="s2572">There was a this – this and – and – and that.</span> <span id="s2573">But I never ex – I never heard anyplace else, how much I read and everything.</span> <span id="s2574">Was all shooting, extermination, concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2575">Some torturing most likely in – in a – in – you know, in prison, but not that open.</span> <span id="s2576">Three or four Sundays, to show the little town.</span> <span id="s2577">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: Was there a time when you wanted to talk and there was nobody to listen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: Probably it was.</span> <span id="s2580">I knew one thing, that I will not forget, and I will write.</span> <span id="s2581">And I will write.</span> <span id="s2582">Now I come to that.</span> <span id="s2583">And I ca – and I see my age is going – you know, we’re getting older, days are passing, and this event I will take to – to my grave?</span> <span id="s2584">No.</span> <span id="s2585">I told myself no.</span> <span id="s2586">And then happened that I saw there a Captain Sporelli(ph) in the – in the film, and I start in the beginning for that, I say here is th – my – my clue or my incentive to write what happened in my country.</span> <span id="s2587">And I start and I finish.</span> <span id="s2588">And I say why this had to happen to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: You first wrote about this publicly in 2010?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: 2010, November six.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: And it was published where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: In Chicago, in Drogas(ph) daily newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: And it’s a Lithuanian language newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: Lithuanian language newspaper.</span> <span id="s2595">I have given – I had given my script – [break] – for former editor, two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Two years before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: Before that.</span> <span id="s2598">And I called stairdinas(ph) massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: Slaughter.</span> <span id="s2601">And the editor did not had time to read that or to give me a comments.</span> <span id="s2602">And I was little bit unhappy when – when – when, and she never returned that to me.</span> <span id="s2603">The one I wrote, I did not correct much.</span> <span id="s2604">I only gave to my sister.</span> <span id="s2605">My sister said, I was three or four years younger, I don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s2606">She only remembered that she saw some torturing – Soviets torture Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2607">She was that, as a schoolgirl, put that – to look at that.</span> <span id="s2608">She remembered that.</span> <span id="s2609">Otherwise she doesn’t remember.</span> <span id="s2610">Parent did not – they – parents did not talk.</span> <span id="s2611">Should be kids on their own who – who would kind of search, think about, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2612">And then that – then we only heard later, you know, what happened there, what happened there that 1941, what happened in Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: When you’re talking – now let’s go back to Kretinga and – [technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Okay, no we – we almost –</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: No, we’re not done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: We’re not done.</span> <span id="s2618">No, no, no, because I want to talk about Kretinga afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">Q: [inaudible] So, you said that after this, people were quiet, they didn’t talk, they were stunned in the town.</span> <span id="s2621">That you haven’t heard of anything else that happened in quite such a similar fashion elsewhere.</span> <span id="s2622">What – did any – did life normalize at any point, or do you think Kretinga was changed forever?</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A: I think it was – was fairly normalized.</span> <span id="s2624">Normali – the front was far away.</span> <span id="s2625">There was already Kaunas taken, was Vilnius taken, the Germans were in – in Russia.</span> <span id="s2626">German administration, the military administration was changed to – to civil German administration, although the lower echelons were Lithuanians, but was German.</span> <span id="s2627">German regime.</span> <span id="s2628">And you have to [indecipherable], you have to [indecipherable] because you don’t know.</span> <span id="s2629">Some people were taken, deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: To Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: To Germany.</span> <span id="s2632">Some girls who were a little bit loose, they were pointed out and the Germans took them to Germany.</span> <span id="s2633">There were no mass deportations to Germany for work.</span> <span id="s2634">Lithuanians were not in that category as Poles and Ukraini-Ukrainians and some other ones.</span> <span id="s2635">Although there were Lithuanians who worked in a – in a – during the – the war in German factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: Did you – after this – after these events, these horrifying things that you saw, did you hear of more murders while you were in Kretinga?</span> <span id="s2637">Those women and children, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Oh, oh, the children, I didn’t finish that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q:

go, you know, in the city.</span> <span id="s2859">They were all intelligent, all students.</span> <span id="s2860">Lithuanian girls were very happy, all the gymnasts’, were really fine guys.</span> <span id="s2861">And they used to fight with these hooligans, Lithuanians, with the stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: This is all during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A: And use a

some friends who already studied in Kaunas, you know, some were older, studied in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s2875">And the last time I was in Kaunas, when Vilnius was occupied second time by the Soviet Union, when we had to run just out of Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: I was there then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Did you ever go to

like.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A: What my – my understanding is that there were not many left.</span> <span id="s2900">There were not many left – left, who hid themselves and somehow survived, because that started the partisan times.</span> <span id="s2901">There were Soviet partisans and there were Lithuanian partisans.</span> <span id="s2902">Lithuanian partisans fought the Soviet partisans and German partisans.</span> <span id="s2903">And so – and they were tel – told that, you know – so that was the – the tragic time again for Lithuanians, for young people.</span></p>

<span id="s2937">The Germans were.</span> <span id="s2938">The Germans were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2940">What did she die of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: How

fever?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: – y-yellow fever.</span> <span id="s2946">All the – probably she had the cancer.</span> <span id="s2947">The whole body went yellow.</span> <span id="s2948">And the – there were no medicine.</span> <span id="s2949">We tried to get the German doctor, German doctor didn’t come, there were no doctors.</span> <span id="s2950">And whatever she took.</span> <span id="s2951">But she was already – one year before she always complained that she has something, something, something.</span> <span id="s2952">And she probably sensed that she – you know how Lithuanian mother is that said, little kinder – little children, I probably will be leaving you.</span> <span id="s2953">I probably will be leaving you.</span> <span id="s2954">And one day suddenly, she was yellow – yellow, she worked and everything and suddenly died, and then when she died, my father was little bit on edge.</span> <span id="s2955">He didn’t know how to cook, he didn’t know how to do anything, laundry or anything.</span> <span id="s2956">My elder sister was a dame.</span> <span id="s2957">She never peeled a potato, she never did anything.</span> <span id="s2958">Mother spoiled her.</span> <span id="s2959">I was the one who knew little how to cook, because my – my mother was my friend.</span> <span id="s2960">Our father was the girls’ friends.</span> <span id="s2961">So that I took over and Father was very angry many times.</span> <span id="s2962">I – I had the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: You didn’t cook as well, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: I – yeah, and I – I felt that I – I have to disappear.</span> <span id="s2965">And that was for me a good – good reason.</span> <span id="s2966">I said, I am going to – to mine tante, or aunt, and I will stay there.</span> <span id="s2967">And then after that when they – I mean, when they run someplace, I’ll run with them.</span> <span id="s2968">And they ran too, we ran with them.</span> <span id="s2969">And we separated and – and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2970">The bombardments in Germany was – and you have to hide.</span> <span id="s2971">I had a da – advantage.</span> <span id="s2972">Guess what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: Small.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: You were a little guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: S – yeah.</span> <span id="s2977">Small, young looking.</span> <span id="s2978">I looked like – I was 17, I looked like 15, like 14.</span> <span id="s2979">And I hid myself like this.</span> <span id="s2980">They didn’t take.</span> <span id="s2981">Now I could – I – now I tell you, but I – I just speculated, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">A: I used to go with a – on a bus from Kretinga to Palanga.</span> <span id="s2984">And you know, for kids was free.</span> <span id="s2985">But I was playing yi – small, and I didn’t need to – to – to pay for that.</span> <span id="s2986">And I used to go free for [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2987">So that, hey, combination, you know, speculation, all kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: I want to ask something, going back to the main topic of our – of our discussion.</span> <span id="s2989">And that is, did what you see with that torture and I’d say defilement and cruelty to those Jewish men, did that change you?</span> <span id="s2990">Did you feel like you – somehow or other it changed some part of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">A: It changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: It changed when I grew up.</span> <span id="s2994">When I grew up, it changed.</span> <span id="s2995">It changed that the – to subject one what I don’t want, to pain some other one.</span> <span id="s2996">If you break, if you do, if you beat.</span> <span id="s2997">And, you know, when I was young, I was little bit, you know, edgy and so, you know, [indecipherable] and – and hitting something.</span> <span id="s2998">After that, I had never had a fight in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: So after you saw such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: Ne – te – but I – I kind of – I kind of grew up very early.</span> <span id="s3001">But I was in a – in a Germany, or – or something, or – or some disagreement with some friend or something, I never wanted to get in a fight.</span> <span id="s3002">Not that I was afraid that I will not win.</span> <span id="s3003">You know, you just protect yourself.</span> <span id="s3004">But no, but just – just a – now, when I see grown people fighting, or the lithu – you know, Lithuanian fights, especially [indecipherable] you know, when – when they – they get drunk and they fight.</span> <span id="s3005">And I never smoked in my life and I don’t drink.</span> <span id="s3006">I drink socially, but I – my father was drinking and I swore to myself, I will not subject my family what he subjected us.</span> <span id="s3007">And there is a story, laughing story to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: But – but so, what you saw did change you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: Change, change.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">A: And when I see now – when I – you know, I watch the movies and everything, and I see those tortures.</span> <span id="s3014">And especially now recently was history channel about the – the – the Third Reich and the fall.</span> <span id="s3015">And they showed pictures, and after that they showed the Germans, how they have to go to Dachau and take care of the bodies, and you see – and I think it was good.</span> <span id="s3016">Now, the Germans claim – probably this is not, but the Germans claim that we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3017">Yeah, you didn’t know, but feel the guilt.</span> <span id="s3018">Feel.</span> <span id="s3019">Because yeah, this was your people You elect na – not elected, but you supported Adolf.</span> <span id="s3020">You supported Adolf.</span> <span id="s3021">He was good, so long at wi – everything was okay.</span> <span id="s3022">When is bad, then is bad.</span> <span id="s3023">But not all Germans too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: Germans fought quite a bit against that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: There were some.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: But about Germans in – in Klaipeda, I have nothing good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about is that it took a long time, if we talk about 2010, when you wrote this article and you had it published – maybe you passed it in 2008, but it sat in you for a long time, until you were ready to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">A: It’s – it sat, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: Why did it take so long, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: I think I mentioned a little bit that I was not sure if I should reveal this.</span> <span id="s3032">I was – I knew that one day, after me, or before me or whatever, I have to tell.</span> <span id="s3033">But there was my personal neglect.</span> <span id="s3034">I always set priorities.</span> <span id="s3035">You know, to sit such a article, you have to sit, you have to concentrate, you have to have time.</span> <span id="s3036">I was working.</span> <span id="s3037">I was – I had this tough – tough job.</span> <span id="s3038">I had the – I was in charge of several office of Citibank international banking, Cleveland, Ohio, Minneapolis, Saint Louis and Chicago, the hub for Citibank international business.</span> <span id="s3039">So – and I had the people, it – so – and I had many, many Jewish friends in Citibank.</span> <span id="s3040">Jewish hired me, and my bosses were, my co-workers were.</span> <span id="s3041">So that – that I – I – I couldn’t tell anyone.</span> <span id="s3042">I couldn’t tell anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: So you didn’t share this with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: No, no, this – this I didn’t share.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Did you share it with your wife, or your kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: My wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">A: I shared with my wife, no not – not the kids.</span> <span id="s3049">The kids didn’t want to – to – to listen.</span> <span id="s3050">They didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s3051">They don’t want to.</span> <span id="s3052">And the kids – Lithuanians were poor – poor Lithuanian, I wrote to Lithuania – like the book now, which I published, sorry.</span> <span id="s3053">I published in Lithuanian, they cannot a – they – they cannot enjoy the reading.</span> <span id="s3054">They can understand, but they cannot enjoy the reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">A: And I’m sorry that I was lazy, I could not, at least part translate too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: Now, I want to ask you.</span> <span id="s3058">You mentioned in your book that you wrote about everything, but you didn’t write about this part in your book, about what happened to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: No, I didn’t write, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: And why would that be?</span> <span id="s3061">Why would you leave it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A: Well, because that – but that time, what I wrote in that book, I wrote my high school, how I left Lithuania and how I started high school in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q: Oh, so you li – you don’t talk about before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: No.</span> <span id="s3067">The – in Germany.</span> <span id="s3068">What we did in Germany, that you – you will see that it – that’s what we – how we prayed, how we learn, what we learned, how was that.</span> <span id="s3069">You will see that in the book is just that part, and then university, Baltic University and the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: And nothing else, no America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">A: No America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3074">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">A: They wanted that I – I write again and now they are asking me, and I must admit, I – I am newly married, and I – I don’t have time.</span> <span id="s3076">I don’t have the patience, I don’t have time.</span> <span id="s3077">And that book was published when my first wife was already with Alzheimer’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">A: And I was in such a hurry, I ask my friends, group, we had the group, that we all contribute.</span> <span id="s3080">If we publish the book, each one part.</span> <span id="s3081">And I waited three or four years; nobody responded like to this article.</span> <span id="s3082">Nobody wants to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s3084">Why do you think that’s the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3086">Nobody – nobody calls me, nobody there.</span> <span id="s3087">There probably are some Lithuanians someplace, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: Nobody was interested in what you had revealed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3090">And when I ask, di – have you read?</span> <span id="s3091">No.</span> <span id="s3092">I say, was in two pages, in Saturday publication.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: The most read publication of that newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3095">One lady wrote me, say oh, I read your article – email – I read your article.</span> <span id="s3096">My mother told me something that happened someplace else, and I would like to – what my mother told, I would like to write, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3097">And that’s it, yeah.</span> <span id="s3098">And that’s little bit, kind of angered me that was not enough response for th – [break] – and I hope, therefore that this will be the contribution to your museum, and to the relationship between the Jews, the folks, and the Lithuanian folks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s3100">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s3101">If there’s anything else you’d like to add, that I haven’t talked to you about –</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s3103">I – I wanted, because there is no lie, nothing is a lie.</span> <span id="s3104">So if – if there is some doubt, there is not intentionally, but probably.</span> <span id="s3105">Because I went to Lithuania special, on a trip.</span> <span id="s3106">I went there, I measured, I looked.</span> <span id="s3107">I walked around the pond, and this one, that I don’t make mistake.</span> <span id="s3108">And in that article is much more than I told you today.</span> <span id="s3109">An explicit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">A: What was on one side, what was on other side, how that was.</span> <span id="s3112">Is – is much better expressed that I expressed in my report now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">Q: But tell me, did people in Kretinga read this article?</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">A: I gave to my relatives, the day we delivered to Kretinga newspapers.</span> <span id="s3115">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3116">You know that they hesitate?</span> <span id="s3117">They don’t want to know that such things happened.</span> <span id="s3118">Because there is always some needle come out from someplace.</span> <span id="s3119">There are some people who probably feel, and to publish this one, there would be sensation.</span> <span id="s3120">And when I went to Lithuania, when I presented in Kretinga, in a church meeting, I presented my book, because I am from Kretinga, there were about hundred people.</span> <span id="s3121">I give presentation.</span> <span id="s3122">I didn’t had the article yet.</span> <span id="s3123">I didn’t had the article.</span> <span id="s3124">And you know, my book was presented in Mažvydas library, and was said to be [indecipherable] ga – was that – in charge.</span> <span id="s3125">He said, one of the best books about DPs, which doesn’t talk much individually about the person, but about general, about everyone.</span> <span id="s3126">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: And, you know, I sa –

the books are in the national library in Myronis(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">A: And in – in Kretinga and [indecipherable] so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">Q: Again, thank you very much, I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">A: Thank you for listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: I appreciate this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: I enjoyed.</span> <span id="s3138">I apologize for the language –</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">A: – which I forgot.</span> <span id="s3141">And now I will understand how people forget languages.</span> <span id="s3142">I couldn’t believe that someone lived in Germany a long time doesn’t know German.</span> <span id="s3143">I say, how could you forget?</span> <span id="s3144">Yes, we forget our own language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">Q: It can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: Well, we understood and we heard it and we’re grateful.</span> <span id="s3148">And this concludes –</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">A: That was typical DP English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">Q: This
