1999 in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s12">This is a follow up interview that will focus on Regina Spiegel’s post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s13">In preparation for this interview, I watched the videotape of the interview you conducted with the Holocaust eyewitness project of Washington, D.C. in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotape interview you conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on March 5th, 1985.</span> <span id="s14">I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews.</span> <span id="s15">Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on those interviews and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s16">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s17">What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: At birth, Regina – Regina Gutman.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Radom, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: It’s – it was May 12th, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Let’s start with your liberation.</span> <span id="s24">Could you talk about –</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: – how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s28">In – as I spoke previously, from the other tape you probably heard that on the last part of our journey, so to speak, we found ourselves in – closed up in cattle trains.</span> <span id="s29">They were shipping us, to where we don’t exactly know, but supposedly, from what we’ve heard after the war, that our journey was taking us to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And you had been where?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: In Elsnig by Torgau.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: It was our last camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: – that we were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And we is who?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: The group, you know, the whole – you know, we were like about 3,000 women.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: So the group, when I speak we, I refer to the – to the whole camp, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: They put us on these cattle trains and we were traveling.</span> <span id="s42">And in Germany, all of a sudden we had to stop.</span> <span id="s43">And why did we have to stop?</span> <span id="s44">Because in Germany the railroad tracks were bombed.</span> <span id="s45">This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to tell you the truth, didn’t know exactly when, what time it was.</span> <span id="s46">But later we found out that the war was getting – was almost of the brink of being finished, except we didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s47">But when we stopped at our – in our train because the railroad tracks were bombed, we couldn’t go – excuse me – much farther.</span> <span id="s48">So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20th, 1945, it’s Hitler’s birthday.</span> <span id="s49">And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it’s Hitler’s birthday?</span> <span id="s50">But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it.</span> <span id="s51">And no sooner did he finish as the whole sky became black and we were actually bombed.</span> <span id="s52">Our trains were hit by the allies.</span> <span id="s53">Not direct, but next to it.</span> <span id="s54">And actually, we were like about 3,000 women, probab – [coughs] excuse me – probab –</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: You want a cough drop?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No, I – I am using a –</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Probably a thousand of us got killed by the bombs, and the rest of us, when this train split open, and we saw like an opening, the ones who were able to, we just ran into the woods.</span> <span id="s59">We hid out.</span> <span id="s60">We couldn’t stay there too long, because after all, they didn’t give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn’t do a – hide out too much, and we finally came out and we spotted this Russian – he was like a – probably like a colonel in the army.</span> <span id="s61">And we ran over to him and he said, don’t worry, you are free.</span> <span id="s62">And that’s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20th, because it took us like two days longer.</span> <span id="s63">But apparently, the Russians were already there.</span> <span id="s64">I always say, had the Germans left us in that camp, we probably would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the Elbe river.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Excuse me, that makes a sound.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Oh yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s69">So anyhow, that was mine liberation.</span> <span id="s70">So what do you do after you were liberated?</span> <span id="s71">You know, we had thru – in a way, we had a chance, because we could have – and the Russians were encouraging us to go on a rampage, you know.</span> <span id="s72">The Germans killed us, you go out, you have a chance now, kill the Germans.</span> <span id="s73">But you know what?</span> <span id="s74">We decided this wasn’t our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Wh-When they were telling you to do this, how did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: The Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Yeah, did you have weapons to –</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, we didn’t have weapons, but we could have gotten – they would have been delighted to give us a – one of their guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: The Russians would have?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah, they would have, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So they would have helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s83">But we decided ourselves that’s no way to go, and we just figured because we didn’t like what they were doing to us, we would turn around doing the same thing to them.</span> <span id="s84">After all, the German that I would have picked up, I probably would have never – had never seen him before.</span> <span id="s85">It would have been just picking up a German because he was German.</span> <span id="s86">And it – this wasn’t our way.</span> <span id="s87">And the next thing what we started doing is let’s go home.</span> <span id="s88">Let’s try to get home.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: N-Now when you say we, were – who – where – did you have special friends that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: We kind of got – when we were liberated, because we were so used to always being in groups, like I didn't know how to be by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I-It – so like about 15 girls, we got together and we like di – did things together.</span> <span id="s93">If we wanted to get some bread – because we didn’t have like what the Americans did on the American zone, a displaced persons camp where they fed you.</span> <span id="s94">With the Russians you didn't have anything like this.</span> <span id="s95">The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take – let’s go to a German bakery with us.</span> <span id="s96">And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us.</span> <span id="s97">So we – and we, our type of eating was very crude.</span> <span id="s98">Bread and water, that’s all we needed, you know, to keep us alive.</span> <span id="s99">So that’s what we got, we got mostly bread and water.</span> <span id="s100">Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households became empty.</span> <span id="s101">Why?</span> <span id="s102">Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the American zone.</span> <span id="s103">So they left a lot of their homes with no one there.</span> <span id="s104">So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there.</span> <span id="s105">I remember in one place, they had to spe – these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits.</span> <span id="s106">We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it.</span> <span id="s107">So we wouldn’t even touch this.</span> <span id="s108">But we would have the bread from the baker and the water and that’s how we continued going towards Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Now, you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah, a Russian soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s112">Were all the Russian soldiers helpful to you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Mos-Most of the time yes.</span> <span id="s114">You see, they didn’t have this type o-of gan – organization like they had with the – the Americans had.</span> <span id="s115">You know, what the Americans did, they found the survivors, they put them in into a camp and they supplied food and you had a place where to put down your head.</span> <span id="s116">With the Russians you had nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: But some Russians in some places were abusive to –</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: To women.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: To women, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: – did you encounter any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: A – well, we learned to – to kind of counteract that.</span> <span id="s123">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s124">During the day, ess – you know, I told you, we were 15 girls of us.</span> <span id="s125">As a matter of fact, we took out from one of these homes, a horse and one of those – it was like a coach – not a co – you know, a horse and buggy?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: But it’s not a b – it wasn’t a buggy, it was like the most beautiful si – here at the Smithsonian I walked in one time, in front was sitting this coach, you know, it was the most gorgeous thing if I would have kept it and would – wouldn’t have to had to worry about any finances because it probably was worth at – a fortune.</span> <span id="s128">But we were traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit.</span> <span id="s129">During the day, let’s say where we – if we were in a certain town during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into different places to sleep.</span> <span id="s130">Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in – in some kind of – what do they call them, the barns, like.</span> <span id="s131">Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of – of raping, because during the war, you see, i-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do.</span> <span id="s132">If – if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble.</span> <span id="s133">So they usually stayed away from us.</span> <span id="s134">They probably were raping more German women.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What – what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Oh, that’s was the – what they called the rassenschande.</span> <span id="s137">Rassen, the race, schande is the – a – you know, shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: The – the – the race shame, you know, otherwise you – you like committed the worst sin.</span> <span id="s140">I mean, you commit a sin when you rape anybody, but this, th – it wasn’t the raping that they were worried.</span> <span id="s141">So after the war we did have to – the women, and I don’t – we got away – we got away kind of lucky, but a lot of women weren’t that lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: It sounds as though you also were careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Very, very, as I say.</span> <span id="s144">You see, when I was liberated in ’45, I was already almost like 19 years old.</span> <span id="s145">You know, through the war years, you became very adept, let’s put it this way, and like self preservation.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: So most of us were really looking out for these things.</span> <span id="s148">When we notice in a town that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out on – you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that town.</span> <span id="s149">We would march on.</span> <span id="s150">We – like I said, we had this horse and buggy, so we could move on a little bit more.</span> <span id="s151">And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in Germany.</span> <span id="s152">You know, they came to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s153">And they were also like trying to get back.</span> <span id="s154">So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a – with another man, they would just stay away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: The Italian guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s159">And then we just lost them.</span> <span id="s160">Came to another town, we looked around what was bat – we were very much aware, and I’m really surprised – you probably heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really, that question, how – because we were – were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: So anyhow, after – to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the Polish border, I really don’t know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three weeks.</span> <span id="s163">First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very – from the bombs, she was a little bit more in – and sh-she – you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us.</span> <span id="s164">You know, like I had a little bit of a i-injury, you know, like a shrapnel?</span> <span id="s165">A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn’t – you know, I never felt it.</span> <span id="s166">You know, it wasn’t dangerous for me.</span> <span id="s167">But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital.</span> <span id="s168">So she actually stayed in the hospital.</span> <span id="s169">We couldn’t, you see, we couldn’t keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this.</span> <span id="s170">So we actually had to leave her in the hospital, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her.</span> <span id="s171">So she was like more or less taken care of.</span> <span id="s172">But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s173">And when I got there – and you know, as you were walking – you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn’t realize that most of our families were murdered?</span> <span id="s174">We still were hoping that maybe somebody’s gonna be alive because I will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that’s what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up.</span> <span id="s175">But that was, in a way, kept us – hey, you stay alive because you promised that we’re gonna meet at home.</span> <span id="s176">You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate – when they separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine hometown.</span> <span id="s177">But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated – you see, never thinking that what’s going to happen, that it’s going to be this mass killing, but just separated.</span> <span id="s178">If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we’ll meet in our place, you know, in our home.</span> <span id="s179">So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back home.</span> <span id="s180">So I did.</span> <span id="s181">That’s how – and most of us –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Back to Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Back to Radom, but by the time when I hit the Polish border, it was the city Poznań.</span> <span id="s184">That was like on germ – Polish German border.</span> <span id="s185">I don’t know whether – you know, I think it’s not any more Poznań, I think they call it now Wroclaw, because this became part of Germany, you know, ne – I think so they call it Wroclaw, I’m almost sure.</span> <span id="s186">Or maybe it’s still there, I haven’t looked at the map.</span> <span id="s187">Maybe after I finish this interview I will take a look at the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: But we got to this town Poznań, and when I got to Poznań, the trains in Poland were running already.</span> <span id="s190">Because you see, Poland was actually liberated in ’44, towards the end of ’44, th – it – the beginning of ’45.</span> <span id="s191">So their trains were already running.</span> <span id="s192">They weren’t maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs.</span> <span id="s193">And I dropped – I will never forget this, I drove – I – I didn’t drive, how do you call it?</span> <span id="s194">I brought this horse and buggy on the station and left it there just like that because actually, we were 15 girls, no one wanted to go near the horse.</span> <span id="s195">I said to them, you went through such a war.</span> <span id="s196">You’re afraid of a little horse?</span> <span id="s197">I mean, he was that – he probably w-wa – I wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and – other than with the people.</span> <span id="s198">I said, and you’re afraid?</span> <span id="s199">So they were afraid to go near the horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, I was the one that took him in – now I probably wouldn’t know how to deal with it, but at the time, you know, when your life is at stake, or whatever it is that you have, I came to the conclusion that human nature, you would do what you have to do for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And had you had any experience with a horse before?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: So you didn’t know anything about –</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I was a – I wa – I was a city girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: – handle – so you didn’t know anything about handling a horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Never.</span> <span id="s206">Never in my life –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: But you learned fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: – did – did I go close to a horse, but I didn't know – you see, now I know a horse can kick you or something.</span> <span id="s209">I didn’t even know a horse can do that to you.</span> <span id="s210">But I knew that it was the only way that if we wanted to get back to Poland, rather than walking step by step.</span> <span id="s211">And that was also a lit – a little bit in our way, that we had this mobility a little bit, that when we realized that this town isn’t so safe for us.</span> <span id="s212">I mean, not with our lives, but with our – you know, virginity.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: So we figured we better keep on using it.</span> <span id="s215">And that’s what I did, so I left in Poznań, somebody had a very good deal on me, left in Poznan this gorgeous, gorgeous thing, with the horse.</span> <span id="s216">And of course, then we start – got on that train, no tickets.</span> <span id="s217">I don’t know where [indecipherable] going [indecipherable] going to the trains, you know, on the outside, because we had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did they require that you had ticket – have a ticket if you were a returning refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: They might have.</span> <span id="s220">You want to know something but – there were so many people in the trains that probably the conductor could never manage to get them that – to go and ask him for anything because you just got on the train and you hopped off wherever it stopped.</span> <span id="s221">And then how we stopped in one place, and somebody passes me by, and he actually had walked away already and came running back.</span> <span id="s222">He said Reginka(ph) to me.</span> <span id="s223">He recognized me, we were in one of the camps together in Pionki, you know, that was – we were the only camp where men and women worked together, but I was.</span> <span id="s224">And he says hey, you know that your boyfriend is alive?</span> <span id="s225">That’s when I found out that Sam was alive.</span> <span id="s226">So I already felt a little bit better because I felt I – it’s true, I’m going back into my city and I’m going to look for my family, but at least my boyfriend is alive.</span> <span id="s227">Because by the time we were getting to Poland, the closer we were getting, we realize more and more that our families were dead, but we still couldn’t accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: In a way it reminds me a lots of times when God forbid, you have a very si – terrible sick spouse, and you know he’s gonna die, or she’s gonna die, i – you just don’t want to accept it.</span> <span id="s230">And I think that was with us, you know, now that I’m – I never thought of it then, but hi-i – but now that I’m older, I put – I can think a little bit differently than I did in those years.</span> <span id="s231">And I think most of us didn’t want to accept the idea that everybody was dead.</span> <span id="s232">So you clung to it.</span> <span id="s233">But at least, as I say in my case, at least I knew my boyfriend, if he behaves himself and if he is waiting for me, and if he thinks of me as much as I think of him, maybe we’ll be able to get together.</span> <span id="s234">So finally I got to my city, Radom.</span> <span id="s235">To tell you the truth, when I got there, I don’t know exactly, but – have you ever been to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s237">Not to Poland, but other parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah, but you know like other, like bel –</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Czechoslovakia, Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: – bel – it would be the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: You know how before you walk in into the places where you actually lived, you walk into a big gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah, and then you go into the courtyard.</span> <span id="s245">Well, I did that.</span> <span id="s246">I came to my place where I used to live, it was called Jerome Skakel(ph) 21.</span> <span id="s247">This street was Jerome Skakel(ph), he was a Polish writer, the name of the street, was actually the main street of the city and the number of the building was 21, and a – I walked in.</span> <span id="s248">And no sooner did I go in, I haven’t even – because we lived a little bit farther into the place, and I had this idea that I was going to walk in into my place, knock on the door, because by then I really knew already that most of our – my family was dead.</span> <span id="s249">And I – but I figured I will knock at the door and just ask it.</span> <span id="s250">Tell them who I am.</span> <span id="s251">Maybe if somebody else from my family comes and ask – tell him that the sister is alive.</span> <span id="s252">And I was also going to ask him, you know what?</span> <span id="s253">I lost all my pictures in Auschwitz, and it always bothered me that here I lived through it and I don’t even have a picture to look at it.</span> <span id="s254">You know, it’s – it seems so funny, because when you have access to it, i-it really isn’t that important, but I hear more and more people when their homes are on fire or something they run back.</span> <span id="s255">For what do they run back?</span> <span id="s256">For their pictures.</span> <span id="s257">And the same thing I thought maybe when we left for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s258">My mother couldn’t take everything.</span> <span id="s259">I’m sure she took some pictures, but she prob – maybe she left some pictures and maybe these people would have those pictures.</span> <span id="s260">That wouldn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s261">But no sooner did I walk in into that place, you know, walked through this back gate, somebody caught me and said Reginka(ph).</span> <span id="s262">Reginka(ph), by the way, is a name for – like Regina.</span> <span id="s263">It’s – in Polish you use it like a diminutive, yeah.</span> <span id="s264">Say hey, Reginka(ph), what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s265">They just shot Gudsztat(ph), otherwise a neighbor of ours, came back.</span> <span id="s266">He came back maybe a month before.</span> <span id="s267">They used to have a jewelry store before the war, and he took back the jewelry store.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, the Russians weren’t yet in Poland like later on they came in.</span> <span id="s269">As it was, later on it didn’t make any difference because the Russians took away from it.</span> <span id="s270">But he took back the jewelry store that belonged to his family.</span> <span id="s271">Somebody came, knocked at the door, that same time that I came in into our city, and killed him.</span> <span id="s272">And this girl grabbed me, she says, let – g – run.</span> <span id="s273">And she and me started running.</span> <span id="s274">And where do we run?</span> <span id="s275">There’s no place where to run.</span> <span id="s276">We run into where the ghetto used to be in Radom.</span> <span id="s277">They had – they made like out of a warehouse, they made like almost like a – a – what they call a – a community center, you know, so when – because so many people were coming back into the city and they had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s278">So at least you should be able to put down your head and what we used to do, in a place like this, we would – they would have like sheets of paper on the walls, and you would put in your name.</span> <span id="s279">So at least I felt like – so I put down my name, and – Regina Gutman, am – you know, so maybe if somebody will look through, they will find me or if they know [indecipherable] of course, nobody found me except my boyfriend by then already heard that I got back to Radom and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: He – your boyfriend heard –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Y-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: – that you had gotten back?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: You know true, I always say it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s286">We didn’t have telephones, we didn’t – but through the way – through the grapevine, you know.</span> <span id="s287">People were walking.</span> <span id="s288">The people were walking, i-it was like the march of the masses.</span> <span id="s289">People were walking from Radom to Germany.</span> <span id="s290">People were coming from Germany into Radom.</span> <span id="s291">So as you were walking, you met some people, and we had a way to identify ourselves, to – to ask you, let’s say if I pass by somebody that I thought that looked a little bit familiar but I wasn’t too sure, I would just address him as amho(ph).</span> <span id="s292">You know, just go by amho(ph).</span> <span id="s293">And this was almost like our password.</span> <span id="s294">It’s a Hebrew word for – like folks.</span> <span id="s295">You know, a country –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Folks?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">A – maybe I’ll ask Sam a – a better definition of, because he speaks Hebrew much better, but amho(ph).</span> <span id="s299">So if – if he heard the word amho(ph), he realize that I’m Jewish too.</span> <span id="s300">Do you know – of course, we were plenty identifiable in the beginning anyhow.</span> <span id="s301">I – all right, I didn’t wear any more mine suit what I had what – when I was liberated, my striped suit, because this I got rid of at the first thing.</span> <span id="s302">The minute I got in into a German house – I told you I wouldn’t touch the food, but I looked around in their clothing and whatever the clothing was, I got rid of that because I just couldn’t seem myself walking through in this striped suit.</span> <span id="s303">Because if you saw somebody in that striped suit, you knew, more or less that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s304">But this what we had, you know, in order to identify ourselves.</span> <span id="s305">So people, you started and the minute you knew that he was Jewish too, you stopped it.</span> <span id="s306">Where you coming from?</span> <span id="s307">I am from here.</span> <span id="s308">Did you see anybody?</span> <span id="s309">And that’s how we got a little bit, you know, like information.</span> <span id="s310">Like this, and Sam probably found out through this way that also that I was alive.</span> <span id="s311">And as a matter of fact, I didn’t even stay, that same night I was going to spend the night in that center, but I found a cousin of mines who actually was already there.</span> <span id="s312">She just came down to see who else was coming, because she actually was able to take back her apartment.</span> <span id="s313">She came back with a stepmother and she, when she saw me, she said, don’t stay here, you can come and stay with us in our apartment.</span> <span id="s314">So I went with her in the apartment.</span> <span id="s315">Was a little bit – much more comfortable to stay there, and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s316">And then of course, Sam and – Sam found out that I was alive, he sent for me.</span> <span id="s317">He got somebody with a horse and a buggy, because that’s what it wa-was basically the mode of transportation, you can still see it over there.</span> <span id="s318">And I went to Kozienice.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Now how far was that from Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: It probably was maybe, at the most I would say like maybe 30 - 40 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Which isn’t really that much.</span> <span id="s323">If – if we had to we could have almost walked there, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s324">But we did have to walk a little bit because if the horse needed go up on a hill, we had to go down and push the hor – push the whole thing because – help the horse along.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So what was that like for you to be in the horse and buggy on your way to meet Sam?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I-It was – I would tell yo – you know what?</span> <span id="s327">It was so natural, you know, like I didn't even think about it that it was a – I was just hoping, because I hadn’t seen him yet, that he hadn’t lost the – the love for me, so to speak.</span> <span id="s328">But i-it was like adventurous in a way, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Because you didn’t know what he would be like, and what –</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: – it would be like.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And I – it was – e – e – I met him in 1942, in – in that camp, and this was already 1945, so you know, three years you haven’t seen each other.</span> <span id="s333">Of course, you know, you didn’t grow too much in camps, you know, because they didn’t – so I was about the same size, you know, what I was.</span> <span id="s334">I mean the height I was about the same size.</span> <span id="s335">I was still pretty skinny, but it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s336">I – you know, when I survived, I weighed 69 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And how tall are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Well, now I’m probably five three or five two.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And then, at the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I was – when I came to the United States, the papers, on my papers, they said that I was five four, but I don’t think I was ever five four, it probab –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And you weighed 69 pounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: 69 pounds.</span> <span id="s343">I was always a pretty tall girl for – you know, for Europeans.</span> <span id="s344">Y-Y – most Polish people aren’t very tall, so I was always considered a pretty [indecipherable] and I was pretty skinny, but it’s – was amazing how even just on that diet of bread and water and of course once I got to Radom I had already some soup too because they had a soup kitchen – you know, how fast your body fills up.</span> <span id="s345">It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: We have to turn over the tape –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: k – we’re at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Regina Spiegel, tape number one, side B. Will you repeat what you just told me?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yeah – yes.</span> <span id="s353">I-It’s a lots of times when my husband and I, we would talk to one another, e-even with other survivors, we just can’t figure out how we even managed to survive even after the war, because we had no money.</span> <span id="s354">You know, we lived like homeless people.</span> <span id="s355">Really, when you – when you think – except our brain worked pretty good, that was the only thing.</span> <span id="s356">But really, how we managed to get through day after day with nothing, really, til of course when I finally caught up with Sam, he ordered the head – we were like a little business in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: You and Sam?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s359">Not me, he did, because when I came, he already had it.</span> <span id="s360">He put a – but he will probably tell you, he put a mill that belonged to a friend of theirs, a flour mill into working.</span> <span id="s361">And he started using that mill as making flour.</span> <span id="s362">And the Polish people would bring in the – the wheat to make flour from it and all of a sudden when I came there to Kozienice, I didn’t have to go to requisition bread because all of a sudden I had money to go out and buy a bread.</span> <span id="s363">But really til then, I can’t figure out, because it took us at least, by the time I caught up with him, it was like, I would say, almost like towards the end of May.</span> <span id="s364">For a month to six weeks, we lived from day to day, whatever came along.</span> <span id="s365">It was like an – struggling from day to day.</span> <span id="s366">But then we decided one day that we couldn’t stay in Poland, because it was really very dangerous, you know.</span> <span id="s367">I don’t know whether you Jewish or not, you know, I never ask people, but it’s very hard for me to even tell this, because I-I feel almost ashamed.</span> <span id="s368">And mind you, what I went through, believe me there were plenty times where they tried to make me to be ashamed of being Jewish, or whatnot.</span> <span id="s369">But I almost feel ashamed that I lived in a culture where coming back after such a horrible, horrible war, that our neighbors truly didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s370">Not only didn’t they want us, they were really willing to almost go out and kill us.</span> <span id="s371">So my boyfriend and I decided one day, what the heck, w-we can’t stay here, they gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s372">We have to get out.</span> <span id="s373">And we – he – we got up one morning, like maybe five o’clock in the morning, he went – he knew this man in Kozienice that gave you like almost by then you had to have really a piece of paper to get on the train.</span> <span id="s374">And we were supposedly going to the settle in the western part, or the eastern part of Germany, which the Poles were hoping to sort of settle with Polish people, that in case if there ever was a question, whether they should have it, if they should have a vote, which they used to call the plebicid(ph), they should have Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s375">So we s-sen – went and gave them a piece of paper, the man in the magistrate, and they – and they – you know, like – like –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Sit –</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: – the mayor.</span> <span id="s378">The city –</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Like city hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: City hall, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Which is the same thing.</span> <span id="s383">I-In ti – in city hall, gave us a piece of paper that sh – we should be able to get on the train.</span> <span id="s384">And when we got from this train to take us off – out of Poland, the train stopped and we didn’t even know where we were going, we just knew we had to get out of there.</span> <span id="s385">And when the train stopped and there was another train next to us, and it was still summertime, so the windows were open, I hear somebody is talking and I turned around to Sam, I said Sam, you know what?</span> <span id="s386">The other train, people speak, it sounds like Polish, but it isn’t Polish.</span> <span id="s387">Maybe we’re in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s388">And you know what we did?</span> <span id="s389">We didn’t think too much.</span> <span id="s390">We had this little, little suitcase, we took this little suitcase, we got out from this train, climbed underneath the trucks, through the other train, walked in and into the other train, sat down.</span> <span id="s391">The train – the next time the train stopped, we were in – in Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s392">So we were breathing already a little bit lighter.</span> <span id="s393">As a matter of fact, I loved Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s394">I wanted to stay there in.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Wa – why did you love it?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s397">When we were there, their president came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s398">Apparently during the war he escape to Russia, and he came back.</span> <span id="s399">And I watched, for the first time in my life, I watched the people of Prague, the way they were greeting their president.</span> <span id="s400">They were hanging out from their windows and they were – with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president, that’s how much I knew about – you know, it somehow – I always say, with g – all going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna, what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other people.</span> <span id="s401">So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned around to say, they must be wonderful people.</span> <span id="s402">I never knew about Czechoslovakia except what I learned in the history books.</span> <span id="s403">I mean, after all, when the war broke out, I was 13 years old, how much did I learn about other countries, you know?</span> <span id="s404">But I always was – loved, you know, geography and history.</span> <span id="s405">So I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't know about them, but I didn't know about nature of people.</span> <span id="s406">But when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here.</span> <span id="s407">But you know why we didn’t?</span> <span id="s408">We probably wouldn’t mind.</span> <span id="s409">Because we heard that you had to be born there in order to become a citizen – to be a citizen.</span> <span id="s410">Otherwise, if you weren’t born there, you never become a citizen.</span> <span id="s411">So we were worried.</span> <span id="s412">What if it comes in something changes, we’re the first ones to be shipped out like they did in Germany, to a lot of Jews in Germany, because if they weren’t from Germany, they shipped them out.</span> <span id="s413">And by then, little by little we found out that the Americans were there.</span> <span id="s414">And also they – we got co – some people contacted us.</span> <span id="s415">You know, they picked us up, we were wondering how do they recognize, but it was easy to recognize us.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Well, who were the people who picked you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: It was people that worked for the Jewish Distribution Committee, which is called the Joint.</span> <span id="s418">And a lot of them were working also for what was then Palestine, and they were trying to get together the refugees, you know.</span> <span id="s419">And then they took us actually on a – on a bus, it was an American bus, a transport – er, later on – what I’ve heard lately, that because people were coming back and they gave – you know, like to Truman, you know, when Truman became president, that they gave him news that for the Jews in Poland it’s so bad that s-something has to be done, that they should be able to get out of there.</span> <span id="s420">So I – I understand that he actually saw to it that some of the borders were opened.</span> <span id="s421">You know here, right, we thought that we did such a act that we were able to smuggle ourselves into the other country so easy, but it – apparently this was maybe already as a fact.</span> <span id="s422">And we were taken from there, we were taken on a bus into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: From Prague into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: From – no, we were already by then in Pilzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Pilzen, which was not too far from Prague.</span> <span id="s427">They took us from Pilzen to Germany, which was near mun –</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Now this was the Joint that took you to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: The Joint that was working with the American army because –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: – because we were on an American bus.</span> <span id="s432">We didn’t ask any questions.</span> <span id="s433">You took it – you take us – we can’t – we’re getting out, we don’t care.</span> <span id="s434">They said they’re taking us to Germany, we’re going to Germany, no matter where, because we were hoping that maybe from there we will be able to go to Palestine, because that’s was our idea that whatever do – we do, we don’t want to stay in any other country, except go to Palestine, because we already had being in other countries.</span> <span id="s435">So that’s what we wanted to do, and the next thing we knew, we came into this, like what they called it later, displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s436">It was called Foehrenwald, which was near Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s437">It was like about 15 kilometers from Munich.</span> <span id="s438">And it’s very interesting because later on I found out that Dachau was near Munich and actually my last transport they were taking us – we were supposed to get to Dachau.</span> <span id="s439">So I said, here I came on my free will, practically – not to Dachau but almost, but I came differently.</span> <span id="s440">So we spent that time in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s441">Sam actually got a job, he was working in the office.</span> <span id="s442">It was run by the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s443">Have you ever heard of UNRRA?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: You probably did.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s448">So he was working in the office, I got a job doing something and we got a house to – where we stayed, and whoever came to that camp that was – that we knew, or was with – from my family or Sam’s family, they all came and they – we all stayed together in that house.</span> <span id="s449">So we wind up that my former brother-in-law came with his brother, and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: This is your sister’s husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, my mun –</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Your sister the dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, the one got – was killed.</span> <span id="s454">He survived and he came there, and he – he had a younger brother that survived also, and he came and stayed with us, and then Sam had three, actually two cousins and then a young woman that was, I think she was his cousin, but stayed all – we stayed all together in this house, and we cooked and we – we did things, you know, together.</span> <span id="s455">So this wasn’t already too bad, because we were able to have enough food – as a matter of fact, we were already getting too much food, that you started worrying you might be getting too fat, because basically the food – and a lot of the food we weren’t used to it, that – but like they gave us tuna fish, we never knew what tuna fish was, we’d – when – we’ve never seen it.</span> <span id="s456">They gave us powdered milk, we never saw it.</span> <span id="s457">But later on, it’s amazing how you learn.</span> <span id="s458">I found out that if you mix the powdered milk, you – you know, the powder with water, it becomes like milk.</span> <span id="s459">So we made cheeses out of it.</span> <span id="s460">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s461">We used to make delicious cheese.</span> <span id="s462">I wish I could get it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: In your other interviews, you said that you were raised in an Orthodox religious home.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yeah, mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And before the war, could you say something about what your religion was for you and what about after the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: – like when you were in this house with all these other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s469">Well, I will tell you, I was actually – I was actually – I was raised in a fairly religious home.</span> <span id="s470">Everybody was almost Orthodox in my city, but I was probably the most Orthodox in my family.</span> <span id="s471">I wouldn’t go to s – when I went to sleep I would leave in the f – in front of my bed a – a – a little pan with a – with water, because when I got up the first thing in the morning when my eyes opened, I would wash my hands and say a prayer thanking God for making me get up tha – to be able to be alive.</span> <span id="s472">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Did your parents encourage that?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Well they – they must have because they sent me to a – a religious type of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: But I myself, I was very, very much into the religion.</span> <span id="s477">First of all, I had a teacher that was a – I was absolutely crazy about her and she happened to be from that school.</span> <span id="s478">So I would like follow her.</span> <span id="s479">She influenced me a lot.</span> <span id="s480">But of course, during the war a – you know, we’re keeping, you know, with Jews you keep kashrut, you know, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s481">And I will never forget the first time when I came to live with my sister, and my sister knew how religious I was, she wanted to get me used to – a little bit to a – not to be so picky, you know, like it’s alright to eat something else if you don’t have everything that it’s kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: And she tried to give me a piece of salami, which I’m to this day a salami freak.</span> <span id="s484">I don’t eat it because I’m afraid of my cholesterol, but I could live on salami.</span> <span id="s485">And when I ate it, and all of a sudden I asked her, I said, how did – how did you get it?</span> <span id="s486">Did – I thought because in the city where she lived, I knew she couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s487">I said, did you get it from home?</span> <span id="s488">Did my parents send it to you?</span> <span id="s489">Because she used to always get somebody to get in touch with my parents and she was able to manage to do this.</span> <span id="s490">And she said – I could see the minute she started explaining to me, because she figured it’s time to get me used to it, when she saw how much I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s491">She says, well, in – nota – the minute she – she didn’t even –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did you know what it was when she gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I didn’t, because at that time I probably would have still would refuse to have it.</span> <span id="s496">But she wanted to show me that you can stay alive even if you eat it.</span> <span id="s497">I used to think if you eat something non-kosher that you die.</span> <span id="s498">So the minute she says we-ell, I said oh-oh.</span> <span id="s499">And no sooner did she say it, like everything came out of me, you know, I started throwing up.</span> <span id="s500">But of course, little by little I got used to what they fed me, believe me.</span> <span id="s501">That didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s502">So – but one thing I must say, I am, even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be.</span> <span id="s503">I believe in God.</span> <span id="s504">I believe I am – I like to go to shul, we work for the synagogue, you know, I believe very much in Jewish education for the children and you know, for everybody.</span> <span id="s505">I worked at [indecipherable] for – I was instrumental in raising quite a bit of money for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, because I was always interested in Jewish education.</span> <span id="s506">However, I am not as religious or adherent to the kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then.</span> <span id="s507">Because I found out that you can live and it doesn’t have to be everything exactly kosher.</span> <span id="s508">And – and besides, I myself – had maybe my parents lived through, I would have kept it on for them, because somehow older people stick much more to it.</span> <span id="s509">Even the survivors, the older survivors.</span> <span id="s510">But a lot of people like me that went through the war, are not as – they believe in God, but they don’t believe that the – the meat has to be slaughtered a certain way in order to be a good Jew or something like this.</span> <span id="s511">So no, this they definitely changed me this way.</span> <span id="s512">But as far, they couldn’t kill the spark for Judaism and I don’t know why it’s whether because I was so young that it really – like it, like went above me.</span> <span id="s513">I-It didn’t touch me as much.</span> <span id="s514">I always say, when you were a young kid, you don’t have the – the bonds with your family are not yet so complete that you can cope with – with these thing a little bit better than let’s say, older people.</span> <span id="s515">I always say that had my sister survived, let’s say you know, my sister actually had a choice, you know, she didn’t have to go with her baby.</span> <span id="s516">They actually wanted her to say that this baby isn’t mine.</span> <span id="s517">Because you see, they needed her in the – in the camp.</span> <span id="s518">They liked to staff the camp with the doctor, a dentist.</span> <span id="s519">By then, when they were taking my sister out, they had killed off most of the doctors and the dentists and whatnot.</span> <span id="s520">So they had to go look for somebody.</span> <span id="s521">So they actually didn’t want her to leave.</span> <span id="s522">They actually encouraged her to say no, this is not my baby.</span> <span id="s523">But of course she wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s524">And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she had to live with something like this.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s526">So as far as I was concerned, it’s true I was raised very, you know, in a way you would have been Orthodox, but not to the point where, like I have some Orthodox neighbors here.</span> <span id="s527">You know, they walk around with their hats, and their – you know, th-they call them the payos in – in Jewish, I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Dreadlocks?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: What are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Dreadlocks?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I don’t know whether it is the dreadlocks, but th-the kids, you know and their garment has these little things outside.</span> <span id="s532">And my father never wore anything like this, and – he used to wear a hat, but nothing identifying him as a – as being a Jew, because he could have wear only a hat, like anybody else, you know.</span> <span id="s533">Poland was pretty cold, so most of the time you had to wear a hat.</span> <span id="s534">But – and my mother didn’t shave her head, she had her own hair.</span> <span id="s535">So we weren’t that strictly Orthodox, we were a fairly Orthodox.</span> <span id="s536">Like here, you would have considered us Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: But now – but I was Orthodox, but I will tell you, that’s – as I say, the only thing they killed in me, about the kashrut, but the rest of me, being Jewish and loving Judaism, this they couldn’t kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Tell me about loving Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Tell you.</span> <span id="s541">You know what?</span> <span id="s542">I often think that if I had a choice, if they would have approached me – of course, I shouldn’t say this because it’s my thinking, you know, because I was never approached, but had I been approached to – that somebody would want to take me out and that’s all I had to do is take over another religion, I don’t think I would have done it.</span> <span id="s543">Now, I don’t say – I couldn’t swear to it, because I was never asked.</span> <span id="s544">But I always felt very strong about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s545">Even while I was in camp.</span> <span id="s546">You know, we had a incident in ones of the camps.</span> <span id="s547">It was right after Auschwitz, I was in this camp, Bomlitz, maybe you find –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Now see, you know more about me than I do.</span> <span id="s550">I-In Bomlitz that – we were under – not under the SS, we were under the Wehrmacht, which is the military.</span> <span id="s551">And one day – and believe me, we didn’t know what holiday it was, but the same thing, they had this speech to us.</span> <span id="s552">We know that you have a big holiday today.</span> <span id="s553">It was Yom Kippur, where you fast, you don’t eat.</span> <span id="s554">And guess what he told us?</span> <span id="s555">In the morning we used to get a portion of bread, he would say to us, you don’t have – if any of you want to fast, you don’t have to take the piece of bread now.</span> <span id="s556">We will give it to you in the evening.</span> <span id="s557">And we figured, you know we never trusted them.</span> <span id="s558">We figured that they’ll probably never give us the bread.</span> <span id="s559">But you want to know something?</span> <span id="s560">It was amazing, I would say that 95 percent of the inmates in that camp chose not to take that piece of bread, once we knew that it was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s561">If they had given it to us, we didn’t know that it was Yom Kippur, but once we knew it – so you see, I think it wasn’t only me.</span> <span id="s562">I think most of us had this spirit.</span> <span id="s563">And I don’t know whether it was our – like self preservation or we felt like, you think so great, look what you doing to us.</span> <span id="s564">What am I gonna become, like you?</span> <span id="s565">I don’t want to be like you.</span> <span id="s566">So ee – I – ee – ing – I n – I would never, during the war, I never gave it through without much thought, you know, I never thought of it, because I w – you know what I say?</span> <span id="s567">That only free people have the luxury of thinking.</span> <span id="s568">People that are enslaved the way we were actually enslaved, I don’t think sit around thinking about these things.</span> <span id="s569">Mostly what you thought is about food.</span> <span id="s570">Give me some food, you know, to fill my stomach.</span> <span id="s571">So this is another thing.</span> <span id="s572">So I don’t know whether I answered what you wanted to –</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Mm-hm, yes, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: – to know or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Are – we’re skipping around here, but are most of your friends survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I would say probably a large core of them, but I also have s – non-survivor friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Because first of all it, I think a lots of times has to do with where you lived.</span> <span id="s579">We came to the United States and we came almost right away to Washington.</span> <span id="s580">Washington in those years, would you believe it, they wouldn’t let too many survivors even come then here.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: To Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah, because – as a matter of fact, my husband has this wonderful story.</span> <span id="s583">When we were in New York, they took him in – took us in and they were trying to talk to us.</span> <span id="s584">Why don’t you go to the south?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: No, who was this that took – took you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yo – we came – th-the Joint.</span> <span id="s587">The HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: HIAS and Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: There were, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So they brought – helped you get from Foehrenwald to –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well, we – w-we actually –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: – New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s596">We – they helped us, but we actually had papers to come to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Because – let me –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: From Sam’s uncle, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No, mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: What had happened, when I came to Foehrenwald, you know, all through the war, I never got sick, whether for whatever reason, I was never sick and I always do attribute my survival because I was such a healthy kid.</span> <span id="s603">But guess what?</span> <span id="s604">When I stopped running and when we came back to Foehrenwald to that displaced persons camp, I became very sick.</span> <span id="s605">Yeah, I don’t know, I had something like a blood disorder.</span> <span id="s606">Something – as a matter of fact, the only thing I remember is begging them, cut off my arms, because my arms were just like burning up.</span> <span id="s607">They gave me some kind of medicine that must have had some kind of reaction.</span> <span id="s608">And this doctor came, too, who was in this – actually he was with the American army and the C.I.A. and – but he was a – a doctor from Germany.</span> <span id="s609">You know, he was – his – his birth was from Germany.</span> <span id="s610">So he was going around to hospitals, he was a very fine man and di – to visit the patients.</span> <span id="s611">So he came – when he came near my bed, he handed me a – a candy bar.</span> <span id="s612">I said no.</span> <span id="s613">He said you don’t want?</span> <span id="s614">Can I do anything for you, he asked me in German.</span> <span id="s615">I said yes, you could, you could find me – I have an uncle that lives in New York, which I called Nev York, in ma-my – I remember my mother used to always talk about her brother who lived in New York.</span> <span id="s616">So I said, if you could find him for me, that would be great.</span> <span id="s617">So he got the name and would you believe that this guy put an ad in the Forwards, in the Jewish paper and looking – telling that a niece is looking for a Mr. Sa -- Zeismann(ph) Kreps(ph).</span> <span id="s618">Well, my uncle never read the Forwards, because he read the “Wall Street Journal.”</span> <span id="s619">But there was somebody here in Washington that knew my mother, she was also from Radom, that came here before the war.</span> <span id="s620">She knew ma-my mother and she knew my uncle and she called him to New York to say, did you see a niece is looking for you?</span> <span id="s621">And he was the one that send me papers to come, and my papers were made out not only for me, they were made out whoever is with me, because my uncle figured that if I survived, maybe there was somebody else that survived.</span> <span id="s622">But of course, nobody else survived, so I – I always tell him, you know, when I talk to the kids, they get a bang out of this, I tell them, you know, I turned around to my boyfriend, I said, if you marry me, you know you have a ticket to the United States and never – nobody ever refuses that.</span> <span id="s623">And they think that’s very funny, but that wasn’t it, but you know, I had the papers and I was able to bring Sam with me.</span> <span id="s624">So we c-came, actually, from the papers that my uncle sent, but the HIAS really took care of us.</span> <span id="s625">They saw to it that we got in line to get to the ship, you know, because it was very terrible that time, you know, they only allowed a certain amount of people.</span> <span id="s626">The – the immigration laws were very, very strict in this country.</span> <span id="s627">You had to go through – I mean, like your health and everything.</span> <span id="s628">If you were running a little bit, a grade over, one grade over a fever, one point over what they thought it’s supposed to be, you were sent back.</span> <span id="s629">And nobody wanted to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s630">I was sitting in Germany just waiting and – and the little suitcase what I had, just didn’t want to even unpack.</span> <span id="s631">I – I was just ready to go because I started telling you, we were hoping to go to Palestine, but in those years – you still have time?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: In those years you couldn’t go into Palestine because they had the – the British put up a blockade so you couldn’t bring in the refugees, the only ones they had to smuggle them through.</span> <span id="s634">So once I got married, they figured we are already taken care of, you know, the – the – the people from Palestine that were taking care, they tried to take in the kids that had nobody, that they were single.</span> <span id="s635">So to give them a life.</span> <span id="s636">So – and since we were married and of course by then we had already the papers to come to the United States, so they let us alone and they said no, we can’t go, so we figured we’ll come to the United States.</span> <span id="s637">Anything to get out from – from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Let’s um –</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: – stop here.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Regina Spiegel, tape two, side A.</span> <span id="s643">When did you and Sam get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: We got married actually in May 21st, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: And when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: We came in – to the United States in November of 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you’d been married a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Now previously you said that you and Sam wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s650">How did you feel that it was working out more easily and practically that you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Because, you know, you learn to compromise.</span> <span id="s652">We really wanted to come to – to go to Palestine, because like I told you before, we figured we’ve had enough of different countries where i-if they decide they don’t like us, they can say go.</span> <span id="s653">So we figured we’ll go to Palestine, but since it became very difficult for us to go, they absolutely told us no way that we will be able to go because first of all, we were getting already, little by little, as time went on, we were getting older.</span> <span id="s654">We’d gotten marry – we were married.</span> <span id="s655">We – they tried to take care of people more that were single.</span> <span id="s656">Single people, most of the time, unless you had family maybe, and if –</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So they were not making it so easy for you, but how did you feel not to get to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I-In the beginning we felt very badly.</span> <span id="s659">We – in the beginning.</span> <span id="s660">But once, I will tell you, once we knew that we’re coming here, as long as we were leaving Germany, that was our way to say we’re [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s661">And once we came to this country and I-I will tell you, I fell in love with this country.</span> <span id="s662">From the first minute I stepped off, I take my foot off the boat, th – it – most people were very kind, and we came to Washington almost right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Now, did HIAS encourage you to come to Washington and help you arrange that?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, because originally, I start to tell you –</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: – originally no, they didn't want to, but my uncle suggested that we should go to Washington.</span> <span id="s667">And besides, you see, I had a brother that I – lived in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: When did you first learn that you had a brother in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: It – we’ll, when – when we were started to work – after, when we got back to Germany, in the end of 1945.</span> <span id="s670">See, my brother was in the ar – in the American army, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Oh, he had come over a long time before.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: He came – he smuggled himself into this country in 1939.</span> <span id="s673">And when the United States declared war, he became – he fought in the American army.</span> <span id="s674">So after the war, they shipped him back to the United States.</span> <span id="s675">But he found out that one of his sisters was alive, he didn’t know which one, and he came back.</span> <span id="s676">He had e-enlisted back into the army as a translator because by – he spoke German and by then he already knew English.</span> <span id="s677">So they shipped him back to Germany, and that’s when he came back.</span> <span id="s678">We actually would have gotten married a little bit before, but when I heard that he was coming back to Germany, I said I wanted to have my brother at my wedding.</span> <span id="s679">And we actually have a picture of my brother at our wedding.</span> <span id="s680">But he has passed away since then.</span> <span id="s681">He passed away about 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s682">He was my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s683">So I did find out, and he lived at [indecipherable] in – in the Washington area.</span> <span id="s684">So when – it was actually the Joint and the HIAS wanted to send us south, and when they informed Sam that they sending us south, he said, I’m not going south.</span> <span id="s685">I came to live in the America, I’m not going south.</span> <span id="s686">He thought it was South America or something like this.</span> <span id="s687">So we just, on our own, we left th-the HIAS [indecipherable] tell us to go there, but we decided – he picked himself up, he came to Washington, got in touch with somebody, also through the Joint here, di – like Jewish Social Services, and they took him someplace.</span> <span id="s688">He got a job right away, came back, picked me up, and we came to Washington and he already was – had a job, working.</span> <span id="s689">He – we came in – w-we weren’t here three days, he had a job already, was making 40 dollars a week, so we were – were in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: So, did he speak English when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s692">He got a job with somebody that was from the Italian German border, and the guy spoke a little bit German, so they were able to understand each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: And did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So what was that like for you, a young bride –</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: In the beginning we started going to Americanization school.</span> <span id="s697">In the beginning was very hard, but I will tell you that you always used to find either some people that they spoke Jewish, you speak Yiddish, so the – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: You speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah, mm-hm, and so does my husband.</span> <span id="s700">And he speaks – actually he speaks a little bit Hebrew, much better than I. And di – I don’t speak Hebrew, I know how to read Hebrew because I was taught Hebrew like for a – for praying.</span> <span id="s701">But we came here and we got even a room with a German family, a Jewish German family.</span> <span id="s702">So right away we were able to converse with them in German.</span> <span id="s703">So – because at that time we still spoke a little bit German, now our – my German is very rusty.</span> <span id="s704">I still speak a little bit, but in those years we were still much better at it.</span> <span id="s705">So we were able to converse with her and she would tell us where to go to the grocery to shop or something like this.</span> <span id="s706">So we manage and little by little you – you know what?</span> <span id="s707">What happens to you when you – when you – when you have to.</span> <span id="s708">I think almost within three months, I started speaking English, so to make myself understood.</span> <span id="s709">I mean, I didn’t speak like I speak now, but I was able to make myself understand, and so did Sam.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: What language do you and Sam speak together now?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Together, English.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: English?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: When did you make that switch?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I don’t know, it came so naturally.</span> <span id="s716">It came because when we started going to school – you see, and that’s what I started telling you before when you ask me whether most of my friends are survivors a-and – you see, it all depends where you live.</span> <span id="s717">If you lived in na – an area like New York, where there were a lot of survivors, you didn’t have to learn to speak English, because you could get along on Yiddish – on Jewish, because mo-most of the people that had the little businesses or whatever, you got a job, they were speaking Jewish.</span> <span id="s718">And the survivors that you met together, you – they were speaking Jewish or Polish.</span> <span id="s719">So we really didn’t – they didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s720">But here in Washington, because we had very few survivors in this area that’s came from – spoke Polish, you know, so we di – really, we’re like forced to – to – y-you have to learn or – or sink.</span> <span id="s721">And we did.</span> <span id="s722">A-And we didn’t like – I bet you it didn’t take us less than six months that we were able to make ourselves understood.</span> <span id="s723">And most people, that’s why I always say that the American people are so wonderful, you know, especially in those years.</span> <span id="s724">I will tell you i-i – later on I was thinking to myself how – you know, my English was so bad and yet they tried so hard.</span> <span id="s725">They wouldn’t [indecipherable] from me or anything like that, a-and they tried so hard to like stop and listen to me what I had to tell them or something, you know.</span> <span id="s726">So i-it – it really was a pretty – as far as I was concerned, a very pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s727">You see, you have to realize, it’s one thing when you come to a country when you leave your family at home.</span> <span id="s728">You miss them, let’s face it.</span> <span id="s729">If I would have had my whole family in powl – Poland, and I would have come here, I was a young woman and so was my husband, I would have found it, very probably, disturbing.</span> <span id="s730">But coming from where we came, with nobody, I had nothing to look back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did you think a lot about what you had come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s733">And you want to know something – but it was interesting to hear once my kids telling me the same thing, what I always thought it’s – you know, the minute the war was over, I almost became back like this little girl, except minus the kashrut, this little girl that left home – that was taken from home, that I was forced out of from home.</span> <span id="s734">I-It was always, whatever I did, it was always as if my parents, especially my mother, as if she was standing in the back of me and like guiding me.</span> <span id="s735">And saying no, you – you shouldn’t do that, or yes, you could do that.</span> <span id="s736">And it was interesting, so help me, I’m not making this up, but my daughter, I have three girls and my middle one was always like a little bit of a rebel.</span> <span id="s737">And she had gone to Israel for – you know, like for a summer package deal for five weeks.</span> <span id="s738">And she came back and you know, I started asking her question, what did you do or something, but she says, Mother, you don’t have to worry, it was always – while I was in Israel, it was always as if you were standing right in the back of me, so help me.</span> <span id="s739">And I said to my – you know, I don’t know, is that’s how life goes on, the cycle?</span> <span id="s740">I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s741">That’s how I was thinking when I was without my parents.</span> <span id="s742">I was thinking that they were in the back of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: So what kinds of things was your mother telling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: It wasn’t a question what she was telling me, It was a question what you were learning from – from them, what they were doing.</span> <span id="s745">You always knew that you shouldn’t harm anybody, that you – you should be kind to other people.</span> <span id="s746">You always knew that cert – certain things you just didn’t do.</span> <span id="s747">She didn't have to spell it out to me.</span> <span id="s748">I mean, I knew what was expected of me.</span> <span id="s749">She didn’t just sit me down on my – on my – which, I used to sit on her lap a lot because I was the youngest one in my family, so – a-and she used to like how a – I was 13 years old, I remember she used to keep me – when she hold me on her lap like – like I do sometimes with my grandson who is three or five years old.</span> <span id="s750">One five, and one three.</span> <span id="s751">I’m just saying.</span> <span id="s752">But she kept me like – almost like a baby, you know.</span> <span id="s753">But I always remember my mother as being the kindest person that ever lived.</span> <span id="s754">And you want kn-kn-know something?</span> <span id="s755">If I should have any legacy, even to my children, I always think of it, my children should remember me the way I remember my mother.</span> <span id="s756">But of course I lived much longer, so they probably might not, you know, because – you know, as a child you – I mean, how much harm could I do?</span> <span id="s757">But I-I had certain values that I knew that I mustn’t overstep.</span> <span id="s758">A – in – like a – a living with a – with a boyfriend, I knew that was wrong and you just don’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: So, was that hard for you when you only had Sam and you didn’t have anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, event – eventually we did get – you know, even before we got legally married, we did get – like, because we were together, we did get – I – finally I admitted it to my children, you know, because we did get together, but you see, when we were in his hometown, Kozienice, there was no rabbi, there were only a couple Jewish families.</span> <span id="s761">We took them together and we told it to them that we are getting like married in our own way, not with any ceremonies or anything like that, but they knew that we –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So you had witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes, okay, witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: You had witnesses for your commitment.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Exactly, exactly, that’s what [indecipherable] thank you.</span> <span id="s766">Next time when I’m asked this question, I’ll be able to say that, because I could never figure out what I should call that.</span> <span id="s767">But they – as a matter of fact, one of his cousins who later on went to Belgium was one of them, you know, she and her husband.</span> <span id="s768">That was – and – and there was another couple.</span> <span id="s769">And, you know, with the Jews you need to have at least 10 people, you know, but we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s770">So we, like you said, they were our witnesses for a two hour commitment.</span> <span id="s771">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Did you have any kind of prayer associated with meeting with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Not – n-not – not at that time, not at that time, but later on, when we decided to do get married in [indecipherable] in the displaced persons camp – because you see, while we’re struggling around still in Poland, it was very hard to do that because we were constantly thinking that we’re not going to stay there, definitely, because if not [indecipherable] Sam definitely would have gotten killed, because we even heard that somebody was trying to do that.</span> <span id="s774">Somebody warned us, and we knew we had to get away from there.</span> <span id="s775">And then, when we got to Germany, but then heard that my brother was coming, so I told my husband – because I could have gotten – we had plenty witnesses in the – in the Foehrenwald, in the displaced persons camp, but I said Sam, how can I get married?</span> <span id="s776">I-I have only one brother.</span> <span id="s777">I have to wait for him.</span> <span id="s778">So that’s why we waited a little bit longer, but we could have gotten, actually, in a way – I always tell my kids, i-i-it – it took years til I told them that that’s what we did, because after all, we were traveling together and we – we didn’t get hote – different hotel rooms, you know, so to speak.</span> <span id="s779">But yes, I did have my values I took from my family, and all these things that til this day, all the things that we worked for, like Jewish education, because it was very important in our family.</span> <span id="s780">Any kind of education, but especially Jewish.</span> <span id="s781">And the charity.</span> <span id="s782">We were not rich people, but my – I remember my mother always saying, there’s always somebody that has less than you, so therefore we have to save something to give it to them, too.</span> <span id="s783">And always was that, always stressed, be – be nice to other people, be kind to other people.</span> <span id="s784">Try to do the best with what you’ve got.</span> <span id="s785">And of course I always used to say, I never knew I was poor because nobody ever told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: It’s – a matter of fact, i-in school when I went to school, I was one of the kids that used to be dressed very nicely, and you know why?</span> <span id="s788">Because we were uni – we were used to wearing uniforms, little like type of – like type of th-things and like an apron, you know.</span> <span id="s789">And my mother used to make it for me.</span> <span id="s790">She was a wonderful seamstress.</span> <span id="s791">So I had really things that were nicer even than maybe some – a lot of rich kids, you know.</span> <span id="s792">But I always used to say that a – a – nobody ever told me I was poor, so I never knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Tell me what it was like for you to have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s795">It really was wonderful.</span> <span id="s796">I – it took me a little while, not because – first of all, I knew I didn't want to have any children in Germany, so I waited til I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s797">And then – by then, I wanted to learn to speak English, to be able to, you know, talk to my kids.</span> <span id="s798">So then I – when I had th – I finally had – my oldest daughter was born in – in August of ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So you’d been here how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I was here almost four years, you know, in August ’51 and I was actually four years here.</span> <span id="s801">I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Did you work before your daughter was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes, uh-huh, I wor – or worked as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s804">I knew how to sew enough to do work in – not in that camp, not in Foehrenwald.</span> <span id="s805">Later on, when we left the – the displaced persons camp, after we got married and my br – when my brother was there, he got a girlfriend from Stuttgart and it was too hard for him to come – to go to Stuttgart and to go to visit me.</span> <span id="s806">So he was torn between.</span> <span id="s807">So we decided to leave the displaced persons camp and we moved to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s808">And while in Stuttgart they had the – what it’s called – it’s a very worthwhile organization, it’s called ORT.</span> <span id="s809">They teach you how to make a living.</span> <span id="s810">They teach you how to use skills.</span> <span id="s811">It’s really wonderful.</span> <span id="s812">It – actually ORT is doing this kind of work now all over the world, not just for Jews because now Jews go to colleges and they – they’re what –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: So it’s like a trade school.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s815">And I learned really to sew over there.</span> <span id="s816">I mean, I always knew how to sew because I told you, my mother was a seamstress and we always ar – had a machine, a sewing machine at home, and I always say ar – I used to be br – I probably got born with a needle in my hand, because I always liked to sew, and so when I came over to this country and I wanted to get a job, naturally I – as a matter of fact when I came to New York and I met my uncle, and it’s interesting, because when my uncle came to pick us up and he was looking around, you know, we were – when we got off the ship and we were in – in this big hall with – there must have been thousands of people, I picked out my uncle.</span> <span id="s817">I never saw him alive.</span> <span id="s818">The man looked exactly around his eyes like my mother.</span> <span id="s819">I said, that must be him.</span> <span id="s820">I never even saw a picture of him – I didn’t remember.</span> <span id="s821">I’m sure I must have seen it, but you know, a kid looks at a picture of some uncle that lives in New York that she never saw, didn’t pay any attention.</span> <span id="s822">But I picked him out.</span> <span id="s823">I walked over to him, and sure enough it was my uncle.</span> <span id="s824">But my uncle was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s825">Had one of the finest tailor shops in Manhattan, he and a partner.</span> <span id="s826">They used to make clothing for J. Edgar Hoover.</span> <span id="s827">I mean, in those years when we came over to this country, my uncle’s suits used to cost like about f – between 500 and seven - 800 dollars.</span> <span id="s828">I mean, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s829">Everything was handmade.</span> <span id="s830">So when I came – and of course I found my uncle, he showed me how to use an electric sewing machine, I never used it.</span> <span id="s831">So when I came to Washington, I already knew how to use an electric sewing machine, so I knew, so I actually got a job right away at that place here, and then I switched to another place and I worked til my daughter was almost born.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Do you know the book by the daughter of a refugee from a survivor from Czechoslovakia and the daughter – it came out a couple of years ago – the daughter wanted to trace her ancestors in Czechoslovakia and trace them through her mother’s clients.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Did – did she just recently write this book, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Is that by Helen –</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Yes, Helen somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: – Helen Epstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Yes, that’s the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Okay, okay, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s840">I have a little bit an argument with Helen Epstein, I should [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s841">I mean I – I argue with her in my heart, not in a – when her first book came out, I really felt ve – offended.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: I – I – I heard her speak about the book I mention –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Lately, lately –</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Yeah, what was the ba – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: This other book –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: – what was the first book about, I can’t – don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: The book – the first book what she wrote, she wrote something about how children of survivors are messed up kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: You know, they really –</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Yeah, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: – they have big problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: They – you know, and I was thinking to myself – by then I was already older.</span> <span id="s854">My kids, thanks God I have three daughters that weren’t messed up.</span> <span id="s855">All right, so maybe somebody needs a little bit of a psychiatrist, who doesn’t?</span> <span id="s856">I – I have friends that were American born and they have problems with children.</span> <span id="s857">I mean, you – you can’t put that he – I hate when people like put me in a – in a category.</span> <span id="s858">I figured I had it already.</span> <span id="s859">You know, I went through the category.</span> <span id="s860">I was Jewish, I was a woman, I wasn’t old enough to go in into – into the camp, I had to have different papers, my – I mean, I – I was already put into so many categories, I didn't like to be.</span> <span id="s861">So I wer – resented her.</span> <span id="s862">But because I felt like, if you want to write about your own life, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s863">Maybe you have a problem with your mother, or whatever, you’re entitled to it.</span> <span id="s864">But don’t say that all the survivors’ kids – because when you look around, it’s just the opposite, to the contrary.</span> <span id="s865">I think survivors’ kids are very well adjusted kids.</span> <span id="s866">They – they’ve done wonders.</span> <span id="s867">Or okay, maybe we helped them a little bit, but you can’t help a kid unless they can help themselves.</span> <span id="s868">They all – most of them are professionals, or if they are not, they do something, they’re really very worthwhile citizens.</span> <span id="s869">And the way she put in that book – but this book that she went on this journey, I think she must have come to terms with her mother or whatever, because she went to find from where she came and she found out that her mother wasn’t such a horrible person, and she made that up, that she was, in her mind she assumed that because her mother, you know, maybe didn’t do certain things for her, that she figured all the kids of survivors are no good.</span> <span id="s870">So I had a little bit of a problem, but no, I – as a matter of fact, I would love to get ahold of that book.</span> <span id="s871">They – they had a write-up about this book in one of the – I think maybe “Newsweek” magazine or in one of them.</span> <span id="s872">And I read it, but there wasn’t so much written, but I always wanted to get this book out and read about it, because for the only reason that I wanted to read it, because I wanted to change my mind about this Helen Epstein.</span> <span id="s873">So this – I had my own little beef with her, that I felt like, don’t put all survivors there, just like I’m not going to put that all survivors get a ba – as a matter of fact, I think the survivors’ kids tried so much harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Because they knew like we went through a lot, so they tried to make our life a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s876">I mean, I find it so – I – I used to re-resent this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Do you find that a lot, that you are put into a category?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Not any more, but we – in a way, we used to be.</span> <span id="s879">You know, I never – you see, here again, I think because I lived in Washington and because I had different friends, I was exposed to different friends and I – also I will tell you, I have two cousins here.</span> <span id="s880">Well, one passed away.</span> <span id="s881">But I had two wonderful cousins.</span> <span id="s882">My mother, apparently, this brother that lived in New York, had another brother who lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s883">And he passed away, but he left offsprings.</span> <span id="s884">So he had two daughters and three boys.</span> <span id="s885">It d – the others lived in – one in Baltimore, in different places and with the boys I never got that close, only one.</span> <span id="s886">But with the two women, the cousins, I became very friendly, we became like a family.</span> <span id="s887">As a matter of fact, I have my cousin’s daughter, who is my second cousin, is like the best cousin I’ve ever ha – you know, really, she’s just wonderful.</span> <span id="s888">And we keep so much, so maybe my family, in a way, were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s889">I think some survivors experience a little bit like this, oh you went through what you went through, maybe it was a lot your fault.</span> <span id="s890">You know, it – some people looked at it that way –</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: – in the beginning – I’m not saying now, before people found out what had gone – was going on.</span> <span id="s893">And – but my family was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s894">They accepted us the way we were, with our broken English, and maybe that helped me a little bit look on things with a little bit rosier glasses.</span> <span id="s895">And I had wonderful friends.</span> <span id="s896">Not only the survivors, the others.</span> <span id="s897">I-I had some very intelligent friends.</span> <span id="s898">As a matter of fact one just left for Hungary and – and she lives in Austin, Texas now and she just left for Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</span> <span id="s899">And she called me before she left, she wanted me to know, because she knew that I will enjoy hearing from her, that she is going to visit these two countries that had such also tragedy, you know, with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s900">And some others, very inter – I used to always like oh, I had one friend, she – they live now in Florida.</span> <span id="s901">And I used to always say, oh Mildred, I wish I was intelligent as you are, as educated.</span> <span id="s902">She says, Regina, you’ve got more education, in a way, that any of us could ever get.</span> <span id="s903">You have life education.</span> <span id="s904">You we – I – I listen to you sometimes when you talk.</span> <span id="s905">I like to hear and I like to take your [indecipherable] advice, because you – we always know that you won’t steer us the wrong way.</span> <span id="s906">So don’t look at it that way.</span> <span id="s907">Think of yourself that you are very important.</span> <span id="s908">So they always try to build me up, but it wa – so maybe that’s why I always had a little bit a – a better outlook on things, because I think when you being, you know, all right, we were kicked around plenty ee – oh – in Europe, over there.</span> <span id="s909">But when I came here and I wasn’t kept on being kicked around, I kind of like – it was almost like my healing process.</span> <span id="s910">So I figured hey, I belong back to the human race, or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: How do you take the situation over in Yugoslavia currently?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Mm-hm, well, it’s – for awhile there, you know, I thought oh my goodness, the world just sitting back and doing nothing.</span> <span id="s913">But I will tell you, the way I look at it now, I – that the world has learned a little bit from us.</span> <span id="s914">It’s true that we paid a very, very big price, because let’s face it, nobody, nobody gave us a hand or anything.</span> <span id="s915">It’s a matter of fact, not only didn’t they give us a hand, they put stumbling blocks, you know, in our way.</span> <span id="s916">No – a – I told you we were – we were rescued by – by railroad tracks that were broken.</span> <span id="s917">They could have done that, the same thing in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s918">Like we used to sit in Auschwitz and think of it when we would see a plane fly by, we would say, why can’t they send a plane and just drop a couple bombs?</span> <span id="s919">Not on us, we didn’t want to get killed, but just on the railroad tracks, to slow them down.</span> <span id="s920">Just slow them down.</span> <span id="s921">But never happened.</span> <span id="s922">So I feel that the world, in a way, has learned a little bit [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s923">But it also, as bad as it is, and believe me, no matter what child gets killed, for whatever reason, it doesn’t make any different, it’s still somebody’s child that it’s killed and it – no reason.</span> <span id="s924">But you know, in – in Yugoslavia it was a completely different story.</span> <span id="s925">People wanted territory.</span> <span id="s926">They wa – they wanted – but with us they didn’t gain that they have – if they killed those people they will gain something.</span> <span id="s927">With us, they – they wi – had no gain with us.</span> <span id="s928">The only gain they got that maybe they – they stole some pictures or some art or some money or something like this.</span> <span id="s929">But basically by – by displacing us, or killing us, they didn’t gain anything by it, it was just for the sake of killing.</span> <span id="s930">But of course, I don’t – you know, I don’t like to see what it’s going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Just – do you think more about what happened to you during this period?</span> <span id="s932">What everything –</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Well, when I – when I see in the paper I always – I kind of compare how everybody’s aware what’s going on there, as compared to those years that nobody supposedly knew what was going on except in the high hierarchy, you know.</span> <span id="s934">But the ee – ee – I’m always concerned what was go – what’s going on in this world.</span> <span id="s935">I think it’s – it’s – i – the minute it affects any human being, it affects me too, to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s936">But as far as do I remember more what had happened to me when I see this?</span> <span id="s937">No, because I always – they don’t have – they don’t have to do that mussel – what’s his name?</span> <span id="s938">The guy –</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Milosevic.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Milosevic doesn’t have to do it for me to remind me, because I remember what go – went on with us all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: All the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: So it’s always somewhere in your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Oh, there’s no question about that.</span> <span id="s945">I can be, you know, dancing away and something and all of a sudden my [indecipherable] I will think, wouldn’t that be wonderful if our parents could be here.</span> <span id="s946">Or in, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Wouldn’t it be wonderful if what?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: If our parents could be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: You know, just to see, you know, like when we have a – when my kids got wedding – were getting married and when my grandchildren had Bar or Bat Mitzvahs, you know?</span> <span id="s951">Would have been so wonderful but for the grandparent to be able to come to their child’s Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s952">My sister actually – you know when – when she knew that she was pregnant, she made up her mind that is she is going to have a little boy – you know, in those years they didn’t know ahead of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: She was not going to circumcise him, because circumcision was in Poland was mainly done by Jews.</span> <span id="s955">Not – the Polish kids were not circumcised.</span> <span id="s956">But you know what, when the baby was born, she couldn’t bring herself to do that.</span> <span id="s957">That’s when you ask me how did you think, you know.</span> <span id="s958">Look my sister and she was older and she might have known that we’re into much more trouble than I did.</span> <span id="s959">Sh – when I saw what she – she is preparing to have the baby circumcise, I said you said you – if we’re gonna – if you’re gonna have a little boy that you’re not gonna do it.</span> <span id="s960">She says, I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s961">She – it’s for – it was my parents’ first grandchild.</span> <span id="s962">She says, I can’t to it.</span> <span id="s963">And they couldn’t even come to the city because they were already in the ghetto in Radom and they couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s964">But she still couldn’t bring herself to do something against my parents’ wishes.</span> <span id="s965">I don’t say look, I-I-I’m not going to say had she known what’s going to happen really that she had – wouldn’t have done it, but at the time, she knew maybe that it’s gonna be dangerous, but she figured she’s gotta cope with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: We have to turn over the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yeah, oh boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Regina Spiegel, tape number two, side B. Mrs. Spiegel, I changed the subject when you started to talk about your children and what it was like for you to have children and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Mm-hm, well to have my children, it was really a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s971">All of a sudden I realize that what he started out to do, Hitler, he wanted to really eliminate the Jews, and here were two survivors, we have three wonderful daughters, they’re married and we have eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s972">And this is our really immortal less – like our revenge to Hitler.</span> <span id="s973">You wanted to do away with us.</span> <span id="s974">Look, we’re here.</span> <span id="s975">And they’re all going into – you know, let’s put it this way, I’m very proud of my kids.</span> <span id="s976">They are going in the footsteps, so to speak, of their forefathers.</span> <span id="s977">You know, like they’re all very active in organizational work, do a lot of – for their synagogues.</span> <span id="s978">My son-in-law and my daughter practically built their synagogue on their own in Columbia, Maryland.</span> <span id="s979">My daughter in Tucson, Arizona is very active with her husband in her synagogue, and a lot of other organizations.</span> <span id="s980">So this – regardless what I have done, when I see my kids are doing that, I figure I can take it easy.</span> <span id="s981">So in a way, by watching us through the years, they – you know, they picked up our lead and they doing that – this.</span> <span id="s982">And I myself, you know, I work at – as a volunteer at the museum and I’ve been asked lots of times, how – how can you work here?</span> <span id="s983">I mean, especially what you have gone through, to sit here?</span> <span id="s984">And I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s985">This museum was really not built for me, because I carry the museum with me all the time.</span> <span id="s986">It was built, really, for other people to learn what had gone – what had gone on, and hopefully that they gonna learn something from it.</span> <span id="s987">And as far as I’m concerned, I always say when they ask me how can you work there, I said, how can I not?</span> <span id="s988">To me it’s almost my life.</span> <span id="s989">I work for the museum, I give money to the museum.</span> <span id="s990">I mean, it’s very important for me to – the museum should be in existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: When did you begin working at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: I started working for the museum way before the museum was built, when it was still – the offices they had on Ell(ph) Street, I used to go whenever they had some people that wanted to learn a little bit more about it and to raise, which in the beginning was really mostly raising money, because how do you put up this building?</span> <span id="s993">By raising money because they got the land for the – for the to – the land where to put it on, but to put it on cost a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: So you were active in raising money?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s996">It’s a – it’s – matter of fact, my little cousin that I told you, she and I had a, in my home, right here, a – a what they called it, a parlor meeting, where you invite a lot of friends and relatives and of course, you ask them for money.</span> <span id="s997">And we raised money through this way.</span> <span id="s998">My daughter in her place in Columbia, she and her friends, she made – gave a parlor meeting for the museum and raised money for the museum.</span> <span id="s999">So we worked for the museum way, way before the museum was even in existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: And how did you and the museum know about each other before it was in existence so that you got started –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: You know, it’s – it’s only work them out.</span> <span id="s1002">First of all, I’m also active in the Jewish – the Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Friends of Greater Washington.</span> <span id="s1003">We have an organization here and as a matter of fact when the museum was opened, I was president of that organization.</span> <span id="s1004">Now I’m an officer, but we have a group that we keep up this organization, and th-they – if you’re interested and if you know that we can help you out a little bit, you find us.</span> <span id="s1005">And th-they found us.</span> <span id="s1006">They – they – they knew about us and they got in touch with us and so we spoke on their behalf.</span> <span id="s1007">And to this day I still do and that – as you know, my job is with the development department.</span> <span id="s1008">I still raise money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Now what do you do now with the development department?</span> <span id="s1010">A: Yeah, development department is – I – I am on the for membership and donation.</span> <span id="s1011">I sit at the desk and hopefully –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: This is the desk on the fir – ground floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: On the ground floor next to the – the visitors – you know, where people ask the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: So i-if you come to the desk what a – you – I try to tell you a little bit about it, to let you know what the museum does.</span> <span id="s1016">And most of the time if you come to the desk we’ll hope that you gonna leave us some money.</span> <span id="s1017">And we try to – you know, to help you along to understand why you should leave some money, why it’s so important for the museum to stay open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And how often do you work at the desk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Well, you see that – okay, I work at the desk one – one day a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: A full day or a half day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yes, a full day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: A full day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I come in 10 o’clock and I li – leave about four.</span> <span id="s1024">But I also work in – with the communications department, which is the educational department.</span> <span id="s1025">Let’s say –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Is that another day that you go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Oh, of course.</span> <span id="s1028">I-I don’t particular go in there.</span> <span id="s1029">Let’s say I went to someplace in – in New Jersey to a school, who – a teacher who took – was with the museum on this – they have the bulf -- Balfour scholarship that they bring teachers, Balfour fellow, and the – oh, what’s this – I don’t want, I can’t think of it, of the name right now, but it was actually in New Jersey that I went, somebody, one of the teachers that was at this conference and she called [indecipherable] and wanted to have a survivor to come and talk to her class.</span> <span id="s1030">And I went, as a matter of fact with John Minnick about two weeks ago, per – le-left on a Monday, we came back Tuesday.</span> <span id="s1031">So you see, it’s two days.</span> <span id="s1032">I don’t always particular do it in the museum.</span> <span id="s1033">However, when they have the – these things with the teachers, the Balfour and what’s the other one?</span> <span id="s1034">It’s – I’m embarrassed I can’t think of the m – maybe it will come to me.</span> <span id="s1035">It’s a fellowship, you know, that they get th-the teachers to come to – and they teach them how to teach the Holocaust in other schools.</span> <span id="s1036">And I speak to them lots of times as a survivor.</span> <span id="s1037">They like it.</span> <span id="s1038">As a matter of fact, if we had time I could show you some letters that I have gotten from some of these teachers, how they express how it’s – it’s – it’s so wonderful that what they have learned, and what the museum, how it’s wonderful, but however, just listening to a survivor makes it all to them so real that they put a – a very big emphasis on having a survivor.</span> <span id="s1039">This one tea-teachers’ conf – conference did specify that, said that they should use this more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: So you – is this the – one of the primary things you do with communications, going to the schools and speaking –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Y-Yes, we speaking as a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: – to the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: – yeah.</span> <span id="s1044">Students and also to teachers, yes.</span> <span id="s1045">All –</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So you speak to groups of teachers –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yeah, mm-hm, yes – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: – on how to teach, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Not so much how to teach –</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: – or just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: – what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: – the same kind of testimony –</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: They sh – yes, they should learn, because I – I am not equipped to tell them how to teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1055">So, it’s similar to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: – exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: – speaking to the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s1059">Yes, yeah, but we – she doesn’t tell me here that it’s the Balfour – Balfour the – what’s that, it’s such an easy name to remember.</span> <span id="s1060">No, like this, we were just a – in New Jersey and one of the teachers wrote me a wer – you know, send me pictures, you know, I don’t like the pictures, but she send them to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So you do a l – and have done a lot of speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: A l – a lot of speaking.</span> <span id="s1063">I do a lot of speaking and that takes up a lot of my time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I-I go to schools, I go from the museum and I also go from my own, where I – before the mu – museum was even in existence, we used to have, from our organization, a speakers bureau where s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: From the Greater Washington Survivors organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes, mm-hm, yes, and they would di – call us and we would go, we would send out some people.</span> <span id="s1068">We had some particular people that we knew that they are pretty, you know, they are co – they don’t mind speaking.</span> <span id="s1069">Because a lots of times some survivors don’t like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1070">So we – we – we did that even before, so I have still a lot of schools that do that.</span> <span id="s1071">They call me back year after year that – to come back to – to this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Do students always ask the same questions or do you get some different questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: No, different – different questions all the time, it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: What kinds of things do the students ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Well, almost – one thing one of the kids wanted to know whether – after the war, how my thoughts were after the war, whether I otherwise – whether a – I – I was still thinking as if I was in the camp, or I started thinking like a free person.</span> <span id="s1076">It’s a – it’s – it’s interesting to listen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: How old was that child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: That child was already a little bit older, she was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: But I have had kids tell me – a 13 year old kid told me once that while she was listening to me she was thinking how lucky she was, that her children might not have a chance to listen to a survivor.</span> <span id="s1081">And when I – when she finished telling me, I said how old are you?</span> <span id="s1082">And she – when she told me she was 13, I almost flipped.</span> <span id="s1083">I couldn’t believe it that a kid at 13 would have such insight in somebody’s – you know, to even think about it.</span> <span id="s1084">And this she thought about it while I was talking, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Do you remember any other experiences with these students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: With the students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s1089">Like when you ask me about, you know, how I felt when I had the kids, but one school – I was – it – as a matter of fact it was the American university, it was a university.</span> <span id="s1090">And when I came back – you see, in 1975 my husband and I went with a UJA mission to – back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1091">And to, you know, kind of confront it.</span> <span id="s1092">And when I came back, one – when I was talking, one of the students ask me – he said, Mrs. Spiegel, you were – you were telling us that you had such a – you went through such a terrible period of your life, and now you’re telling me you’re married and you have three children – at that time I had only my three girls, I didn’t have yet grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1093">He said, how come you brought in children into this world?</span> <span id="s1094">And I stopped and thought about it and I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1095">I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s1096">I-I-It was a natural – I got married, we wanted to have a family.</span> <span id="s1097">I-It was like a natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s1098">But now that you ask me, I will tell you why.</span> <span id="s1099">I said, what you actual expected me to do is really, I would have given victory to Hitler, because that’s what he started out to do, and then, after I would have died, we wouldn’t have left anybody.</span> <span id="s1100">So what – you wa – I would be helping him out.</span> <span id="s1101">I mean, not that I thought about it when I was having children, but now that you ask me, I’m thinking about it.</span> <span id="s1102">And he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1103">I can see your point.</span> <span id="s1104">I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s1105">It always bothered me.</span> <span id="s1106">Because he apparently was from New York and he knew a lot of survivors, and he was always wondering why are those people having children.</span> <span id="s1107">He said, it always bothered me, why would you bring in children into this world.</span> <span id="s1108">But now he said, thank you for explaining it to me, because you’re right, I never thought of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: What age group is your favorite to speak to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: To speak to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Actually, you know what?</span> <span id="s1113">Sometimes it’s junior high, because they asks questions without stop.</span> <span id="s1114">But I have one group who is really – fifth graders and – because I usually don’t like to speak to such young kids.</span> <span id="s1115">Of course, I use it a little bit different.</span> <span id="s1116">I always say, I make life beautiful, you know, like this movie, “Life is Beautiful?”</span> <span id="s1117">I make it a little bit it shouldn’t be so hard on the young kids.</span> <span id="s1118">But this teacher also was taking a course how to s – teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1119">And I spoke to the teachers and she called me to come to speak to her kids.</span> <span id="s1120">And I said how – what grade are they in?</span> <span id="s1121">She says fifth graders.</span> <span id="s1122">I said fifth graders, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1123">I would rather not speak to them because I think they’re too young.</span> <span id="s1124">Call me when they get into high s – you know, junior high school.</span> <span id="s1125">She said, I will tell you what, Mrs. Spiegel, I’ll make a deal with you.</span> <span id="s1126">You come to me one time and if you won’t agree with that these kids are ready, then next time when I call you, you may hang up on me.</span> <span id="s1127">I – I went to her this last March I went to her, that’s already the fifth time.</span> <span id="s1128">Because she really does.</span> <span id="s1129">She has learned a lot about the Holocaust – the teacher, and she really prepares those kids so beautifully that they ask questions, I want to tell you that for an hour, she leaves a special hour just for questions and answers.</span> <span id="s1130">These kids – I can’t leave ti – they follow me.</span> <span id="s1131">I spoke just at this school, a Catholic school, they [indecipherable] and they gave me a [indecipherable], excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: We’ll turn off the tape while Mrs. Spiegel is looking for something.</span> <span id="s1133">[tape break] – is back talking about – Mrs. Spiegel is back talking about what she was looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: In – except I couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s1135">Must be in the washing machine – in the – in the – in the dishwasher.</span> <span id="s1136">A – I went to this Catholic school.</span> <span id="s1137">I understand that Caroline Kennedy went to that school.</span> <span id="s1138">It – it’s a – a beautiful school.</span> <span id="s1139">These kids, there must have been like about 300 kids.</span> <span id="s1140">I want to tell you that they asked questions that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1141">When I was leaving, they were following me.</span> <span id="s1142">I said to them, you know, I feel like the Pied Piper, you know, with the kids following me around, except I was really in a hurry because I had to get to the museum, it was on a Wednesday, so I wanted to get to the museum for work, so I didn’t want to spend so much time.</span> <span id="s1143">I said, you will have to make it another time.</span> <span id="s1144">But they do ask very good questions, I’m always very pleased.</span> <span id="s1145">Now I realize I’m not stupid enough to think that I can change everybody’s mind, but I realize that it does – it does – if I change even one kid a little bit to think a little bit differently about bigotry and hatred, then I always feel like maybe my work is paying off.</span> <span id="s1146">In this one – another school was the Good Counsel, the high school.</span> <span id="s1147">That was also – Our Lady of Good Counsel, that’s the one on Georgia Avenue.</span> <span id="s1148">Very – also wonderful class.</span> <span id="s1149">Some are – as a matter of fact –</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A2: Georgetown Prep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: – I speak for Georgetown Prep, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1152">Georgetown Prep, for the last like – I think last time when I went there I think he introduced me as coming there eight year, you know, so I do speak a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Now you have a certificate here, Woman of Achievement and you s – told me that you’d received other awards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Do you want – can you talk about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Well, I received an award of – from the United Jewish Appeal, because when we went with this group to the – to the – to Auschwitz and they really kind of appreciated what we did for them that – because it’s very hard, when you go to these camps to visit, it’s very hard, it’s very helpful when they have a survivor there.</span> <span id="s1157">See somebody, that somebody came out alive, because when you go there you think everybody is dead.</span> <span id="s1158">So that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Now, who was on this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: There were – there were people from all over the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: So it – y – were you the only – you and Sam the only survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes, uh-huh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: – yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1165">So we got from them an achievement award and of course from the Jewish Theological Seminary, because I’ve worked for them the last 30 years, through the synagogue raised – also raised money.</span> <span id="s1166">And – I also – my husband and I go on the March of the Living.</span> <span id="s1167">You know, this is a – we take a – a group of children, especially through the B’nai B’rith.</span> <span id="s1168">It’s the – the B’nai B’rith Youth Organization.</span> <span id="s1169">You got – they get the – the young people, between ages 16 and 18 and they take him to Poland and then Israel.</span> <span id="s1170">And we’ve been going on it since 19 – since 1994.</span> <span id="s1171">We’ve gone ’94 - ’96 - ’97 - ’98 and they called us already for year 2000.</span> <span id="s1172">And I told them, can’t promise for sure.</span> <span id="s1173">If our health is gonna be okay, we’re gonna go up with them.</span> <span id="s1174">They take like about – altogether there are about six to 7,000 kids.</span> <span id="s1175">Six to 7,000 kids, but – six to 7,000 kids but we – or not – on – with us – with the B’nai B’rith we have between 350 and 400 kids.</span> <span id="s1176">Sam is showing off the – all these goodies that I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Okay, why don’t you sh – give them to Regina and she can –</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: – tell the microphone about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Because the microphone can’t see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So Regina – let – let Regina describe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1185">Oh.</span> <span id="s1186">This – this was one of the pictures from the March of the Living.</span> <span id="s1187">This was one –</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Can you describe the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: The picture is – this is a group from my bus, which they are, some of them – this is me and there’s – someplace is sa – Sam is here, and these are the leaders from the group.</span> <span id="s1190">They are le – what they call Madrachim from the – from the group, from the B’nai B’rith.</span> <span id="s1191">This was the year, I think this was actually ’94.</span> <span id="s1192">The – the four them – thi – was April fourth – 7th, ’94 that we went on this – this was our first trip and we had – they were a marvelous experience and the things we get back from the kids – as a matter of fact, just recently I went, during the Yom HaShoah, one of the kids from one of these trips attends Georgetown University here.</span> <span id="s1193">And she had prepared a program for commemoration of the Holocaust for Georgetown University and she asked me to come be the speaker there, and the kids were just absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s1194">I mean, they are not such kids, they are already college kids, they’re probably 19 - 20 years old, but the – I guess they felt so like I was that age almost when I came out.</span> <span id="s1195">And this is one that I was just also spoke at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, you know, with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1196">And I think I told you I happened to be there April 20th, and the soldiers gave me an ovation because it was the day when I actually was almost like liberated, that was it.</span> <span id="s1197">And this was in – in – oh, this is from – for the United States Army Material Command to – that I was a speaker on April, 1993.</span> <span id="s1198">You know, all these things [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1199">Here is one that – oh, on the Woodbridge campus at the University of Virginia, I was just recently a speaker.</span> <span id="s1200">I go there, it’s probably already the fourth of fifth year that I go there.</span> <span id="s1201">I happen to know this professor that works there and she calls me every year.</span> <span id="s1202">So I go.</span> <span id="s1203">So as I say, I do a lot of this kind of work where in the evening lots of times, so that’s the on – that’s the reason I only do it once a week in the museum, because if I worked long – more time, I wouldn’t have any time to do this and I feel like this is also very important to do this and – oh, and this is – this we got from Miles Lehrman, an appreciation certificate for, you know, because for our work.</span> <span id="s1204">And this is also that I was president of the [indecipherable] yeah, of the survivors – Holocaust survivors, when I stepped down as president, because after being so many years, you can’t keep on being the president counc –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: How many years were you the president?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Probably – was it like about three or four years?</span> <span id="s1207">You know, at least three years.</span> <span id="s1208">But you see, the reason I don’t remember exactly, because even when I stepped down, I was doing just as much work, cause –</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: That can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Yeah, so it didn’t make any difference, it just – except we switched the ranks, so to speak because I – basically we have a nucleus of certain people that do the work and we feel like we can’t be – somebody else doesn’t want to step in, so we feel like, between us, we’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1211">So we take every time somebody else’s job so it shouldn’t be constantly in the same job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Well, you’ve certainly told us a lot.</span> <span id="s1213">What else would you like to say, or what have I not asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No, you have asked me quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1215">The only thing what I do want to say, that I do – I always like to finish with a – that I am really grateful to this country, that no matter what they did before, they could have done much more, but once it was over that I’m really grateful to this country that they did let us come into this place, because I love the United States.</span> <span id="s1216">I really do.</span> <span id="s1217">I feel like – I feel like – like I’ve never been born in Poland, except – this is my country.</span> <span id="s1218">I feel much more towards the United States than towards the country that I was born in.</span> <span id="s1219">And I’m grateful.</span> <span id="s1220">I have a very good life here and my husband made a very good living and we raised a wonderful family and wonderful kids and we’re really very grateful t-to God and to this country for letting us in to – to do the work and we hope to be able to do the work as long as we – we can go on.</span> <span id="s1221">That’s the main thing.</span> <span id="s1222">And we appreciate you coming and listening to me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Well thank you very much for doing this.</span> <span id="s1224">This concludes the unite – did you want to say something?</span></p>
