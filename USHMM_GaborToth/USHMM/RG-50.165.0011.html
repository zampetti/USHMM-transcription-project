I’m not a crybaby.</span> <span id="s40">Since concentration camp, I think this was the second time that I broke down.</span> <span id="s41">I just lost my voice.</span> <span id="s42">I couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s43">Why?</span> <span id="s44">Because Velvel Bailyn is a Russian Jew.</span> <span id="s45">He came from Russia three years prior to that night.</span> <span id="s46">He was the man who collected from the community.</span> <span id="s47">We helped him get a job.</span> <span id="s48">A poor man.</span> <span id="s49">That day he went from being a taker to being a giver, he stopped being a ward of the community.</span> <span id="s50">He became a baal-haboos.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WH: When did you break down the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">JB: The first time also had to do with Israel Bonds.</span> <span id="s53">We had an appeal for Israel Bonds.</span> <span id="s54">Melvin was going to Amherst College.</span> <span id="s55">He called me up that he’s coming home for Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s56">He called me from the George Washington Bridge.</span> <span id="s57">He hitch –hiked.</span> <span id="s58">You know Melvin wouldn’t take a bus.</span> <span id="s59">It was 5:20 P.M. and Kol Nidre was at 6: P.M. I grabbed the car and I said: “I’m picking you up!”</span> <span id="s60">And I made it back for Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s61">So he came home and ate.</span> <span id="s62">The next day he came into shul and he said: “Dad, do you mind if with the $1,000 from my bar-mitzvah I buy bonds for Israel?”</span> <span id="s63">You know, I send him away to college; I’m scared about what’s going to happen to him----and when he said that, it’s a certain feeling you have that this is your kid.</span> <span id="s64">Big things don’t affect you that much; it’s the little things.</span> <span id="s65">I fought to keep the $100 bonds because I wanted the grandmothers should also be able to give.</span> <span id="s66">So one man said Israel Bonds is not Zionism [It’s business, I presume].</span> <span id="s67">So I said: “If it’s not Zionism, then I know better places to invest my money.</span> <span id="s68">I mean if there’s no heart and soul behind it…….</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: When you compare the survivors to American Jews do you find them generous when it comes to giving to Israel or do you find it’s hard for them to give?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JB: The survivors should have been the biggest givers because they know from what they went through, that money meant absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s71">But the survivors are not the biggest givers.</span> <span id="s72">However, those survivors who get involved are with heart and soul and fire.</span> <span id="s73">So once you get a survivor to give, he gives above and beyond his capacity.</span> <span id="s74">For the average survivor, when they came to this country they were afraid, they had to make a living.</span> <span id="s75">And they have a terrible stinginess.</span> <span id="s76">But the bigger givers,Wilf, Halpern, Skura, and Zborowski, they give a lot.</span> <span id="s77">I think there’s a subconscious fear of identifying as a Jew.</span> <span id="s78">I have a friend who lives in the South, he said: “My child is not going to be killed because I am a Jew.”</span> <span id="s79">He didn’t circumcise his son.</span> <span id="s80">And the joke of it is, he’s an Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s81">And he’s a survivor.</span> <span id="s82">I don’t know if he made a gimmick, a bloodletting, but I know, no circumcision.</span> <span id="s83">Now I know friends of mine who never will have children.</span> <span id="s84">They decided not to because they didn’t want to go through with this.</span> <span id="s85">I know survivors who will talk about everything except that they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s86">I mean, you have to realize that, after what we went through, we’re meshuggeh by admitting that we’re Jews.</span> <span id="s87">I mean we’re just crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: So why didn’t you go the route of your uncle?</span> <span id="s89">Why did you decide to say you’re a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JB: I decided that route a long time ago.</span> <span id="s91">Because I said I lived as a Jew, I’ll die as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: What kinds of properties do you own?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">JB: I’m by profession a builder.</span> <span id="s94">I build everything.</span> <span id="s95">One family, two family houses, office buildings, shopping centers.</span> <span id="s96">I build and then we sell.</span> <span id="s97">WE don’t build by contract or subcontract.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: Can you estimate how much you own?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JB: We’re comfortable; we’re comfortable.</span> <span id="s100">Let’s say this.</span> <span id="s101">My financial statement is O.K.</span> <span id="s102">We came to America with $5.00.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Tell me about your life on the farm when you first came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">JB: We came on November 19, 1948 on the General Bundy, from Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s105">We arrived in Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: Do you belong to any landsmannschaften?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">JB: The Cracower Society because I come from a town near Cracow, Proszowicp.</span> <span id="s108">It’s north of Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">WH: How often do you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JB: Once or twice a week.</span> <span id="s111">I go around to the schools.</span> <span id="s112">I could be doing any business.</span> <span id="s113">If they call me to speak on the Holocaust, I stop and I go.</span> <span id="s114">I spoke last week from 9:00 to 12:00 in Glen Rock.</span> <span id="s115">I spoke in Paterson, in Passaic.</span> <span id="s116">I never say no and I don’t charge.</span> <span id="s117">Also about Israel.</span> <span id="s118">I speak in synagogues.</span> <span id="s119">I speak because I feel there’s a lack of knowledge of what happened among the most learned people.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WH: How were you received in Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">JB: Beautifully.</span> <span id="s122">They gave us cakes and beautiful girls took us around.</span> <span id="s123">We went by train to N.Y. and we arrived Friday evening.</span> <span id="s124">My uncle and cousin greeted us.</span> <span id="s125">We went to my uncle’s house on 52nd St. in Flatbush.</span> <span id="s126">On Sunday I read in the Tog that they’re looking for a furrier.</span> <span id="s127">I had learned this after the war.</span> <span id="s128">Right away I started working.</span> <span id="s129">After this I got a job doing cushions.</span> <span id="s130">I was an operator.</span> <span id="s131">I must have had seven jobs right away.</span> <span id="s132">I changed jobs so often to improve and because they didn’t pay much.</span> <span id="s133">I’ll tell you a story.</span> <span id="s134">A man hired me and promised me $40.00 a week.</span> <span id="s135">But he only paid me $25.00.</span> <span id="s136">So I saw a big man, a Jewish union organizer who always came into his office.</span> <span id="s137">So I went in and I complained to him in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s138">I said: “what kind of justice is this?</span> <span id="s139">This boss puts the money in his pocket.”</span> <span id="s140">I didn’t tell my uncle of course because I was embarrassed to admit I was being cheated.</span> <span id="s141">So this big guy, what did he do?</span> <span id="s142">He picked me up by the back of my neck and he threw me out the door!</span> <span id="s143">So I wished him dead in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s144">And you know something?</span> <span id="s145">A year later he died!</span> <span id="s146">Because I wished it!</span> <span id="s147">Then I worked in sweaters.</span> <span id="s148">I joined the union.</span> <span id="s149">Then a friend suggested I visit a friend for the High Holidays who had a farm in Vineland.</span> <span id="s150">We drove down there.</span> <span id="s151">Vineland is one of the first towns in America that was a planned town.</span> <span id="s152">The main street is extremely wide.</span> <span id="s153">And it had Christmas lights which I saw for the first time in my life, which I thought it was Paradise, all lit up.</span> <span id="s154">We were on the farm a few days and----I liked it.</span> <span id="s155">It was quiet and tranquil, no rushing; you don’t have to worry if you’ll be laid off, enough food.</span> <span id="s156">Getting up early in the morning, we didn’t worry about that.</span> <span id="s157">But after two weeks we left after saying thank you.</span> <span id="s158">Then we came back to my uncle and aunt in Brooklyn and we said: Fish, after two weeks, smell.</span> <span id="s159">We love you, we want to stay, but not for free.</span> <span id="s160">So we worked out a price, forty dollars a week.</span> <span id="s161">My aunt was a real American, if you don’t know who Da Bums are, you’re not an American.</span> <span id="s162">You have to work hard.</span> <span id="s163">So when we lost a job, we’d go to the library the whole day and read books and when we’d come back she would be very friendly to us.</span> <span id="s164">She thought we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: What did you read there?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">JB: We started reading English.</span> <span id="s167">I went to night school at Erasmus High School.</span> <span id="s168">In June of 1949 I got a diploma.</span> <span id="s169">Then the aunt got mad at us because we took the uncle to Coney Island.</span> <span id="s170">We corrupted him.</span> <span id="s171">She said a man shouldn’t go to the beach without his wife; that this is how marriages are being broken up.</span> <span id="s172">So we moved out.</span> <span id="s173">I mean, we were friendly with her till the day she died, but this how she was; no monkey business.</span> <span id="s174">We took an apartment with Al Goodman’s sister, the musician.</span> <span id="s175">Then we decided we’re going to buy a farm.</span> <span id="s176">So Mr. Harrington showed me a house with a chicken coop for 600 chickens which means you could starve!</span> <span id="s177">And I bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: Couldn’t you get help from the Jewish Agricultural Society?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">JB: I could but I wouldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s180">I’m not a taker.</span> <span id="s181">When we came the uncle bought us shirts and pants in Ripley’s.</span> <span id="s182">He spent $52.00.</span> <span id="s183">The first time I made $52.00 I paid back the uncle.</span> <span id="s184">I said: You gave me coffee and tea but you have no obligation to give me clothing especially when I’m working.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">WH: Something just occurred to me now about the camps.</span> <span id="s186">Where were you, by the way/</span></p> <p><span id="s187">JB: I was in Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">WH: In the camps, you had to depend on people to help you.</span> <span id="s189">Is this idea of not wanting to be a taker, does this come from the fact that you had to depend on people and you didn’t want to do it any longer?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">JB: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s191">I was one of the lucky people in that I lived with my father from the beginning of the camps to the end.</span> <span id="s192">I never told them he was my father or they would have killed him.</span> <span id="s193">In the end I was in the schiess commando.</span> <span id="s194">I took out the shit.</span> <span id="s195">Someone had to do it in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s196">There were thousands of people.</span> <span id="s197">And every day, on this commando, ten got killed and ten lived.</span> <span id="s198">I saw that those who lagged behind got killed, so I didn’t lag behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WH: Wasn’t there a feeling of terrible depression, that if this is going to be my lot, what’s the point?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">JB: No.</span> <span id="s201">I said this is a war and I’m going to survive it.</span> <span id="s202">It’s that simple.</span> <span id="s203">The ones who came with me and did not say it, died.</span> <span id="s204">They went to the wires.</span> <span id="s205">I survived because I organized.</span> <span id="s206">I collected dirty laundry.</span> <span id="s207">It was a side job.</span> <span id="s208">I saw that the kapos counted the shirts and wrote down the amount and stamped it.</span> <span id="s209">Then they gave me the clean shirts and underwear and I brought them back.</span> <span id="s210">So I went to the coal mine and I said: “ If you give me a pencil, a black one, a red one, I will bring you the most beautiful silk shirt.</span> <span id="s211">So the Polish coal miner said “If you don’t bring me, I’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s212">At that time they weren’t giving us striped uniforms; they were giving us shirts from people who were killed.</span> <span id="s213">I said ‘Okay, but give me one week’s time.”</span> <span id="s214">So I made sure they caught me for the laundry detail.</span> <span id="s215">So I carried in 230 underwear and 230 shirts.</span> <span id="s216">And as I stepped out I took the three and wrote an eight.</span> <span id="s217">They gave me 280 shirts.</span> <span id="s218">On the way back I stopped by a barrack which was not my barrack and I hid them in a hole.</span> <span id="s219">The next day I took a shirt.</span> <span id="s220">From that day on I had my father and Jacob Banach---they didn’t know where I got the shirts.</span> <span id="s221">From then until 1944 we carried the shirts in and when we did, we got a piece of bread, a piece of salami, a cup of soup.</span> <span id="s222">Because of this we survived.</span> <span id="s223">So if you’re asking me, I never took.</span> <span id="s224">I gave.</span> <span id="s225">To survive took luck, cunning, and shrewdness.</span> <span id="s226">Absolutely no question we survived because of luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">WH: So, going back to Vineland, what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JB: One came after the other.</span> <span id="s229">Because of me others came.</span> <span id="s230">I want to tell you that at one point in camp, a German (illegible) who was a real animal started with me and I knew if I don’t fight back, I’m dead.</span> <span id="s231">Because he used to have a few Jews for breakfast and a few for lunch.</span> <span id="s232">So I picked up a shovel and said to him in Hebrew: “I will die with the Philistines.”</span> <span id="s233">like Samson said.</span> <span id="s234">And I hit him in the side of the head with the shovel.</span> <span id="s235">And then, it was like a miracle, a tremendous fog came down and no one could find anyone and I got away with it.</span> <span id="s236">A few months later I saw him with a bandage.</span> <span id="s237">He never bothered me again.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t know if he recognized me or not.</span> <span id="s239">He didn’t really know me.</span> <span id="s240">I wish sometimes I would be mystical, or a hasid, and I would say the Ribbono Shel Olom (God) did it.</span> <span id="s241">But I don’t believe that.</span> <span id="s242">I think you make your own destiny</span></p> <p><span id="s243">WH: You don’t believe in destiny but you do believe in the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s244">You sent your child to yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">JB: I believe in this.</span> <span id="s246">All the civilizations went under but we’re still here.</span> <span id="s247">The greatest miracle that happened to us is not that we survived but how we survived.</span> <span id="s248">We had no education after the war, without guidance.</span> <span id="s249">Our parents and teachers were killed.</span> <span id="s250">According to the norms of the world, we should have mixed in with other peoples and disappeared.</span> <span id="s251">Find a Jewish community where a survivor is not involved.</span> <span id="s252">You’ll find survivors in the business community who are movers and shakers.</span> <span id="s253">The miracle is we had something our parents gave us, something in our genes.</span> <span id="s254">And the majority of us do not walk around with a chip on our shoulders that the world owes us something.</span> <span id="s255">Just the opposite.</span> <span id="s256">It must be something that our parents did, the generations of Jewish knowledge, of Jewish belief.</span> <span id="s257">We were stubborn and had a strong belief.</span> <span id="s258">All of us have nightmares but the majority of us don’t have depression.</span> <span id="s259">Because anytime something goes wrong in the business I just look at the number on my arm and I say: “Big deal!</span> <span id="s260">What’s wrong?</span> <span id="s261">Somebody sending you to a camp?”</span> <span id="s262">So I’m not depressed.</span> <span id="s263">For instance, if you would come by today and say: “Joe Bukiet, you have cancer;

P didn’t know these tricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">WH: Can you give me an example of what a trick is?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">JB: Let’s say you sell cabbage.</span> <span id="s297">They look like collard greens.</span> <span id="s298">If you take the leaf from the cabbage and put on top of the collard green, you wouldn’t know the difference.</span> <span id="s299">It would look like cabbage.</span> <span id="s300">You cook it together it tastes the same way.</span> <span id="s301">Or let’s say the supplier takes out six stale breads and brings four fresh.</span> <span id="s302">So he says: “I took out four stale and I brought you six fresh.</span> <span id="s303">It’s a twist of the tongue but you lose four breads.</span> <span id="s304">Milk is dated.</span> <span id="s305">Every woman who comes into the store will always take from the bottom.</span> <span id="s306">So you put the stale milk on the bottom because they’ll take it from the bottom without looking at the date.</span> <span id="s307">But the bread they take from the top; they do opposite!</span> <span id="s308">There are tricks in every business.</span> <span id="s309">And this guy knew every trick.</span> <span id="s310">So I hired a friend.</span> <span id="s311">I made him a one-third partner.</span> <span id="s312">His job was to follow Benny everywhere.</span> <span id="s313">And Benny tried so hard to show me how great he was that after two months I could run the store myself.</span> <span id="s314">I said “ I really appreciate what you did for me but I don’t need you any more.”</span> <span id="s315">He said: “ There’s a lot to learn here.”</span> <span id="s316">So I said: “Yes, but I can’t afford you no more.”</span> <span id="s317">He said: “ You don’t have to pay me as much as you did before.”</span> <span id="s318">So I said: “My friend has been working for two months for nothing and I have to pay him.”</span> <span id="s319">So he said: “ I’ll stay with you another two months for free.”</span> <span id="s320">I said: “ I don’t want you.</span> <span id="s321">You’re a wonderful person but I haven’t got the conscience to employ you for nothing.”</span> <span id="s322">He said: “ Thank you very much.”</span> <span id="s323">He never knew.</span> <span id="s324">He thought I’m the biggest putz in the world.</span> <span id="s325">Never did I tell the man.</span> <span id="s326">You are one of the few people who knows it.</span> <span id="s327">He knew tricks you cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s328">He knew how to buy, where to buy;

a pack of cigarettes, 1 cent; dozen eggs 12 cents; 1b butter 16 cents.’</span> <span id="s372">The sign maker said: “What, you crazy?</span> <span id="s373">You going out of business?”</span> <span id="s374">I said: “Mind your business.”</span> <span id="s375">I made up 40 big signs, came back at 5:00.</span> <span id="s376">I took everything out from the windows.</span> <span id="s377">And five minutes before closing, I put up all the signs and closed the store and went home.</span> <span id="s378">We went away for the holidays.</span> <span id="s379">After the holiday I come in at 4: A.M. and take off all the signs and put back the old signs.</span> <span id="s380">The first Irishman walks in and he says: “I will tell you something.</span> <span id="s381">I says to my wife, you should never trust a man who’s not religious.</span> <span id="s382">I admire you because you’re religious, you closed the store.</span> <span id="s383">Those bastards, those newcomers, those Jews, they didn’t close, but they’re a bunch of robbers.</span> <span id="s384">You should have seen the prices they charged.</span> <span id="s385">I saw your prices.</span> <span id="s386">Never again will I go to those thieves.</span> <span id="s387">Because you are closed, they charged everything three times as much.”</span> <span id="s388">I picked up business!</span> <span id="s389">People came in, they said, the others were thieves.</span> <span id="s390">I never spoke to that man in my life again.</span> <span id="s391">After that I had an Italian man run my store on the holidays.</span> <span id="s392">Anyway we sold the store and purchased a fancy store in Cedarhurst.</span> <span id="s393">And we invited people to see the store.</span> <span id="s394">We lived in a rat-infested apartment.</span> <span id="s395">They had nice homes in Boro Park and I lived in Salvation Army furniture.</span> <span id="s396">I had no problem that the couch was old.</span> <span id="s397">I didn’t buy fancy dresses.</span> <span id="s398">It’s a matter of priorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">WH: What were your priorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">JB: To become independent.</span> <span id="s401">Not to work for any bosses.</span> <span id="s402">And to support my wife and family.</span> <span id="s403">And as we were leaving the house, a woman, we were good friends, she said to her husband in Yiddish: “If you want to live like a pig, you can buy a store like this.”</span> <span id="s404">I heard it; it hurt me.</span> <span id="s405">Then I opened another store.</span> <span id="s406">A new elegant subdivision opened in North Woodmere.</span> <span id="s407">My brother and I bought houses.</span> <span id="s408">We bought new furniture and carpets.</span> <span id="s409">We invited these people for dinner.</span> <span id="s410">They were surprised: “Such a gorgeous house.”</span> <span id="s411">And he said: “This must be like Rockefeller’s mansion.”</span> <span id="s412">And when he said it, I said: “If you want to live like a pig for two years, you can live in a castle for the rest of your life.”</span> <span id="s413">And she looked at me and said: “I deserve it, don’t I?</span> <span id="s414">I shouldn’t have said it.”</span> <span id="s415">“You’re darn right,” I said.</span> <span id="s416">“But you have a good memory,” she said.</span> <span id="s417">“You should have known that,” I answered.</span> <span id="s418">These are the things….</span> <span id="s419">But I shouldn’t have said it because by saying something, maybe I took away some of his manlihood.</span> <span id="s420">One day, though, when he lost his job, I took him as a partner in a building because we were dear friends and his wife came to me and said: “Joe, you have to help us.”</span> <span id="s421">But it was hard to make it in the supermarket.</span> <span id="s422">We were competing with Waldbaums.</span> <span id="s423">So I went into the building business with a friend, the same one I knew from the chicken farm (Al walks in and we are reintroduced.)</span></p> <p><span id="s424">AB: When we wanted to buy the chicken farm we had no money.</span> <span id="s425">My friend lent me the money.</span> <span id="s426">We got to where we got because we helped each other out.</span> <span id="s427">How many people would do that for a friend?</span> <span id="s428">Pantirer was from our hometown.</span> <span id="s429">He collected cigarettes for us after the war.</span> <span id="s430">We helped him and we were very close.</span> <span id="s431">When we came to Brooklyn, the cousin didn’t want us;
