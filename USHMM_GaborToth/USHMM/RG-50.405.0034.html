DATE: July 28, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">INTERVIEWER: Elaine Snyderman (Can you tell me what your earliest memories are?)</span> <span id="s12">Well, I remember a long corridor and I was always playing there.</span> <span id="s13">I had really a lot of toys in a huge box.</span> <span id="s14">I was always playing with my toys in that corridor and they were going down the stairs sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">I also remember going to the hospital.</span> <span id="s16">(Because you were injured?)</span> <span id="s17">I don't remember why, but I remember I went with my Teddy bear and it was a little Teddy bear.</span> <span id="s18">I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">(Who took care of you when your mother was at school or working?)</span> <span id="s20">My grandmother.</span> <span id="s21">My mother's mother took care of me most of the time but in the beginning it was my father's mother.</span> <span id="s22">(And that was Paul Troytsky's mother?)</span> <span id="s23">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">(Did your grandmother tell you stories or teach you any things?)</span> <span id="s25">Yes, a lot of fairy tales.</span> <span id="s26">(Were the fairy tales your father's mother told you much different from the one's your mother's mother told?)</span> <span id="s27">My mother's mother really did not tell me a lot of fairy tales.</span> <span id="s28">Actually, it was my grandfather who told me the stories, my mother's father.</span> <span id="s29">After the War, what happened, and things like that.</span> <span id="s30">He told me what part of the war he was in.</span> <span id="s31">(Do you remember any of those stories?)</span> <span id="s32">Yes, most of them were about sailing into Leningrad, he was a sailor.</span> <span id="s33">During the Siege of Leningrad.</span> <span id="s34">He told me a lot of stories like that, some of them were really strange, some of them were interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">(Could you tell me one interesting one, or just a little about it?)</span> <span id="s36">It was about his ship, trying to go through the river, into Leningrad.</span> <span id="s37">Well the ship was trying to go into the river and the river was frozen so they had to hit the ice with the ship and the ice would pile up, pile up, pile up, until they could not move anymore.</span> <span id="s38">Then they had to call a special ship that could go through the ice easier and have it show them the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">I don't think that is a very interesting story, but that is one that I remember right now.</span> <span id="s40">He usually told me stories about how (?)</span> <span id="s41">got port (fork) (?)</span> <span id="s42">, what kind of engine it had, how the cannon worked and the machine-guns, you know, anything like that.</span> <span id="s43">(So do you think you know how things work a little better than some of your friends?)</span> <span id="s44">I know a little better than other kids in Russia, and much better than most kids in America.</span> <span id="s45">Here, not a lot of kids have any interest in that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">(Did you think that your friends were serious about school and about planning their future, even when you were little?)</span> <span id="s47">How little do you mean?</span> <span id="s48">(As little as you can remember.)</span> <span id="s49">No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s50">They start to get serious about it in Third Grade.</span> <span id="s51">They talk about getting a job, and who do they want to be, what are you going to do in your life....</span> <span id="s52">Also, we had much more like - well, I do not think it is a very mature thing to do, but we would like, fight in parties, with snowballs, and we would make strategies against each other and I was a leader of one of the parties because I could not stand anybody standing over me!</span> <span id="s53">(You called your teams 'parties'?)</span> <span id="s54">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">We had team names, like our's was the English Party, some teachers were like 'English Queen', we also had 'German Queen' and 'French Queen' in our school.</span> <span id="s56">We were defending the interest of our class in the English.</span> <span id="s57">There were some other people involved, fighting with them and making some bad things happen to them, the whole thing was fun!</span> <span id="s58">(Were they teaching you History at the same time?)</span> <span id="s59">The started teaching us that in the Fourth Grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">(Did you know at that time that you had a plan about growing up?</span> <span id="s61">Did you think that you might know then what you wanted to be?)</span> <span id="s62">Yes.</span> <span id="s63">I wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s64">(In Third Grade?)</span> <span id="s65">Yes.</span> <span id="s66">(Have you ever changed you mind, as you got older?)</span> <span id="s67">No, so far so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">(That's even before you knew your mother's parents, right?)</span> <span id="s69">Yes.</span> <span id="s70">They are both doctors but my great-grandfather of my real father, was a doctor and he was killed by Stalin.</span> <span id="s71">(Do you know why this was?)</span> <span id="s72">I think he had something, I don't remember what, he had some views on things that were not liked by Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">(When did you find out you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s74">I'm not sure I remember that exactly.</span> <span id="s75">I knew it for a while before the time we left Russia, I did.</span> <span id="s76">(Did you know you were Jewish before your mother married Victor?)</span> <span id="s77">I think she told me about it.</span> <span id="s78">I wasn't very little, but with a little sense, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">(Was your real father Jewish?)</span> <span id="s80">Yes.</span> <span id="s81">(So, though your mother's passport shows that she is Russian, she chose to marry Jewish men?)</span> <span id="s82">Yes.</span> <span id="s83">I don't think she really liked, or was looking for a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s84">I think she would marry a man who liked her, I don't think his being Jewish was a main point.</span> <span id="s85">(We don't know, though?)</span> <span id="s86">Well, I can't really say but that is my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">(Do you remember any Jewish holidays being observed?)</span> <span id="s88">Yes, once.</span> <span id="s89">I was in Second Grade - no, I was in Kindergarten, yet.</span> <span id="s90">My mother and I and some others, I don't remember who exactly, went to a synagogue and I was sitting on the person's shoulders and I was looking around.</span> <span id="s91">I didn't know what it was all about.</span> <span id="s92">Maybe it was Simchas Torah.</span> <span id="s93">(How old do you think you were then?)</span> <span id="s94">I was probably five or six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">(That was the first time you were in synagogue?)</span> <span id="s96">I was not really 'in', the doors were open and everybody was outside looking.</span> <span id="s97">(Did you feel good or bad, are anything in-between, to being Jewish?)</span> <span id="s98">I felt that is was normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">(When your parents told you that you would be coming to the United States, how did you feel about that?)</span> <span id="s100">First, I didn't really feel it would be any fun, I mean, we had TV there, so there was nothing special about that.</span> <span id="s101">And I really did not take it very seriously.</span> <span id="s102">Then, when we actually left, I was very upset for a few, maybe even (minutes?</span> <span id="s103">months?)</span> <span id="s104">.</span> <span id="s105">Then I started to get over it and now we are here (?)</span> <span id="s106">______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">(What did you think you would be upset about?)</span> <span id="s108">Probably about leaving my friends and my family, mostly my father.</span> <span id="s109">(Do you write to them?)</span> <span id="s110">Yes, I just finished writing some letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">(When you left, two years ago approximately, do you remember what you were studying in school there?)</span> <span id="s112">The last thing that we did over there, that I remember, was Algebraic equations.</span> <span id="s113">Simplified.</span> <span id="s114">I was in Sixth Grade.</span> <span id="s115">They were not really hard.</span> <span id="s116">What I am studying now, with my Dad, is much harder.</span> <span id="s117">(This is your class work at Hillel Day School, that you are studying with your Dad?)</span> <span id="s118">No.</span> <span id="s119">My Dad is just giving me some problems to work.</span> <span id="s120">It really helps me.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">(When you were still in school in Russia, did your parents ever talk about politics at home?)</span> <span id="s122">Yeah.</span> <span id="s123">I wasn't part of the discussion very often.</span> <span id="s124">I remember me and Dad were arguing about, usually just History, not politics.</span> <span id="s125">We were like talking about the Jerry invasion in Russia and how the Germans were able to conquer so much land and how Hitler came to power; and something about Lenin, and that he was Jewish, and how smart he was.</span> <span id="s126">And things like that.</span> <span id="s127">My Mom was always on the right side.</span> <span id="s128">She was very 'right'; not 'left' like a Communist; she was as 'right' as she could be!</span></p> <p><span id="s129">(And your father?)</span> <span id="s130">My mother was much more conservative.</span> <span id="s131">My father is, I think he has an opinion to himself; which I like.</span> <span id="s132">He does not stay stubborn and by one idea, I think that is not wrong but it is not very good thing when you are in politics, or even talking about politics.</span> <span id="s133">Because, you have to see all of the visible situation, which even I don't do, for example, in the Israeli situation.</span> <span id="s134">We talk often about that.</span> <span id="s135">You have to see both sides of the question, and I see only one.</span> <span id="s136">And then my Dad always shows me the other side.</span> <span id="s137">So, it is very, very nice of my Dad, and very smart to see both sides, not just stick with the one side that he is on.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">(When you came here, what was the biggest change for you?)</span> <span id="s139">My family and my friends, in Russia, it was much more interesting to talk with them, the friends my age.</span> <span id="s140">We talk about different things - like politics, we talked about more mature things.</span> <span id="s141">From politics to things like mathematics or sometimes history, you know.</span> <span id="s142">We would discuss that.</span> <span id="s143">Here, all they do is play games.</span> <span id="s144">Okay, I can live with that.</span> <span id="s145">But most of them I know, are really not interested in learning anything.</span> <span id="s146">(Why do you think that is true?)</span> <span id="s147">Because most of the people I have met, which is not really a lot of people, but most of them I have met to judge, were people who were not very interesting to talk to.</span> <span id="s148">They did not have enough -- You see, it is a great way to argue, to know a lot, and the friends I knew in Russia were interesting to talk to and argue with because they knew really, really a lot.</span> <span id="s149">And they were interesting to argue with, because they could give you good arguments, not like here, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">(Was that because they did more reading?)</span> <span id="s151">We did much more reading there, much.</span> <span id="s152">(What were you and they reading?)</span> <span id="s153">The most significant book was probably The Three Musketeers, I read.</span> <span id="s154">I also read some books on Russian History, Ivanho, Tom Sawyer, and different things like that.</span> <span id="s155">(You were really reading in the world literature?)</span> <span id="s156">Yes.</span> <span id="s157">(What had you read in Russian literature?)</span> <span id="s158">I have read Pushkin, I read Gogol, and I read other Russian authors.</span> <span id="s159">Soviet authors, too.</span> <span id="s160">(These books are considered reading for adults, here in the United States, but children in the Soviet Union are encouraged to read the great classic writers?)</span> <span id="s161">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s162">It was absolutely normal, you know.</span> <span id="s163">They were usually simple to read.</span> <span id="s164">Sometimes it would be difficult to concentrate on a subject because sometimes the passages were long and things like that but still it was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s165">It was probably the most interesting thing I did in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">(This literature that you were reading, it was not re-written for children?</span> <span id="s167">it was the original version?)</span> <span id="s168">Yes, it was the original version, no difference.</span> <span id="s169">The best thing I think that I have read here in English was The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.</span> <span id="s170">A friend of my Mom gave me a list of books, good American books, science fiction and others I might be interested in.</span> <span id="s171">(Would you say you read more for fun, or for education?)</span> <span id="s172">I read much more for fun.</span> <span id="s173">That is also why I read in Russia.</span> <span id="s174">Because, you know, when you read, it just seems like a different - part, fun reading, part, education, you get both.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Most of the books that you get education from are not like books from mathematics, but you don't really read those books too often.</span> <span id="s176">I read one.</span> <span id="s177">It was called Elementary Algebra, for example, and it had exercises that I had to do.</span> <span id="s178">I cannot say that it was a very interesting text, you know, but most of the books that I read are for education and for fun, I learn a lot of things from books.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">For example, when we argue with my father about different things, even about my catching birds, I bring examples from books, without even involving my Mom, I bring examples from books.</span> <span id="s180">So, books really allow me an education and fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">(In Russia, among your friends and classmates, were there many Jews?)</span> <span id="s182">In my class, there were.</span> <span id="s183">My friends were partly Jewish, about equal.</span> <span id="s184">(Were you treated any differently because you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s185">No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s186">(So you never had any bad experiences because you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s187">No.</span> <span id="s188">It was absolutely no difference here, either.</span> <span id="s189">I think the people are even friendlier here than in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">(Your friends here, because you go to the Day School, might be more Jewish friends, is that correct?)</span> <span id="s191">Yes.</span> <span id="s192">I still have other non-Jewish friends, too.</span> <span id="s193">(Do you feel very comfortable in both worlds?)</span> <span id="s194">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">(Is there any kind of conflict between the very religious education you get in the Day School, and the fact that your home life is not religious?)</span> <span id="s196">Not really, just sometimes my teachers some of them, start talking to me- about having a lot of non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s197">You know, that is the part I do not like about that school.</span> <span id="s198">Because that is not true, it does not mean anything.</span> <span id="s199">There are some Jews who are worse than some Gentiles, and there is no problem about that, it is true, and we can't argue about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">They tell me- - for example, my good friend, a Russian, whose name is Deema, well, a teacher said that he was using drugs because they live in a neighborhood where a lot of people use drugs.</span> <span id="s201">That is not fair, because she was judging, she was looking in his locker, and she was bugging him for the school year.</span> <span id="s202">I don't think this is the right way to come to a situation.</span> <span id="s203">She was getting him in trouble a lot of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">(This was here?)</span> <span id="s205">Yes, he is Jewish and he comes to Hillel Torah.</span> <span id="s206">He told me they even were talking with him about it.</span> <span id="s207">(There were kids in the neighborhood who approached him with drugs?)</span> <span id="s208">Yes.</span> <span id="s209">Of course, he is a very smart person, one of the smartest Russian kids in America and he was smart enough to say, "No."</span> <span id="s210">(Was that a problem in Moscow?</span> <span id="s211">Were there people who would approach kids and try to sell them drugs?)</span> <span id="s212">No, not really.</span> <span id="s213">Well, some teenagers would like organize themselves but they would not sell drugs, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s214">Organize themselves to get together to breathe in glue, for example.</span> <span id="s215">Because they didn't have any drugs there.</span> <span id="s216">They did, but it cost a lot of money to get them so - they would use stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">(Why do you think they did that?)</span> <span id="s218">There were two reasons.</span> <span id="s219">First, they tried to prove themselves.</span> <span id="s220">The same way people everywhere try to prove themselves.</span> <span id="s221">They want to prove to themselves that they can do something that is 'cool'.</span> <span id="s222">The other reason is that most of the people who use drugs are very insecure people, who cannot hold themselves together and say, "This is not really cool."</span> <span id="s223">(What about the dietary laws they teach at school?</span> <span id="s224">how do you feel about those?)</span> <span id="s225">I find those very difficult, because most of my life, so far, I have lived without those laws.</span> <span id="s226">It is pretty hard to go and change now.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">(Do you remember eating any food -- ?)</span> <span id="s228">Matzo.</span> <span id="s229">I had matzo about two days after I went to that synagogue for Simchas Torah.</span> <span id="s230">Well, I knew there were Jewish organization but I really was not interested, I had problems of my own, my friends, - I really didn't have --.</span> <span id="s231">(What did you think the first time you ate matzo?)</span> <span id="s232">Dry, it was very dry.</span> <span id="s233">We did not put anything on it, we ate it plain.</span> <span id="s234">(?)</span> <span id="s235">and egg.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">(Do you remember eating any other foods, that would be considered Jewish foods?)</span> <span id="s237">Fruits and vegetables!</span> <span id="s238">(Well, I'm thinking about foods like - , some people talk about gefilte fish as a Jewish food.)</span> <span id="s239">I don't like that.</span> <span id="s240">I ate it in Russia.</span> <span id="s241">I had eaten strudel but I didn't know it was Jewish food.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">(Did you ever have Hamantaschen?)</span> <span id="s243">Could you explain to me what that is?</span> <span id="s244">(Well, Hamantaschen, on Purim, are little pockets of dough that have fruit fillings, or poppy seeds in them?)</span> <span id="s245">The little triangles?</span> <span id="s246">No, I never had those in Moscow, only here.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">(What about any other kinds of Jewish ceremonies?</span> <span id="s248">have you ever been to a Jewish wedding?</span> <span id="s249">or a Jewish funeral.)</span> <span id="s250">No, I don't - No.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">(This is tough for me to ask, but it is on the list.</span> <span id="s252">What about the ritual of circumcision?</span> <span id="s253">Do you know anything about that?)</span> <span id="s254">I was circumcised here.</span> <span id="s255">When we came here.</span> <span id="s256">It was not frightening, and it was not really painful.</span> <span id="s257">(Was your father circumcised?)</span> <span id="s258">I have no idea!</span></p> <p><span id="s259">(You are at a point in your life where you may, or may not, go back to a Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s260">Would you be upset if you didn't?)</span> <span id="s261">Well, that depends on ________(?)</span> <span id="s262">Actually, I could live with a Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s263">Without being upset.</span> <span id="s264">Of course, I might be upset leaving my friends that I have there.</span> <span id="s265">I'm used to that kind of change.</span> <span id="s266">I've changed seven schools in my life and it was nothing special.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">(How do you explain the fact that you are such a steady person?</span> <span id="s268">and so mature for your age?)</span> <span id="s269">I don't know, I try to control myself.</span> <span id="s270">My father always tells me, "You always have to be in control."</span> <span id="s271">(But not everyone can do that.)</span> <span id="s272">It is very simple for me, to control your feelings and not to show them.</span> <span id="s273">But sometimes I just let them out of control.</span> <span id="s274">My father calls that "the theater" because then I start acting like I am on the stage!</span> <span id="s275">But I try to control myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">(If you were going to draw a map of your future life, what are the things you would put on that map?)</span> <span id="s277">Okay.</span> <span id="s278">Sailboats, after medical school, then a house on a lake, or a house on the ocean.</span> <span id="s279">Good food, that is the important thing for me.</span> <span id="s280">Lots of fish.</span> <span id="s281">I liked fishing in Russia.</span> <span id="s282">I used to go fishing with my uncle.</span> <span id="s283">It was against the law.</span> <span id="s284">You see, there is a way, you can catch fish for nothing, just a stick, right?</span> <span id="s285">So what we would do was get a stick and on the string put a lot of hooks so a lot of fish would get caught on one string.</span> <span id="s286">Some people would get a lot of fish with dynamite or with a net, but we didn't do that.</span> <span id="s287">It wasn't on a river, it was a lake.</span> <span id="s288">I don't remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">When my uncle's friends were over there, we did not catch anything at all.</span> <span id="s290">We caught a ___________(?)</span> <span id="s291">fish.</span> <span id="s292">We started with a normal fishing pole and we got five fish.</span> <span id="s293">This was my mother's brother, Sergei.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">(To go to medical school, what are you going to have to do?)</span> <span id="s295">I am going to have to get a very good education.</span> <span id="s296">(Where will you go to high school?)</span> <span id="s297">I haven't thought about that yet, I don't know a lot of high schools yet.</span> <span id="s298">(Are you more likely to go to a Jewish Academy, or to a public high school?)</span> <span id="s299">Public high school, I think.</span> <span id="s300">But I hope that after I finish that school I will be able to go to a good college.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">(How do you feel you rank with your classmates?</span> <span id="s302">Supposedly, you should have a language handicap but it seems to me that you sound like a native speaker.</span> <span id="s303">When you came over, did you know English?)</span> <span id="s304">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s305">I had studied English in the Soviet Union from the Second Grade.</span> <span id="s306">First we spent one hour a day, and then in Third Grade, it was ninety minutes.</span> <span id="s307">I don't think my language and vocabulary developed good enough because I want to have an English accent.</span> <span id="s308">A real British accent, not American.</span> <span id="s309">I could probably develop that if I went to England!</span> <span id="s310">I really wanted to go to England, from the time _______________(?)</span> <span id="s311">If I could, I would like to go to England, both before, and after, I go to medical school!</span> <span id="s312">(Well, as long as we're making plans here, if you had your choice of any place to live in the whole world, what country would you want to live in?)</span> <span id="s313">England.</span> <span id="s314">I like it, it is ancient, there is a lot of sailing, British accents, nice food, nice people and the Beatles.</span> <span id="s315">(When did you first learn about the Beatles?)</span> <span id="s316">In Fourth Grade, my Dad told me about them.</span> <span id="s317">I have heard their music, and I have one disk of their's in Russia.</span> <span id="s318">A regular phonograph record, not compact disk.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">(Have you ever studied a musical instrument?)</span> <span id="s320">No, just my voice, I learned that in school.</span> <span id="s321">I do sing.</span> <span id="s322">I don't study voice anymore.</span> <span id="s323">I would like to play guitar.</span> <span id="s324">I will try to find a school for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">(If you go on to a public school, do you think you will want to continue being Jewish in your practices?</span> <span id="s326">whatever they may be?)</span> <span id="s327">Well, you see, I am not really a religious person.</span> <span id="s328">I don't think that I have to be religious to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s329">Some people say you do, but I really do not agree with that because Jewish is a kind of _______________(?)</span> <span id="s330">here.</span> <span id="s331">I mean that it is not really a religion, it is a group of people, who live in a certain area and have certain traditions.</span> <span id="s332">And, religion is only part of those traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">(What do you see as some of the other traditions that are not religious, to be Jewish?)</span> <span id="s334">Probably, living is Israel is one of them.</span> <span id="s335">But that is not absolutely necessary because it changed thousands of years ago.</span> <span id="s336">I might like to visit Israel but I think it is too dangerous a place to live in.</span> <span id="s337">Well, it is not because I'm scared.</span> <span id="s338">It is because the level of life is very low there.</span> <span id="s339">That is what I heard from people who really know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">By that, I mean that it costs more to live there.</span> <span id="s341">Here we live like this, but maybe in Israel we would not be this comfortable.</span> <span id="s342">(How would you compare the level of life here to the life you lived in Russia?)</span> <span id="s343">It is a jump up.</span> <span id="s344">Apartments are better here, schools, and services.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">(But to go back to the ethnic differences, you said that you wanted to be Jewish but without the religious practices?</span> <span id="s346">Is that what you meant?</span> <span id="s347">What other practices are Jewish and not religious?)</span> <span id="s348">Okay.</span> <span id="s349">Four of them I already said.</span> <span id="s350">Being nice to other people, but that is the main thing about Judaism, as a religion, you know.</span> <span id="s351">There is one main concept and all of religion is about it.</span> <span id="s352">And the concept that you should do unto other people the way you want people to do unto you.</span> <span id="s353">And this is a concept that should be in every single religion and I think that as a real Jew, you know, that is the concept that a Jew must follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">(So for you, then, Larry, it is an ethical thing, more than it is anything external in the way of any kind of practices.</span> <span id="s355">For example, do you think that you would want to belong to a synagogue?)</span> <span id="s356">I might, but wouldn't be excited about it.</span> <span id="s357">(Do you have thoughts about whether you would want to belong to a religious synagogue, such as Orthodox; a Conservative, which is less traditional; or a Reform, which is the least traditional in their practices?)</span> <span id="s358">Well, you know, what I think is that the Orthodox is the real, true religion.</span> <span id="s359">And Reform or Conservative are just the easy way to do it.</span> <span id="s360">So, I think that if you are going to follow anything, you should follow Orthodox, and if you don't follow the Orthodox rules you shouldn't go for Conservative or Reform.</span> <span id="s361">To me they are really like not believing in the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">(Is this a view that came from your family, from your school, or from yourself?)</span> <span id="s363">This came from myself, from being in different synagogues.</span> <span id="s364">It is from hearing their points of view and hearing different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">(What, to you, is the best that American life can offer you?</span> <span id="s366">taking in all your views about ethics and other things?)</span> <span id="s367">There are two things that I think are really very, very important to me.</span> <span id="s368">They are freedom and liberty; and, of course, the opportunity to do what I want.</span> <span id="s369">(Can we do everything we want?)</span> <span id="s370">I mean in the law.</span> <span id="s371">I mean, I could be a Senator, I could be anything I want, actually!</span></p> <p><span id="s372">(What do you miss about Russia?</span> <span id="s373">I know I asked you that before but I wanted to give you an opportunity to add anything you wanted.)</span> <span id="s374">My friends and my family, first.</span> <span id="s375">Probably, some pieces of nature, I don't know.</span> <span id="s376">Like the little animals, the environment.</span> <span id="s377">Some birds - - I never saw birds here like the Russian sparrow.</span> <span id="s378">To me they seem different.</span> <span id="s379">The Russian sparrows are little and they are kind of playful and they are much more interesting to watch.</span> <span id="s380">Some of the other places there I miss.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">(What places are you thinking of?)</span> <span id="s382">I'm thinking forty-three kilometers from Moscow.</span> <span id="s383">There is a small forest, and it is filled with mushrooms, and flowers and berries, and the light and shadows, with the light with such a position it gives you very good look on how nature really should be.</span> <span id="s384">(Do you think you might ever go back to see these things?)</span> <span id="s385">Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s386">I think I might go back in about two years.</span> <span id="s387">Not with my family, just to see my friends.</span> <span id="s388">I feel empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">(Do you think that any of your relatives or friends there, will come here?)</span> <span id="s390">Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s391">Sooner or later.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">(Is there anything that I didn't ask you, that you would like to talk about?)</span> <span id="s393">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s394">We have covered a lot, it was a pleasure.</span></p></body></html>
