1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">WH: Tell me about yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">MB: I was born in Czechoslovakia in Koshitz.</span> <span id="s13">My family was very religious, though not Hasidic.</span> <span id="s14">They were in the wine business, a large and wealthy enterprise.</span> <span id="s15">I had two sisters.</span> <span id="s16">Only I survived.</span> <span id="s17">I was in Auschwitz for eight months and then in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">SB: I was born in Som Cutamaire, which was originally part of Romania and which became part of Hungary in 1940.</span> <span id="s19">A very Hasidic family, Satmar.</span> <span id="s20">We were ten children.</span> <span id="s21">The Satmar Rebbe, when he came to our town, stopped in our house.</span> <span id="s22">My father loved to be involved in community affairs, with talmud torah and the Beis Medrash.</span> <span id="s23">My mother was in the store at 8: 00 A.M.</span> <span id="s24">There was a Jewish girl who took care of kashrus and two maids.</span> <span id="s25">My father came into the business later in the day.</span> <span id="s26">Of course she also had the ten children and was therefore a very capable woman.</span> <span id="s27">My father also gave loans to poor people.</span> <span id="s28">They were special people.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WH: Where were you in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">SB: I was the third oldest and I’m the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s31">During the war it was only a fight to survive, but afterwards, it was much harder to get oneself together, to understand why I was spared.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">WH: Do you think it was luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">SB: In no way could it only have been luck.</span> <span id="s34">It was just written down (in heaven one presumes) that someone should survive.</span> <span id="s35">I was in Auschwitz a short time and was then transferred to Plazsow.</span> <span id="s36">I was sent to clean up in the Warsaw Ghetto, to take it apart after the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: And you were there for the entire war?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SB: No.</span> <span id="s39">After the Russians came close to Warsaw, we were marched away.</span> <span id="s40">They didn’t let us drink water from the river but I had a beer bottle and I filled it with the dirt water that ran off on the side of the streets.</span> <span id="s41">Later I went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s42">I also had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: You were determined to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">SB: I was determined to survive, no matter what it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">MB: With what we went through, we had more education there at age 16, than people here.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WH: Have you ever been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MB: Yes.</span> <span id="s48">My granddaughter will go there this summer to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: So what happened at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">SB: I saw that my family was dead and the Germans were still alive.</span> <span id="s51">And I asked if there was a God, how could this happen?</span> <span id="s52">I think if there had been psychiatrists around in the DP camps right after the war it would have been good.</span> <span id="s53">Many people committed suicide right after the war.</span> <span id="s54">There was no one to help us adjust.</span> <span id="s55">And at that time I said there’s no such thing as God.</span> <span id="s56">But we had a rabbi from our town, But the Klosenberger Rav talked to us and told us we had more of a responsibility to believe after what happened.</span> <span id="s57">He organized, with American money, a yeshiva in Foerenwald and I went there.</span> <span id="s58">There were about 25 students our age.</span> <span id="s59">We wore old clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">WH: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">MB: I went home after the war for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s62">I stayed in Romania and after two years we married.</span> <span id="s63">We went to Italy right before the 1948 War.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">SB: When the war broke out, I decided to go to Israel to fight.</span> <span id="s65">But my wife started to cry and said: “You cannot leave me here.</span> <span id="s66">I’m pregnant.”</span> <span id="s67">So I said: “Miriam I have to go because if we lose this war there won’t be anyone here to assist because no Jews will survive.”</span> <span id="s68">We were nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s69">So my wife cried that I couldn’t and we stayed.</span> <span id="s70">Actually, at that time one couldn’t go anyway from Italy.</span> <span id="s71">Actually, most of the people who went then, ended up in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s72">We stayed in Italy for three years and came to the U.S. in 1951.</span> <span id="s73">In Italy I peddled nylons, watches, socks, whatever, trying to survive from day to day.</span> <span id="s74">I had some money I’d brought from Romania.</span> <span id="s75">But I was pick- pocketed when I went to buy some watches, I didn’t tell my wife.</span> <span id="s76">A friend gave me some help to start over again.</span> <span id="s77">Our first child was born in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: How did you get to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">MB: Through the Joint.</span> <span id="s80">Our contacts came from Reading, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s81">They had an apartment for us, completely furnished.</span> <span id="s82">They gave us everything we needed.</span> <span id="s83">They even polished the doorknobs.</span> <span id="s84">Their kindness was incredible.</span> <span id="s85">It broke my heart when I realized we weren’t going to stay there.</span> <span id="s86">We were religious and needed an Orthodoz shul, a mikveh, a kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s87">It was mostly German Jews who had escaped the war.</span> <span id="s88">I told the rabbi “I’m 22 and I come from a prominent family and I want to remain Jewish (meaning, religious.)”</span> <span id="s89">So we came to New York and settled in totally on our own because, since we left Reading, the HIAS or Joint wouldn’t give us a penny.</span> <span id="s90">They didn’t want more Jews in N. Y.</span> <span id="s91">So we took an apartment that had two mattresses with springs.</span> <span id="s92">We bought a used kitchen set with three chairs, the fourth one must have gotten broken.</span> <span id="s93">And the apartment was $33.00 a month.</span> <span id="s94">It was on Stockton Street in Bedford Stuyvesant.</span> <span id="s95">It was a walkup.</span> <span id="s96">I went to night school.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">SB: I went to work.</span> <span id="s99">No one helped me.</span> <span id="s100">So I took the first job I could get, as a butcher’s helper for 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s101">I also cleaned toilets for three months.</span> <span id="s102">But, eventually I learned to be a butcher.</span> <span id="s103">I spoke Italian perfectly and I asked the butcher Luigi, for a job.</span> <span id="s104">And he taught me.</span> <span id="s105">I’d never done it before.</span> <span id="s106">I didn’t even know how to hold a knife, how to sharpen it.</span> <span id="s107">He came to like and trust me.</span> <span id="s108">The driver wanted me to steal and I told him: “I don’t steal.”</span> <span id="s109">I worked hard and was not lazy.</span> <span id="s110">And that’s how I came to be a butcher.</span> <span id="s111">I never collected unemployment.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">MB: After I finished night school with a high school diploma, I took a LaSalle Extension course to be a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s114">I worked doing that in a Bais Yaakov school.</span> <span id="s115">Then, in a few months (1956) there was the Hungarian uprising and many students came into the yeshiva and, of course, I knew Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SB: I had a butcher store in Crown Heights.</span> <span id="s117">My biggest achievement was when I graduated from working in non-kosher places to my own kosher place.</span> <span id="s118">I came to Kew Gardens Hills in 1960 because there was no glatt kosher butcher in this area.</span> <span id="s119">So I settled here.</span> <span id="s120">And I had here a supermarket style, self-service butcher store.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MB: Two daughters and a son.</span> <span id="s123">My daughters went to Bais Yaakov.</span> <span id="s124">In elementary school the girls went to Shevaeh and our son went to Ohr Yisroel.</span> <span id="s125">Afterwards he went to Long Beach Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s126">After that, my son went to Ner Israel and to college in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s127">And I worked in the butcher store helping my husband.</span> <span id="s128">The hardest thing was learning to be a big store because before we were a small store.</span> <span id="s129">And the people weren’t used to the idea of choosing what they want, of buying larger amounts.</span> <span id="s130">We had to teach the customers how to do it.</span> <span id="s131">But after they got used to it, they liked it.</span> <span id="s132">Now, the children are in the business, but we still go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">SB: Eight years ago I had an accident.</span> <span id="s134">I had gone to a Satmar meeting to see how we could help them get more help from the government.</span> <span id="s135">It was a rainy day and I broke my foot.</span> <span id="s136">The Satmar community was not backing Cuomo in his campaign for governor against Mayor Koch.</span> <span id="s137">I was unable to convince them that they should support Cuomo but I neutralized them a little.</span> <span id="s138">Thus, after the election I was friendly with Cuomo and people turned to me to ask how they could enter the inner circle.</span> <span id="s139">I told them we would have to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">WH: How do you feel about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">SB: When the 67 War broke out, I cried.</span> <span id="s142">I desperately wanted to help even though I’m not a soldier.</span> <span id="s143">Without Israel, as rich as Jews may think they are, Jews cannot survive.</span> <span id="s144">This is my strong belief.</span> <span id="s145">A Holocaust could happen even with Israel.</span> <span id="s146">Our so-called leaders aren’t popularly elected leaders.</span> <span id="s147">Even a rabbi, he has a couple of people in a synagogue, is not necessarily a community-wide leader.</span> <span id="s148">That’s part of our problem today.</span> <span id="s149">We have very few devoted and sincere leaders today such as, say, a Rabbi Herman Neuberger, who cares about and takes care of the children.</span> <span id="s150">Or a Rabbi Kotler from Lakewood, may he rest in peace.</span> <span id="s151">Most of today’s rabbis though are politicians, not rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: What’s your biggest accomplishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SB: That I survived the camps and that I put a family together that believes in Torah and Yiddishkeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WH: And you agree with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">MB: 100%</span></p> <p><span id="s156">WH: If there’s something you could do different, would you?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">SB: To be more educated, to know how to speak to the so-called rabbis.</span> <span id="s158">But that I couldn’t achieve.</span> <span id="s159">But I never give up trying.</span> <span id="s160">And I believe it’s important to be sincere and devoted to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s161">Without that we have big problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">WH: What do you think of Elie Wiesel?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">SB: I think Elie Wiesel is a beautiful writer and a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s164">Nobody should criticize him.</span> <span id="s165">But to be a leader you have to be more than a writer.</span> <span id="s166">Look at Shimon Peres.</span> <span id="s167">He’d sell the country for nothing.</span> <span id="s168">And Shamir is also not a leader.</span> <span id="s169">He’s not strong.</span> <span id="s170">They’re all opportunists.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MB: It’s a power struggle.</span> <span id="s172">And yet, they have to decide what’s good for Israel and we have to support them.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">SB: Their children are on the line every day, not us.</span> <span id="s174">So they have to decide.</span> <span id="s175">Lebanon was our destruction.</span> <span id="s176">In the same way Afghanistan was Russia’s destruction.</span> <span id="s177">I still don’t trust Russia.</span> <span id="s178">Their aim, like Japan, is to control the world.</span> <span id="s179">A united Germany has the same (illegible).</span></p> <p><span id="s180">WH: Have you ever been back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">SB: When we go to Israel, I never stop in Europe.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t want to see Europe, stop in Europe, or put my foot in Europe.</span> <span id="s183">But I would like to go back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s184">And I go to Israel because I feel at home there.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">SAM AND MIRIAM BRACH</span></p> <p><span id="s186">April 29, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WH: Tell me a little more about your father’s involvement in the Jewish community in Europe</span></p> <p><span id="s188">SB: There was a pride in community involvement.</span> <span id="s189">Actually, you will find that most of the survivors are seeking to be involved in their communities.</span> <span id="s190">But here, in Queens, you have a bigger problem.</span> <span id="s191">Let’s take Kew Gardens Hills.</span> <span id="s192">You have a new community.</span> <span id="s193">The rabbis, in some cases, have life contracts.</span> <span id="s194">As a result, many people who moved in later were not able to gain entry into the community in terms of being involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">WH: How did this prevent others from being involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">SB: Because those who had hired the rabbis initially controlled these synagogues.</span> <span id="s197">Look at, for example, Hillcrest.</span> <span id="s198">It still doesn’t have a mikveh.</span> <span id="s199">The leadership there isn’t interested.</span> <span id="s200">On the other hand, in Europe every small town with 100 families, had a mikveh.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: Was your father involved in that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">SB: Everything.</span> <span id="s203">He was involved in mikveh, Talmud Torah, shuls, everything that was needed in the Jewish community-----a shochet, a cantor, a rabbi, whatever was needed.</span> <span id="s204">And in this community, like others, there was an open election, a fair election.</span> <span id="s205">The need for a chevra kadisha wasn’t a matter of politics.</span> <span id="s206">No one asked, like they do here, will the rabbi let me do it?</span> <span id="s207">, will the rabbi appreciate me for it?</span> <span id="s208">When I see this I ask: Why should I be involved?</span> <span id="s209">I don’t want to push myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">WH: Would you say that other survivors who wanted to be involved weren’t allowed to?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SB: A lot of people.</span> <span id="s212">But let’s look at Williamsburg, Crown Heights, or Boro Park.</span> <span id="s213">They pushed to become involved and they achieved tremendous things.</span> <span id="s214">Look at Bikur Cholim, Hatzoloh, or Chevra Kadisha.</span> <span id="s215">Anything that involves communal things is something that survivors participated in because that’s the way it was done in Europe.</span> <span id="s216">They’re completely different from the Jews that came here previously.</span> <span id="s217">Those Jews may have been running away from the army, or they couldn’t make a living in Europe, or they were caught stealing or doing something wrong.</span> <span id="s218">The survivors, on the other hand, had a business background, an educational background.</span> <span id="s219">They only came because they had no choice, because their communities were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">WH: Why were the survivors in Williamsburg or Boro Park able to enter the leadership structure more easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">Without mentioning names or individual neighborhoods, the other communities were more like American communities.</span> <span id="s223">There was prejudice against the greener.</span> <span id="s224">They wouldn’t allow them to be leaders in the community.</span> <span id="s225">Very few were able to do that, to become part of the board of directors, or something like that, even if they gave a lot of money.</span> <span id="s226">Lately some of the survivors have become more interested in communal affairs, and now, in recent years, they’re more accepted.</span> <span id="s227">But this wasn’t the case before.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">MB: Right.</span> <span id="s229">My husband was involved in community affairs way back, from day one.</span> <span id="s230">He wanted to do something even before he was able to do so financially, with the chevra kadisha.</span> <span id="s231">He was very involved in building the mikveh.</span> <span id="s232">We feel you have to be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">WH: Would you say that in some cases the survivors’ money was respected more than their thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">SB: That’s right although one can’t generalize.</span> <span id="s235">The fact is that most survivors wouldn’t have taken as strong a stand against certain rabbis as I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">WH: When did you take such a stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">SB: When one of the rabbis returned from Lebanon.</span> <span id="s238">During the time when Schultz and Weinberger were criticizing Israel very much for going into Lebanon, I suggested to one of the rabbis that we have a big rally in the neighborhood to show our support for Israel.</span> <span id="s239">So, the rabbi said: “I’ll give a speech in the synagogue”.</span> <span id="s240">So I said: “ You need more than simply a speech “.</span> <span id="s241">And he said, a businessman, a kosher butcher, should never be involved in politics because they can arrest me, they can cause me a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s242">And I told him that it is important for me as a human being, especially as a survivor, that I be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">WH: Can you explain that in greater detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">SB: To explain that I have to go back to the time when I established myself in this neighborhood to the point where I was no longer fearful about where my next penny would come from.</span> <span id="s245">Until then I always had the drive, and I guess it’s present in every survivor, or the need to be secure.</span> <span id="s246">This is because, unfortunately, during the war, in the camps, I had no one to turn to for help.</span> <span id="s247">I had no brother, no father, no family.</span> <span id="s248">This creates in a person, a tremendous fear, so much so that I can’t really explain it to you.</span> <span id="s249">There’s a tremendous pressure that makes it very important that you shouldn’t have to come to a person and ask them to help you.</span> <span id="s250">After I was liberated I always said that I hoped I’d never have to beg someone for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">WH: You wanted to be independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SB: Not independent.</span> <span id="s253">A person is never independent.</span> <span id="s254">It’s always up to God.</span> <span id="s255">You just don’t want that in a business sense you should be dependent on another person.</span> <span id="s256">I had a tremendous drive to be my own boss.</span> <span id="s257">That gave me peace of mind and this is the main thing.</span> <span id="s258">I don’t have to be afraid that the customer will leave me, that the rabbi will leave me, or that the wholesaler wouldn’t sell to me.</span> <span id="s259">But then I would have to give an account to myself: What am I trying so hard to achieve?</span> <span id="s260">Not to take vacations?</span> <span id="s261">To have two jobs, three jobs; To get up two or three in the morning and work until ten or eleven at night.</span> <span id="s262">After all, I didn’t have such a big family.</span> <span id="s263">I only had three children.</span> <span id="s264">And I didn’t feel that I had to go out to eat in restaurants.</span> <span id="s265">I’m not such a fancy person.</span> <span id="s266">I didn’t have to go to hotels.</span> <span id="s267">The first sixteen or seventeen years we were here I didn’t even take a vacation for a day.</span> <span id="s268">I came to a certain conclusion----usually I talk to myself in a room, or I talk to the Ribbono Shel Olom (God).</span> <span id="s269">I ask him to listen to me, because He has to listen to me.</span> <span id="s270">Because I went through the fire and came out alive and what was the purpose of it?</span> <span id="s271">It’s not only to have a family.</span> <span id="s272">So I searched for an answer within myself.</span> <span id="s273">What is the reason that I survived?</span> <span id="s274">What do I need to accomplish in my lifetime?</span> <span id="s275">Well, thank God, parnoseh ( business) I have.</span> <span id="s276">Thank God, the kids are healthy.</span> <span id="s277">And then I realized what it was that was bothering me, what it was that was hurting me so much.</span> <span id="s278">It was that when I was liberated from the concentration camp no one was there to accept us.</span> <span id="s279">There was no Jewish community organization that cared for the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">WH: What about the Joint and the HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">SB: They just oversaw.</span> <span id="s282">They paid employees to feed us and house us.</span> <span id="s283">There was nobody to care for us as human beings.</span> <span id="s284">There were no social workers then.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">WH: What about when you came to Reading, Pennsylvania?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">SB: In Reading, yes.</span> <span id="s287">But after I left Reading, no one in New York helped us.</span> <span id="s288">The fact is that the Jewish community, as wealthy as it is, as wealthy as America is, with all the rich Jewish organizations, it’s not as giving or generous in heart and soul, as the community was the way I recall it as a child in Europe.</span> <span id="s289">There they helped a needy person.</span> <span id="s290">You needed a piece of bread, they gave it to you.</span> <span id="s291">If you had problems, there was someone who listened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">WH: That about today when they have Jewish Family Services?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">SB: Today it’s a little more organized though there’s still a need.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">WH: But when you became involved in the seventies and eighties, they already had these things in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">SB: They had upgraded it bit it didn’t always filter down to the grass-roots of the community.</span> <span id="s296">And when I became involved I wanted that there should be a community where people genuinely cared about each other and not simply where professionals in Jewish organizations helped an individual.</span> <span id="s297">Hatzoloh, for example, is new, not even ten years old.</span> <span id="s298">So my desire to be involved comes from my European background and from what happened to me during the war.</span> <span id="s299">Today we make a big deal about the baalei teshuvah, about bringing people back to religion.</span> <span id="s300">But after the war, so many people needed a helping hand and no one cared.</span> <span id="s301">People committed suicide.</span> <span id="s302">You have today, rabbis who care about the community and you have rabbis who are more interested in politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">WH: If you were in a position of real power today, what would your priorities be with respect to the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">SB: First, if people want to be involved in a community they should be brought into the process.</span> <span id="s305">Everything isn’t money.</span> <span id="s306">You need people who give money, but you need even more people who work for the community.</span> <span id="s307">But, unfortunately, today, it’s not always recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">WH: How do you think American Jews see the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">SB: If a person like me, a survivor, succeeds financially and the leadership feels threatened by that person, they’ll lock him out if the can.</span> <span id="s310">If they can’t lock him out, they’ll make things so difficult for him that he’ll have to move out, or they’ll try to hurt his reputation.</span> <span id="s311">This is because they want to dictate to the community what should be done.</span> <span id="s312">They want to have power without sharing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">WH: Do you think that the fact that you’re a survivor has something to do with how they feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">SB: I can’t go into their mind, but I think that a survivor will come on stronger and more forceful and without the finesse of an American Jew.</span> <span id="s315">And this may make those in power feel more threatened.</span> <span id="s316">Or the survivor feels more of an obligation to be involved at the same time as he feels more eager and hungrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">SB: Because the survivor feels that he can never know what tomorrow will bring, so in his mind he has very little time in which to achieve.</span> <span id="s319">And this can lead him into confrontation with other people.</span> <span id="s320">But the rabbis should understand that such individuals don’t really want to threaten them.</span> <span id="s321">They’re not going to become rabbis.</span> <span id="s322">They can’t be rabbis.</span> <span id="s323">And they don’t need money.</span> <span id="s324">Instead of being threatened they should encourage such involvement.</span> <span id="s325">If I want to spend a fortune of money to get Jews to register to vote, I should have been encouraged to do this.</span> <span id="s326">But they couldn’t put a package together.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Mrs. Brach shows me a reply by President Reagan’s office to his protest regarding Reagan’s presence at Bitburg.</span> <span id="s328">She also shows me a letter praising Reagan for his action in the air controller’s strike.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Queens week, Vol.2 No. 12, April 25, 1985:1 “Thinks Reagan Can Get Some Good Out of German Cemetery Visit.”</span> <span id="s330">-(Brach) Although a Democrat, he twice supported Reagan and together with some other Democrats opened a Reagan Headquarters in Forest Hills, Queens.</span> <span id="s331">Backed Koch for two mayoral campaigns, but switched to Cuomo in the gubernatorial race.</span> <span id="s332">Brach blamed Reagan’s aides and the President’s desire to improve relations with West Germany for his mistaken decision to visit Bitburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">WH: I see you’re also involved politically.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">MB: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s335">I ran for the N.Y.S. Assembly here in the 28th A.D. (illegible) Daily News, Sunday February 21, 1982 p. B6, by John Toscano (his column) “Special at Butcher’s: “Koch for Governor” Brach backed Abe Saperstein who unsuccessfully challenged Assemblyman Alan Hevesi.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">New York Magazine, March 24, 1980 “Primary Time: Kennedy, Carter, Jews, and the Money Gap.”</span> <span id="s337">By Joe Klein &amp; Michael Kramer.</span> <span id="s338">He is interviewed and quoted on his views about Carter and Kennedy saying that Carter can’t win and that Kennedy would never become President.</span> <span id="s339">But he said he favored Kennedy because of Carter’s handling of the economy and his handling of the Iran hostage crisis.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Brach is also quoted in the Wall Street Journal of 9-22-80 as saying that he would work for Reagan, not simply vote for him.</span> <span id="s341">And indeed he opened a headquarters in Queens.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">WH: Did this political activity and quotes from you in the paper make others jealous of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">SB: Yes it did.</span> <span id="s344">I was involved in many things.</span> <span id="s345">Cuomo recognized my involvement.</span> <span id="s346">I wanted to be in the so-called “inner circle.”</span> <span id="s347">Cuomo asked me when I had a 45 minute meeting with him: “Sam, why are you involved in politics?”</span> <span id="s348">I said: “May I call you Mario?’</span> <span id="s349">“Sure,” he said.</span> <span id="s350">I said: “Mario, some people like to go to hotels.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t.</span> <span id="s352">Some people like to go to bars.</span> <span id="s353">I don’t.</span> <span id="s354">Some people like to go on vacations.</span> <span id="s355">I don’t.</span> <span id="s356">I’m interested in doing something for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s357">You will be the next President.”</span> <span id="s358">He said: “Sam, you really mean it?”</span> <span id="s359">I said: “Sure.</span> <span id="s360">You didn’t win this election.</span> <span id="s361">Koch gave it to you.</span> <span id="s362">But I don’t want a job.</span> <span id="s363">I want only a “dollar a year job” that would recognize my involvement with the Jewish community.”</span> <span id="s364">He said: “ I hear you.</span> <span id="s365">Go work with rabbi Moshowitz.”</span> <span id="s366">I sais: ‘ Governor, I have a rabbi, my own rabbi.</span> <span id="s367">I worked directly for you.”</span> <span id="s368">I went to see Moshowitz but others in the community were continuously knocking me.</span> <span id="s369">They said: “Who is Sam?</span> <span id="s370">Sam is my butcher.”</span> <span id="s371">So I didn’t get the recognition.</span> <span id="s372">And so the leaders tried to attack my professional reputation to keep me in my place.</span> <span id="s373">But I worked too hard to establish myself and I fought back and I succeeded in maintaining my good name and self- respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">WH: You’re in real estate now too.</span> <span id="s375">Tell me a little about how you got started in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">SB: When I lost a lot of money in the stock market in 1974, I decided that I have to diversify and so I went into real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">WH: Were you lucky or was it shrewd investments?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">SB: Neither, Everything is bashert (preordained); you have to do yours and God will help you.</span> <span id="s379">I own apartment buildings and a shopping center, and parking lots.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">WH: Is there something else that you’d like to say for the record?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">SB: For the record I’d like to say that we survivors have an obligation to ourselves in addition to our responsibilities for our families who perished not to be afraid of threats or blackmail.</span> <span id="s382">When this happens to me I become more determined.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">WH: Are you still involved in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">SB: I’m looking forward to be more involved.</span> <span id="s385">Right now I’m trying to establish a pac (political action committee) in this community.</span> <span id="s386">My son is involved in politics.</span> <span id="s387">He works with AIPAC.</span> <span id="s388">As long as I’m able to breathe I’ll remain involved in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">WH: How did you open up a butcher store here in K.G.H,?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">SB: It was an opportunity.</span> <span id="s391">I first was going to open up a store in Boro Park, but the Satmar Kehilla wanted its own store.</span> <span id="s392">Since my deal was already made with the individual I asked for a din Torah from the Satmar Rebbe and agreed to abide by his decision.</span> <span id="s393">He ruled that the needs of the community come before the individual even if I had the property first.</span> <span id="s394">So I came here.</span> <span id="s395">And then I went to the Satmar Rebbe for a bracha (blessing) which he gave me.</span> <span id="s396">I didn’t come here out of choice; I came here because it was my destiny.</span> <span id="s397">For the first two years I continued to live in Williamsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">WH: Did you miss Williamsburg at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s400">There was little here by way of Yiddishkeit.</span> <span id="s401">It was very hard to get used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">WH: There are many butchers not as successful as you.</span> <span id="s403">How did you succeed in setting up such a large operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">MB: It was foresight and determination.</span> <span id="s405">We looked at non-kosher supermarkets and saw that self- service kosher supermarkets were a real possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">SB: I told my rabbi 28 years ago: “I’m looking to move higher in life.”</span> <span id="s407">So he said: “What do you want to do?’</span> <span id="s408">And I told him: “Look at Waldbaum’s and see how the non-kosher meat is sold in packages.”</span> <span id="s409">And he answered me: “Our wives who take a chicken only with opening up the insides are going to buy that meat?”</span> <span id="s410">And I said: “Rabbi, you have no idea how much they can learn and how much better they’ll like it if we show them how.”</span> <span id="s411">And so it was.</span> <span id="s412">We explained it to them.</span> <span id="s413">We pioneered in this area.</span> <span id="s414">And, in fact, I told it to one of my workers, who took this idea and opened a store in Boro Park</span></p> <p><span id="s415">WH: What was the story regarding the tree that happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">SB: I was working in the forest where we had to carry 100 1b.</span> <span id="s417">bags of cement.</span> <span id="s418">I did this for about two weeks and realized that if I continued I would die very quickly.</span> <span id="s419">So I hid myself inn the top of a tree when the workers went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s420">But they found me.</span> <span id="s421">I decided to hold on to the tree.</span> <span id="s422">They hit me and hit me but I held on, saying: “If I die, I’ll die here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WH: How did you hold on?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">SB: Don’t ask me how.</span> <span id="s425">That’s it.</span> <span id="s426">I stayed there.</span> <span id="s427">I woke up later on all beaten.</span> <span id="s428">I walked around the camp and looked for another job, which I found.</span> <span id="s429">You had to be determined to survive.</span> <span id="s430">But of all the attacks on me, when people here try to attack my reputation, that is the most painful, especially because I worked so hard to be involved in the Jewish community like with Russian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">WH: Miriam, how did you decide to run for district leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">MB: My husband insisted that I do it.</span> <span id="s433">Friends supported but I’m not a political type.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">SB: At the same time, I established a community newspaper called The Voice of the Hills.</span> <span id="s435">Unlike you, who went to school and got a Ph.D., I had to try to understand why I work so hard; what do I want to accomplish?</span> <span id="s436">Why didn’t I enjoy myself like any other American after I succeeded financially?</span> <span id="s437">Before you came here this evening, I had a meeting with other people about rebuilding a shopping center which will cost close to two million dollars.</span> <span id="s438">I’m 61 years old.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know what tomorrow will bring.</span> <span id="s440">And there is a need to show our children that we have a responsibility that goes far beyond simply enjoying ourselves-to do for the Jewish community and to show those American Jews who did not go through the Holocaust, how much of a need there is to have helping institutions.</span> <span id="s441">Sure, the Germans are the ones who were directly guilty, but at the same time, the Jews could have done more to help us, to save us.</span> <span id="s442">They sent money?</span> <span id="s443">Money alone wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s444">And a Jewish community that is organized politically has real power.</span> <span id="s445">We have tremendous institutions that help others, like hospitals, but we don’t do enough to help ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">WH: Why is it we don’t do more?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">SB: Because the so-called leaders always preach that we have to show the world how we’re better people.</span> <span id="s448">But the world isn’t interested and never was interested.</span> <span id="s449">But I say that first you have to start locally in politics and that you also have to be financially successful because the money helps too.</span> <span id="s450">Spending time is not enough.</span> <span id="s451">Money is required to create and have an impact.</span> <span id="s452">Look at the Amsterdam News.</span> <span id="s453">It’s a small paper but it’s quoted everywhere.</span> <span id="s454">We should learn not to turn the other cheek.</span> <span id="s455">Koch spoke out but few Jews supported him.</span> <span id="s456">Now Dinkins has praised Mandela and Tutu.</span> <span id="s457">And that’s why you need local influence, not only necessarily in the U.S. Senate because if you’re strong locally, then you can go further.</span> <span id="s458">Look at the Boro Park Council.</span> <span id="s459">And I tremendously admire Malcolm Hoenlein who understands these things.</span> <span id="s460">He’s one of the most unique individuals I’ve ever met.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">WH: Are you sorry you didn’t go to Israel instead of the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">SB: It’s very easy to say you’re sorry.</span> <span id="s463">But if you’re truly sorry you can go now.</span> <span id="s464">You don’t have to look for parnoseh {income}; you have income from here.</span> <span id="s465">I could retire on Social Security.</span> <span id="s466">But since my destiny was that I should be here, I wanted to do things here.</span> <span id="s467">My children are here; they wouldn’t go there now.</span> <span id="s468">And let’s face it---without strong U.S. support, Israel cannot exist.</span> <span id="s469">In a couple of years though, I hope to have an apartment there and spend half my time in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">WH: Do you ever take a vacation now?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">SB: In the last four years I haven’t taken a vacation.</span> <span id="s472">Look, a vacation is nice, but after you come back, what have you got?</span> <span id="s473">It’s all nonsense.</span> <span id="s474">A person needs to have a rest, but if you don’t have the patience, why go?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">WH: Well, do you ever relax?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">SB: I wish I could.</span> <span id="s477">My mind is always going.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">MB: We go away for Shabbos if we’re obligated, like for a barmitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">WH: But I see you watch television.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">MB: That we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">WH: But you do enjoy work.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">MB: He thrives on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">SB: Let’s understand each other.</span> <span id="s484">I think there’s a great deal that needs to be done.</span> <span id="s485">Those few of us who are left have to get involved.</span> <span id="s486">Let me ask you this: Do you think if someone would go for a vacation, they would live longer?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">WH: How is your health?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">SB: Okay, now.</span> <span id="s489">Four years ago, I didn’t think I would have four years to live.</span> <span id="s490">But now I’m okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">WH: You said you wanted to see Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s492">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">SB: I feel it will make me stronger to see what we overcame.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">MB: I wouldn’t want to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">WH: Have you personally experiences anti-Semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">SB: Definitely.</span> <span id="s497">From my workers.</span> <span id="s498">I have a superintendent in a building who is an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s499">I had drivers who delivered meat who made anti-Jewish remarks.</span> <span id="s500">And I don’t tolerate it.</span> <span id="s501">I had fist fights about it.</span> <span id="s502">When I have such problems now, I fire the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">WH: Do you think blacks have a particular problem with Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s505">We demonstrate for them but even though we helped them, we’re the first to be blamed.</span> <span id="s506">The reason is jealousy, because we’re hard-working people.</span> <span id="s507">Now they have the same problem with the Koreans and for the same reason.</span> <span id="s508">Instead of being involved with the black community we should be involved with our own people.</span> <span id="s509">We should be worried about possible reapportionment in the city.</span> <span id="s510">We are a minority!</span> <span id="s511">We’re more of a minority than blacks are.</span> <span id="s512">The ACLU should fight for Jews.</span> <span id="s513">In our community voting in local elections is not sufficiently promoted.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">WH: Do you prefer Democrats over Republicans?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">SB: You have to go with the individual.</span> <span id="s516">The party no longer matters.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">WH: Do you know of any other survivors whose efforts to become involved have been rejected by snobbishness by Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">SB” When I worked for Koch I went to Williamsburg and survivors there said: “ What, we have no chance; we have nothing to gain by being involved in politics.”</span> <span id="s519">The same thing happened when Cuomo ran for governor.</span> <span id="s520">Now Jews vote Republican more often , but unfortunately, people like Sununu and Baker are not friendly to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">WH: Were you involved in politics in the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">SB: No.</span> <span id="s523">At sixteen I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">WH: What boat did you come on?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">SB: The General Stewart.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">WH: What did you do on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">SB: I worked as a steward bringing food to the people.</span> <span id="s528">It’s my nature to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">WH: Do you dream about the war at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s531">Whenever I have time and I think, the memories come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">WH: Are there any habits left over from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">MB: I freeze food.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">SB: I never saved food in the camps because they would steal it.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">WH: Do you live “with your bags packed,” so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">SB: It wouldn’t help if something happened.</span> <span id="s537">You could have a billion dollars today and tomorrow nothing.</span> <span id="s538">There’s no security in banks.</span> <span id="s539">Who knows how much money Jews deposited in Switzerland during the war and no one is claiming it?</span> <span id="s540">Sometimes one has to take a chance, though.</span> <span id="s541">I remember when after the war I reclaimed my family liquor business.</span> <span id="s542">I saw two Russian soldiers carrying off about 20 liters of spirits, which was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s543">So I ran after them and I said: “C’mon guys.</span> <span id="s544">Bring it back.”</span> <span id="s545">The women ran off.</span> <span id="s546">So one of them took out his gun and pointed it at me.</span> <span id="s547">I said to him: “I’m from the concentration camp and I’m not afraid.”</span> <span id="s548">And I took the gun and pushed it down.</span> <span id="s549">So they brought it back and I gave then wine, and they left.</span> <span id="s550">But I accepted things as my destiny.</span> <span id="s551">What hurts much more is when Jews attack you.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">WH: Do you feel that Jews are different than other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">SB: I think Jews are more devoted and caring as a group.</span> <span id="s554">Look at how they take care of their children.</span> <span id="s555">Or take Hatzoloh, which takes Jews to hospitals, look at the yeshivas we established.</span> <span id="s556">Of course, there are some rotten Jews too.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">WH: It’s nice to see that despite everything that happened, you didn’t lose faith in the Jewish community as a whole.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">SB: It’s the opposite.</span> <span id="s559">I fight for the community</span></p> <p><span id="s560">WH: Was the Jewish community in Europe more giving?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">SB: Yes, because people were more sincere.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">WH: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">SB: People felt more responsible in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">WH: What did you like about life in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">SB: There was nothing to like.</span> <span id="s566">I remember that I went to my grandfather sometimes for a simcha but everything else was bad (He was young during the war.)</span></p> <p><span id="s567">WH: What do you think about the fact that most of the yeshivas didn’t allow students to go to Washington to demonstrate on behalf of Soviet Jewry in 1988?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">SB: It’s very distasteful to me.</span> <span id="s569">And I know that some of the yeshivas tried to force people into supporting their position.</span> <span id="s570">And my position is we need to do more than just give money to yeshivas even though that’s good too.</span> <span id="s571">And I want people to realize that Sam Brach isn’t just interested in himself alone or just in making money.</span> <span id="s572">On the contrary, he spends money in the community.</span> <span id="s573">Some yeshivas are only interested in their own yeshivas, not in other yeshivas.</span> <span id="s574">And rabbis too.</span> <span id="s575">A rabbi’s job shouldn’t be merely to deliver a eulogy or visit the sick.</span> <span id="s576">In Europe the societies did that.</span> <span id="s577">A rabbi should do more than that.</span> <span id="s578">He should lead the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">WH: How do you decide which charities you’ll give to?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">SB: First, I like to give directly to the people.</span> <span id="s581">Second to Hatzoloh, Bais Yaakov.</span> <span id="s582">I used to give $5,000.00 a year to the Shevach School.</span> <span id="s583">I got a call from the Satmarer leader.</span> <span id="s584">I had to give.</span> <span id="s585">They’re my own people.</span> <span id="s586">I buy a lot of Israel Bonds and I give to other organizations in Israel.</span> <span id="s587">I give to Ner Israel because my son went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">WH: What did the Holocaust teach you about human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">SB: It taught me only one thing: To be determined and to accept responsibility to do things for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s590">After the Holocaust I also learned a great deal about how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">WH: Did you ever doubt God through all the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">SB: Right after liberation I said there’s no such thing as God.</span> <span id="s593">No such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">WH: And when people ask you now how to explain the Holocaust happening if there is a God, what do you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">SB: I have no explanation.</span> <span id="s596">I don’t think there is an explanation for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">WH: I know of survivors who are Orthodox, they pray every day and go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s598">On the surface they appear Orthodox, but they tell me they keep the religion, not so much out of deep belief, but because it’s the community they grew up with and feel comfortable with.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">SB: No such thing.</span> <span id="s600">I disagree very much with that.</span> <span id="s601">Survivors especially, should adopt whatever they want to adopt.</span> <span id="s602">It’s not like home where you had to hold on to the traditions.</span> <span id="s603">Today you can do whatever you feel like.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">WH: It’s mot necessarily a matter of force.</span> <span id="s605">They say the traditions make them feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">SB: It doesn’t make sense to me.</span> <span id="s607">These people are just fooling themselves talking themselves into something.</span> <span id="s608">It’s actually a copout and that’s no good for us.</span> <span id="s609">It’s bad.</span> <span id="s610">The important thing is to face yourself.</span> <span id="s611">That’s what I try to teach my children: Face it and don’t go around things---go through things.</span> <span id="s612">You can’t pretend things are good when they’re bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">WH: Do you think your own children would have a good chance of surviving if a Holocaust happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">SB: It’s not up to them.</span> <span id="s615">No person can survive without help from upstairs.</span> <span id="s616">Impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">WH: Is there one political leader who particularly impressed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SB: Believe it or not, I don’t want to say it; he’s no tzaddik but I would say Ed Koch.</span> <span id="s619">He’s not even a believer.</span> <span id="s620">He goes to churches, but he impressed me.</span> <span id="s621">Yet of all the people, Malcolm Hoenlein impressed me the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Speech by Sam Brach Honored Rabbis, My Good Friend Lt. Gov. Mario Cuomo, Mayor Ed Koch, Boro President Donald Mannes, Worthy Members of Congress and our own Dedicated Legislators, Ladies and Gentlemen: I would like to acknowledge the presence of a most important representative of the State of Israel We serve a great purpose here today.</span> <span id="s623">If the news media will report this gathering honestly, then the message will be received by our fellow Americans and by our brothers and sisters in Israel, that Israel does not stand alone.</span> <span id="s624">There are people of good conscience and heart throughout the world that will not allow the facts to be ignored damaging the image of Israel by presenting a one-sided story and promoting an atmosphere of anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">I may not have full command of the English language or a great ability to express my thoughts and feelings; but when one heart speaks to another heart there is no need for big words as we share the same ache and the same determination to ease that ache.</span> <span id="s626">You see before you a heart that has felt many aches.</span> <span id="s627">Like many of you I am a product of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s628">There is no one in this world who can tell me that what I went through in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau was created by someone’s imagination.</span> <span id="s629">It was as real as the signs of today.</span> <span id="s630">A new Holocaust today that shows it’s ugly head in Europe and yes even here in this great democratic country of ours, America.</span> <span id="s631">I took an oath when I survived that hell that when I got on my feet, never again would I allow anyone to treat me, my family and my Jewish brothers and sisters as anything less than human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">It is the existence of the State of Israel that has given us the courage to defend our honor and our place in the world as a nation to be reckoned with.</span> <span id="s633">The price for this courage is very high.</span> <span id="s634">Six million Jews in Europe, thousands in battles with our Arab enemies and hundreds in the cowardly acts of terrorism.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">But we have learned from the defenders of the State of Israel “Never Again”.</span> <span id="s636">Israel has become a refuge for Jews throughout the world.</span> <span id="s637">It has become a symbol of our right to exist, it has become a reason to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Surrounded by enemies, threatened by friends, we have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Our battles were fought for our survival, never for new lands or wealth.</span> <span id="s640">For a supposed momentary period of peace we have surrendered land and wealth as witnessed by the return of the Sinai.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Mr. Weinberger and Mr. Schultz, do not take that as a sign of weakness.</span> <span id="s642">We will pay the price in search of permanent peace, even with the loss of our soldiers, but never with the loss of our security and our ability for Israel to exist as a refuge for Jews around the world.</span> <span id="s643">Less than that would make all the sacrifices of human life and suffering a terrible waste.</span> <span id="s644">We stand solidly with the Israeli government in keeping Israel in the Mid-East as a secure and honest friend to America.</span> <span id="s645">For there is no other.</span> <span id="s646">But, Mr. Weinberger and Mr. Schultz you must be aware that to keep that friendship, to keep the only democratic state in the Mid-East as a partner in American interests, you may not dictate who should be Prime Minister, you may not tell Israeli citizens where they may or may not live.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Is it any wonder that Prime Minister Begin strongly and promptly rejected the proposal that denies Israel the fruits of a hard fought victory?</span> <span id="s648">With the defeat of their sworn enemy the P.L.O., Israel could now turn its attention to the Arab situation in the West Bank and deal with it to the satisfaction of all parties.</span> <span id="s649">This way its security would be strengthened.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Instead Mr. Weinberger and Schultz and you Mr. President have betrayed your ally in the Mid-East.</span> <span id="s651">You would present.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">And now You must all vow today as I did when I left the concentration camps, NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Thank you</span></p> <p><span id="s654">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0009 PAGE 17</span></p> <p><span id="s655">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
