A-R-L-E-T-T-E D-E L-O-N-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Was that your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: No.</span> <span id="s22">At birth I was called -- my first name, Arlette, Waldmann, W-A-L-D-M-A-N-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born June 15th, 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was born in Brocourt, France.</span> <span id="s27">It’s in the department of Somme.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Could you spell those for me, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">B-R-O-C-O-U-R-T.</span> <span id="s31">Somme, S-O-M-M-E.</span> <span id="s32">It’s in the north of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did your family have a long history in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No.</span> <span id="s35">My parents are not French.</span> <span id="s36">My mother came from Siberia -- she was born in Siberia, lived in China; came in France in 1918 or ’20 to study medicine in Paris.</span> <span id="s37">My father was born in Chernivtsi, which was Romania, used to be Austria and he spoke German as his first language.</span> <span id="s38">He came to Paris also to study medicine and they met in medical school, and got married, and they came in the village, where I was born, in 1935.</span> <span id="s39">They chose -- they chose that village because once they graduated from medical school, they had no money between themselves at all.</span> <span id="s40">So, they searched for a place that would have no physicians, and I don’t know why it was in the north, exactly what was the process, but they found this village in which there were no doctors within about 30 kilometers, or just -- or maybe less than that, 15.</span> <span id="s41">So, they rented a house, settled down, and never told anybody that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s42">It was 1935 and they must -- they -- they had a good feeling for what was happening, they were really -- had much forethought, and in fact I think this is what saved our lives, because even though in the village I’m sure people knew we were Jewish, because we were this foreign family; Waldmann was the name, Waldmann (vald-man), however they spoke with an accent.</span> <span id="s43">My grandparents had come from China to live with us in 1937.</span> <span id="s44">So, we suddenly were a very odd family in that village.</span> <span id="s45">There were no Jews at all anyplace in this area.</span> <span id="s46">But the fact that he was never officially announced that -- when I was a child -- when I was born on -- I have papers.</span> <span id="s47">I don’t know if it happened in that (?</span> <span id="s48">sho-let-ry?)</span> <span id="s49">or not, but I have papers that I’ve been baptised.</span> <span id="s50">I think the only person who knew the truth was the priest in the village, who did not speak.</span> <span id="s51">No one spoke.</span> <span id="s52">No -- no one told the Germans that we were Jews, or no one made a concerted effort to get us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: When you were growing up, did your parents speak to you about your family background and any traditions with respect to religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No.</span> <span id="s55">Well, during the war certainly not, but I didn’t really - no.</span> <span id="s56">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s57">I know very little about my grandparents on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s58">They died -- his father died during the war, and his mother just a month after I was born, and my father never, never, never spoke about that.</span> <span id="s59">I asked a few questions, but I have no idea who they were, what their life was like.</span> <span id="s60">My grandparents; I don’t know if they were religious or not.</span> <span id="s61">My grandfather died when I was eight and my grandmother died when I was here in America, I forget, 40, and she looked old.</span> <span id="s62">If there was a tradition, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s63">What happened is when I was 10 I moved to the suburbs of Paris; my parents followed a year later.</span> <span id="s64">I spent a year with my grandmother there.</span> <span id="s65">When my father came, he joined a synagogue in -- in the town where we were, the suburbs of Paris, called Le Raincy, and it was -- of course in France we did not have reform, so it was a traditional synagogue with the woman going upstairs, and then we started going to that.</span> <span id="s66">I had no -- really no understanding much.</span> <span id="s67">I wasn’t told very much about the religion, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s68">Believing in God or not, I felt was more sort of my business.</span> <span id="s69">It wasn’t a family thing, and when I was 13-14 I stopped believing anyway, and for me it was more complicated, because I had gone to church when I was little in the village, and so....</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Let’s back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Do you have any memory of your life before the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What were your first memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My first memory was being under a table with my grandmother holding onto me, to my shoulder.</span> <span id="s76">I wanted to get from under the table and she was very determined to keep me there.</span> <span id="s77">The reason was -- later on I was told that there were bombs.</span> <span id="s78">And now, this was not in our village.</span> <span id="s79">At some time during the war, and I don’t know when exactly, although I think I was pretty young.</span> <span id="s80">I must have been about two and a half years old, or three, my mother -- my father joined the army, the French army, as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s81">My mother and grandparents left the village, we had a car, and we went down to (?</span> <span id="s82">cam-pare?)</span> <span id="s83">, or someplace in Normandy.</span> <span id="s84">I’m not absolutely sure what the purpose of the trip was.</span> <span id="s85">My father later said that my grandparents want, and my mother wanted to leave France.</span> <span id="s86">Was it because -- was my mother trying to leave, you know, just go away?</span> <span id="s87">The story is unclear.</span> <span id="s88">The marriage was bad, so it might have been.</span> <span id="s89">Anyway, apparently my father discovered them.</span> <span id="s90">It’s all very unbelievable.</span> <span id="s91">I don’t know what the truth is.</span> <span id="s92">They will not tell me what the story is.</span> <span id="s93">But after a while we came back to our house in the village and my father -- well, the army, the French army, surrendered very quickly.</span> <span id="s94">So -- but maybe it was -- I must have been -- it was -- must have been in the beginning of the war, because there was no French army very soon after.</span> <span id="s95">So, this is my first memory.</span> <span id="s96">After that I don’t have any for a long time.</span> <span id="s97">I remembered the village, you know, my life in the village.</span> <span id="s98">I remember -- I remember really (?</span> <span id="s99">bar-is-son?)</span> <span id="s100">.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: After that episode that you just talked about, did you go back then to the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Did your family make any effort to change their name?</span> <span id="s104">Or to, perhaps, conceal any suggestion that they might be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, because people already knew them by their name before the war.</span> <span id="s106">Since they hadn’t said they were Jewish, they just kept on with the same pretense, so-to-speak.</span> <span id="s107">There were no special -- there was no special effort that I can think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Do you remember the war years in this village?</span> <span id="s109">Did you -- was -- were you touched at all by the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No.</span> <span id="s111">Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s112">Of course, we were touched by -- the things I remember is the food shortages, but they weren’t real food shortages.</span> <span id="s113">There was no -- there was no chocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time, and my best friend too, owned a store, a grocery store, and I remember I used to go there every day and looking at the chocolate that was displayed, and the candies and wanting some, but everything was rationed, so I couldn’t have them, and so, that was really memory for me.</span> <span id="s114">There were no explanation, of course.</span> <span id="s115">I remember wooden shoes, shoes with wooden soles that were heavy.</span> <span id="s116">I remember one time an American or British soldier on a parachute came down, and I think he died, and the villagers got his parachute, which was stained with blood, I think I saw it, but my mother had taken the - the thread of the parachute and had -- and knitted a jacket for me, sweater, which I absolutely hated, maybe because it had that connotations.</span> <span id="s117">Also, it was slippery, it was white, and I remember hating it.</span> <span id="s118">I don’t ever remember wearing it, though.</span> <span id="s119">I must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Do you remember German soldiers in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s123">I used to play with them, with some of them.</span> <span id="s124">We had a big house.</span> <span id="s125">We had -- relatively, for the village.</span> <span id="s126">We had a house with -- eventually indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s127">I think we had it during the war already.</span> <span id="s128">But we had a brick house, and the -- we didn’t have a bathroom -- bathroom that I know.</span> <span id="s129">I mean, I used to take baths outside in a tub of water, and the house was joined to -- to another house, there were two of them, and in the house next door to us there was an old, old lady who lived there with a -- who had a beautiful garden full of flowers.</span> <span id="s130">The Germans took that house, took that part of the house, made her move, and we stayed in our part.</span> <span id="s131">We had a garden too, but not so many flowers, we had strawberries and potatoes and things.</span> <span id="s132">The two yards were contiguous so that I used to -- the soldiers were there -- when they were in the yard, I used to go there too.</span> <span id="s133">I remember my mother saying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave me some, because they could be poisoned.</span> <span id="s134">I don’t know if I knew, but I knew -- I have a feeling that I knew there was a secret.</span> <span id="s135">I don’t think I knew we were Jews, especially.</span> <span id="s136">It’s like I had a feeling maybe they were bad, but I was too young to understand, really, whether they were bad or not.</span> <span id="s137">It was confusing.</span> <span id="s138">The soldiers were not difficult towards -- I mean, they didn’t harm the -- the population.</span> <span id="s139">They lived with us, they occupied the village, but to a child they looked like different people, but the people, they were not especially frightened, I don’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Was there every any fighting in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No.</span> <span id="s142">We had a little bit of -- some men joined the Résistance, I think, but it was more a gesture, I think.</span> <span id="s143">When -- we didn’t have bombs.</span> <span id="s144">Bombs didn’t fall on us.</span> <span id="s145">They fall -- fell on the village not too far from us.</span> <span id="s146">Because they had V8s, they had bunkers, the Germans, and they were sending the V8 to Germany from that place.</span> <span id="s147">So, they could bomb quite a bit, but not us.</span> <span id="s148">There were about 10 kilometers away from our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did your parents seem at all uncomfortable, or nervous, when the Germans were near them?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s151">I -- my parents were very anxious.</span> <span id="s152">Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">My father spoke German.</span> <span id="s154">You know, this was his mother tongue.</span> <span id="s155">So, I think that that was very useful.</span> <span id="s156">I think he treated the German soldiers as well as the French people, and that was helpful for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What languages did you speak in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: We spoke two languages.</span> <span id="s159">I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and my mother, and French with my father and my mother too.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did you have any idea what a Jew was?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Had there been any discussion about Jews, to the best of your recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: In those....</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did your parents have any discussions that you might have been present for, or you might have overheard, about what was happening in other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: You know, I don’t think I had any knowledge of concentration camps or any -- any such thing at all.</span> <span id="s168">I knew the Germans were bad.</span> <span id="s169">There was killing and bombs.</span> <span id="s170">There was danger and I knew there was something very bad and that the Germans -- we were hoping would leave.</span> <span id="s171">That’s about as far as it got.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did you get a sense from the people in the village that they knew something of your family secret, or they were protective of you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No, I didn’t -- no, not at all.</span> <span id="s174">I thought -- we had a privileged position, being the doctor.</span> <span id="s175">My father was respected.</span> <span id="s176">He was a good doctor.</span> <span id="s177">He is, yeah.</span> <span id="s178">He was well liked.</span> <span id="s179">He was quite devoted to his people.</span> <span id="s180">He used to go by car, by -- first by bicycle, then my motorcycle, and then by car, all around when people were sick.</span> <span id="s181">If people didn’t have money he treated them for free.</span> <span id="s182">We always had food because the farmers would give us things to eat.</span> <span id="s183">So, I felt really a little special being his daughter, but not in any different way than that when I was a child.</span> <span id="s184">I didn’t know any differently -- I was never confronted by (?</span> <span id="s185">____?)</span> <span id="s186">or I didn’t suffer in any way for being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: When you look back to those years during the war, are there any episodes, or any memories, that stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s189">That was at the end of the war; I was -- must have been eight and it was in the spring, or in the summer; it was early in the morning and my -- oh, by that time we had moved.</span> <span id="s190">The German had to -- Germans took our house.</span> <span id="s191">So, they made us move, and we moved in the village next door to us, but they were detached to each other.</span> <span id="s192">So, it was really like (?</span> <span id="s193">___?)</span> <span id="s194">village with an old lady, and it was very early, my grandmother, she came in the room, shook me, and said, “Wake up, wake up, we’ve got to run.”</span> <span id="s195">So, we ran outside and hid in the chicken coup.</span> <span id="s196">What had happened is -- and my mother was inside the house and my father and grandfather were running away towards the (?</span> <span id="s197">____?)</span> <span id="s198">.</span> <span id="s199">The Germans had come to everybody, but we didn’t know that at first, and they made us go in front of the (?</span> <span id="s200">Merie ?)</span> <span id="s201">, they separated the townhouse, they separated the men, the women and the children, they brought trucks and they were going to ship us to Germany because something had happened, I’m not sure what.</span> <span id="s202">The food had been stolen, or someone had been killed, but it was really frightening.</span> <span id="s203">They shot towards my grandmother and me, but didn’t -- didn’t -- missed us.</span> <span id="s204">But it was pretty scary.</span> <span id="s205">And I remember so standing in the garden for a minute, and the old lady who was with us in her nightgown.</span> <span id="s206">Then I remembered spending some time with the other children and our teacher.</span> <span id="s207">I remember seeing François, the woman who had the grocery store, she was very pregnant at the time and she was crying.</span> <span id="s208">I also remember crying, but I didn’t know why I was crying, but I saw all the kids crying, so I figured -- I mean, I knew I was feeling bad, but I wasn’t sure why -- what the danger was.</span> <span id="s209">So, that was a significant memory.</span> <span id="s210">I remember that.</span> <span id="s211">But again, it was not because we were Jews, it was because we were in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What happened to the people that the Germans had collected?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Oh, they collected all of us.</span> <span id="s214">The priest talked them out of taking us to Germany.</span> <span id="s215">We were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Can you tell me about your early days in school during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: My first school -- I don’t remember very well, whether I was four or five, five maybe, when I went.</span> <span id="s218">It was a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s219">The teacher made us sing songs about Vive Pétain, which my parents must have loved when I’d come home.</span> <span id="s220">I had no idea who Pétain was, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s221">I remember we had a garden, we were planting a garden, working in the garden on the slope next to the church and I remember loving that.</span> <span id="s222">It was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Tell me about this song.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I don’t know any more than Vive Pétain was part of the song.</span> <span id="s225">After that I went -- and that might have been after the war, I don’t know the changes at all.</span> <span id="s226">I went to one school, one room school, in the village and there were kids from the age of seven -- I might have been -- I might have been there.</span> <span id="s227">From the age of -- before the war ended.</span> <span id="s228">From seven to fourteen we were all together with one teacher, and I remember the teacher screaming at us because you can imagine boys and girls, everybody in one room, and I used to talk a lot.</span> <span id="s229">I would talk and talk and talk.</span> <span id="s230">So, they -- she had me sit alone under her nose, which I did not like.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What kinds of things did you study?</span> <span id="s232">Was there anything that you studied during the war that you might not have studied if there hadn’t been a war?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s234">I just studied how to read and write and add.</span> <span id="s235">It was really simple.</span> <span id="s236">I mean, I was very much behind.</span> <span id="s237">When I moved to (?</span> <span id="s238">____?)</span> <span id="s239">it took me a year to catch up, because I barely -- I knew some things, but very much less than other kids did.</span> <span id="s240">It’s hard to know how the war affected us, because by the time I have any memory at all, you know, that was all I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Did you have any regular contact with the German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: (?</span> <span id="s243">____?)</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Except to run into them in the garden?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: No.</span> <span id="s246">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Were there any -- to the best of your recollections, were there any restrictions or rules imposed by the Germans on the villagers?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s249">Yeah.</span> <span id="s250">I think we had to blackout the windows, we did that ourselves.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t -- I have a very, very vague memory, that may have been an early memory of -- we had a trench in the garden and going in there, seems like in the evening, or at night, when -- when there were airplanes above us.</span> <span id="s252">The airplanes were scary because you never knew what they were going to do, where the bombs would fall.</span> <span id="s253">They never fell on us, but it was -- I think they were -- you know, the food restrictions, which I remember the most.</span> <span id="s254">I think -- I was told, I didn’t know that, but I was told you couldn’t butcher animals.</span> <span id="s255">Gas, gasoline was restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Were your movements restricted in any way?</span> <span id="s257">Travel or....</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Not that I knew, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: When you were in school and you said that you attended church, when you were in church...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: ...was any mention ever made of Jews and Judaism?</span> <span id="s262">In any way shape or form that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, I don’t remember anything about Jews.</span> <span id="s264">I remember being -- the priest talking about Jesus and me developing a great love for -- for a man who was described as loving children, and I think for me the connection was, my family was not very loving and it was nice to have an idea that someplace there was somebody who was looking after you.</span> <span id="s265">So, that’s what I remember about the church.</span> <span id="s266">It was -- it was a good place.</span> <span id="s267">I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Did your parents attend church along with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s270">My parents did not, and I think they were very -- my mother is, I remember, was very unhappy if I -- I always wanted to cross myself and I don’t know if -- when I was a kid if I could do it or not, but afterwards, it was forbidden.</span> <span id="s271">It was like a very bad thing, and yet, it’s funny, even to this day, when something really bad happens, you know, the impulse is still there on me to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Was it unusual for adults to miss church attendance?</span> <span id="s273">Did -- was anybody -- so, your -- you’re shaking your head, you need to give me an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s275">Yeah.</span> <span id="s276">No, it wouldn’t have been -- especially the men, they didn’t necessarily go that much.</span> <span id="s277">It was the family we were friendly with, François and her husband, Marcel.</span> <span id="s278">For instance, Marcel was a communist.</span> <span id="s279">I don’t know if he was a communist at that time, or if it existed, but he was fiercely anti-religion.</span> <span id="s280">Oh, he hated the priest.</span> <span id="s281">He hated the idea of -- it’s funny, he still is.</span> <span id="s282">His wife, of course, was Catholic.</span> <span id="s283">Everybody was Catholic in the village.</span> <span id="s284">You know, everybody had been baptised.</span> <span id="s285">And -- you know, I don’t think she went much to church, either.</span> <span id="s286">I mean, you were Catholic because that was part of your -- of your way of living, everyone was baptised, it was normal.</span> <span id="s287">But you didn’t have to practice.</span> <span id="s288">So, that not very many people would go to church.</span> <span id="s289">But they would go in the priest if they were sick.</span> <span id="s290">I mean, you took no chances, and baptisms were obligated, communion, first communion.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Did you participate in any of the Catholic rituals, other than going to church, was there anything above -- above that level of observance that you engaged in?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I didn’t -- well, I would have been too young for first communion, and I don’t think there is more children take communion.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Were there any church events, or anything like that?</span> <span id="s294">Maybe I should have made the question more clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I very faintly think there was a ceremony, something with flowers, and I don’t know if I went or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did your family observe Christmas in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: No.</span> <span id="s298">They didn’t observe -- observe many holidays, no Jewish holidays, in those days.</span> <span id="s299">Not Christmas’s.</span> <span id="s300">I may have gotten a book, or something like that.</span> <span id="s301">May have gotten a present, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And not Easter?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No.</span> <span id="s304">No, Easter was not part of the (?</span> <span id="s305">___?)</span> <span id="s306">.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: When you look back on those days, do you have a sense that people really knew you were Jewish, or do you have a sense now as an adult, looking back...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: ...do you have a sense that maybe they weren’t sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I don’t think they were sure in the sense that they had proof, or they had seen any signs of being Jewish, or like Yamika, or any of the traditional signs.</span> <span id="s311">Of course, there were no synagogues in the village, you would have to go 40 kilometers to the town.</span> <span id="s312">So, they didn’t have solid proof.</span> <span id="s313">On the other hand, I think the name is a Jewish name by itself, Waldmann, apparently, Waldmann (vald-man), my parents were -- they had dark hair and -- everybody in the family looks more Jewish than I do.</span> <span id="s314">I’m the only one with this lighter hair and blue eyes, and so, I think everybody suspected.</span> <span id="s315">I think it was pretty common suspicion or knowledge.</span> <span id="s316">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Was your -- to your knowledge, again, was there any incentive for the town’s people, or the villagers, to pursue this, or to turn you in as a suspected Jew?</span> <span id="s318">Was there any motivation, or incentive, for this kind of act?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s320">It’s -- it’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s321">For -- for most of the people I don’t think there was any incentive, because my father was the doctor and he helped everybody and he was well liked.</span> <span id="s322">So, there was no reason to kill the village doctor and then be left without anybody.</span> <span id="s323">On a personal level, it was interesting and more complicated, because much later on, about 10 years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that’s what my mother had told me that no one knew in the village.</span> <span id="s324">It was a very well-kept secret and that’s why we never had any troubles.</span> <span id="s325">I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my father’s mistress, and this was common knowledge in the village, everybody knew, and he certainly would have had incentive to get rid of him, and he didn’t.</span> <span id="s326">He -- he was the one who told me when I mentioned that nobody knew we were Jews in the village, he started to laugh and said, “Everybody knew, but we were not animals.”</span> <span id="s327">So -- so, we were saved by the grace, in a way, of this man, and of the whole village.</span> <span id="s328">Certainly they could have gotten rid of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did the man say any more to you in your conversation 10 years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s331">It’s interesting, because we -- we have all -- we are all friendly still.</span> <span id="s332">But it is also a taboo subject.</span> <span id="s333">The relationship between my father and François -- when I speak to François, which I do quite often from here, I call her.</span> <span id="s334">We have never, never mentioned -- she calls my father Dr. Valmon (ph), because they have changed their name since, and it’s all really kind of funny, but I feel that she wants her privacy and it’s not to me -- for me to -- to invade it, although I am very curious and I would like to ask questions about their relationship, and whatever happened back then.</span> <span id="s335">But (?</span> <span id="s336">___?)</span> <span id="s337">.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: There must have been many other events that occurred during the war years, in your life.</span> <span id="s339">Can you reconstruct some of what your life was like during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I have very few memories of my childhood.</span> <span id="s341">The war years in -- in a way, well it’s a paradox, but when I was 10 and I moved to live in the suburbs of Paris, this was to me a much more painful event than any of the war years.</span> <span id="s342">I liked living in the village.</span> <span id="s343">I was happy there despite the war, and despite the difficulties, it was a better time in my life, and so, the -- the loss at the same time when I was eight, after the war ended my grandfather died and that was a tremendous loss to me, and -- and I have very, very few memories of -- maybe the two years before he died and none -- none at all between eight -- eight and ten and a half.</span> <span id="s344">I have absolute no memories at all.</span> <span id="s345">It’s all erased.</span> <span id="s346">But I have one memory at the end of the war, I remember, it was -- we were standing in front of my house with my family, I think, and two tanks came with either American or Canadian soldiers, and the Germans stood in between the soldiers, in between the tanks, and they threw their hands up in the air and their weapons fell down, and the soldiers threw us gum, which we’ve never seen, like, you kept that piece of gum and chewed on it, I think, for two weeks.</span> <span id="s347">At night I would put it away.</span> <span id="s348">And that was it.</span> <span id="s349">That was the end of the war, and then the woman next -- across the street from us, she was a spinster.</span> <span id="s350">Apparently, she had been sleeping with a soldier -- with some soldiers, which -- it makes me laugh, because when I was a child I thought of her as so ancient.</span> <span id="s351">You know, it was like a 90-year-old woman; maybe she was 30 or 40, who knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it was -- it was kind of comical to think of her sleeping with everybody.</span> <span id="s352">She got her head shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Which soldiers was she -- German or....</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: German.</span> <span id="s355">We only had Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Not -- not the liberating soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Oh hell, no.</span> <span id="s358">They wouldn’t have -- nobody in France would shave your head for sleeping with a man, but soldiers, you know, German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: We have to pause to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">...TAPE CHANGE.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Question: This is Tape 1, side B.</span> <span id="s362">We are interviewing Arlette de Long.</span> <span id="s363">And you were telling me about the woman who had her head shaved...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Answer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: ...for having slept with German...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: ...with German soldiers...</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Or soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: ...or a German soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: A German soldier.</span> <span id="s371">I didn’t know anything about it, of course, until, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s372">Her name was Mademoiselle Levon (ph) and it -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s373">You know, things were done, I think, people got self-righteous in the village afterwards, but I really don’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s374">Unfortunately after that, I have no memories.</span> <span id="s375">That’s my last memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You mentioned earlier about moving...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: ...to the suburbs of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Why did your family move?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Ostensibly the reason was because I needed a better education.</span> <span id="s382">The truth was that Amiens, which was a big town 40 kilometers away, could have provided a perfectly good education for me as a boarder and I could home on the weekends, but my mother wanted to move.</span> <span id="s383">She wanted out of there, which was understandable.</span> <span id="s384">My father did not, but eventually he gave in, and so, we moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And you also mentioned earlier that it was in -- in this new home that your father joined a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Can you tell me your first memories of your introduction to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s389">Unfortunately, they were very, very negative.</span> <span id="s390">Even though I was, you know, 11 at least, I don’t think my parents had explained to me any -- any of what was -- what had happened.</span> <span id="s391">And also, because at the same time I was going to the Girl Scouts and the Girl Scouts were Protestant, the troop, and so, I was -- I went back to church, but this time to the Protestant temple, which again, I liked, because at least they spoke English -- or French.</span> <span id="s392">You know, I could understand some of it.</span> <span id="s393">But I remember -- and I have it to this day, I am ashamed of the feeling, but I can’t help it, sort of visceral dislike for the way the people looked, the Jews looked, because I did not know that those were the survivors.</span> <span id="s394">You know?</span> <span id="s395">So, they looked battered and they looked sad and they looked grey, you know?</span> <span id="s396">I didn’t know any of that, and so, they looked awful to me, you know, those people compared to the Catholic who were young and, you know, in good health and certainly didn’t have the past.</span> <span id="s397">So, I wished I -- I wanted to be like all the other girls.</span> <span id="s398">I wanted to go to church, you know, legitimately.</span> <span id="s399">I wanted to take communion, I wanted to continue believing in Christ and -- you know, and then -- by then it was a terrible thing, and I was required to hate -- hate the Christians, but I had no whelm of hatred in me for Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Why were you required to hate the Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: That was my mother’s call for allegiance, so-to-speak.</span> <span id="s402">If I loved her, you know, I was to love her and hate -- love the Jews, hate the Christians, but you can’t make yourself.</span> <span id="s403">So, what happened was the opposite mostly, and the synagogue was terribly boring.</span> <span id="s404">I had to sit upstairs.</span> <span id="s405">I’m an only child, so I didn’t have any siblings to commiserate with.</span> <span id="s406">I was sitting there with my mother, who didn’t believe in anything, and was, you know, just sitting there and I think she was talking with other women.</span> <span id="s407">The rituals didn’t -- you know, I missed the church ritual and the respect when you go in the church; you’re quiet, you pray.</span> <span id="s408">There, it was just sort of sitting up there watching men in dark suits downstairs.</span> <span id="s409">The rabbi, who was mean and ugly.</span> <span id="s410">His wife, who was -- her hair was -- head was shaved, she was wearing a wig and the wig didn’t fit, and I was just there and I hated it, but I hated it guiltily because I was expected not to, and it meant no -- I didn’t believe in God by then.</span> <span id="s411">I felt it didn’t make sense to me.</span> <span id="s412">And so, I just put in time because I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: When did you learn about what happened to the Jewish people in other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: You know, I really stayed away from knowledge.</span> <span id="s415">I didn’t want to learn, I didn’t want to know, I didn’t want to be part of it; I married a Methodist, who was not practicing.</span> <span id="s416">It’s not that I -- I hid that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s417">I always said I was Jewish, because I feel you’re born this way, you can’t erase it.</span> <span id="s418">But I never identified with the Jews.</span> <span id="s419">I thought it was more of a curse to be born a Jew.</span> <span id="s420">And so, I really didn’t want to know, and interestingly it’s my daughter, when she was 16, she started asking me questions about the Holocaust and I said to her, you know, “I don’t know much and you surely don’t need to know, it’s too horrible, forget it.”</span> <span id="s421">But she needed to know.</span> <span id="s422">She started to read.</span> <span id="s423">I started having nightmares, and so, I needed to help her.</span> <span id="s424">So, I - I started myself to read a little bit and become, you know, more knowledgeable, so I could talk to her.</span> <span id="s425">And it was -- she is now 29, so it was a slow -- a very slow progression.</span> <span id="s426">I still, you know, haven’t seen (?</span> <span id="s427">Schorr?)</span> <span id="s428">or I haven’t seen that new movie, Schindler’s List, because I am very visual and if I see something like that it’s going to haunt me for months and months and months, if not years.</span> <span id="s429">And I figured, I went to the Holocaust Museum and I went through it in a daze, I don’t remember much, except for the shoes and the car -- the wagon.</span> <span id="s430">It’s about all I remember -- oh no, the picture, the tower of pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: After the war, did your parents make any efforts to find some of the people, relatives, friends, that they grew up with before they came to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No.</span> <span id="s433">My mother is an only child.</span> <span id="s434">But my grandmother was one of 12, I think.</span> <span id="s435">So, there must have been a lot of people in Russia, but they never made any attempt -- any effort at knowing the family, or I wasn’t -- I didn’t know their name or anything.</span> <span id="s436">My father was one of four.</span> <span id="s437">I have an uncle who lives in Munich, who I think may have been in a camp and came out.</span> <span id="s438">I met him once.</span> <span id="s439">Then -- and then the rest of the family, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s440">I didn’t even know their names.</span> <span id="s441">So my parents, we -- we really, really cut themselves off entirely from family (?</span> <span id="s442">___?)</span> <span id="s443">.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No, except for an occasional remark.</span> <span id="s446">People don’t think of me -- people who don’t know, don’t think of me as Jewish.</span> <span id="s447">I think it’s because Arlette is such an unJewish name, or when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s448">Personally, no.</span> <span id="s449">I can’t remember having been directly attacked.</span> <span id="s450">The funny thing that happened -- the funniest thing that happened to me was in America, and it was a funny story, because I was driving in a car with a woman who was a social worker and also a nun, and her friend, and the nun did not know I was Jewish and as we’re driving, some -- some car cuts her off and she says, “Oh, that’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s451">They are so pushy.”</span> <span id="s452">At which point I thought, “I can’t let you get away with that.”</span> <span id="s453">So, I said, “I am a Jew”, and she was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s454">It was funny, but it was also pretty innocent, I felt.</span> <span id="s455">And so, once in a while I hear remarks like that.</span> <span id="s456">Some -- some woman who told me about somebody trying to “Jew” her.</span> <span id="s457">But I very often -- I didn’t -- I knew the woman very slightly, and I -- I don’t pick up on those things, because I don’t -- I feel they’re too stupid, you know, I’m not going to give them -- honour them with a response.</span> <span id="s458">So, I’ve been quite lucky, in retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I came in 1962, and I originally came for a vacation, three weeks’ vacation, then I decided to spend a year to learn the language and also to get away, and then I met my ex-husband at Stanford and within six weeks we were married.</span> <span id="s461">We stayed married 10 years, and have two children, and once I had the children I could not see taking them to France and cutting them -- basically it would have been cutting them off from their father, which I did not want to do to them.</span> <span id="s462">I’d been enough -- through enough separations that I wasn’t going to impose that on them.</span> <span id="s463">So, I stayed.</span> <span id="s464">I stayed in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: When you say you had been through enough separations that you didn’t want to impose that on them; what are you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh, I’m just thinking, you know, about my grandfather and leaving the village, you know, those kinds of disruptions as a child.</span> <span id="s467">When you’re a child what you need are roots.</span> <span id="s468">A divorce is bad enough, but you don’t want any deceptions, you don’t want any changes.</span> <span id="s469">So, that’s why I stayed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did your parents stay married?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s472">Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: When you look back to your childhood during the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Mm hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: ...are there any other memories, or feelings, that you have, or anything else that might come to mind at this point that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I think, for me, the war might have been like thunder in the background.</span> <span id="s477">You know when you hear thunder at the distance and in a way you don’t know whether it’s going to come closer or move away.</span> <span id="s478">So, there is some sense of danger.</span> <span id="s479">Like, there are planes in the night.</span> <span id="s480">Years later when -- I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s481">Oh no, there was one thing I never understood exactly why I felt that way, it was listening to machine gun fire, or any kind of gun shooting.</span> <span id="s482">I don’t know if it was from that one experience, or what, but that would absolutely make me shake, and that surprised me, because, you know, I was not really part of any very traumatic events that I can think of, but that -- that - I would have a tremendous response to that.</span> <span id="s483">I just couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s484">Now, it’s getting better, but in movies I’m careful, because it could send me -- it used to.</span> <span id="s485">I mean, I saw a movie and I shook for a good hour and cried.</span> <span id="s486">So, there was a sense of danger, I think, which I may have repressed or not want to deal with, because there was some other aspects of my childhood that were good.</span> <span id="s487">I certainly wish it never had happened.</span> <span id="s488">I mean, not only for all the others, of course, but personally that -- I don’t know it was damaging in some ways that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s489">I think it was the atmosphere that was poisonous, but poisonous in a way that does a child to just absorb, but do not understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So, you don’t -- you don’t perceive any lasting fallout from your Holocaust -- your experiences during the war too?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s492">I think so.</span> <span id="s493">Well, I think it was either thinking back on it, of course.</span> <span id="s494">I think for me the most difficult thing was being a Jew, because the experience was so mixed and so poorly integrated, and my sense of identity has been being -- being part of a group I never wanted to be part of, but that I could not leave, nor would I want to leave for sense of guilt.</span> <span id="s495">I do have a sense of guilt, that’s one of the reasons I didn’t really want to tell the story because I feel, what do I have to tell, you know, so many people have suffered so terribly, as I know from the group here and children survivors.</span> <span id="s496">You know, I didn’t suffer, or -- why not?</span> <span id="s497">There is this -- this survivor’s guilt.</span> <span id="s498">It’s real.</span> <span id="s499">It’s a real thing, and it certainly had a profound effect.</span> <span id="s500">A sense of insecurity.</span> <span id="s501">You know, you never know when you could be asked to move, or asked to leave.</span> <span id="s502">You never know if a bomb will fall on your head.</span> <span id="s503">But I think it was both, it was the war in general, which all the children, everybody in my time suffered from, and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew and having such strong identification with -- with a man, with Christ, with a religion which basically also doesn’t exist very much; it’s an idea in my head.</span> <span id="s504">The Catholic Church, I wouldn’t be part of it if you paid me at this time, because there are many things I think they are doing which are not (?</span> <span id="s505">___?)</span> <span id="s506">, because they didn’t fight the Germans either very much.</span> <span id="s507">So, it’s a place that’s sort of -- it’s sort of no-man’s-land, you know?</span> <span id="s508">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add before we conclude the interview today?</span> <span id="s510">I did want to ask you a little bit about your -- your life in this country and your professional career.</span> <span id="s511">Would you mind sharing just a few minutes with me on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span> <span id="s513">I think my career -- I have -- I was lucky to -- to have found -- to have found a career that really met a lot -- a lot of needs for me, and in which I have a sense of my life.</span> <span id="s514">Having made a little difference, I worked with adults most of my life as a psychotherapist.</span> <span id="s515">I’m now going to work with children, which I look forward to.</span> <span id="s516">I think I have a sense of -- a sense, a need, a wish, of -- to help those who are less fortunate.</span> <span id="s517">The greatest pain I have -- it’s funny, it’s interesting because it has nothing to do with the war, or maybe it does, is of being in exile.</span> <span id="s518">I did not really wanted to leave France.</span> <span id="s519">I left mostly to escape my parents, not the Germans.</span> <span id="s520">I can’t go back.</span> <span id="s521">I’d go back, but I cannot go back because my children are here, my life is here, and all I know, I think, I survived much better than other people.</span> <span id="s522">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s523">And well, you know, like many in New York, Jews are not Jews, we all pay the price for the
