-CONTENTS- I live in Hawaii. I was born on Jan 2, 1918. I was born here. I am second generation Japanese American. My parents were Nissei, they were Japanese citizens. I was 24 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked. I was drafted into the army a few months before Pearl Harbor. The Commander told us Japanese Americans that we were related to Japan and couldn't be trusted. Nevertheless we served like other nationalities. I did not feel good about it but we were in the army of our country. We were there to serve and we adjusted like anyone else. I felt I was an American like anyone else. I did not speak to my parents about this during or after the war.
I went to a Japanese school. It was not anti-American. Japanese Americans in the service were sent to the islands to serve. They did not hire Japanese Americans to serve in Pearl Harbor in the military installations but after the war they did. They needed men.
I trained in Camp Shelby, Mississippi and in Wisconsin. I went to a relocation camp to visit a friend and did not like what I saw, barbed wire fence, machine guns. My friend worked as a Japanese schoolteacher and was taken to a relocation camp. My parents were plantation workers and were not bothered. Anyone connected with Japan was picked up and put in a relocation camp. I did not like it. I talked to some people about it. I feel that people should be compensated for their losses and some sort of apology should be given to them. Redress should go through court and through Congress. It is wrong and nothing like that should happen again.
This was done under the law. .
When I finished training, I served in Italy and France. I did not experience any discrimination in Mississippi. Once on a bus a 1st Lt. , Black, came on the bus on his way home. The white driver stopped and told him to get on the back of the bus. A white private could sit anywhere. He went to the back and said nothing.
One time a black soldier who was going home on furlough, got on a bus, the bus driver hit home, kicked him out of the bus and used a blackjack to hit him.
The police wagon came and picked him up and the other bus drivers came up and shook his hand and congratulated him. Nobody did anything, white or black soldiers, or they would get the same. We were treated like white soldiers. .
They called us Japs and there were a few fights. As a Japanese American I saw discrimination against blacks. White soldiers did nothing. If I interfered I would get the same treatment. As long as I did not do anything I felt they would treat me right.
American troops called us Japs, you were an American soldier and you accepted. You should be equal since we were going to fight the same people. I do not have any trouble in Hawaii with
discrimination.
I became aware of the Holocaust through newspapers. Films and TV reports of concentration camps. I was really surprised that anything like this could happen. My daughter went to Dachau on the way back from Israel and told us what she saw. Something like this should never happen again. We try to attend the annual Holocaust Memorial services. This issue should be alive so that it will not happen again. Something like that could happen again unless it is kept alive. People should know about it.
Five years ago we started going to the Holocaust Memorial Service at the Temple. I feel that by going, more people will be aware of what happened and it won't happen again. I do not discuss this too much with my friends. If they are interested I will discuss it with them. I do not know if my Japanese American friends know I attend
the services.
When my daughter was in high school, she always talked about going to Israel. After graduation from the University of Hawaii I gave her permission to go to the Hebrew University. I felt if she wanted that experience, she should have it. When asked if she was Jewish, her replied no she is Japanese.
To prevent the Holocaust from happening again I attend the Memorial Service to keep it alive. I learned about the Holocaust more from TV than from reading about it. Something has to be done so it will not happen again. In University of Hawaii my daughter studied Hebrew and then attended Hebrew University. She admired the Jewish people and their achievements. I am not too sure why she is so interested in the Jewish people.
With regard to the relocation camps in America. I told my family about these camps. My daughter had a Jewish friend who was a West Point graduate and she brought him to the house. We talked about the Jewish military and Entibe and how they have to keep themselves in top shape, surrounded as they are by unfriendly nations.
In the Kibbutz where my daughter is there are students from all over the world. She is not the only Japanese.
I believe that those who were relocated to camps in the U.S. should be recompensed and the government should apologize to them.
I entered the Army shortly before Pearl Harbor. I took training in Shelby, Miss. and Mc Crory.
. END.
