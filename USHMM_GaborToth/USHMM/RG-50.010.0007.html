Bates.</span> <span id="s4">I live at 2569 Windwood Court, Atlanta, Georgia 30360.</span> <span id="s5">I was born September 29, 1922.</span> <span id="s6">And at the time of the liberation, I was 22 years old.</span> <span id="s7">My prospective profession at that time was really indefinite, because I had started college and I had a partial year at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio prior to the time I had to go into the Army.</span> <span id="s8">At present I am a real estate regional manager for Chrysler Realty Corporation here in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s9">At the time of the liberation I was with the 830th Amphibian Truck Company and I was a Staff Sargeant at that time.</span> <span id="s10">And in my travels in Bavaria, which is in the southern part of Germany, we liberated Dachau, which was in the vicinity of Munich, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: How did you first hear about these camps, Mr. Bates?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Actually, we had heard about the various camps, but had no idea where they were.</span> <span id="s13">At this particular time we were moving a good bit and we were really advancing from a town called Rothenburg, Germany toward Munich.</span> <span id="s14">I really think it was just a matter that we happened to be passing this general direction when our company came upon Dachau, and the time we came upon it, we really didn't know what we had come upon.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Did your unit know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s17">I was an enlisted man.</span> <span id="s18">I don't believe any fellows that were enlisted men really knew that much about it.</span> <span id="s19">Now, it is possible that some of our officers knew about the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And you got there how soon after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I would say that we were one of the first American soldiers to even be in that area, and I would say that we were probably one of the first units.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: You would say in a matter of hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes, I'd say we were probably there in a matter of hours.</span> <span id="s25">As soon as anybody else was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Can you give a description of the camp?</span> <span id="s27">What was your impression when you first got there?</span> <span id="s28">Sights, smells, etc?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We could see these tall fences with the barbed wire on the top, and we could see people lying around inside the camp.</span> <span id="s30">And they were all nothing but skin and bones for the most part that we could see.</span> <span id="s31">Of course, we couldn't determine whether they were dead or whether they were alive.</span> <span id="s32">And as I recall, the smell was quite bad in there.</span> <span id="s33">That's really about the best I can recall seeing it, initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Could you hear them crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: We heard some noises.</span> <span id="s36">We didn't know whether there were people that were rejoicing to see someone that was going to let them out or whether there were people that were in great agony and pain, or people that were dying, or just what the case might have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What did the prisoners do when they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: As I mentioned before, a lot of them we realized were dead, and there were probably a number of them that were near being dead.</span> <span id="s39">Those that could do anything, that I recall, would raise their hands and just sort of wave at us, mumble something, and we didn't even know which language it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did they give you any specific orders to stay away from the prisoners or how to treat them or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Our lieutenant that was with us at that time told us that he thought it would be Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s42">definitely best that we didn’t try to go into the camp, because none of us fellows were medics or knew anything about medicine or anything else.</span> <span id="s43">He felt there was absolutely nothing we could do by going into the camps.</span> <span id="s44">I mean whether we opened the gates or what we did, we had no food to give them.</span> <span id="s45">We could do nothing to help their misery.</span> <span id="s46">And he told us that there was great concern and they had been forewarned to be very careful about going into these camps because of the tremendous amount of diseases that were probably prevalent there.</span> <span id="s47">So with that none of us even tried to go in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Did they tell you to stay away from the prisoners or how to handle them if they came up to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No, I don't recall them telling us to do anything as far as the prisoners go.</span> <span id="s50">I do recall them saying that if you have any kind of rations with you it would be all right to give them something like that.</span> <span id="s51">But at that time we were moving so fast and we had very light rations.</span> <span id="s52">We might have had a couple of cans of C rations or something of that sort, but we didn't have any bread or anything else that we could give them.</span> <span id="s53">As I recall, they also told us that they probably all would have to be fed special diets initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How did you feel about these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Really, I don't recall having any specific feeling except that it was beyond my comprehension that there could be people in a situation like that.</span> <span id="s56">I believe when you are involved in seeing people getting killed a lot, it probably doesn't affect you nearly as much as if you would see this as an isolated incident and you never had seen any deaths before that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did their condition have an impact on you as a human being toward them?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: The impact was that it almost made you sick to your stomach.</span> <span id="s59">Even though I was a young kid, it was beyond my comprehension that there was actually Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s60">people that had been treated by anyone that way.</span> <span id="s61">I mean it was just incomprehensible.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you look upon these prisoners as fellow human beings?</span> <span id="s63">How did you feel about them personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: I think we looked on them as fellow human beings.</span> <span id="s65">We just wondered how anybody could possibly be in the wrong place at the wrong time to end up in a situation like this.</span> <span id="s66">And we just couldn't understand or comprehend how anybody could possibly be treated that way.</span> <span id="s67">We always thought if we ever got captured, we wouldn't get treated real bad.</span> <span id="s68">I think it made all the fellows wonder if we got captured, would we have gotten treated like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you see any German guards around?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, by the time we got there, there weren't any German guards around there, or German people, or anything as I recall .</span> <span id="s71">They had already fled, gone someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You didn't see any dead guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, I don't recall any dead guards at all .</span> <span id="s74">Of course, at that time, which was near the end of the war, there were all kinds of German army units really fleeing west to get away from the Russians, so they were going in the opposite directions from us.</span> <span id="s75">In most cases, they were just walking along the sides of the autobahn in columns, and they still had all their weapons and all those things, and they just sort of waved to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: What about the civilians other than these?</span> <span id="s77">Did you see any around the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, I don't recall seeing any civilians right there at the camp at all.</span> <span id="s79">We saw them around the countryside, but I didn't see a soul around that camp.</span> <span id="s80">That's the thing that really struck us, that we sort of wondered if there was even anybody alive in there.</span> <span id="s81">And the ones that were alive were just barely alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you see many Americans in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, at the time we got there, there weren't any Americans in there.</span> <span id="s85">But we were told that there was a medical unit on the way there, who would be the ones that actually got in there and entered the place and took whatever action they were going to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: In your military unit, did you get any advice or any encouragement on how to cope with the situation like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span> <span id="s88">Like I said, we were just a company.</span> <span id="s89">We weren't a big unit and we had one lieutenant with us, and I don't think that he or any of the others even realized that we were going to pass this place.</span> <span id="s90">We were really on our way to the Munich area, and it just happened that we came by this Dachau camp.</span> <span id="s91">It's just the way it happened, the way our route was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Do you remember any of the fellows in your group that had any particularly strong reaction to this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No.</span> <span id="s94">I think most of the fellows there were 18, 20, 22, 25, and I think most of them had been overseas quite awhile and had seen different people get killed and I guess you might say they were really not too emotional about anything, as long as some close friend of theirs didn't get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did the Chaplain or anyone ever mention this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: You mean a chaplain mention to us about the camps?</span> <span id="s97">No, we had a chaplain in our battalion, but in those last couple of months of the war, we never saw anybody from our battalion or we never saw a chaplain or anybody.</span> <span id="s98">We were just moving and we didn't hardly see anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you tell anyone about this camp and yout experience there?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Over the last 30 some odd years that I have been out of the army, from time to time I have talked to fellows who have been in that general area.</span> <span id="s101">I’ve talked to fellows who have been in other parts of Germany.</span> <span id="s102">We discussed it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s104">We never discussed it in great detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you feel like you would like to talk about it now to some extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I find the history of WWII in Europe very interesting.</span> <span id="s107">I've read a lot about it.</span> <span id="s108">I don't claim to be a scholar on it.</span> <span id="s109">I have read a lot of books on the military aspect of it.</span> <span id="s110">I believe somebody could really open my eyes to some things that happened and some of those things that went on over there.</span> <span id="s111">At my age and at that time and under the circumstances I didn't realize what I was seeing or what I was doing or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Do you think it is important that your wife and children know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I think that everybody in the world should know about this thing, so something like this would never happen again.</span> <span id="s114">That's the thing that is beyond my comprehension.</span> <span id="s115">It is very difficult to realize over the years that a race of people like the German people...of course I can’t say the German people, but certain German people would do this to anyone, regardless of who they were or what they were.</span> <span id="s116">I mean I just can't comprehend in my own mind that you could dislike someone so much that you would do this to them.</span> <span id="s117">I can see where you can put a certain person in jail, but you feed them.</span> <span id="s118">You don't torture them to death.</span> <span id="s119">This is going back to the beginning of time -- doing things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Do you think that the Holocaust TV show was beneficial to show?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I just watched part of it.</span> <span id="s122">I am not a big TV watcher.</span> <span id="s123">As I recall, I really didn't watch a whole lot of that and I really wasn't all that interested in watching the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Is there anything people can learn from this other than the fact that it shouldn't happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: You get people from time to time that you don't see eye to eye with, that you don't like or something of that sort, but I think that it should impress man that Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s126">the answer to a lot of these things is not to torture someone.</span> <span id="s127">I think things can be settled different ways than actually torturing people.</span> <span id="s128">In some of them, you know they were in there and they just were victims who happened to end up in those places.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did you have any personal things like nightmares or anything that came from this experience or were you not close enough involved in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I don't think I was really close enough to be involved.</span> <span id="s131">When I came home from service, I was never a person to let those things sit deep in my mind.</span> <span id="s132">I’ve read about different fellows waking up at night and dreaming about these things, screaming or something.</span> <span id="s133">But it never really affected me that way.</span> <span id="s134">Maybe that's just my nature, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Would you consider yourself a religious person at the time of your military experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No, I wasn't a religious person then, and I can't say that I am now.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you have any thoughts about God allowing something like this to happen or a Creator that would let it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, I can't say that I even thought about that at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you have any religious attitude concerning something like this now?</span> <span id="s140">I mean do you think that a personal God would let something like this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s142">I can't say that I would blame it on God.</span> <span id="s143">I know that things maybe not quite as bad, but just about as bad, are happening all the time in the world now in some of the African countries and some of the Asian countries.</span> <span id="s144">And so I guess my answer to that would be I assume that God is still allowing this to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What faith are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: The Bates were originally Presbyterians, and I can't say that I am really a Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Presbyterian now.</span> <span id="s148">I am a Protestant I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You believe in God then?</span> <span id="s150">A: Oh yes, very definitely so.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: But you don't believe in so much organized religion?</span> <span id="s152">A: I believe in it, but I just don't participate in it too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did this experience have any religious impact on you at all?</span> <span id="s154">A: No, I can't say that it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Now, I really want you to think about this now.</span> <span id="s156">Do you think you could have kept your faith under the circumstances that those people were going through at those camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I believe that for most people that were in a situation like that the #1 thing they would be concerned about is their own survival.</span> <span id="s158">There are individuals in this world -- and I don't claim to be one of them -- that are so strong in their faith that they could survive something like that and still keep their faith and do, I guess, what everybody thinks you should do.</span> <span id="s159">But I think those people are few and far between.</span> <span id="s160">I think there were a lot of Americans that were taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese and the Koreans who broke down in the situation they’re in.</span> <span id="s161">And I might even break down too.</span> <span id="s162">You can't tell what you would do under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s163">You don't really know how strong a person that you are until you get in that situation.</span> <span id="s164">It would be easy to say I would keep my faith and I wouldn't cooperate with them and everything else, but you can't tell really until you are put in that situation what you would do.</span> <span id="s165">You don't really know how strong you are until you are in that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did this experience change your political views?</span> <span id="s167">Like man's inhumanity to other humans or ...?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I think it probably didn't change mine.</span> <span id="s169">I didn't go into the service with bubbling Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s170">enthusiasm, because I remember saying when I was in basic training that there must be some other way to solve problems in the world besides everybody shooting and killing one another.</span> <span id="s171">And I think I carried that feeling and thinking through my time in the army.</span> <span id="s172">And I have always felt that way, even though we have had wars since the beginning of time.</span> <span id="s173">Evidently we will continue to have them.</span> <span id="s174">There should be another way to solve some of these problems without going through this type of thing that the world seems to go through, continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What is your attitude concerning the civil rights movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I think that the civil rights movement has its good points, and it has also got points that I don't agree with.</span> <span id="s177">I believe in giving everybody an opportunity to make the best thing in this life for themselves; however, I think that a lot of the civil rights movement now has gone somewhat overboard.</span> <span id="s178">I think that even though what has happened to the black race over hundreds of years was wrong, I don't think that we can turn the whole thing around now and repay them for all those things that were done in the past hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s179">I believe they should have the same opportunity as anyone else for education, for jobs, for everything else, but I don't feel as though they should have any favoritism because of things that happened to them over the previous hundreds of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What about the Viet Nam war?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I guess on the Viet Nam war, I was -- you might say -- middle of the road.</span> <span id="s182">I could not see why we were in it.</span> <span id="s183">I think we made a horrible mistake of getting in it; however, I guess you might say that I was a little hawkish.</span> <span id="s184">My feeling has always been that if you get in a war, you get in to win or else you get out of thing.</span> <span id="s185">I think we made a mistake getting in it, and we made a mistake of expanding it as we did.</span> <span id="s186">We kept expanding it, but we didn't do anything, and if Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s187">we weren't going to get in it to win, we should have packed up and left the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What about the executions that are going on -- supposedly going on -- in Cambodia now?</span> <span id="s189">How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Again, this is like I mentioned earlier, this is man's inhumanity to other men and these things are going on in some of these African countries.</span> <span id="s191">I'm sure they are going on in some of the Asian countries and I don't agree any way, shape or form to this.</span> <span id="s192">This isn't going to correct anything by killing somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What would be your reaction if one of your children came to you and said they wanted to be a Nazi?</span> <span id="s194">What would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I don't have any children, but if they came to me and said they wanted to be a Nazi, I believe what I would do is sit down and try to talk some sense to them about why I don't think they should be.</span> <span id="s196">However, I believe that if they were set on that thing, I'd tell them if you get involved in this, don’t come around and see me.</span> <span id="s197">I'm not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did you see this experience in these prison camps as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, I think the Jewish situation was one phase of it; of course, there was a tremendous amount of political prisoners in there, and there were other prisoners from other nations that were trouble-makers in prison camps that I think ended up in these places.</span> <span id="s200">I don't think it was just a Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s201">I think it was political as well as Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did this cause you to change your attitude towards Jews or humanity itself?</span> <span id="s203">A: Let's see, I don't quite understand that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Have you ever been anti-Semitic or anything like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: My wife from time to time says that if I make any kind of remark against the Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Jewish people I am anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s207">I don't agree with her.</span> <span id="s208">Some people think that if you say anything is wrong with any Jewish people or Black people or Irish people or German you're anti that.</span> <span id="s209">I don't think because you don't agree with them 100% on everything, that automatically makes you anti-Semitic or anti- anything else.</span> <span id="s210">No way you can agree with them 100% on everything.</span> <span id="s211">I don't think.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Do you feel that something needs to be done today so that something like this won't ever happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I guess something needs to be done about it today, and probably something needed to be done about it for thousands of years, but I don't know who is going to do what about any of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Can you start with education?</span> <span id="s215">Politics?</span> <span id="s216">Religion or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I think that here in the US, a thing like this could be accomplished, but I don’t know whether it can be accomplished in maybe some of the African nations or the Asian nations.</span> <span id="s218">Their whole philosophy of life is completely different than ours.</span> <span id="s219">In a lot of those countries over there, life really doesn't mean a thing.</span> <span id="s220">And if you are on the wrong side of the political fence, I think this is the consequences that you might end up with.</span> <span id="s221">And I don't believe that except in the US and some of the more civilized nations of the world that any effort would even be made towards this.</span> <span id="s222">I don't think you would convince some of the communist nations to go along with some kind of a program like this, because their thinking is just completely different than ours.</span> <span id="s223">I don't think that I and a lot of other people in the US would have any comprehension of the Asiatic mind or the African mind on a lot of these situations.</span> <span id="s224">I don't think we could even comprehend what their mind thinks.</span> <span id="s225">Some of the things that they do in the Asian countries and also in some of the African countries to us seem to be Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by Copyright Law (Title 17 U.S. Code).</span></p> <p><span id="s226">completely unbelievable, but to them it is everyday routine.</span> <span id="s227">Life really is absolutely meaningless over there in these countries.</span> <span id="s228">I mean it is really in some of the other nations in Central and South America.</span> <span id="s229">They think nothing of shooting a political prisoner or hanging him or anything else.</span> <span id="s230">It doesn't mean a thing to them.</span> <span id="s231">I think our whole type of thinking is completely different than theirs.</span> <span id="s232">It’s just the way we have developed over hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s233">I don’t know if I made any sense in any of this stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: I certainly do appreciate so very much you helping us with this.</span> <span id="s235">It will be meaningful and as soon as we work it all out, we will let you hear from us.</span> <span id="s236">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Special Collections – Woodruff Library – Emory University – This Material May be Protected by
