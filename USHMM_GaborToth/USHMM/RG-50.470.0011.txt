Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 1 Henry Kanner interview 2/8/95
SWB: HENRY KANNER: OK, I remember the last days in __________________ uh going back to early January of 1945 where we knew something was going to happen, that the Russian Army was not too far. And sometime, I believe uh very early, January the 7th or 8th, I don't remember exactly. We were taken out of the Camp and uh told to march uh It was a brutal winter, as I remember, wickedly cold, and the the trouble quote un quote started almost as soon as we left the camp because the weakest people who didn't have sufficient protection from the elements and didn't have enough food, started to falter fall back, and within a very short period of time we began to hear shots and we knew what they were. Because anyone who faltered was taken to the side. And most the roads of Poland have ditches on both sides, so they were just pushed towards the ditch, shot and we just continued. I do not recall exactly how many days we were marching, but I do know that uh many people, many people uh were shot during the first two days. I believe it was after this second day of marching where we stopped at a what would appear a large farm uh I was one of the very lucky ones, because uh they put me with a group of people in a pig sty, which was great, because it protected us from elements. Uh, we stayed there for a while and someone in the group was very enterprising and he had a pocket-knife and uh we decided to butcher one of the pigs. There were loads you know around us. uh I recall it today...laugh. . almost you know with some humor because uh I uh vividly recall a whole slew of us sitting on the pig trying to hold it down while somebody tried to butcher it Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.

HENRY KANNER Page 2 with a pocket-knife. uh Eventually, uh we succeeded, I don't remember how it happened, how it finally it took probably hours, but we succeeded and uh the pig was butchered or torn apart and um we took a piece of whatever was available with us, we ate raw. And whatever was left over _______us and we started to march again. And just around the third day, uh I began to feel that I wasn't going to make it because cold was sever and I was getting weaker, although I was in relatively, and I emphasize the word, relatively, better shape when I then most when I left ______________. Eh, however, there were some friends who were much older, and I was only what... 15 or 16 at that time. And who were much stronger and who helped me. We finally uh I think it was the forth day reached a railroad yard of some sort and we were put in open cars, these weren't the cada____ these were open coal type of wagons, and we shoved I I mean we were pushed in pretty tight I I would assume that there were over a hundred people. And it was things got pretty bad then, because it was snowing heavily. We had again no protection at all. But, lucky for me there were again strong people in the car particularly there were a lot of uh German prisoners uh from ______. And most of the German's were in a a _____________position. So they were both well feed and and uh they were provisioned somewhat better than eh they were. In any case I had known some of them because of the fact that when I was in ___________I was working in a laundry and these guys used to come to us and to me and uh to have their laundry washed, which I did, and because I knew them from uh from uh that time uh they for some reason protected me. Or at least helped me. Eh, it was unpleasant the first two nights because there were too many people you know in uh in open air uh it was very bad. Uh the Germans took ...laugh...as I Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 3 recall of the overcrowding very simply at night they simply picked up the weakest people and tossed them over board.
Eh, I do remember that someone had some matches and eh _____there was a container, and eh they made a bit of a fire and they melted some snow and we survived basically on drinking that melted snow and eating the remnants of the pig that we slaughtered the night or two before. They gained my memory state and I don't know how long we were in that car, eh, I do know that towards the end, eh I was so cold that I I I I thought I really wasn't fully conscious. We finally arrived and again I don't know how many days it took I I uh three four I don't remember. The train was very slow. It stopped at various points for hours and then moved again.
Anyway, we arrived at a place and I saw at a railroad station ___________ which I recognize immediately because we all knew Mauthausen was another one another one of the concentration camps. When uh the doors when uh yeah if you will call it doors were slid open eh most of the people were dead anyway and they fell out. I don't remember the exact number, but I don't think there were more than maybe eh eh a dozen left in my car comprising essentially, mostly of the of the Germans and maybe ya there was one Polish man and I.
Em we were told to to get out of the car and of course you know since because of conditions that we were in few of us could stand up immediately and but there was no no eh violence that I recall at the station other than the usual shouting by the SS eh "get going, get going." Eh . . sigh. .
And any event I I do recall looking around looking down this train seeing corpses frozen stiff all over, they were hanging out of the cars or people pulling them out or they were laying already on the ground. We were then eh marched up eh a hill, it was quite a long hill, as I remember ______reach the gates of the camp. Eh the camp eh eh looked Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 4 I remember like a fortress because it was stone walls, towers, in any case, we entered the camp and we were made to stay in the main assembly eh eh square so to speak where they were, they were counting people_______and we stood there for several hours until an officer, an SS officer came and he spoke to us in German of course. And he said, "you have arrived at" (I'm not quoting ver ba ver bedim) but eh he said something to the effect extent you have arrived in Mounthauser??? eh if you behave you have a chance if you don't you don't have a change. I subsequently found out that there was a Camp Commandant Commandant that made that speech. After that, we were then assigned to the various quarters. Mounthausen ???? consisted of one, two, three, four separate, it was it was one camp that was divided and isolated by walls and doors into four camps. And of course the camp eh that eh we were put in was the worst one eh because well it had nothing else but because the barracks consisted of nothing else but four walls. There was nothing else. Eh, we....pause....got in, we were glad that we had a roof over our head. We were given towards the evening a the usual bowl of of liquid eh which was cold soup, but really, there wasn't much more to it. Then we were told it was time to go to sleep and that was an interesting situation because there were the couples who stood with big sticks over us, and they put people on the floor, head to toe, head to toe,
like sardines. Pause
2nd tape In any case eh ehe sleep was eh out of question under these conditions and when we woke up, when we got up the next morning, things were pretty bad. It looked that, I spoke to some people who were in the camp for several weeks and I Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 5 found out that the purpose of that particular camp was to kill people quickly. Starve them or whatever, eh, pause, about the fourth, third or fourth day when I was in the camp, eh an SS man entered the barracks and they made everybody line-up. And I recognized the SS man very well, his name was ____________ who was in ________and he eh walked by us and he says, "is there anyone over here from ______?" And eh I stepped out and said, "yes sir," I said, "I used to do your shirts." And he looked at me, smiled, didn't say a word, but he did smile. And eh he continued and just asked eh eh there were a number of eh bodies lying around and says, "what happened to them?" And a couple of the blacks said "oh the usual thing." He that was the end of that. We were, he left the the barracks, and we were then allowed to mingle or whatever. Eh he went towards the gate of this camp and I followed him. I don't know why, eh I went with him all the way to the gate and when he opened the gate and when he opened the gate, I asked him, I don't know what posses me, but I asked him, "May I go through the gate?" And he kind of shrugged his shoulders again that half a smile on his face and um I went through. And that allowed me to go into the main camp were all the old prisoners were, prisoners who might have been in in Mounthausen??? for several years. And as I walked around, and I knew I had to get back because we all had numbers and
we had to eh stand for the counting at the, twice a day. But, again eh providence, luck or whatever it was as I walked around I noticed a familiar face and I walked over to the man. And of course he was in a prisoners uniform, but, well in a clean prisoners uniform. And I asked him, "do you recognize me?" And he looked at me and said "of course." The man was eh ah someone who was my father's employee before the war Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 6 and eh eh who I know who was very close to my father. Eh looked at me and he said, "where are you? Where did you come from?" I said, "just a few days ago I came from _______." He looked at me, he was a wonderful man, I I will never forget him, and he said, "sit over here and don't move until I come." I did not know, I did not know at all what he had in mind, why, but I certainly sat down and waited for him.
Eh in about a half an hour, and that was late afternoon, in about a half an hour he came to me and he said, eh "try to make sure that you wear your shirt eh sleeves all the way down so that know one sees your tatoo." Eh I says, "why?" "Well the fact that today you are a Roman Catholic and you are Polish and you have been transferred from Camp 4 to Camp 1 and you are going to go ______I think it was Block number 3" And eh I just couldn't believe it because eh in Mounthausen???? Jews were not supposed to live. It was something that was well known. Anyway I reported to the block where he told me to. Eh I should mention that eh the he was in a high position, he was a eh what they call a a Shriver which roughly translated would be Clerk of the eh and he was employed in the main registry office, so he had access to all the files. He has changed, I have I have failed to say it. What he has done what he has done, he went to the main office. He pulled my file and he changed it. He just left my name on it but it changed where it said Jew, he changed it to Roman Catholic which the nationality, he said Pole. Eh, that single ev event with without question saved my life. Now that was eh late January of 1945 eh I spent the next few months in in Mounthousen?? em long pause. . not really working hard at anything because things were quite disorganized eh I eh one day eh I I was eh almost eh told that that I had to join the brigade eh that work eh in the stone query and that equalled to almost a Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 7 _________________________because it was a hundred and sixty steps that you had to walk up with a _______________on your back and eh then after you got to the top you had to go back and repeat it. Eh. . pause. . anyway few months have past and eh I seen this eh wonderful man several times. He brought me food and eh I survived. Eh, as time went by, close to May eh we knew something was happening. Eh, one of the things that I noticed immediately is that a lot of the SS men were disappearing and those who stayed suddenly were not wearing SS uniform, but rather the ________uniform. I also noticed that the guards around the parameter of the camp, the SS guards disappeared, and we were being watched by eh some comical looking eh guys with eh in the sixties with guns and eventually some would tell us that these were the fire-brigades eh from Vienna. Eh somewhere around that time I remember there was an air-raid and we had eh great Mauthausen on the top of the mountain with a great vantage point to observe what was going on. And eh one of the things that I remember is that a eh plane was shot down by the anti-aircraft and three American soldiers were brought into the camp, eh chained to the wall near the gate, beaten brutally. And eh the following day they were taken to the gas chambers and killed. Just about a few days later we began to hear distant artillery and we knew that things were going to happen. Sight...we were very fearful because we were told that the camp was mined and that the camp commander had issued orders that the whole thing be blown up before liberation. The day of liberation, I remember very very vividly because eh all of a sudden there was no one around the camp. There was no one at the gate. And it all happened within like almost you know minutes. Eh eh at one time, you know, one minute they were there the second no one was there and eh someone climbed the wall and he started Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 8 yelling and then we just, the humanity, all the prisoners rushed to the gate and we went through the gate. Something that was unheard of before. And we ran outside and in a distance . . sniff. . we saw a tank, a single tank, American tank and they did not they did not ride into the camp or close to the camp. They just stopped there. Of course we rushed to them. I was one of the first, eh by the tank and eh I we started of course screaming out of joy or eh and one of the eh one of the eh em soldiers, a lieutenant, he started to speak, he eh you know tried to respond to what we were saying. Eh, of course everybody was talking in his own language but eh he tried to respond and I am sure to this day that he must have been Jewish because he tried to speak in German which sounded more Yiddish to me than it sounded eh German. The thing that is almost impossible forg to forget to me is the outcry, because you had several thousand people yelling at the top of their voices. And it wasn't eh as I recall eh a shout of joy or anything. It was just like an eh eh an animalistic outcry. People were just yelling at their top of their lungs. I was yelling. And and eh it it it's incredible to this day to me. Of course, eventually, eh it died down and eh the next thing that happened is that eh the eh prisoner the eldest, every camp every camp

Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 9 recall it was just a a like a bellowing sound. There were no words. I'm sure of that, there were no words of joy, there was no expression. It's just people I think eh in were shouting in disbelief. People who never thought that they they would see the day. Eh certainly, eh af after some time it all eh you know died down and people began to realize really what what was happening. Eh in any event, we eh everyone ran to the gate and were went right through it eh, we ran to the tank. And we surrounded the tank of course, eh eh I was, I think I was one of the first people to reach one one of the first, one one of the first groups that that reached the tank and we tried to communicate with with the soldiers. Because of the languages of course, eh eh it was very difficult until one of the eh em, one of the soldiers tried to speak to us. And I recognized it he tried to speak German but eh it sounded much more Yiddish and I'm quite sure that he was eh eh Jewish. Eh after a while, the eh Prisoner Camp Eldest approached the Americans and spoke to them, he apparently spoke English. And then one of the American soldiers and the Camp Elder mounted the stand above the main gate and I will never forget because they stood over there with all of us, thousands of people down below, and he uttered in German these words, "______________" which translates, "you are free." When he said that the same outcry started. Peopled just bellowed. They couldn't believe it. There's reaffirmation before we_______saw the soldiers knew we were liberated??? The word "you are free" eh just evoked eh a tremendous emotion of everyone. And again, the five ten minutes you couldn't hear anything, but this shouting. Eh when it then died down, eh the next words were that eh they requested that everyone stay in the camp until the em the Americans can reach for provisions and eh medications and eh whatever was needed in the camp.

Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 10 I stayed in the camp until the following day eh where eh I decided that I was going to strike out on my own. Eh I knew that I did not want to go back East since by that time, I knew that none of my family had survived. There was nothing there and I had a lot of relatives in the United States.
So, I and eh eh a young Polish man eh whom I befriended in the last couple of days decided that we were going to strike out and that we were going to walk. And we proceed. And we walked from eh Mauthausen the immediate next city, which was Lyn_____??? We tried to find something to eat over there, but the city was totally bombed out and couldn't even see anyone. We went to some of the house, there was nothing.
So, we continued to walk and into the direction of Westerly and en . . cough. . in the directions of the next town which was _____________. Anyway, being prisoners for so many years we were afraid, still, of something, eh we did not walk too much during the day. We tried to walk mostly at night. And we walked eh with not on the main road, but we tried to walk through the forest where there was cover. I think it was the second night out . . snif. . we were going through a small village where...laugh slight...suddenly we were surrounded by a bunch of eh villagers. Em, most of them elderly people, since most of the younger people were in the Army. Eh who clamped us down and took us in a in a place and sat us in the chairs and hog-tied us. And eh told us that eh you probably escaped from Mauthausen and eh we know what to do with you. I speak eh eh German rather fluently. So I had no problem communicating with them. So I tried to explain to them that eh there was no more Mauthausen as they knew. That there were Americans over there and eh I told them they are making a terrible mistake.
And they laughed at at eh and eh eh left us alone but they were sitting, standing in a group discussing it. Eh I heard Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 11 them saying that they don't believe a word and that the next day they are going to call the local Gestapo and they probably will be rewarded in some sort for catching two escapees from Mauthausen. Eh it went down for a couple of hours, finally they left, and one guy came later on and I spoke to him. And he was not so sure that we weren't telling the truth. And I told him, "look, you know there will be hell to pay," em something to that extent.
"American's come and they will find out that you had hog tied and tried kill." I forgot to say that. They were, there was one guy in the group before who suggested they had all shotguns with them, that eh maybe if they shoot us, the Gestapo would be more pleased. In any event, I talked to this man and I noticed that he was vacillating in in his belief and finally I told him, "look," I says, "you know no matter what happens you let us go and we will take care of you when the American's come - - you were the good guy." Or something to that extent, I don't remember. Sight. . in any event, they they eh, he untied us and we ran and . . laugh. . it's irony, but almost we were almost shot after the the day after we were liberated. Laugh... We then continued until we reached eh a small down called P____________? on the Danube. And there I found a one of the first DP camps. It was just just a small enclave . . sniff. . and I found that there was um a displaced person who then ______ call displaced person...cough. . sniff. . and most of them were French. Eh I we went in and I told them that we eh were ex-prisoners from Mauthausen and eh that eh I eh was French and that I you know belonged. Eh the next day, no excuse me. No, I didn't tell them yet that that I was French. The next day when a truck a truck arrived and eh it was manned by French Army personnel and called all French people to load on the the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.

Eh since I wanted to go West, I eh mingled and I jump on the truck, my Polish friend decided not to. He stayed there...sniff... and eh we were taken to Nuremberg where we were unloaded for one night and then the French were eh after about an hour or so told to load another lorry to France. And eh I tried to go with them, but eh by that time eh they found out that I was not French and I had no business. So I was kind of kicked-off. _____________I was kicked-off. And eh then found myself in a very large DP camp in Nuremberg eh which was cold eh eh eh _________________which was prior to eh the end of the war which was a large complex of ________________barracks.
After a few days I managed to go to the...since each nationality had its eh own office. I went to the Polish office and I eh managed to tell them that I could be of some help, I don't know why they believed me. And eh after a while, they accepted me. And little, by little, I eh worked up into the administration office of this of the camp. Eh

The condition in the camp eh in the camp were not too bad, although freedom of movement was restricted in the sense that we eh the the DPs were not allowed to exit from the camp and had to stay within the parameter of the camp. Exceptions were granted but required specific pass of permits to exit from the camp.
Pause....Cough...The parameter of the camp was guarded and it was guarded by American military personal. I do recall one eh vivid instance where for whatever reason it happened,eh one of the eh DP's was shot because he either came to close to the parameter of of the camp or what. I do not recall. But I do know that he was shot. Other than that the the there was sufficient food and eh sufficient clothing given. And the various nationalities were repatriated when at one time or another. I had approached the eh the eh Captain in the main office, the American Captain and requested or asked him whether he would be good enough to use is ________privileges to contact my relatives in the United States and tell them I was alive, which he did. And eh eventually I received communication from my relatives who of course had to arrange for my eh eh for my immigration into the United States.

you want me.
SWB: HENRY KANNER: ok but I will not go into much specific. That please, I I really, really, under no circumstance. I will be general, but not specific, I have my reasons.
SWB: HENRY KANNER: Well, upon liberation, we knew that the members of the SS were hiding in the wood or in the villages around Mauthausen We had broken into the SS arsenal, camp arsenal, and a good group of us grabbed guns and eh ...sigh. . made an effort to find these people. We were I guess, by definition, slightly crazed. And we spent a day and a half combing the surrounding area looking for those people. Many of whom were found. That is what I was going to say. Pause....Please forgive me......
SWB: HENRY KANNER: Sigh, I don't know eh personally eh oh yes I knew I knew maybe two or three, but not immediately in in em
Nuremberg in the DP camp. I know people who eventually whom I have met later on in the United States who told me that they found a father or a mother or a sister whom they had considered dead. And they had found them one way or Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.

In fact, I have a dear friend in in in Fort Lauderdale, Florida whom I visited only several weeks ago who found his father ex exactly like that. I know another lady who found eh her sister and her mother. Sigh...but in eh vast the vast majority of the people eh knew that eh there were no survivors, eh now you might ask me, "how did I know that eh I was the only survivor in my family?" Well, I knew eventually, I knew that people who were taking in that particular action in the town where I lived were taken to one of the first ex extermination camp called _________________and were gassed. Eh. I eh knew it I felt it and, certainly I could have been wrong, but I wasn't. Eh ________________was simply one of the extermination camps.
In fact, it was a a a model on which upon which Auschwitz was built. Because the quote un quote experts from ____________came to Auschwitz to help in establishing it.

SWB: HENRY KANNER: Tremendous amount. There were displaced persons, camps all over. Eh the there were of course the fortunate, the people of Western nationalities, meaning, Belgium, Holland, France. They were the fortunate, because they were first to be repatriated back to their own countries. People from Eastern countries didn't have a place to go. I remember there were many many Russians and Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 16 Ukrainians for instance in Nuremberg in the DP camp. And they were afraid to go because they knew what was going to happen to them. I remember visits from the Russian eh eh _________ at that time which was the the secret police, who came in eh pleading to the people to come back. Eh and they wouldn't move. Interestingly enough they were eventually, they were forced, some of them, they were forced to come back. Eh the Jewish people again, it was a question eh a lot of them decided to go to Israel, one way or another.
And they managed. Eh the rest of them, like I, and many other ones eh immigrated to various parts of the world. I came to the United States, only because eh some of my ancestors, on my mother's side, came to the United States in 1700's. So eh, I I I knew immediately where I wanted to go.
But I know many people who went to Brazil, to South America eh you know many South American countries. Or just anywhere they could. But, yes, there was a mass movement of people, eh eh in in Europe at that time, particularly, particularly particularly in Germany. Because that's where the concentration of the various nationalities was. Yes, and no matt I mean there were Prisoners of War, there were DP's, just about anyone. Eh there were there not not to far from from Nuremberg there was a very large _____________ of former Polish Prisoners of War. And they, too, eh eh had eh, as I spoke to them, had eh had some fears about returning back to Poland. I I em I don't know I guess I was luck, I'm here, I have three sons. Good citizens, good Americans, good children. Pause.....It was long ago....but em.....in my case, eh there was ....I am fortunate there was continuity. In many case there was, I know of many many of my contemporaries who came to the United States and that was most prevalent in the first two years of the war who were either hospitalized with sever psychotic problems or who Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.
Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 Int. HENRY KANNER Page 17 simply committed suicide. They simply couldn't deal eh with with the reality. And I think if there is one thread emotionally, emotional thread common to all of us is eh that there is certain amount, not a certain amount, there is there is a profound feeling of guilt that we had survived and those dear to us did not. And uh I would like to say that I handled it rather rather well, and perhaps I did.
But as I get older I find out that it isn't as deep as I thought it was. And as my son said, "we need to scratch very little for it to come out." And I think it is a function of I guess of a age. I simply don't have the same amount of self-discipline that I had when I was young. But, umb, all in all, I consider myself very fortunate. Like I said before, I have had eh three great sons, I have grand children right now, and eh I continue and my children. And that's very important to me. That's where the continuity is, I have my sons, I'm not afraid of dying at all. I continue. Sigh...I hope that I haven't board you. . sigh. .
