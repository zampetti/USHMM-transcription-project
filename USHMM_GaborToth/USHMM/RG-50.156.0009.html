Dean, Liberator, 1/26/1987 Interview conducted by Rhoda Lewin for the Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: This is Rhoda Lewin interviewing Donald Dean in Willmar, MN, for the Holocaust Oral History Project for the Jewish Community Relations Council Anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s3">Mr. Dean, could you start out by telling me where you were born, where you’ve lived, what your education is?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I was born in the little town of Ashby, Minnesota – not in it, it was a farm outside of Ashby – in 1911, which was quite a long time ago.</span> <span id="s5">And went to the high school and that’s as far as I went through school.</span> <span id="s6">Then went to the big city, Minneapolis, to seek my fortune, with my mother and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Where is Ashby?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Ashby’s near Fergus Falls; just southeast of Fergus Falls about twenty miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And so you came to Minneapolis to make your fame and fortune.</span> <span id="s10">That must have been about 192….</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: ’29.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Just as the Depression hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Yeah, we was just going into it.</span> <span id="s14">I worked at different jobs, automotive, primarily.</span> <span id="s15">I worked for automotive wholesale jobbers, and traveled on the road for about twenty years for one of the major automotive manufacturers out of St. Louis.</span> <span id="s16">In ’42 everybody started waving the flag, and so my brother-in-law and myself, one day got real patriotic and we said, “Let’s enlist,” so we enlisted.</span> <span id="s17">Well, he wound up as a major in the quartermaster corps, and never went overseas, and I was a private in the ordnance, and worked my way up from there.</span> <span id="s18">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And so you got shipped out to the European theatre, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I think it was about ’44 when we landed in England.</span> <span id="s21">I had quite a trip over.</span> <span id="s22">I told my wife I had a lot of interesting experiences.</span> <span id="s23">I went overseas with Winston Churchill.</span> <span id="s24">(Laughs) We were on board the same ship, which was the Queen Mary.</span> <span id="s25">I only saw him once.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: You mean as a private in the US Army, you sailed to England on the Queen Mary?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s28">(Laughs) Well, I wasn’t a private then, I was actually a warrant officer.</span> <span id="s29">But it was converted to a troop ship, of course, and he and his entourage were in the States, and we didn’t know anything about it at the time, but we got out to sea and it was announced that he was on board.</span> <span id="s30">He and his party, about 150 in his party, they took up a whole deck.</span> <span id="s31">We saw him only once.</span> <span id="s32">They showed a moving picture in the big theatre on the ship and he came down with his party and sat in the front row, and then as he left, he had his two fingers up, the victory sign, and had his big cigar.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">We landed in Scotland.</span> <span id="s34">That was the only place that these big ships could go in.</span> <span id="s35">They took it into Glasgow and at night down the island to Southhampton.</span> <span id="s36">The next day we boarded some ships and went over to France and went over the side, into some LST’s and up on shore, in the sand.</span> <span id="s37">There was no combat then.</span> <span id="s38">It had been declared a “communication zone,” so there was no shooting, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">We had all of our vehicles, and everything.</span> <span id="s40">Our orders were to go down to southern France.</span> <span id="s41">There was a pocket of Germans there, that were surrounded, and were just holding out, and to kind of get us accustomed to the warfare part of it, we were supposed to go down and clean that out.</span> <span id="s42">Well, in the middle of the night, we were moving along and all of a sudden we were stopped and had orders to turn around, which we did, the whole division, and went into the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s43">That’s when we started shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Now, just for these 1980s people who are listening to this, tell me, what was ordnance?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Ordnance deals with weaponry, ammunition, and the vehicles, and maintenance, and so on.</span> <span id="s46">I was in the vehicular part of it.</span> <span id="s47">In our battalion we repaired the tanks that were damaged, and shot up, or were disabled, all vehicles, all the weapons, the sighting devices for the field artillery.</span> <span id="s48">That’s what ordnance consists of.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">In our battalion, certain men were in charge of the ammunition, and drawing it, and so on.</span> <span id="s50">I was in the replacement parts.</span> <span id="s51">I had another fellow with me, Bennett Gordon, from Des Moines.</span> <span id="s52">We controlled all the parts and repair parts that went into all the vehicles: the engines, axles, transmissions, front drives.</span> <span id="s53">Had quite a big operation.</span> <span id="s54">It was just like a parts department on wheels.</span> <span id="s55">We had around forty trucks that were loaded with replacement parts, and we went into combat with all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Now, you fought through the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s57">And then what happened, after that?</span> <span id="s58">You moved on out?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: We kept moving and we were close to Dusseldorf and several cities.</span> <span id="s60">We wound up bypassing Koblenz, wound up at Linz, Austria, on the Danube River.</span> <span id="s61">And we were in that town across the river from Linz – I don’t remember the name of that town – and word came that there was a concentration camp about fifteen miles south, on the east side of the river.</span> <span id="s62">So, this Bennett Gordon and myself, we took our jeep, and drove down there.</span> <span id="s63">This was not a duty.</span> <span id="s64">We weren’t actually liberating the place.</span> <span id="s65">We did some work in there, but as we come up closer to the camp, there would be groups of civilian people – we didn’t know anything about them at that time – they were inmates of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Now, this fellows name was Gordon.</span> <span id="s67">There are a lot of Jewish people named Gordon.</span> <span id="s68">This was a Jewish friend of yours in the army, and he was going with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s70">Bennett Gordon, he was a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s71">He was my superior officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And you had heard that his was a concentration camp, and so you were going to….</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We knew it was there; work came out.</span> <span id="s74">So these people we were meeting, staggering around there, they were actually inmates of the camp.</span> <span id="s75">And when it was actually liberated – I think it was the day before – they rushed to the gate, those that could walk, and they got out into the Fatherland, there.</span> <span id="s76">They’d go across the road, and it was a nice warm day, and by the time they got across the road they were exhausted, so they would lie down and sleep, and rest.</span> <span id="s77">The stronger ones went down the road both ways from the camp, and they would go until their strength gave out and then they’d go off on the side, in the grass, and lie there.</span> <span id="s78">And that’s what these people were doing.</span> <span id="s79">We’d see them lying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: This was in April, or May?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Probably May.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Describe what they looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Well, most people had some clothes.</span> <span id="s84">Most of them had the striped uniforms, wide stripes, blue and kind of white.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And I suppose they were dirty and worn.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s87">They were dirty, and unshaven.</span> <span id="s88">We kept on going and finally got to the front of the place, and we drove in the big arch, and I have a picture of that.</span> <span id="s89">We got inside and we started walking around and we could see these emaciated people, and the farther into the camp we got, well, it was really pretty gruesome.</span> <span id="s90">But a pretty well-dressed man came in, came up to us, who was a Russian.</span> <span id="s91">I’ve got a picture of him here, if I can put my hands on it.</span> <span id="s92">Now there was the front of the camp, and that’s the gate we went into.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: We have a stone wall, like stucco, and inside you can see the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: This is the fellow that confronted us.</span> <span id="s95">This is the Russian fellow, and he offered to take us around.</span> <span id="s96">He speaks some pretty good English.</span> <span id="s97">This little guy here was a Polack, and he had a little machine gun there and he was having the biggest time in the world, ‘cause he was running around the country, shooting things up.</span> <span id="s98">And what they did is they’d find these people that worked in the camp, these SS troopers, and they’d kill them right then and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">And this is more of what the camp looked like.</span> <span id="s100">Some of the people had some clothes.</span> <span id="s101">And so this Russian fellow, he says, “If you want me to take you guys around, I can tell you more about it.”</span> <span id="s102">And he did.</span> <span id="s103">And as we toured around, these are some of the sights that we saw.</span> <span id="s104">Pictures of all the bodies.</span> <span id="s105">Maybe you’ve seen a lot of these things anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yeah, but every time you see them it’s a new experience.</span> <span id="s107">All these people, they were just like skeletons, they were starved to death.</span> <span id="s108">They had all these bodies just in piles and here’s a cart, two carts full of bodies.</span> <span id="s109">How were they disposing of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s111">Well, here’s a picture of these people across the road, that I told you about.</span> <span id="s112">Here’s a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s113">He had a stripe down the top, through his hair.</span> <span id="s114">They would do that so in case they did escape, they could easily be identified.</span> <span id="s115">They clipped it right down to the scalp.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And of course he’s just skeletal.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Here’s one more, the people going down the road.</span> <span id="s118">So we’re kind of jumping around here a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: It’s a beautiful tree-lined country road.</span> <span id="s120">Now, were these all men, or were there both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I’ll show you something about that.</span> <span id="s122">This Jewish fellow that I told you about, we talked to him quite a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Did you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, he spoke English.</span> <span id="s125">I made the mistake there of pulling out a package of cigarettes, and I was practically mobbed.</span> <span id="s126">These ones that could walk, such as these right here, they smelled that smoke and saw the cigarettes and I gave them the pack and I didn’t pull another pack because I think they probably would’ve killed me to get a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: It doesn’t look like they were strong enough to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No, it doesn’t.</span> <span id="s129">Now here are some of the piles of bodies that you were asking about.</span> <span id="s130">Now, let me get these in sequence here.</span> <span id="s131">You can’t see them, but they were loading them up in wheelbarrows, and this was a big ditch, a mass grave, and they’d take one end, and the other end.</span> <span id="s132">These first, maybe a half a dozen or so, or a dozen [bodies], were women.</span> <span id="s133">And that pile right there – these pictures here – this was taken by that grave and right in there is where this pile is, and the commanding officer of our unit there issued a proclamation that the civilians in this town of Mauthausen and another town of Geissen would work in there and dispose of the bodies.</span> <span id="s134">They’d pick them up, quite ceremoniously, two arms, two legs, lay ‘em on a wheelbarrow, push ‘em up, and lie ‘em down in the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: They’re put so nearly, in a row.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I suppose that the bulldozer come along out and just filled it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yeah, because in the foreground you can see they’re already partially covered.</span> <span id="s138">So then the commanding officer had gone into the towns, and just commanded these….</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s140">And the people professed they didn’t know anything about this.</span> <span id="s141">But of course the odor…Now in between these two windows is the crematorium.</span> <span id="s142">As you fact the over, off to the right there was a big door that looked like the big door on a walk-in cooler, with that handle like they have on a cooler.</span> <span id="s143">And you opened that up and in there was a room, probably 20 by 20.</span> <span id="s144">The floor level was about three foot down below the level we were at, and there were steps going down.</span> <span id="s145">In the ceiling were shower heads, which actually were gas heads.</span> <span id="s146">And this room was completely full of bodies, corpses, right up level with us, three foot deep.</span> <span id="s147">The stench was terrible.</span> <span id="s148">They’d haul them from there, after they’d kill them.</span> <span id="s149">The Russian fellow said the screaming and hollering was terrible, but it didn’t last long because the gas would put them away pretty fast.</span> <span id="s150">And they’d haul them out of there and put them into the ovens, and cremate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You say you went into Mauthausen, how long after it was liberated?</span> <span id="s152">The next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Probably it was the day after.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And the ovens were still warm?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s156">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Full of ashes?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Partly.</span> <span id="s159">There’s an outline there – it looks like it could be a skull.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t know if it is or not.</span> <span id="s161">These are some of the local workmen, working on that mass grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: There they are, in their vests and their Fedora hats, the Germans from town out there helping buy these people.</span> <span id="s163">And the news article you’re showing me is “Twenty-six more death camp killers named in Germany.”</span> <span id="s164">It’s from Landsburg, and it says, “Mauthausen concentration camp officials and doctors hanged by the U.S. Army.”</span> <span id="s165">They’re being tried, and convicted, for murders and tortures at Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: One fellow worked in this little area, where they hung them and they shot them.</span> <span id="s167">You see this wall, where the bullets were.</span> <span id="s168">They’d stand them up and shoot ‘em.</span> <span id="s169">The guy who worked here was lying down along the edge over here, with a rake through his skill.</span> <span id="s170">He’d gotten out.</span> <span id="s171">The people that worked in here, they’d put on civilian clothes, and gone out in the countryside.</span> <span id="s172">Well, these people were searching around and they found this guy and they dragged him back in here and they put him away.</span> <span id="s173">My partner Ben took this picture of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: This was one of the German concentration camp guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: That’s just me walking down there.</span> <span id="s176">That path I’m walking on is a gravel path and right alongside of it is a blacktop path.</span> <span id="s177">If they stepped from this path over into here, or towards the fence, they’d immediately shoot them.</span> <span id="s178">This is all high voltage.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Barbed wire.</span> <span id="s180">Electrified wire fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yeah, and this fellow here, got across there, and got in and was electrocuted and fell down, I suppose.</span> <span id="s182">I imagine that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s183">There’s another one down below there, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you have the feeling that they knew you were coming, that they were trying to clean up everything before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s186">They were trying to get rid of those bodies, but they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s187">That’s why – this fellow told us – why they’re all messed around here, scattered all over.</span> <span id="s188">They were trying to get them disposed of before the Allies came in.</span> <span id="s189">But this is one or two sheets that I took out of the files in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Oh, they kept beautiful files.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: You don’t know how beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Very detailed.</span> <span id="s193">Let’s see, there’s the prisoner’s last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: First is nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Nationality.</span> <span id="s196">Italian.</span> <span id="s197">Serbian.</span> <span id="s198">Polish.</span> <span id="s199">French.</span> <span id="s200">Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s201">The initial’s in front of the name.</span> <span id="s202">And that’s his last name.</span> <span id="s203">And his first name.</span> <span id="s204">And the date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Date of birth.</span> <span id="s206">And his serial number, which was tattooed into his wrist.</span> <span id="s207">You’ve seen that, probably.</span> <span id="s208">And supposedly the time he died.</span> <span id="s209">And there it tells you, May 3rd, 21,288 to that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: they kept a running total of how many people had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: And how accurate was that?</span> <span id="s212">Nobody knows, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And you imagine somebody was sitting there in the office of the concentration camp, typing those lists, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: These are the pictures of some of the grounds.</span> <span id="s215">They maybe don’t tell you an awful lot, and I don’t know why I even took ‘em.</span> <span id="s216">I was taking pictures and Bennett was taking pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Can you describe how you felt about what you were seeing?</span> <span id="s218">And then how he felt?</span> <span id="s219">What he said?</span> <span id="s220">Do you think you looked at it differently because you had this Jewish person with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Oh, no, that had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s222">We were good friends.</span> <span id="s223">Most all my good friends in the army were Jews.</span> <span id="s224">When I worked in Minneapolis, all my good customers were Jews.</span> <span id="s225">Wilenskys, Rappaports, and so on.</span> <span id="s226">It seemed like I got along with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s227">No, that had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s228">We were accustomed to seeing death.</span> <span id="s229">When we crossed the Rhine, I remember that day, which was kind of a trying day.</span> <span id="s230">My driver and I, we drive along and we got across the river on an engineering bridge – it was a temporary bridge – and we were driving along and I said to him, “Petty,” I says, “I haven’t seen any dead Germans around.”</span> <span id="s231">“No,” he says, “I noticed that.”</span> <span id="s232">(Laughs) Well, when you saw the dead Germans around then you felt comfortable because you knew that our troops had gone through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">So we drove along and pretty soon, by golly, there’s a couple of ‘em laying in a ditch, dead.</span> <span id="s234">Well, we felt better.</span> <span id="s235">This was a horrible thing to witness, but our reaction to it was, well, “tough, you know, they’re no good.”</span> <span id="s236">But you wondered how anybody could do it.</span> <span id="s237">And then the stories that they told us.</span> <span id="s238">This Russian fellow, they caught him eating a raw potato he’d stolen out of the kitchen, so they took him to a shop area where he supposedly worked.</span> <span id="s239">And there was like a footstool about so high, and up above that was an eyebolt coming out of the ceiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">He ways they stood him up on that stool, took a rope and put it through the eyebolt in the ceiling, had his hands behind him, tied, and they fastened this rope tight to his hands and they kicked the stool out from under him.</span> <span id="s241">He says, “There I hung,,” he says, “and boy, it was pretty painful.”</span> <span id="s242">I don’t know how long it was, but they finally cut him down.</span> <span id="s243">But I guess you even become accustomed to that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s244">When we finally went back to our quarters in Linz where we were, we all had quite an odor from this thing, and we bathed, and we bathed, and finally we burned our clothes, disposed of them completely, and we still had the odor.</span> <span id="s245">It was in our hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You can’t describe the odor?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, have you ever smelled a Turkish cigarette?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Not for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well, I say it because we were in that office there, and they had some cigarettes and this one fellow was smoking and I used to just love the odor from it, from a Turkish cigarette, and I can’t smoke one now.</span> <span id="s250">I really enjoyed smoking one, but somehow I connected the odor of a Turkish cigarette to that camp.</span> <span id="s251">Not that it probably smells like the camp, but is I should get a whiff of one of those things, I think right away about that lousy camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: The smell of things rotting.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s254">Dirty feet.</span> <span id="s255">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: The prisoners must have been awfully happy to see you.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Sure!</span> <span id="s258">You bet!</span> <span id="s259">These people, like the ones that you saw standing there and the fellow we talked to.</span> <span id="s260">The Red Cross came in pretty fast afterwards, and they had to be very careful feeding ‘em, because all they could them would be just a little bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s261">Some of them over-ate and got violently sick, and I guess some of them died because of it.</span> <span id="s262">The food was a shock to their system.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">But those that could walk and could move around, they got to start with just a bowl of soup, and they were put into a kind of hospital, and rested up.</span> <span id="s264">I don’t know what all happened to them after that.</span> <span id="s265">But it was pathetic to see those people.</span> <span id="s266">This Jewish fellow, we asked him, “Well, what do you want to do?”</span> <span id="s267">And what he wanted to do, was, he wanted to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s268">I don’t remember what country he was from, if he was from Germany or Poland or where, but they shipped a lot of people around to these different camps from different countries that they had taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: How long did you stay in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: So you weren’t really aware of how many of the people were continuing to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No.</span> <span id="s273">We didn’t want to go back, either.</span> <span id="s274">One day was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And did you have any feeling for how many of these people were Jews and how many of them were not Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No.</span> <span id="s277">According to this thing here, there really weren’t so many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s278">Now maybe they were Polish Jews, maybe they were all Jewish, from Italy or from Poland or Russia or wherever.</span> <span id="s279">There’s a lot of Poles here, quite a few Poles, and there’s two Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: I think on the record Mauthausen had prisoners of war, too, and so you would get other nationalities.</span> <span id="s281">Can you think back and remember – I know you’ve seen it on the pictures – can you walk through the camp?</span> <span id="s282">Tell me how many buildings there were, and how big they were, and what they were for?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: That building there was the only one that appeared to be in good shape.</span> <span id="s284">Some of these are made of stone, and that’s what this camp did, they made these stones for bridge building, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: You say the “made” the stones.</span> <span id="s286">Did they have a quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: There was a quarry there, and all those stones there were made in that camp.</span> <span id="s288">This Russian fellow said that they made these people lift those stones up onto little saw-horses – you know what a saw-horse is, they were about so high – they lifted the stones up, and stood with hammers and chisel, and shaped ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Into nice rectangular building blocks.</span> <span id="s290">So then they built the wall, and they built the buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: They used these stones for bridge building, highway work, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did you go inside the buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s294">In one place, it was just the most gruesome thing.</span> <span id="s295">It looked like they’d taken bunk beds, about three bunk beds, three high, and pushed them all together so they actually were shelves, and it was dark in there and wet, maybe from human urine, and the people in there were crawling around, and they were snarling.</span> <span id="s296">Maybe that isn’t the right word, but they were insane, and they were in such misery, and crawling around like a bunch of animals.</span> <span id="s297">That was the worst thing we saw.</span> <span id="s298">It really was the worst, because these were people that were alive, and I would presume they were insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: They had been so mistreated.</span> <span id="s300">You said the Red Cross came in.</span> <span id="s301">The army medics, then, were not involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, I’m sure they were.</span> <span id="s303">I’m sure that they came in there, to take care of these people that were still alive, that they could save.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: When you look back on this, do you think about how people could do this?</span> <span id="s305">What do you make of all this when you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Well, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: When they had the program at the high school, you came in with Bill Borth, and said you had witnessed this.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s309">Were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: No.</span> <span id="s311">I heard about it.</span> <span id="s312">I wish I had been.</span> <span id="s313">But was this the first time you had talked about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: In the public area.</span> <span id="s315">You’re the second time.</span> <span id="s316">The local Golden Kiwanis – they’re the old, retired people, they meet once a week – one fellow asked me after he saw this thing if I’d talk to them, and I ran the slides and everything.</span> <span id="s317">Do you know Fred Baron?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: He gave a very interesting talk.</span> <span id="s320">He was in the camps.</span> <span id="s321">Another fellow – Rafowitz – he has a cap and hat manufacturing plant on First Avenue North [in Minneapolis] – he called on me.</span> <span id="s322">I was in business here, and he called on me one day.</span> <span id="s323">He sold caps, manufactured caps, an interesting guy.</span> <span id="s324">And he had the tattoo, the serial number, on his arm.</span> <span id="s325">And I saw this thing.</span> <span id="s326">We talked and talked.</span> <span id="s327">Quite broken, very, very Yiddish.</span> <span id="s328">“Sam,” I says, “What camp?”</span> <span id="s329">And he looks at me kind of funny (laughs).</span> <span id="s330">He’s a great little guy.</span> <span id="s331">And he come over here, he and his wife and another Jewish fellow and his wife, they manufactured caps in the old country and he started making caps.</span> <span id="s332">And he went up to Dayton’s and he made a bid on the caps and he got the bid from Dayton’s, hundreds of caps.</span> <span id="s333">We bought a lot of caps from him.</span> <span id="s334">So he got the bid, and he didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s335">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Oh, to get the materials to make the caps.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: So he goes to Northwestern National Bank across the street, that’s burned down now, and he says there was an old fellow there.</span> <span id="s338">Now this wasn’t this particular day that we talked about it.</span> <span id="s339">We talked quite frequently about it when he called on me, you see.</span> <span id="s340">But this is one of his experiences.</span> <span id="s341">He says, “I looked over these loan officers, and there was one old fellow sitting there, I’ll give him a try.”</span> <span id="s342">So he told him the story and he showed him the orders from Dayton’s, which was collateral, you see.</span> <span id="s343">And the old fellow, I think, gave him $8,000.</span> <span id="s344">And he bought the material.</span> <span id="s345">And Singer sewing machines, they would lend him the machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">“Well,” he said, “my wife, and” – I forget his name, the other fellow – “Hymie, and his wife, the four of us were in this little room,” he says, “that had one light, the bulb coming down, and the women would cook and we sewed night and day.</span> <span id="s347">And,” he says, “we made all the caps.</span> <span id="s348">And I loaded ‘em up in the car and took ‘em over to Dayton’s.”</span> <span id="s349">He put them on the passenger elevator, boxes of them, cartons of ‘em caps, put them on the passenger elevator, and took them up to the office where this fellow was, this buyer was, that he got the order from.</span> <span id="s350">Hauled them down, and put them in the hallway.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Alongside this – he’s laughing as he tells me about this – he says, “I went into the office, and well, I says, ‘Your caps are ready.”</span> <span id="s352">“Well, where are they?”</span> <span id="s353">“Right outside the door.”</span> <span id="s354">“No.</span> <span id="s355">you should have taken them to the warehouse.”</span> <span id="s356">And he laughed, but he said, “I didn’t know.”</span> <span id="s357">So then they laughed about it and then he got the check for it.</span> <span id="s358">Then he went right over to the bank and paid this old fellow, and he says the old guy kind of smiled.</span> <span id="s359">“Sam,” he says, “ you want to borrow some more money?”</span> <span id="s360">Sam says, “No.”</span> <span id="s361">“Well, why not?”</span> <span id="s362">“I got money.”</span> <span id="s363">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Oh, so he was in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Funny you haven’t met him, because he is very successful.</span> <span id="s366">He just went right up to the top.</span> <span id="s367">And this fellow Fred Baron, the same way.</span> <span id="s368">I asked him, what prompts this, he came over here stone broke, can’t even speak the language, you see, and our own people laying right here hollering and begging the government for help, and getting relief, and Jewish people come over, and can’t even talk the language, and in a couple of years they’re successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Well, I think it was the very strong, very resourceful, very lucky ones who survived.</span> <span id="s370">And those are the ones who came over.</span> <span id="s371">The ones who would not have been hard workers and brave and adventurous --- they were the ones who usually didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s372">But it’s something to think about, how these people could do this.</span> <span id="s373">Did you try to talk about it after the war to the people here?</span> <span id="s374">People in the Twin Cities, people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, I never.</span> <span id="s376">But I’ve showed the pictures to quite a lot of people, and they’re amazed; they can’t understand how anybody could do such a thing like this, you know, and you can’t understand it and neither can I.</span> <span id="s377">Why would this guy take off and try to experiment on a whole race?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: But it’s interesting, though, that forty years passed before people really started saying, “Tell me about it,” so now when they ask you, you think back.</span> <span id="s379">Do you have the feeling that you really remember all the details, or that maybe you’ve forgotten?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I’m sure I’ve forgotten a lot of it.</span> <span id="s381">I went back over two years ago; went over and celebrated D-Day.</span> <span id="s382">Four of us, we went over and had a great time.</span> <span id="s383">But I didn’t have a chance to get in to the places I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s384">I couldn’t get back to this place.</span> <span id="s385">But I have pretty fond memories of that, the big cemeteries and so on.</span> <span id="s386">But you kind of shrug it off, and hope it will never happen again.</span> <span id="s387">Bill Borth here has created quite a lot of interest.</span> <span id="s388">At this meeting they had here this winter, the place was completely jammed and people had to leave.</span> <span id="s389">There was not even standing room.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: That was the Holocaust memorial program that he had in October [in Willmar].</span> <span id="s391">Do you think it changed your life at all to have seen how terrible people could be to other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s393">Maybe unconsciously it changed it somewhat but I can’t pinpoint anything that changed my way of living or feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did you ever talk to your wife about this?</span> <span id="s395">Your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Oh, yeah, my kids all know about it.</span> <span id="s397">I have two boys, they were young when I got home.</span> <span id="s398">My wife won’t look at these pictures, because she says they’re too horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Where are your children now?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: One of ‘em is in town here, the older boy, and then the younger one, who’s forty-some years old now, he lives near Avon, MN, near St. John’s College.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Now you say that you lived in a suburb of Minneapolis, in St. Louis Park, until about 19…</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: ’54.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: So what brought you out to Willmar, MN?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Well, there was a new way of doing business, called the Fleet Farm stores, that sold farmers replacement parts.</span> <span id="s405">I called on some of these people, when I was on the road with these manufacturers, and I thought it looked like a good business, and so another fellow and I put down Polk county, which was Willmar, and a little bit around Willmar – a lot of farms here – and so we opened up a business here.</span> <span id="s406">We build a home in St. Louis Park in ’47 and I figured that’s where I’d live and die, and that it would be the end of the road.</span> <span id="s407">Well, eight years later, here we are, leaving town.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: And so you’ve been in Willmar ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
