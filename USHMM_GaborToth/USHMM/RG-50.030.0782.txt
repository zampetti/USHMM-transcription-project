Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. John Krawiec, on January 29th, 2015, in Evanston, Illinois. Thank you very, very much Mr. Krawiec for agreeing to speak with us today.
Answer: Pleasure.
Q: Before we get into all of the difficult times of the war years, I’m going to ask a number of questions about what your life was like in pre-wars years; and the idea is to get a sense of the world you were born into, the people that you knew, who you were close to; so that when the war comes we can understand how things changed, and what was lost. So my first question is the very basic: can you tell me the date of your birth?
A: June 15, 1919.
Q: And where were you born?
