id="s55">I was so already beaten before the war because the Russians sent my parents, and mine oldest brother with his wife to Siberia, and so it...it was a week before the war broke out, and I was very miserable because we heard that the trains were...were bombed and I was sure my parents are not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s56">And so I was beaten one after the other.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't...I didn't believe that my husband was killed and my brother was killed.</span> <span id="s58">Somebody told me that it's not time to tell the particulars, but I still hoped that they are alive.</span> <span id="s59">But I had to move to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s60">I was staying in the city a long time because I went to some people...uh...uh...my... with my husband, my late husband was...had connections with the Lithuanian because he build for the government, they build ...many buildings . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: I'm going to stop you because I need to

id="s66">We're fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What was it like for you as a young widow, alone, in the Slobodka ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: It was...it was terrible because I..</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">they...everything was taken from me.</span> <span id="s71">They...my...my apartment, my...my money, my jewelry, everything, and I..</span> <span id="s72">.</span> <span id="s73">and I was staying too long in town.</span> <span id="s74">Then I couldn't get a room in the ghetto because it was so few dwellings, and then it was terrible.</span> <span id="s75">I 'til I by chance, it is a long story, but I shall tell it.</span> <span id="s76">I got a little tea room.</span> <span id="s77">It was half a room.</span> <span id="s78">It was about 8 meters and then I..</span> <span id="s79">.</span> <span id="s80">I went around with a..</span> <span id="s81">.</span> <span id="s82">with all the belongings.</span> <span id="s83">I had to get a cart from the...the Lithuanians were not supposed to...to lend their carts for Jews.</span> <span id="s84">By law, by the German law.</span> <span id="s85">But anyway when you paid money you...you got it...we had to go 2 hours to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s86">It is...it was a short, not so far away, but the long route the...uh...the cart we went to the ghetto made it so slowly.</span> <span id="s87">And three times I went with the belongings to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s88">I didn't have a place to put the things so I put it where acquaintances relatives were, so I put it on the...on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s89">And then, uh, finally, I got in a..</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">got to this little home, and I moved in.</span> <span id="s92">This is also a very hard story, that uh could be told another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: We'll...we'll do another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s95">And then it was a..</span> <span id="s96">.</span> <span id="s97">there was the parents of my brother-in-law, my...my...my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s98">Yeah.</span> <span id="s99">Because...uh...her...and they helped me to get some food, some flour.</span> <span id="s100">She is...to get some flour and some foods, but it was frightening.</span> <span id="s101">In a short time it was gone.</span> <span id="s102">And you had...you couldn't have where to put...you didn't get other things.</span> <span id="s103">Till they organized and until they begin to give the food in the ghetto, it took some time, and then it was so ...so, uh, little.</span> <span id="s104">For instance, we got a 120 gram bread a day.</span> <span id="s105">And the...uh...there is...you...you couldn't die and you couldn't live on it you see.</span> <span id="s106">It was a starvation.</span> <span id="s107">It was such starvation, and we had to...how to...to get food.</span> <span id="s108">So the meaning to get food it was to sell your things, to change it for food.</span> <span id="s109">And the...there were brigades.</span> <span id="s110">We went out into the street...into the city to work.</span> <span id="s111">There were little brigades where you could if connections with the Lithuanians, change with them your...your...uh...belongings for food or for money and so you got some food.</span> <span id="s112">But you...you it was very hard work.</span> <span id="s113">You had to go...uh...by foot...about 10...I'm speaking kilometers, 10, 15 kilometers and then after a day's work, walk back, and with the parcel your... on your back.</span> <span id="s114">But when I..</span> <span id="s115">.</span> <span id="s116">I did it I was already lucky because I was...I had it already...I could breath in food in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s117">But it took...it passed a long time til I could go out.</span> <span id="s118">And then happened that my...the nanny of my daughter who stayed in the city tried to get connections with me and she used to come...uh...where the people worked and send some little parcels for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s120">I'm going to interrupt again.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And let's stop a bit.</span> <span id="s123">How did you...when did you met Avraham Tory?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: This I tell you.</span> <span id="s125">This is a connection of this.</span> <span id="s126">So but not...nobody...nobody gave it to me.</span> <span id="s127">Everybody...I don't know where the people got it, but they get it.</span> <span id="s128">So one day, I knew my husband, Avraham, a long time ago when we were...I was a girl of 15 or so, he came to our little town to make...he was a Macabi sportsman.</span> <span id="s129">And he used to make the little shtetl and in all the country, he used to come and make sports speech you know and teach.</span> <span id="s130">So to keep together the Macabi movement.</span> <span id="s131">And he came also in our shtetl, so I knew him the first time.</span> <span id="s132">And then I met him even he was my husband...my marriage in my wedding when I married.</span> <span id="s133">And I was also in his wedding when he married because my parents were someway connected to them.</span> <span id="s134">I don't remember how.</span> <span id="s135">But I was not aware of him at all that he's in the ghetto, and I had no connection with him.</span> <span id="s136">But then one day he came in and he tells me...and brings me a little parcel from the nanny.</span> <span id="s137">It was...was wonderful.</span> <span id="s138">There was bread and a little piece of butter and...uh... and salad or something, and he tells me that what told him that he was several times here and sent parcels and she never got any news from me.</span> <span id="s139">So this was the first time I knew him, I saw him again, but and he was very much pressed...or so pressed what he saw there, how I lived.</span> <span id="s140">It's already cool and it was...it was already.</span> <span id="s141">It was

took her in and when my...her brother also my cousin, came to...to us to eat because...but we couldn't eat together.</span> <span id="s145">One went out and the other one could come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s147">When did you start helping.</span> <span id="s148">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s149">I'm going to have to keep doing this I'm afraid.</span> <span

the...the building of the Council.</span> <span id="s163">So and he used to come...he was already interested in me.</span> <span id="s164">He told me you can get this.</span> <span id="s165">You can...like other persons on the Committee and... He was interested how I'm going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">Please.</span> <span id="s168">I really have to stop you.</span> <span id="s169">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s170">Please.</span> <span id="s171">Follow my lead.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s174">I want to ask you very specific questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And you give me very specific answers.</span> <span id="s177">Okay?</span> <span id="s178">Just because we're short and it's not right, but I have to do it this way.</span> <span id="s179">When did you...when did you start physically helping Avraham with the diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">Yeah.</span> <span id="s182">I tell it.</span> <span id="s183">It was in about 42, from my new apartment opposite him, the Council.</span> <span id="s184">I came one day out, and I saw him coming against me and I said hello and he...he was very, very grave so my...very much grave, and he told me, "Look, Pnina, I want to ask you something."</span> <span id="s185">"What's on your mind."</span> <span id="s186">"I write a diary and I can't keep it with me and I want you to...to...to keep...to hide it for me, to keep it in your place because I can't keep it in my place.</span> <span id="s187">And not in the Council.</span> <span id="s188">I was a..</span> <span id="s189">.</span> <span id="s190">to once I was very much astonished you know, but I thought he was so grave and he repeated I can't keep it in...at my place."</span> <span id="s191">So I said, "Hello.</span> <span id="s192">This... I was very interested to hear that he writes a a diary.</span> <span id="s193">So I said, "Of course, I shall do it."</span> <span id="s194">And then he had to say to me, "You know it is very

after several months, I begin to beg him to...to...to bring Avraham there.</span> <span id="s249">And this was a young boy there of 20 that wanted very much to study so I told him, "You...Look, he's a lawyer and he'll teach you everything," and this...it was the thing that brought him to speak to his mother to bring...to bring Avraham.</span> <span id="s250">And so it is long story of the escape,

story.</span> <span id="s263">I want your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">And so... Yes.</span> <span id="s266">So he...when he got the letter.</span> <span id="s267">Yeah.</span> <span id="s268">He got then the letter from Dr. Elkanan Elkes.</span> <span id="s269">He was so sure that you'll stay alive and you'll stay alive, and you'll bring the letter to my children.</span> <span id="s270">And with this letter he came ...he went out and with this letter he came, and he waited all the time this letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: But how did you get the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: When we out from...we are going with the Brichah, fled from...from Lithuanian, and so we took the letter with us together with all the documents we took out from the earth, the crates.</span> <span id="s273">And all the time my husband kept the letter with him in his...uh...

back to Hungary, back to...uh...Austria (coughing)...sorry...and then we came to...on the border of Austria and Italy and there we passed a border.</span> <span id="s322">We were of the Jewish Brigade, and this was a wonderful thing what happened to us.</span> <span id="s323">It was like coming to .</span> <span id="s324">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s325">We can never forget it.</span> <span id="s326">After all what happened to us...to us, this was the most wonderful thing what happened to us.</span> <span id="s327">And then...then in the north of Italy, I wrote to Joel Elkes, Dr. Elkes, so they sent me the letter.</span> <span id="s328">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Your letter then was mailed from Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: From Italy.</span>

other...the other documents.</span> <span id="s354">It was very also in the same place.</span> <span id="s355">We had to smuggle through the bundle of the documents.</span> <span id="s356">And it was a miracle we succeeded it.</span> <span id="s357">Just a miracle.</span> <span id="s358">When I think about it so (laughing).</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s360">Let's stop a

Alright.</span> <span id="s383">Let's...let's go back because you are on tape now.</span> <span id="s384">Uh...Let me rephrase the question.</span> <span id="s385">When Avraham came with Elkes's last letter, you read the letter.</span> <span id="s386">What was your reaction to the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: It was .</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">I was very emotional.</span> <span id="s390">It was very emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did you know Dr. Elkes?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s393">I knew him very well.</span> <span id="s394">I knew him as a doctor, and I knew him as a..</span> <span id="s395">.</span> <span id="s396">as a head of the...the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Could you tell us about what you know about Dr. Elkes?</span> <span id="s398">How you saw him as a person?</span> <span id="s399">Okay.</span> <span id="s400">And would you use his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s402">Dr. Elkes was...first of all, he was...he was an outstanding doctor.</span> <span id="s403">My parents were always his patients.</span> <span id="s404">Coming from the little town to.</span> <span id="s405">.</span> <span id="s406">to him, and he was now...and he was now a director of the of the hospital, the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s407">And then in the ghetto everybody honored him, and everybody admired him because he was above...above...above all you see, and...uh...uh...I heard always about him, great admiration from Avraham.</span> <span id="s408">So the...our...when I heard this stories from Avraham...Avraham told me, always he used to...to confer with him to reach before in this...what is written because he wanted to know if it is correct about I things he wasn't present about...on things that Avraham wasn't present because he heard...Dr. Elkes spoke with the Germans so or so, so he...when he wrote the diary he always brought it to him, read it before him, to know if it is everything correct.</span> <span id="s409">And so he used to tell me about these conferences and also about the Mrs. Elkes.</span> <span id="s410">She was also a wonderful woman, and this is what I know about him.</span> <span id="s411">It is...many, many of this is written in the book and I read it too.</span> <span id="s412">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Alright, one more question and then we're going to stop.</span> <span id="s414">Can you tell us again, when you were helping Avraham with the diary...uh...were there times when it was particularly dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Of course, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s416">It is always dangerous.</span> <span id="s417">We were always afraid.</span> <span id="s418">Uh...Uh...for instance, in the daytime so when a German used to come in the ghetto, Avraham used to send me messenger to tell Germans in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">So I..</span>
