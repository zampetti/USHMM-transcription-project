and we were rolling along, and then the people got hungry, and they got thirsty, and the children started crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s499">And then my -- my father was -- got very nervous and he grabbed one of the guards, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: There was a guard on the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Guard on -- on -- on the train.</span> <span id="s502">And

id="s504">They’re going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s505">So, because it was like bedlam over there, you know, you know there was no food, no -- no -- it was in -- the air wasn’t too much, there was little -- little -- like a little, you know, the -- no -- not much air coming into the trains, you know, those cattle cars.</span> <span id="s506">And we were there for about three -- three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: The car was moving the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Moving, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And could you see out, did you know where you

they were those guards, you know, those -- they call haftlinger, and they -- they were like Jews from Poland who worked in the camps.</span> <span id="s517">That was already in Birkenau, you know, with the striped clothing.</span> <span id="s518">And this I still remember, he says, “Tell them that you’re 18 years old.”</span> <span id="s519">You know, for -- for the children.</span> <span id="s520">Tell them you’re 18 years old.</span> <span id="s521">And we didn’t know what it meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: This guard told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: This guard.</span> <span id="s524">No, he wasn’t a guard, no he --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: He was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: -- he was a Jew that he emptied all the -- the luggage when they took us out from the train, you c -- you didn’t take anything with you.</span> <span id="s527">So you left -- you had to leave everything on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: And -- and where was it that the train stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: That was in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Birkenau.</span></p>

night time.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Just -- it was a night, was dark.</span> <span id="s538">We didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s539">And then they say raus, everybody raus.</span> <span id="s540">So we started to walk, and then they lined us up to there.</span> <span id="s541">Women and children one side -- women, children and old me -- old people on one side, and younger people on another side.</span> <span id="s542">So we came to the selection.</span> <span id="s543">The guy say, reckt, the guy say l -- left.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s551">Same thing with my brother.</span> <span id="s552">He was about three years younger, he said 18.</span> <span id="s553">So -- s -- am -- so my brother and I and my father went to the different line, and my mother with the children went on the different.</span> <span id="s554">Different selection.</span> <span id="s555">Then already, when we walked -- then these -- they walked us to different places, and then we knew already that we were -- we were in hell.</span> <span id="s556">Because there were fire burning, and I can smell -- you know, I smelled the smoke, and -- and I just -- I’m talking for myself, I was in -- in a daze.</span> <span id="s557">I didn’t know what was day or night or just i -- i -- i -- in a delirious condition, you know?</span> <span id="s558">See women and children walking.</span> <span id="s559">Those were sent right away to the -- to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: W-when that separation happened --</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s709">Q: And were -- were the guards mistreating people, were they cruel, were -- was there a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Well, the-the -- they had guards, yes, oh

gravel.</span> <span id="s713">You know, we used to build a -- we used to unload ga -- gravel, used to came in in the wagon, used to beat us up for just -- you just keep on going.</span> <span id="s714">I never -- I never was sick.</span> <span id="s715">On all the time, I was never sick.</span> <span id="s716">Because if you’re sick, that’s it, you’re finish.</span></p> <p><span

anything, they just took them off.</span> <span id="s719">You don’t know w-what happens to them, yeah.</span> <span id="s720">Everybody was for himself.</span> <span id="s721">I remember one day -- I used to work on the night shift, and I’ve seen some guys used to go down near the camp.</span> <span id="s722">They had potatoes, you know for the -- used to -- they have potatoes underground, you know, that it shouldn’t get rotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: In a cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s725">No, o-on the open fields.</span> <span id="s726">So they

their shirts.</span> <span id="s728">So one day I went with these guys, and I went underneath the ground, and th-th -- the ground caved in -- in on me.</span> <span id="s729">And I got so frightened, and I didn’t know how to get out there.</span> <span id="s730">I finally got out.</span> <span id="s731">And they caught couple of guys, and they got such a beating, I says, no, no more.</span> <span id="s732">I’d rather die than to -- to go through that.</span> <span id="s733">So I never -- never tried again.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: You said it was every man for himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Everybody’s for himself, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: There was no cooperation --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Oh, b --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: -- between the people, of any kind, to help each other, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well, they di -- they -- there was nothing, because you didn’t get -- you didn’t get enough food.</span> <span id="s740">You couldn’t help anybody because you couldn’t share with anybody any food, because if you get so little food -- we used to get -- you know how we used to divide our bread?</span> <span id="s741">We got those German breads, those square breads.</span> <span id="s742">So four of us, for four people divided, they get a bread for a day, you know?</span> <span id="s743">So we used to cut it in four, and we didn’t know how to -- who’s going to get -- maybe some guys are going to get a bigger piece, or some guys got a smaller piece.</span> <span id="s744">Used to cut up the bread, and put it under the blanket.</span> <span id="s745">So they say, “Mark, which one do you want?”</span> <span id="s746">I pointed on -- on the blanket, I says, “I want this one.”</span> <span id="s747">So

young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: You’re only 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So you have your -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Oh, we ha -- it was -- it was -- the only problem over there, we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s1694">Because -- said we had to change clothing, and all that.</span> <span id="s1695">Because y-y-you couldn’t make any money, only if you’re -- if you’re -- you know, a tradesman, a good tradesman, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: When you were -- when you were in Paris, a lot of the people that you were with were also refugees, but were people in general understanding of what had happened to you?</span> <span id="s1697">At this point did people know what had happened in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: We -- we were all in the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: No, but I mean Parisian’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Oh, Parisian’s.</span> <span id="s1701">Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, we -- oh -- oh yeah, oh yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Did you -- did -- did people knew that it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: -- because the French, they suffered too, you know, the French Jews.</span> <span id="s1704">They -- they suffered a lot too.</span> <span id="s1705">Oh yeah, France was in the -- they were in the same boat as we were.</span> <span id="s1706">You know, they were taken to the -- to the camps, they suffered a lot, a lot of them survived.</span> <span id="s1707">Same thing with the -- a lot of Europeans, Jews like the -- the Greeks, the -- the Hungarians, the French, even the Italians, they suffered a lot, too.</span> <span id="s1708">The only differences between them and us, that they could disguise themselves, you know, beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Who -- who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Like th-the French, you know, because they spoke French, these pu -- and the -- and you know, and they -- and they mingled in with -- with the -- with the people, you know?</span> <span id="s1711">They couldn’t tell who was a Jew, and who wasn’t a Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s1712">But with us it was very easy because we were very easily disguised, easily recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: How?</span> <span id="s1714">Explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Because -- because we all lived -- we all lived in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s1716">Like in Europe all the Jews, they gather together, the same over here like they live in whatever, Beverly Hills, or wherever lives the -- lot of them live, you know, together.</span> <span id="s1717">But the French -- an-and -- and the -- they’re weren’t that many French, you know, because they can get lost amongst millions of people.</span> <span id="s1718">But with us, like in a hometown like mine, you know, you couldn’t hide.</span> <span id="s1719">Even Budapest was very hard to hide yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1721">When you came to Paris and you started to have a little bit of a routine --</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: -- and a little bit of a life, did you go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Funny, no, no.</span> <span id="s1725">Didn’t go to synagogue, no.</span> <span id="s1726">Tha-that was an -- I was completely -- not that I deny that my -- my -- when I came to Canada, then I started, you know, getting back, you know.</span> <span id="s1727">But otherwise, didn’t want to believe anything, we didn’t have no interest.</span> <span id="s1728">No interest in religion at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: What about in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: In the camps, y -- well, over there, no, no.</span> <span id="s1731">The only thing we done is we fasted.</span> <span id="s1732">I-It was only one -- or it was only one day out of a year, and there was -- we were there only one year.</span> <span id="s1733">No, we didn’t have no -- no interest in religion because we lost it all.</span> <span id="s1734">I remember when we came in Auschwitz, you know, and they were undressing us, and all the people started to scream, where is God, where is God, you know?</span> <span id="s1735">You know, so we -- we sort -- a lot of people lost it.</span> <span id="s1736">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1737">How can you do this to us?</span> <span id="s1738">That’s how e -- we felt.</span> <span id="s1739">Yeah, I was -- it wasn’t -- it was -- when I came to France I was already no -- life was getting into normal.</span> <span id="s1740">But I wasn’t old enough then, you know?</span> <span id="s1741">I wasn’t old enough, only -- was only to go out there and have fun, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1742">But otherwise, never thought of religion, anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: You told me about -- you showed me a photograph which we will show later, of you and some cousins, and your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: -- in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: What was -- what happened there?</span> <span id="s1748">How did everybody happen to be in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Because we lived in the same -- same place, same hotel.</span> <span id="s1750">We all lived in the same hotel.</span> <span id="s1751">We all gathered.</span> <span id="s1752">I still remember, the reason we done it too, because we were -- we were parting.</span> <span id="s1753">You know, like one cousin went to Ecuador, and another one -- another person went to how do ca -- to Venezuela, Caracas.</span> <span id="s1754">We were -- we were leaving Paris.</span> <span id="s1755">We didn’t want to stay there, we just want to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1756">Wanted to start a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And it’s interesting to me that you were all going different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: No, it’s not we were going different places.</span> <span id="s1759">We were going wherever we could go, whatever was open for us.</span> <span id="s1760">But the main thing, we all wanted to come to America, but America was -- we couldn’t come to America.</span> <span id="s1761">I don’t know, maybe we weren’t smart enough, we didn’t know the right -- the right channels.</span> <span id="s1762">But I know one thing, I always wanted to come to America.</span> <span id="s1763">Even all these years I want to come to America, I couldn’t come.</span> <span id="s1764">So finally I said to my wife, I don’t know whether it was in 1965, says, “We’re going to go to America.”</span> <span id="s1765">I was lucky because I couldn’t come on my papers, I could go on -- on her papers, because she was English.</span> <span id="s1766">So I go on her quota.</span> <span id="s1767">My quota would never be able to come to America.</span> <span id="s1768">I tried a couple of times coming across the border, Niagara Falls.</span> <span id="s1769">Go back, you don’t have no papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: In your interview with Professor Boder, you told him that you had an uncle in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Did you ever -- but you didn’t know where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: I didn’t know where he was, but I finally found -- found out where he was, I got in touch with my aunt.</span> <span id="s1774">Remember I told you my aunt send me the 10 dollars?</span> <span id="s1775">She said what I have to do is just ask the Jewish Congress, so -- but I don’t know what city he is in, I don’t know -- I only know his name.</span> <span id="s1776">His name was Sam Moskovitz.</span> <span id="s1777">So the Jewish Congress found him for me, that he live -- he came out and -- in 1902.</span> <span id="s1778">So what your -- he was c-came out to America before my -- my father was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: So he was a lot older than your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: Oh yeah -- pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Older than your father, a lot older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yeah, my father was born in 1903.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yeah, he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: So he’s been here the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Yeah, he was here.</span> <span id="s1787">He was a nice guy, but he didn’t -- he didn’t know us.</span> <span id="s1788">The only person that knew us is my aunt from Cleveland, Aunt Lana.</span> <span id="s1789">And all the cousins, everybody jumped on Aunt Lana to send us money or do something for us, that she couldn’t take us all out.</span> <span id="s1790">She took a -- the other cousins, but I didn’t get a chance.</span> <span id="s1791">So I had to go to Canada, second best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Did you ever get to meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Who Lana?</span> <span id="s1794">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1795">Oh, after I came out to Toronto, I had a house.</span> <span id="s1796">She came to my house, we slept in my house.</span> <span id="s1797">We put the mattresses on the floor and we all slept there.</span> <span id="s1798">Toronto.</span> <span id="s1799">She -- she was one of -- she came out -- she remembers all of us.</span> <span id="s1800">I wasn’t born then, but she came and must have been in the -- after the -- I think after the second World War -- the first World War.</span> <span id="s1801">She must have come out here in 19 -- in the 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: And those other cousins that you were with in Paris, one went to Venezuela --</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1804">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: -- one -- what happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: But he wasn’t a cousin, he was a -- an acquaintance, you know, a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: But the one from ke -- Quito, he is a cousin of mine, yeah.</span> <span id="s1809">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Did you ever see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: No, no, I never see him.</span> <span id="s1812">Yeah, I missed him, I missed him.</span> <span id="s1813">He -- he invited me over for a Bar Mitzvah, to Ecuador, but I couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1814">So he passed -- he passed on, yeah.</span> <span id="s1815">Yeah, we were all spread out.</span> <span id="s1816">Oh yeah, but m-ma -- it was interesting story about my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: What -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: You know, I didn’t know I had a brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: -- till somebody came from my hometown, and told me, “Mark, you know, you have a brother at home.”</span> <span id="s1821">So I wrote a letter, and there he send me that picture, that picture, you know, with the Russian -- Russian soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: And -- and where was this that you found -- where were you when you found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: In Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: And where had he been when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: He -- he was in Russia all that time.</span> <span id="s1826">But that was 19 what -- ’46.</span> <span id="s1827">We were still new there, you know?</span> <span id="s1828">And found out that he is in -- that he was in my hometown, and he didn’t know about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: What had happened to him from -- from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Auschwit -- he got liberated.</span> <span id="s1831">He got liberated in a place called Glivitz.</span> <span id="s1832">That’s -- he got liberated in January.</span> <span id="s1833">And then the Russians took him to Russia.</span> <span id="s1834">He was a young boy, he was what, about 12 years at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: He had been with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Ma -- my father, yes.</span> <span id="s1837">And my father died, somebody -- they killed my father.</span> <span id="s1838">He told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: After the -- b-bef --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: You know, around -- must have been around January, around January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: On a march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: No, they didn’t march, because they didn’t march far enough.</span> <span id="s1843">He was in a place called Bunau.</span> <span id="s1844">And Bunau from Glivitz is -- excuse me -- it’s not that far.</span> <span id="s1845">So he got liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: My brother, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: And -- and when was your father killed?</span> <span id="s1849">A: My father must have been killed around -- in I would say January or February, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Around the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Same -- yeah, when -- when the -- they liquidated Auschwitz, cause the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s1852">And they emptied all the, you know -- and then he went to Glivitz, and then he -- they took him to Russia.</span> <span id="s1853">He was there all that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1855">And is it your assumption that your mother was killed right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Oh, my mother, the -- they all went to the -- they all went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1857">All -- all the -- the whole town.</span> <span id="s1858">Everybody, ex -- a-anybody who wasn’t able to work, put into a work camp, they -- they -- they eliminated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: First day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: First day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: The first day, yeah.</span> <span id="s1863">I -- I could see them coming, or -- stepping out from the train, coming, I can see it.</span> <span id="s1864">We were standing there outside and my -- my friend said from my hometown, “Hey Mark, look, there’s your mother, there’s your -- your sister,” blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1865">They we -- marching into the -- how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1866">They marching -- they -- they took them off from the train, and they took them right away.</span> <span id="s1867">Maybe I don’t know how long they were there, kept there, but they were all taken out the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: That was your mother, and which of your siblings, youngest ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Well, my -- one of them was Malka, Marilyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Two -- two of them, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Two of them, yeah, yeah, and that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Malka and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: -- Malka and Shemshin -- s -- it’s Sam,

mother.</span> <span id="s1878">Because she wasn’t old enough to -- she was -- went with the children.</span> <span id="s1879">And the -- the guys who are in Cleveland now, their mother was a young woman, beautiful, strong woman, Malka, but she -- she had small children.</span> <span id="s1880">So anybody with small children, even if they were able to work, as long as you want to go with your children, you want to -- they eliminate -- they take you to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1881">It’s a harsh thing to say, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1882">You can’t just say it so cold blooded, you know, but that’s -- that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1883">Anybody who -- young people, let’s see, young woman who -- who had a child.</span> <span id="s1884">19 - 20 year old girls who had children, they went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1885">You’ve seen fiddl -- you’ve seen Spielberg’s -- what’s the name that film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: “Schindler’s List.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Schindler -- you’ll see in that, young people, that’s what -- that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1888">Unless you -- you want to throw your baby away, and you could save yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: You had a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Have you, in the years since you came to Canada and the U.S., do you ever meet with people that you knew -- knew in the camps?</span> <span id="s1892">You ever run into anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: No, I never -- never run into anybody bi -- in the camps, because it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s1894">Was only about 500 people of -- and for us to sort of -- you know, for me to meet somebody who was in that same camp, there was no chance, because you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1896">And I have some random questions.</span> <span id="s1897">When -- were you ever sorry that you didn’t go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: I ever sorry?</span> <span id="s1899">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: You didn’t really want to go, I mean --</span></p> <p><span

-- it was -- it was sort of -- too many people were ahead of us, you know?</span> <span id="s1905">People who had money, who could pay their way to go there, could go.</span> <span id="s1906">But we -- we -- we couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1907">We could only go whatever, you know, was available for us to go.</span> <span id="s1908">No, I wasn’t -- it’s not that I was -- I wa -- all my friends -- and -- they were in Israel -- all of them -- most of them went to Israel, because it’s the -- how do you call it, the circumstances brings you to -- to go there.</span> <span id="s1909">Otherwise, I would have went there.</span> <span id="s1910">Like coming to Canada, or coming to United States.</span> <span id="s1911">It wasn’t a matter of that I didn’t want to go there, it’s just a matter of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: But you -- you’ve also said you had it in your mind always that you wanted to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Was that something that began when you got to France, or had that been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: No, I -- since I was a little boy, when I was at home, playing i-in the sand.</span> <span id="s1916">You know, people were talking about the America, you work only eight hours, and they have electricity, and they go to
