Jack Taylor, who was a member of the OSS, he told me what Mauthausen was.</span> <span id="s11">Then I told Gen. Dager what it was, and I went to get some lunch.</span> <span id="s12">And the telephone rang.</span> <span id="s13">It was Gen. Dager wanted to talk me.</span> <span id="s14">And he said: Dick, he said, I want you to return to Mauthausen and take supreme command of the camp.</span> <span id="s15">He said: You got a lousy job to do and he said, you cannot accept any orders from anybody, and he said, I have enough confidence in you to know that you will do what is right,and therefore you will take command and stay there and run it.</span> <span id="s16">And that's how it all about and that's how I wound up in Mauthausen with the capture and the occupation of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Sandy: OK, now go back to when you first came in before you reported that---how people reacted to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

never seen anything like this before in my life.</span> <span id="s22">I knew nothing of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s23">We had heard of them, but that was the extent of it, and to see all of these bodies piled up and these starving sick people in the camp, I just couldn't imagine it.</span> <span id="s24">We we didn't know what, actually and truly, we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s25">And then, as I said, I returned, but my initial shock when we found about 700 bodies lying around and just piled up like wood, if you will.</span> <span id="s26">I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s27">The -man's inhumanity to man actually existed between men and women and the starving, sick, dead people in that camp--unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">I, I, I stop and think about and I I don't know how I ever managed to stay through it.</span> <span id="s29">It was, in my opinion, it was</span></p> <p><span id="s30">that awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Sandy: When you first came back, what did the people in the camp do to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: They, they were so happy that we were there.</span> <span id="s33">Of course, we felt that we had done a tremendous thing by capturing the place and turning it to the Americans to solve a problem, if you will.</span> <span id="s34">But it it, I can't describe to you exactly--we were there and it was the second day.</span> <span id="s35">One of my people came into the headquarters and said: You better come quick into the main compound.</span> <span id="s36">He said: there's trouble.</span> <span id="s37">So I went out, and there are four people on the pavement with their throats cut.</span> <span id="s38">Which I had never seen before in my life.</span> <span id="s39">And the political unrest in the camp, I couldn't believe it because we were shocked actually and truly, that those people would be fighting among themselves, and I think it Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL Page 3 was primarily in control of the camp.</span> <span id="s41">I just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s42">Because, ah, here they are liberated people, and fighting among themselves.</span> <span id="s43">I don't know what they were fighting about, of course, it's it's a political, let's put it that way, and so, then from that time on, we become very strict.</span> <span id="s44">And we, we segregated camp, 18,000 people.</span> <span id="s45">We segregated the camp by nationality, and got all of the various nations nations living together rather than....</span> <span id="s46">The Poles hated the Russians, and so they were locked up separately.</span> <span id="s47">And the other nations, like the Yugoslavians ah anybody who was who was there, I learned this from from the ah ah Yugoslavians.</span> <span id="s48">People who were the followers of King ?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">, King Peter and Mahailowisz, they were not accepted by the people who followed Tito.</span> <span id="s50">And therefore, there was great unrest among those people.</span> <span id="s51">And it was all political, and we were, we were really shocked.</span> <span id="s52">We thought, we here we are, the great white father has liberated these people from a concentration camp and here they are fighting among themselves.</span> <span id="s53">So we took some very severe action and put a stop to it--real quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Sandy: What about the initial reaction of the people when you first came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: Mixed emotions, really and truly.</span> <span id="s56">Some people, I know, would come up they want to touch me.</span> <span id="s57">Other people ah, were not particularly concerned.</span> <span id="s58">But after we were there a little while that all changed.</span> <span id="s59">And they they recognized us as their saviors, if you will.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Sandy: What about--wasn't there one prisoner who had taken over an office.</span> <span id="s61">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Wentworth

came back.</span> <span id="s67">When we came back to occupy the camp and take it over, we went into the headquarters and first of all I must tell you, I speak only English and not too good at that, and here are all these different nationalities, and for me to correspond with them, no way.</span> <span id="s68">So there was a prisoner there, and he still lives in London.</span> <span id="s69">His name is Premislav Dobios, and correspond him, and it fat, I'll be seeing him in Austria in May.</span> <span id="s70">He volunteered to be my interpreter, He spoke 6 languages.</span> <span id="s71">And so, he was with me, and this fellow who was sitting behind the desk, and, I don't know, 3-4 other people behind him.</span> <span id="s72">I said by an interpreter, I said: What's he doing there?</span> <span id="s73">And he asked me.</span> <span id="s74">WEll, he was a Russian major who was prisoner in the camp, and they had taken over command of the camp.</span> <span id="s75">I said: Is that so?</span> <span id="s76">I said will you please inform him that this is in the American zone, and we are responsible for it and therefore we are in command of the camp.</span> <span id="s77">He wouldn't budge, he wouldn't move.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">I said: Please tell him again that we are responsible for this camp and that I am personally in command.</span> <span id="s79">He wouldn't move.</span> <span id="s80">So, I reached down and pulled out my 45 pistol and I cocked it and I shoved it right across the desk in his face.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">I said: Now you tell that s.o.b. to get out of here or I'm going to shoot him.</span> <span id="s82">Boy, they took off just like that and that was one of the highlights of our occupation.</span> <span id="s83">But they wouldn't budge, they wouldn't move at all until I used some force and that they understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Roll 2 Sandy: Tell me how bitter the

bring their perpetrators to justice.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: Well, that was one thing that we had to all of the people down because under the stress and strain that they had been and all of a sudden they are free people,and it was very difficult for them to accept that fact.</span> <span id="s87">And they had certain rivalries, I'll say, in the camp, and we had to stop that because so many people would be hurt.</span> <span id="s88">And ah, the the feelings, we we were so surprised that they thought, we thought, that they would just bow down and scrape, you know, because here we had saved their lives and such.</span> <span id="s89">And so, we were trying to be good guys.</span> <span id="s90">if you will, and then we had to stop being good guys and be quite severe, if that's the proper word, to get them to understand that it was still a concentration camp and we were going to run it to the very best of our ability and take care of them and we expected cooperation from all of the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s91">And That's that that was our feeling and how we got them in line to be</span></p> <p><span id="s92">normal beings again.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Sandy: Tell me about how the Jews requested not be put with</span></p> <p><span id="s94">their countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: All right.</span> <span id="s96">Ah, of course, I came from a very small town in Ohio.</span> <span id="s97">Population at that time was somewhere in the neighborhood of 9000 people, and we had two Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">They weren't Jewish , as far as were concerned, they were members of the community and didn't recognize them as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">So my education in that respect was nil.</span> <span id="s100">One day, one of the boys came in and said: There is a prisoner out here who wants to see you.</span> <span id="s101">And I said: All right, bring him in.</span> <span id="s102">And Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL Page 6 he came in and I said: What do you want?</span> <span id="s104">And he said: I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s105">And he said: I want to know why all the Jews in the camp are not together.</span> <span id="s106">I said: That a good question.</span> <span id="s107">I said: What's your nationality?</span> <span id="s108">He said: I'm a Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">He spoke excellent English.</span> <span id="s110">I said of all the hell you people have been through before, being, ah, wearing the Star of David on your on your clothing and being treated as Jews and to severe punishment and severe actions, ah, that doesn't happen anymore.</span> <span id="s111">I said: You may be a Jew, but to me you are a Hungarian.</span> <span id="s112">I said: Judaism is your religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">He said: Yes.</span> <span id="s114">He said: I know, but I think all the Jews should be together.</span> <span id="s115">I said: Not according to my book.</span> <span id="s116">I said: You are a Hungarian, therefore, you will live with the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s117">And so finally, he accepted it.</span> <span id="s118">And this is kind of odd.</span> <span id="s119">When he got ready to leave, he thanked me, and he said: Sir.</span> <span id="s120">He said: Could you give me a couple of Hershey bars.</span> <span id="s121">And from that time on, the Jewish zionist organization from Switzerland, the chief of the zionist organization plus other members of the organization came to Mauthausen and really put the stem on me to put the Jews all together.</span> <span id="s122">And I wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s123">I said: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">I sid: I do not recognize these as Jews.</span> <span id="s125">I said: I recognize them as a nationality, and that's the way it is gonna be, and nobody is gonna change.</span> <span id="s126">And so they accepted it, but not willingly, I'll put it that way.</span> <span id="s127">So from that time on, we didn't have any problem, but I would not put Jews together because they had been living under horrible conditions isolated as Jews, and I wasn't gonna stand for that, cause I didn't believe in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Sandy: When you tried to bring order in that first month or so that you were there, what were your primary goals and</span></p> <p><span id="s129">problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL Page 7</span></p> <p><span id="s132">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: Well, I would say, that the big problem we had was the sickness that we had among the prisoners, primarily typhus and Tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s133">I had doctors with me who kept me very well posted and we deloused every prisoner in the camp with DDT powder, and those people, and we called in two clearing hospitals, big hospitals, army hospitals, and anybody who was ill they were confined to a hospital.</span> <span id="s134">And so we hospitalized while we were there, we hospitalized 1000s of people and got them back on their feet and got and with proper medical treatment and such, got them to where they were normal beings again.</span> <span id="s135">We had abut 1300 people die while we were there because they were beyond help.</span> <span id="s136">And we were giving them the very best medical attention that we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Everybody was in the huge clearing hospital tents, and they were all on cots.</span> <span id="s138">So that we tried to give them the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Then the other thing that was so important was food.</span> <span id="s140">And upon the advice of my doctor friends, told me what I could and couldn't do.</span> <span id="s141">so we started out giving them the same type of food they had been receiving, very watered potato soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">I mean it was just colored water, that's all.</span> <span id="s143">And so we did that for, I don't know, for or three days, and then we thinned it up a bit and made it a little thicker and then we had found a warehouse in Linz, Austria of dehydrated vegetables.</span> <span id="s144">And so we brought those in, so then we started adding some vegetables to the potato soup and that was lovely.</span> <span id="s145">They all liked it very much.</span> <span id="s146">And as it progressed, they went on solid food--boiled potatoes and vegetables, these dehydrated vegetable, but not in soup.</span> <span id="s147">And meat, horse meat.</span> <span id="s148">See, in the German army, a mechanized division has got umpteen horses and so in in the combat action, you're driving all these horses ahead plus the ones that Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL Page 8 were there in Austria on the farms.</span> <span id="s150">So we butchered horses and we fed them meat, potatoes and vegetables.</span> <span id="s151">And coffee,of course.</span> <span id="s152">And bread.</span> <span id="s153">Now bread, that was something that presented a bit of a problem.</span> <span id="s154">We found a bakery and we got some people who were prisoners in the camp to do the baking.</span> <span id="s155">We didn't have any yeast, all we had was oats, and mixed oats mixed with water turned into bread--I think maybe I'm responsible for for the oatbread in the United States today.</span> <span id="s156">But, ah, we baked thousands and thousands of loaves and we had to put because when they are first baked and they come out, they are just nothing but squishy water.</span> <span id="s157">if you will.</span> <span id="s158">So we put them in the warehouse to dry out.</span> <span id="s159">And after they got dry enough that we could slice, every prisoner got one slice of bread.</span> <span id="s160">and then after a little while, they got two slices.</span> <span id="s161">And brad, eh, eh, prior to our occupation, bread was the most the precious article of food that they had in the camp or ever had or ever will.</span> <span id="s162">And so then it got to where we could give them a quarter loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Ah, and our stock of bread kept building and building, so finally, I said: OK.</span> <span id="s164">Give everybody half a loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">One day one of the prisoners came in and said: Colonel, We don't want anymore bread.</span> <span id="s166">We've got enough.</span> <span id="s167">[laughs] Which was quite rare because bread, I say, you could get your head bashed in or your throat cut for a half a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">And they used to store in in their bunks and sleep on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">If they hadn't eaten it.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Roll 3 Sandy: Did you bring in German civilians to help you with the running of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">COL

id="s173">We didn't bring any civilians in, but we did bring in about 400 German Wehrmacht soldiers.</span> <span id="s174">We had, see, the SS, when they left, they disrupted everything.</span> <span id="s175">And they were gonna burn the place down, but the prisoners said: Please don't.</span> <span id="s176">And they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s177">But they had disrupted all of the water supplies, the sewage, the electricity, everything, there wasn't anything in the camp.</span> <span id="s178">And so we found out that there was a prisoner of war camp where they had a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special things.</span> <span id="s179">And so we got 400 German POW and brought them in to do all of the things that were necessary, which helped us tremendously.</span> <span id="s180">And they were they were conducted as soldiers and they were not treated as prisoners, and we got along very well.</span> <span id="s181">And they brought life back into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Sandy: How do you think they felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">COL RICHARD SEIBEL: Well, I remember the captain who was in put in command of this detachment.</span> <span id="s184">His name was von Bruhl and he was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s185">Ah, he couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s186">They they were combat soldiers and they they they really and truly didn't believe that their own people and other people were being treated like that.</span> <span id="s187">It was an experience for them the same</span></p> <p><span id="s188">as
