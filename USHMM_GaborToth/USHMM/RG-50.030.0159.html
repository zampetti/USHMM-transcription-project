<span id="s355">One problem I can...I want to tell.</span> <span id="s356">A lot of people ask questions.</span> <span id="s357">Nu, why people come again to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s358">The time is what...it was so bad if you jumped for example from the truck or you jumped or you run away from the Germans, the time it was...the Ukraine police and a lot of people anti-Semitism was they catch you and they kill you by their self or they take you to the Germans.</span> <span id="s359">The Germans for each...for each Jewish people, the German was giving a pack cigarette or.</span> <span id="s360">.</span> <span id="s361">or a piece bread or a..</span> <span id="s362">.</span> <span id="s363">or a 100 gram sugar, so that what...the problem it was that the people what they left from the pogrom, what they run away some...it was lucky people.</span> <span id="s364">Nu, it was.</span> <span id="s365">And what happened?</span> <span id="s366">In a couple of days, people come back.</span> <span id="s367">It's come woman, men, some children...what they can walk, they can run.</span> <span id="s368">Nu, it was come...no, it's beginning they did...all the people, they come back.</span> <span id="s369">Oh, three hundred maybe people, they come around for...for...and we stay in this...the Germans what they was doing in this time, they said, "Who left in life, come back.</span> <span id="s370">We will not touch you.</span> <span id="s371">You will work, and that's it.”</span> <span id="s372">You know, it was a lie, what you cannot...you cannot believe in that.</span> <span id="s373">No?</span> <span id="s374">In that situation like that, you cannot stay not in forest.</span> <span id="s375">You cannot stay not in village.</span> <span id="s376">You cannot stay in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s377">You must to come again because you want to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Everybody was thinking, "Ah, ...maybe here...maybe we'll leave or we'll not leave.”</span> <span id="s379">Nu, the answer...they came.</span> <span id="s380">Maybe it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s381">In this time what they want to say you want to move, and this time it was no partisans.</span> <span id="s382">Nobody in the forest what can help the people, the Jewish people, but we stay...what we came in the forest.</span> <span id="s383">We stay...maybe it was one months more, and its begin the second pogrom.</span> <span id="s384">Second come...the second pogrom happened when...uh...I want to say you how I find out what it will be something.</span> <span id="s385">In this time when it was the war...uh...with Poland, some people, Polish people, come...uh...run away from Poland and come to the...uh...Russian...to stay Russian because the German comes to take Poland, he kill, begin to kill in Poland people.</span> <span id="s386">Some people was smart people, and they run away.</span> <span id="s387">They don't want to be...uh.</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">by the Germans, and they came to Russia.</span> <span id="s390">I met with a couple of people.</span> <span id="s391">It was two brothers in a city...it was [Julebiersk (ph)], and that was...the Germans saved them, and the same time they take us to work, they save what is the two brothers because they was making gold stuff for them.</span> <span id="s392">You know, how it come the stuff?</span> <span id="s393">I will tell you this stuff how come to the Germans.</span> <span id="s394">The SS comes...it was...uh...in ghetto.</span> <span id="s395">It was called in this time a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s396">They come and they said, "We need 5 pounds," for example, 5 pounds.</span> <span id="s397">I don't know how much...5 pounds, 3 pounds.</span> <span id="s398">"We need gold.</span> <span id="s399">If you will not give the gold, tomorrow you will be shot.</span> <span id="s400">All of the Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s401">From the Judenrat, the people comes to the people in the city, of that's how I begin to explain how from where its come the gold.</span> <span id="s402">And take...you have a spoon of gold or you have a batch of gold, you begin to give that.</span> <span id="s403">And that's...what that's the SS, they got the gold and they make every...any stuff.</span> <span id="s404">Before its comes the second pogrom, one night they came, the SS, came to the two brothers and they said, "Give all the stuff.”</span> <span id="s405">This was the stuff...it was not finished.</span> <span id="s406">And they said, "We don't want to wait.</span> <span id="s407">Give everything.”</span> <span id="s408">Then I meet in [Ilnick (ph)] and they take...he tell me, the brother, too, "You know what.</span> <span id="s409">It will be something happen because if they take all the stuff, the gold.</span> <span id="s410">It must be something, they think something to do for, to us.”</span> <span id="s411">And this time I saved my father.</span> <span id="s412">"You know what?</span> <span id="s413">We will not go in the place where we stay at nighttime to sleep.</span> <span id="s414">We'll go in the farm.”</span> <span id="s415">And we said to some people, to other people who believed...who didn't believe.</span> <span id="s416">Some believed and they came, and some friends and it was, nu, where they keep the cow, they keep the horses...they keep everything.</span> <span id="s417">And we stayed the night in this place in the farm.</span> <span id="s418">In morning, nu,...it's come the sun...come up and bring here it's quiet.</span> <span id="s419">We don't hear nothing, what from German ... the policeman.</span> <span id="s420">We was thinking...I was thinking in the...with my father together and I tell my father, "You know what?</span> <span id="s421">I think it...it's quiet.</span> <span id="s422">We don't hear nothing.”</span> <span id="s423">We come out from the...you know, it was hay.</span> <span id="s424">We come out, I and the father, and they stay...the policemen and Germans.</span> <span id="s425">Nu, excuse me, for the ["Verfluchtene Juden, Raus!"]</span> <span id="s426">.</span> <span id="s427">That mean, "Come out.”</span> <span id="s428">Now they take us and they begin to look around.</span> <span id="s429">They find more people, and they begin to beat us.</span> <span id="s430">My father... uh ...was speaking very well...uh...German, I told you before.</span> <span id="s431">He begin to talk to him.</span> <span id="s432">He don't want to talk, and again the same words...bad words, good words and hit him and hit me and hit other people.</span> <span id="s433">And they take us all...how many people they find.</span> <span id="s434">They find maybe in the farm, it was, nu, maybe 30, 40 people, and they take us in the ghetto, back in the same place where it was before, and they take us in...in the houses.</span> <span id="s435">We come to the houses.</span> <span id="s436">Houses stay a lot of police, Ukraine police and a lot of SS.</span> <span id="s437">People from the...all, they take and this time the second pogrom...maybe it was 500, 600 people they came back.</span> <span id="s438">When they take us... when they brought us in this house, they put us and we stay...and we stay until maybe it was in morning very early, and
