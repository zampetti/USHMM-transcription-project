don't you tell me how you came to [Dachau] ALAN ZIMM: I came to [Durovan-Bullchiwan] in January of 1945 which was a very, very cold day.</span> <span id="s5">And snow was laying on the ground much deeper than here.</span> <span id="s6">And, eh, we arrived at Atr - and we were actually on the train for almost 6 hours, from [Bulchwa] to [Dura].</span> <span id="s7">And we arrived it was very early in the morning, ah 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s8">It was dark, still, and we had to get out of the train you know, and the Germans with the dogs, and with the bayonets.</span> <span id="s9">[Rauss, Rauss, Rauss].</span> <span id="s10">And we lined up in groups from the whole train and we marched into the camp.</span> <span id="s11">[Muracha] didn't know what was there.</span> <span id="s12">And there was in the mountains earlier a whole barracks, were up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s13">We had to walk up and to divide a thousand groups to each block one group.</span> <span id="s14">I was assigned to a certain block.</span> <span id="s15">We had to walk up steps, wooden steps, into the mountains and there was the barracks.</span> <span id="s16">We checked into the barracks and they told us," You're going to sleep just a couple hours and next you're going to be awakened and you're goin' get some breakfast.</span> <span id="s17">The breakfast was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Just a little bit of waterish soup with turnips, and they gave you a chunk of bread- black, it was black like black coffee.</span> <span id="s19">It was so soft you could just throw it in the wall, it would stick.</span> <span id="s20">So that was the breakfast, the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">And they marched you out, out of the barracks and we came into a big place in the center of the camp called a Appelplatz.</span> <span id="s22">We lined up in groups and the head of the [Cest}, the Gestapo, came around with two officers and they checked every - asked everybody what kind of - what's what coming [brupastu].</span> <span id="s23">What kind of profession or trade do you have.</span> <span id="s24">So I'll told them I was a

id="s27">2/10/95 Int.</span> <span id="s28">ALAN ZIMM Page 2 me to the factory, and when we were there the two days, until we got assigned to the factory, we didn't actually know where the factory was.</span> <span id="s29">We were just a block away from it.</span> <span id="s30">It was so camouflaged that you didn't know it was a factory there.</span> <span id="s31">And the entrance to the factory was covered with a net of artificial trees and bushes and you,uhum, we didn't know it was a factory.</span> <span id="s32">When we marched in we realized what it was.</span> <span id="s33">The factory was a huge underground factory, it was about two miles long, and they had 48 tunnels, and each tunnel a different section, a different part of the racket was built.</span> <span id="s34">I was assigned to one of the tunnels, to a group of two hundred, and I was assigned to work in that area.</span> <span id="s35">So I-I saw machines who I've never seen in my life, so the foreman and the engineer, a German civilian, and the foreman was also from a prison there.</span> <span id="s36">He said,"I'm goin' teach you how to operate this machine, what you have to do, and em, you're going to learn quickly."</span> <span id="s37">I said, 'Well, I'm looking at the machine there was something very unusual to me.</span> <span id="s38">So but uh it took me about six hours to get what I was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s39">So I was supposed to make a part to the racket.</span> <span id="s40">So hold it and still remember it like today --------- and dis to order to make that racket hard, you went through a certain operation, about 12 different operations with the machine.</span> <span id="s41">The German called it drapping what you put part on the machine you do certain operations with it and eh they told me you have to make it with on my shift.</span> <span id="s42">20 of these.</span> <span id="s43">That's normal.</span> <span id="s44">We should not make anything which is defective.</span> <span id="s45">If it's defective, one they allow it but if make more than one, or three or four, then we could be considered a sabotage.</span> <span id="s46">People would hang for that.</span> <span id="s47">And then but them to hang you is no problem as if it was 1-2-3 they hang you.</span> <span id="s48">So I learned how to make it and ah the German foreman, the German engineer, civilian, he was a Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s50">2/10/95 Int.</span> <span id="s51">ALAN ZIMM Page 3 telling me later on that he was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s52">But he wasn't in fact civilian, he lived outside the camp.</span> <span id="s53">And he said to me do your work and no worry everything will be ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Do your work right and I will treat you well.</span> <span id="s55">So ah the second I heard this I was increasing my norm and I was afraid if I make some wrong I'm ah they hang you.</span> <span id="s56">So I made instead of 20 I make 24, 25, and 26 and they foreman and they engineer was very happy with me, so what he did is during they give you bread additional bread in the factory so he signed me up to get a loaf a bread once a week.</span> <span id="s57">A whole loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s58">That was just like saving your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Because what we ate there was nothing couldn't even hardly walk.</span> <span id="s60">So I ate the eh eh gave me this bread and told me to hide it so nobody would see it.</span> <span id="s61">And we had to hide it for our, in front our prisoners who couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s62">I ate at night time on when I was going to sleep.</span> <span id="s63">And in the barracks.</span> <span id="s64">But he was so happy with me he was a nice man.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Sometimes he would come in the morning early from before when I came to the machine he would hide the sandwich in the machine for me, his own.</span> <span id="s66">From we brought from outside.</span> <span id="s67">And I was doing the worked in that factory actually for almost 4 months.</span> <span id="s68">And eh by the time I arrived we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s69">I never saw the daylight.</span> <span id="s70">Because we arrived into the factory in was night, dark when we left it was dark.</span> <span id="s71">And inside was dark, I mean it was light but no daylight.</span> <span id="s72">And eh eh the the Germans had the the prisoners stay eh eh eh that camp where we were with 25,000 prisoners.</span> <span id="s73">And among those prisoners were 10,000 Russian prisoners, war prisoners.</span> <span id="s74">In eh uniform soldiers were there also.</span> <span id="s75">And what happen is the one time it was in February I think, I was there almost 2 months.</span> <span id="s76">2 escaped escaped the camp 2, 2, people, we don't know who.</span> <span id="s77">So made us stay outside in winter when it was freezing cold, snow up to here.</span> <span id="s78">We stayed outside for Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s80">2/10/95 Int.</span> <span id="s81">ALAN ZIMM Page 4 almost 24 hours we didn't get into the barracks, we didn't go to work either.</span> <span id="s82">Because they were looking for those two escapees in every barracks they looked everywhere.</span> <span id="s83">Under the floors, everywhere and they haven't found them.</span> <span id="s84">So finally they made us go back to the barracks and we what they did took 10 prisoners from the group, Russians and hanged them in the camp.</span> <span id="s85">For the ones who escaped they took 10 of them and hanged them.</span> <span id="s86">And they had a band there, music from prisoners the band was playing while they hanged the people.</span> <span id="s87">And we then we start keep on going back to the factory working.</span> <span id="s88">I worked there and worked and one time it was March, at the beginning of March '45.</span> <span id="s89">Somebody in one of the tunnels in one of the sections somebody sabotaged a part of a machine, broke apart of the machine, without that part they could not produce the rackets.</span> <span id="s90">And they I heard the engineers talking between them selves in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Whoever did this, must have known, must be educated person to know what he is breaking, what he's doing.</span> <span id="s92">Without the that part they couldn't finish the racket.</span> <span id="s93">And what they did was they took the whole group from that section and hanged them.</span> <span id="s94">All of them.</span> <span id="s95">In the middle of the tunnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Put scaffolds all around.</span> <span id="s97">An an almost 200 hundred people where hanged in pairs.</span> <span id="s98">And we had to march the group they marched every group they let them hang there for about a whole shift and every group from every tunnel section had to go march thru so you hanged from the hanging prisoners would touch your head and made you look watch you that you look up and see what we do with people who do sabotage.</span> <span id="s99">That's gonna happen to you if you do the same thing.</span> <span id="s100">I was so scarred after that I couldn't sleep all night.</span> <span id="s101">I'm that really shook me so much that I say well we never going get out of here alive regardless what we do.</span> <span id="s102">We didn't believe anybody's gonna be alive for getting out from this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP

steps were dead corps laying 5 of them, people starving from starvation.</span> <span id="s107">Because we were the good ones actually, there were people going to the quarries from there working in the rocks, quarries, drilling more tunnels in the factory and enlarging the factory.</span> <span id="s108">Those people didn't survive, very few of them.</span> <span id="s109">Every day dead people coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Because there were bound to kill them the ------ kill them and all the prisoners had to bring the dead bodies and lay them down in front of the barracks where they belonged to and the following morning people clean em up and take them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s111">Permanently.</span> <span id="s112">Right there was a crematorium also.</span> <span id="s113">In that camp.</span> <span id="s114">It was working day and night that crematorium.</span> <span id="s115">So we we were was a terrible terrible time to was eh the the condition was just brutal in that camp.</span> <span id="s116">And an well I was we continue working in the factory.</span> <span id="s117">Till the end of March the end of March we notice something unusual.</span> <span id="s118">The time to evacuate the whole camp, because end of March, was the end of March 29 I would remember correctly.</span> <span id="s119">American planes about 500 of them showed up at one time.</span> <span id="s120">And in not far from the factory was a small town called Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s121">And they came instead of bombing the factory actually, they I don't know if they realize there was a factory or not, but there was train tracks going into the factory from outside and leaving the tunnel also train tracks what the Germans did, they loaded the racket up on the trains on the trains coming into the tunnel and covered them with straw, boxes of straw with empty boxes to camouflage them and leave in the tunnel.</span> <span id="s122">And nobody knew what was on the train.</span> <span id="s123">Even the people leaving Mauthausen didn't know.</span> <span id="s124">And they were loading the rackets up to North to ship eh to use against

after after the bombing of Nauthausen, the Germans start to evacuate the factory.</span> <span id="s131">The first they evacuated the Russians, all of them by train.</span> <span id="s132">Constantly trains were moving in and taking out the prisoners.</span> <span id="s133">That was the beginning of April.</span> <span id="s134">April 1st and 2nd of '45.</span> <span id="s135">And ah what my foreman did he left me a stor?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">last group to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s137">So everybody evacuating and I was left with 2000 other prisoners.</span> <span id="s138">And what they did was they gave us a loaf bread and can of meat because we were the last group to leave.</span> <span id="s139">And my our um eh?</span> <span id="s140">which we were supposed to do there was cut all the cables from all the machines and burn all the blueprints.</span> <span id="s141">That what we were doing in the factory.</span> <span id="s142">And we did it took us one day to do all that and then they evacuated us, also on the train.</span> <span id="s143">While we were on the train we did know where we were going actually, we were going North.</span> <span id="s144">They told us one of the guards were going to Hamburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s145">And there they gonna put us on a ship and blow us up.</span> <span id="s146">So we were very much concerned what they gonna do to us and we didn't see anybody but what they evacuated before.</span> <span id="s147">So we kept on going from station to station but the American bombers came in and bombed the stations before we got there.</span> <span id="s148">So the train was headed back.</span> <span id="s149">A couple hours till they repaired the trucks so we could get thru.</span> <span id="s150">So finally we arrived to a station in Hanover, I remember Hanover in Germany the Americans came in and bombed completely the station.</span> <span id="s151">And the railroads everything was flames everywhere was burning.</span> <span id="s152">And we stayed with before we can get thru we stayed on the train.</span> <span id="s153">It took we stayed there 2 days and waited until they repaired the train.</span> <span id="s154">The station was still burning.</span> <span id="s155">They made the train go thru the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

train went thru.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Finally, after about 6 days on the train we arrived at a small station called Bergen.</span> <span id="s160">That was a junction a railroad crossing.</span> <span id="s161">And there trains coming from other directions too with prisoners but we eh other places.</span> <span id="s162">So I had overheard the Germans the guards talking between each other now we have a chance to go into Americaner?</span> <span id="s163">or to the English, Germans.</span> <span id="s164">We had to surrender to either to this one or that one.</span> <span id="s165">So I knew the end was coming.</span> <span id="s166">But there still was get it was guns like there machine guns around you all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">And no food.</span> <span id="s168">And everybody was from the group we we came from Bergen, half of the people were dead actually.</span> <span id="s169">If we if I wouldn't got the loaf of bread and the can of meat was hiding under my shirt I would never survive either.</span> <span id="s170">When we arrive there, before we arrived at that station, we stopped in an area with a farm like a farm.</span> <span id="s171">The train stopped for no reason, I don't know.</span> <span id="s172">This asked the guards wanted to have some water for themselves so they stopped the train, and eh eh I said to the guard who was sitting next to me, can I go with you get something I saw some prisoners over there in the field.</span> <span id="s173">Had some piles you know that could mean all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s174">So a French man in Belgium, war prisoners also grabbed by the SS.</span> <span id="s175">But they were not like us, they was a a was war prisoners they were treated differently like us.</span> <span id="s176">So we arrived there when in the the SS got took some watering and buckets and I said does this can I go over to the prisoners maybe get something to eat there.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Mushner!</span> <span id="s178">Mushner!</span> <span id="s179">So I ran over there to the Frenchman I couldn't talk French I say Mzham Mzham food.</span> <span id="s180">And they let me take potatoes and turnips what they had there whole potatoes I just put them in my shirt and put some turnips. . .mumbling. . .my friend was me we ran back to the

arrived at Bergen they made us get out of the train, and line up whoever was living still line up and we could holler I could still walk.</span> <span id="s186">But eh some people could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s187">So we hugged each other five in a row, and made us walk and there were a whole column of prisoners walking a a 100's and SS were all around us with machine guns, bayonets.</span> <span id="s188">So we walked and walked and we started to walk 9 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s189">When we arrived there.</span> <span id="s190">We arrived at the camp.</span> <span id="s191">It was a camp I don't know what camp it was--it was three o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s192">Turn right, you go in there, and the gate opens up, and we walked into this camp, Bergen BElsen.</span> <span id="s193">But here were two camps actually, one was half a mile further down, where the women were, women, and this camp wa a vacant camp what the army used, soldiers used this for themselves they had no space where to put us.</span> <span id="s194">They put us in this camp.</span> <span id="s195">We stayed in the camp--everybody, they assigned us to different barracks.</span> <span id="s196">We went in to lay down, there was nothing in, er, no tables, no nothing just straw on the ground and cement.</span> <span id="s197">We lay down, we were so exhausted we just lay down and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s198">we must have slept about a day an a half there.</span> <span id="s199">When we woke up-- was, probably if was about the twelfth of April of 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Suddenly we looked out of the window and they say, I was with a Polish young priest, Polish ex-soldiers in civilian clothes, we were together--Jewish prisoners were there very few--from the whole 35,000 prisoners there in Bergen Belsen, there must have been 200 of us left from all over.</span> <span id="s201">So I said what are you making out of this.</span> <span id="s202">He said, Oh, I looked, he looked and leaned his head out of the window.</span> <span id="s203">He said: the German army is here, the army, not the SS.</span>

you think they are going to do?</span> <span id="s209">He said: Maybe they are going to kill us all here.</span> <span id="s210">Nobody believed they're going to survive.</span> <span id="s211">Till the last minute, we didn't believe.</span> <span id="s212">Suddenly a grand battle erupted.</span> <span id="s213">Without, without any warning, the they shooting the German with heavy guns, machine guns are shooting, and and and we hear from far away distance artillery, shooting in our direction and explosions all around.</span> <span id="s214">The camp was in a wooded area, all woods, no human beings around there, and not far from the camp was a road, in the woods going between the woods, a road going somewhere, we don't know where.</span> <span id="s215">The battle took about 24 hours, a day and a night, and the following morning, early in the morning, the guns were silent, nothing moving, nothing, er er, eerie feeling--you don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s216">Laying down nobody there to lift his head.</span> <span id="s217">I said to the chaplain, the young priest: What do you think is happening?</span> <span id="s218">He said: I don't know.</span> <span id="s219">I said: Let's look out and see where they are, the Germans.</span> <span id="s220">So he picked out his head up to the window, the glass was gone, the windows were shattered, all was gone.</span> <span id="s221">He said: We don't see any soldier--all gone.</span> <span id="s222">What happened?</span> <span id="s223">He looks around, there's nobody here.</span> <span id="s224">So we looked out the little window.</span> <span id="s225">The SS is still there.</span> <span id="s226">But they had put on white arm bands on the arms and there still were the guns.</span> <span id="s227">And they came, guarded by Hungarian SS, all around.</span> <span id="s228">We can't get out from the blocks; we're sitting in there with no food.</span> <span id="s229">We stay already there almost four days without food.</span> <span id="s230">it was the 13th of April.</span> <span id="s231">After it was quiet.</span> <span id="s232">The sun was out, nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">We looked out the window and suddenly like an earthquake, everybody's running, all the prisoners are running to the middle of the camp.</span> <span id="s234">We didn't know what

do?</span> <span id="s240">He says: Let's run too, see what's going on.</span> <span id="s241">We jumped out of the barrack of this barrack--we run.</span> <span id="s242">They knew what was going on there.</span> <span id="s243">There were mounds of potatoes, mounds of turnips covered in the ground for the winter for the soldiers there.</span> <span id="s244">They prepare for the winter, and they were still in the ground, and with their hands, everybody grabbed with their hands uncovering the mounds.</span> <span id="s245">we uncovered potatoes and turnips, I said: Well, this is something.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">They didn't care who's shooting, or the German are there or nobody.</span> <span id="s247">So I grabbed some potatoes, we're eating while we're digging, we're eating already because we were so hungry.</span> <span id="s248">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s249">So I grabbed two turnips put under my shirt on my shirt, a couple of potatoes, and I said to my friend: Let's go back.</span> <span id="s250">I don't want to stay out here.</span> <span id="s251">We can get shot here.</span> <span id="s252">So we run back, we lay down and we're eating.</span> <span id="s253">We're waiting, it's quiet, nothing happened, SS is there, the Hungarians outside the fence with guns and they're wearing the white arm bands.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">So in the afternoon around the 14th, they said to us: You know what?</span> <span id="s255">the loudspeakers announced: Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, the Swiss Red Cross is going to come in and go take you over.</span> <span id="s256">We will nothing to do with you anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Tomorrow morning nine o'clock.</span> <span id="s258">Nobody believed it, because they were lying to the last minute all the time.</span> <span id="s259">So why would the Swiss Red Cross, why would they put white arm bands when the Swiss Red Cross is going to come tomorrow morning?</span> <span id="s260">While we were debating that--it was about 3-4 o'clock in the afternoon--the sun was out and the fourteenth of April.</span> <span id="s261">Suddenly we hear the tremendous roar, noise, roar, uh, heavy artillery or tanks are moving from somewhere.</span> <span id="s262">And it comes louder and louder, so one of the officers, a Polish officer was in civilian
