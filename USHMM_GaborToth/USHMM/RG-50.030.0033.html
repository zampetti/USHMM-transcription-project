Late Bomba.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Where were you born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in a little place.</span> <span id="s20">It was Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s21">Boyden-Oberslazen, but when I was a little kid...I don't even remember anything.</span> <span id="s22">My father he comes from a..</span> <span id="s23">.</span> <span id="s24">a city by the name of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s25">And they moved to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s26">I was brought up over there.</span> <span id="s27">I was raised over there, went to school, and I lived over there until the last days of the liquidation of the Jewish population in Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Tell me about your childhood in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s29">What was it like living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My childhood was not a rosy one.</span> <span id="s31">I come from poor parents.</span> <span id="s32">What do you mean, poor parents?</span> <span id="s33">In.</span> <span id="s34">.</span> <span id="s35">in Poland, I would say about 70 percent, maybe more than 70 percent of the population were poor.</span> <span id="s36">Poor, I mean poor.</span> <span id="s37">Actually, they had no food on the table.</span> <span id="s38">And to get a job was very, very hard, especially for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s39">Jewish people were not employed by the government, not by the legislature.</span> <span id="s40">Their trade was tailor, shoemaker, some of them a barber, hatmaker.</span> <span id="s41">Even in factory, in Jewish factory where the people they owned the factory, also Jews, they didn't want to employ Jewish people.</span> <span id="s42">Maybe there's some reason, maybe not.</span> <span id="s43">Some of them they didn't want to have the sin on their own conscious because he has to work on Saturday.</span> <span id="s44">So the best thing for them was not to employ them.</span> <span id="s45">So and actually, it was very, very hard...the upbringing.</span> <span id="s46">In my house, my father he married off my mother.</span> <span id="s47">He was married.</span> <span id="s48">His wife passed away.</span> <span id="s49">He had a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s50">I have never seen them.</span> <span id="s51">When my father married my mother, my brother left for Paris.</span> <span id="s52">After that when I was about 9 months old, my sister left, also for Paris.</span> <span id="s53">They lived over there, married, had children, and we remained in the city of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s54">Why I knew?</span> <span id="s55">Because after I got a little older, I wrote letters to them.</span> <span id="s56">I knew I have a brother and sister over there.</span> <span id="s57">Besides them, my mother had...had me count three brothers and two little girls.</span> <span id="s58">The two little girls passed away when they were...one of them was about a year old.</span> <span id="s59">Another one was about three years old.</span> <span id="s60">The main reason of it, there was no food.</span> <span id="s61">There was no milk in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">There was nothing in the house.</span> <span id="s63">Why I think that was the reason, I remember they'd be sick or other thing.</span> <span id="s64">My mother tried to help my father whatever she could, but there was no work.</span> <span id="s65">On one job, 50 people grabbed it.</span> <span id="s66">And that was going on until I, myself and my brother got a little bit older.</span> <span id="s67">My brother went to work.</span> <span id="s68">He started to work by a relative of ours, shoemaker, which he was a good one.</span> <span id="s69">Even by having a trade was a difference between a good and a bad one.</span> <span id="s70">So he was working, helping out.</span> <span id="s71">And then by the age of 12...when I was 12 years old I couldn't go to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s72">I got myself a job in a factory by making dolls.</span> <span id="s73">They had somebody over there, liked me, took me in when I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s74">I worked there for 2 and a half years old and then my mother decide and myself that's not a trade for a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Gotta have a real trade.</span> <span id="s76">What's the real trade?</span> <span id="s77">I had a cousin of mine, he had a barber shop.</span> <span id="s78">In my town, that's considered as a good trade.</span> <span id="s79">Was nice dressed, mixed with nice people, all kind of people they came in, and he took me in to learn.</span> <span id="s80">Learning time was 3 years for nothing.</span> <span id="s81">Alright, I got a few pennies like you call it here for tips, other things you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">And this I brought into the house.</span> <span id="s83">That was after those two kids passed away.</span> <span id="s84">And there was a little boy that time.</span> <span id="s85">It was about 3 years old.</span> <span id="s86">And that's how we got together.</span> <span id="s87">We provided for the house.</span> <span id="s88">My mother was...I would say not in a bad condition, because food, clothes, even had electric which for that time, it was a big thing.</span> <span id="s89">We had a radio in the house.</span> <span id="s90">You know, we didn't spend the money like the kids today, throwing it away, because every penny we maked we brought to the house, needed.</span> <span id="s91">And that's how we grew up until my brother got married.</span> <span id="s92">I myself tried to go to school.</span> <span id="s93">I went into a school after the hours of work and I finished it.</span> <span id="s94">It's one of the finest schools.</span> <span id="s95">And besides that I was very active in an organization.</span> <span id="s96">I was active in the Zionist organization...uh...called the ,The Right One, Ben-Gurion's party.</span> <span id="s97">I was in the youth group.</span> <span id="s98">I was the leader also with them.</span> <span id="s99">I remember I led a branch of girls, about 20 some girls....also not young ones, 18, 19 years old in which I was myself at that same age.</span> <span id="s100">Was the branch.</span> <span id="s101">You know about the .</span> <span id="s102">And beside that I was very much in love with books.</span> <span id="s103">Up to date, I cannot eat, I cannot go to sleep.</span> <span id="s104">I got to have a book.</span> <span id="s105">That's my thing.</span> <span id="s106">And real I learned by myself.</span> <span id="s107">I would say like self education.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Did you go to seder?</span> <span id="s109">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Did you to go seder like everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Oh, naturally, every...every child when to seder.</span> <span id="s112">Every one went to seder.</span> <span id="s113">I myself went to seder for the money because my mother had no money to pay so went into a seder which there was provided by the Jewish .</span> <span id="s114">You know what that means, the eldest of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s115">And we didn't pay for it, and I learned there.</span> <span id="s116">I was very good student.</span> <span id="s117">I was very good in the...in a bible and all kind of kings, in which I know up to now very well.</span> <span id="s118">And besides that, I was very interested in literature, all kinds.</span> <span id="s119">American, French, English.</span> <span id="s120">And I know about a lot of it.</span> <span id="s121">And so I'd say by the age of 18, start going around with a girl from my home town.</span> <span id="s122">We were...we were...we would say here in love.</span> <span id="s123">Not the same way people here in love.</span> <span id="s124">That time was a different style.</span> <span id="s125">It's already 50 years ago, don't forget.</span> <span id="s126">More than 50 years!</span> <span id="s127">So we were going around about 7 years.</span> <span id="s128">We couldn't afford to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Tell me about her.</span> <span id="s130">What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: She was a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s132">Blonde.</span> <span id="s133">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s134">In my eyes, you know, well especially when you're alone, every...everything is beautiful.</span> <span id="s135">But she was a nice girl, very nice girl.</span> <span id="s136">And we're going around and we started, you know, to save for the time when we get married to buy some stuff.</span> <span id="s137">We didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s138">It wasn't like...it wasn't like here.</span> <span id="s139">You want this and that.</span> <span id="s140">And we saved up until the time came in 1939.</span> <span id="s141">And that was the bitter time had come.</span> <span id="s142">Everything was separated.</span> <span id="s143">The German came into the town on a Friday morning, September, the 1st, the war started.</span> <span id="s144">Our town was almost on the border with the German, was 4, 5 kilometers which is about 3 miles from the border.</span> <span id="s145">In the morning, they were already in the city.</span> <span id="s146">So we lived...separated.</span> <span id="s147">My brother was living with his wife.</span> <span id="s148">He had a son about 4 years old, and I was living with my mother and my younger brother and my girlfriend was with her parents.</span> <span id="s149">Different place!</span> <span id="s150">To tell you the story how it was, you know, the first thing when the...when the German came in, it was not a ball.</span> <span id="s151">First thing, they came in on a Friday, I mentioned it.</span> <span id="s152">Friday, it was quiet.</span> <span id="s153">At the beginning of the war, everybody start running.</span> <span id="s154">We did to.</span> <span id="s155">We ran about 40 kilometers, walking.</span> <span id="s156">Me, my wife...not my wife, I mean my mother, my little brother, also my girlfriend was with me.</span> <span id="s157">And then we decided where will we camp?</span> <span id="s158">The Germans were there already.</span> <span id="s159">So we...where we going to hang around?</span> <span id="s160">Decided to go back.</span> <span id="s161">Went back...came back to the same apartment.</span> <span id="s162">Monday morning, like a magic thing happened.</span> <span id="s163">The Germans were all over the place.</span> <span id="s164">Everybody out of the house.</span> <span id="s165">And they start dragging the men, just the men, to public places, like school, synagogue, churches and open place on the market.</span> <span id="s166">We were a couple of days and but seeing that stuff, shooting, killing some people, a lot of people.</span> <span id="s167">Matter of fact a friend of mine which was together with me in Treblinka by the name of Rappaport, Moshe.</span> <span id="s168">His father was killed the first one.</span> <span id="s169">First from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s170">His name was Rappaport, Lazer Rappaport.</span> <span id="s171">.</span> <span id="s172">And a lot of them.</span> <span id="s173">We...we were over there about 3 days.</span> <span id="s174">They took away couple of thousand people and the rest of them they sent back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Can you describe what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: What...what was like?</span> <span id="s177">I'll tell you what...excuse me.</span> <span id="s178">I'll tell you what was like.</span> <span id="s179">You come into the house.</span> <span id="s180">Imagine yourself.</span> <span id="s181">You were in my shoes.</span> <span id="s182">Somebody comes in without anything, without any reason.</span> <span id="s183">Out from the house.</span> <span id="s184">Not allowed to take water, not allowed to take bread...bread, not allowed to take anything.</span> <span id="s185">And in the street.</span> <span id="s186">In the street with guns, they start running after you until...until you got to the place.</span> <span id="s187">I myself...they took me into a church.</span> <span id="s188">The church was the...the holy...the name was the Holy Family CHurch.</span> <span id="s189">We had a big church.</span> <span id="s190">We had a very big church.</span> <span id="s191">And we went over there in that church.</span> <span id="s192">They weren't...the people they couldn't get so fast in in the back of the church.</span> <span id="s193">They got killed in the front going in through the door.</span> <span id="s194">And they killed a lot of people that way.</span> <span id="s195">We were there.</span> <span id="s196">There was no food.</span> <span id="s197">There was no water.</span> <span id="s198">There was no places, you know, for the humanbeing with .</span></p> <p><span id="s199">We were over there, a priest.</span> <span id="s200">I'm gonna mention him.</span> <span id="s201">His name was .</span> <span id="s202">He was one of the finest gentlemen of the Catholic priest I have ever met.</span> <span id="s203">He said to us, "Children, never mind you're without any church.</span> <span id="s204">You do whatever you can.</span> <span id="s205">You...this place or that thing, as a..</span> <span id="s206">.</span> <span id="s207">you know, and the other place.</span> <span id="s208">He tried to bring in water for us.</span> <span id="s209">And really, I admired him as a gentlemen.</span> <span id="s210">He knew that we are Jews which was also some Christian people living in those neighbors, mostly they took his from the Jewish neighbor.</span> <span id="s211">Let's say...I would say...I don't know about Washington...Let's say when you this side, this that, that kind of a neighbor they took.</span> <span id="s212">We're there for 3 days, came out from over there, went back home.</span> <span id="s213">Thank God, everybody's fine.</span> <span id="s214">My brother was in a different place.</span> <span id="s215">He also came home.</span> <span id="s216">I was working in a barber shop about when I came to the age 17, 18, my boss passed away.</span> <span id="s217">His wife passed away, and the family...they decided to sell the shop to me because I was working there.</span> <span id="s218">I was working there for about 4 years.</span> <span id="s219">And was 20 years I bought that shop.</span> <span id="s220">Not the money that I had.</span> <span id="s221">I had no money, but there was another barber which he had a little bit of money.</span> <span id="s222">He came in with me as a partner, and we owned that shop from I would say 37, 38 until 1942 we were partners.</span> <span id="s223">A very wonderful man as a partner.</span> <span id="s224">Very wonderful man.</span> <span id="s225">And that's how we lived.</span> <span id="s226">Every one...every barber had a quota for taking care of the Jewish people...people they worked for the government.</span> <span id="s227">They worked for the Judenrat, so we had a quota about a week, 30, 35 people to shave them, to cut hair without money.</span> <span id="s228">We did it.</span> <span id="s229">So we were not obligated to go dig ditches or other thing for the German.</span> <span id="s230">And for us that was good thing.</span> <span id="s231">At least we were employed .</span> <span id="s232">And we had a card that we...uh...that we are not obligated.</span> <span id="s233">And that what was going on until May 41.</span> <span id="s234">May 41, they decided to make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s235">So that call in the language of our town, it calls the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s236">Why the big ghetto?</span> <span id="s237">Because was many streets included in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s238">Also the streets were more wealthy people lived, not just the neighborhood where the poor people lived, also where... And from that ghetto nobody could leave.</span> <span id="s239">Nobody could go in like Catholic people.</span> <span id="s240">Situation was going from bad to worst.</span> <span id="s241">It was impossible to get along.</span> <span id="s242">For instance, before 1939 a loaf of bread, in Poland was a loaf of bread 5 pounds.</span> <span id="s243">The price of it was 50 cents.</span> <span id="s244">During 1941, the price of it was already 15 slotas.</span> <span id="s245">In my trade where the price of getting a hair cut was 50 cents, getting a shave 25 cents, the price didn't go up.</span> <span id="s246">Instead to get from a customer one loaf of bread, we had to do more than 15 customers for the same thing.</span> <span id="s247">Well, naturally was the situation was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">But we lived and some kind of hope it's gonna end.</span> <span id="s249">One day it's gonna end.</span> <span id="s250">Everybody knows that, this...that.</span> <span id="s251">We're gonna pray.</span> <span id="s252">It's gonna end.</span> <span id="s253">It didn't end.</span> <span id="s254">That was going on from May 41 until September the 22nd, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Were you married during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s257">I got married in 1940.</span> <span id="s258">I got married 1940 because we couldn't go from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s259">Our dating...the time...we were almost 7 years together, so we decided to get married and to live together.</span> <span id="s260">We got married.</span> <span id="s261">Wasn't a marriage... marriage like they make it now, but we married off.</span> <span id="s262">Two years after that, my wife she got pregnant and we had a son.</span> <span id="s263">Was born September the 31st, 1942.</span> <span id="s264">That is almost 20 days...not 20...little bit...only 20 days...little over 20 days when it started the liquidation of the Jewish people in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s265">But between 41 May - September 42, they took out a lot of people.</span> <span id="s266">They send them...they put them places, especially young people.</span> <span id="s267">They sent them to work which most of them did not return and it was not always in that big ghetto.</span> <span id="s268">But we could live with communicate also with the outside people, with the...with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s269">Some of them, you know, not the German...they didn't look, they looked away they didn't see it, they could bring in some stuff.</span> <span id="s270">But when the liquidation started on September the 22nd, it was exactly a day after Yom Kippur in 1942.</span> <span id="s271">At Yom Kippur 1942, we were at the prayer house and people came in from work because people they had to work even on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s272">They said at the station, the railroad station, there is a lot of cattle trains and there are Ukrainians around.</span> <span id="s273">We heard the word Ukrainians, we know something it's going to happen.</span> <span id="s274">So the prayer was interrupted.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">We seen going here and there, looking what's going to be, where we're going to go.</span> <span id="s276">We know already that they're going to take us away.</span> <span id="s277">They're going to take us somewhere.</span> <span id="s278">Middle of the night, around 12, l o'clock, all of a sudden, all the lights were on, which normally since 1939 was not allowed to have any light in city or in apartment and here the lights...lit lamps were on bright, shining.</span> <span id="s279">Four o'clock in the morning, the Germans started to take out the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s280">They started first the poorest neighborhood where the poor people lived.</span> <span id="s281">That was on September, the 23rd, 1942.</span> <span id="s282">I was living with my wife, my mother, my little brother, child of mine in that poor stretch called , which was the poorest neighborhood.</span> <span id="s283">They took us out to the transport...taking out you know you take people they transport who wasn't fast enough got killed and left on the road.</span> <span id="s284">We were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s285">We maked to the transport.</span> <span id="s286">When we came to the railroad station and there was over there I would say thousands of people.</span> <span id="s287">Thousands and thousands of people!</span> <span id="s288">They had, accordingly that I know, over 60 wagons, cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s289">Each one contained over a hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Children were not counted because the children...</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s292">I want to stop this and we will go back.</span> <span id="s293">Would you stop the tape, Bonnie?</span> <span id="s294">The PA is coming through into the studio and will be on the tape, and I can't have it.</span> <span id="s295">Alright?</span> <span id="s296">And this is not the time for it.</span> <span id="s297">Bonnie, just do it.</span> <span id="s298">Just do it.</span> <span id="s299">We will back up a minute.</span> <span id="s300">Wait one minute until they do it.</span>

suggest that we proceed while somebody else goes the checking on that to find the source of that.</span> <span id="s305">This is no time to stop, so if you'll tell me when the film's rolling.</span> <span id="s306">Barney, I want to move please.</span> <span id="s307">I want to start now.</span> <span id="s308">Alright, tell her.</span> <span id="s309">Bonnie, I would like to start now please.</span> <span id="s310">I'm sorry about this.</span> <span id="s311">They had to check the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Alright, Bonnie I would like to...can we start this while someone else deals with it.</span> <span id="s313">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s315">The tape is on.</span> <span id="s316">I'm sorry about that.</span> <span id="s317">Can we go back a little and can you start again your description of what it was like when you were rounded up and taken?</span> <span id="s318">Is that possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: As of...as of...as of 39?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: No.</span> <span id="s321">No.</span> <span id="s322">No.</span> <span id="s323">You are in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s324">It's after Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s326">Alright.</span> <span id="s327">Yes.</span> <span id="s328">So when we were taken out from the house, they took us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s329">And on both sides there were German Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s330">Whoever couldn't walk that fast, they got rid of him by killing.</span> <span id="s331">So we went in to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s332">It was not the general railroad station.</span> <span id="s333">It was the railroad station for cattle.</span> <span id="s334">And over there, they pushed in people.</span> <span id="s335">They threw in children, one on top of the other until they're loaded.</span> <span id="s336">Those ones...over 60 wagons.</span> <span id="s337">Myself and my wife, the kid, my mother, and the little brother, we couldn't go in.</span> <span id="s338">It was about 2,000 more people.</span> <span id="s339">They couldn't go in because they had too many people already in the wagons so they decided to send in...send us back home.</span> <span id="s340">Now this was unbelievable a story.</span> <span id="s341">All of a sudden, people start to panic.</span> <span id="s342">People start to dance.</span> <span id="s343">Happened?</span> <span id="s344">They were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s345">They got their amount what they need to be taking out from the ghetto, and the rest they will not touch anymore.</span> <span id="s346">The people they were together, the families were together, they were very happy because nobody was missing between them.</span> <span id="s347">People were taking away like brothers or sisters or parents...if somebody remained of them, there was crying going on in the city.</span> <span id="s348">We were sent home.</span> <span id="s349">We were sent home, but one thing whoever could understand the situation was not finished.</span> <span id="s350">They didn't take away the Germans.</span> <span id="s351">They didn't take away the Ukrainians, and the light was still on for day and night.</span> <span id="s352">So we know something is going to happen to us again.</span> <span id="s353">We didn't have to wait too long because on the 25th, 4 days after the first transport, the same thing was going on again.</span> <span id="s354">September, the 25th, 1942, which on the Jewish calendar was , again they took us out.</span> <span id="s355">Now this time we didn't go straight to the railroad station to be sent off.</span> <span id="s356">We went to the market which over there the German the head man from the Gestapo was the man over there by the name of Degenhof, he was the leader from them.</span> <span id="s357">He was the murderer of the...not only this city, but more cities.</span> <span id="s358">And that was...when he decided who should live and who should die.</span> <span id="s359">With the point of the finger, he said this way, the other way.</span> <span id="s360">A little bit younger, not too many asking questions, "What is your trade?"</span> <span id="s361">Somebody had a trade like electro mechanic, which was very few people in our town, or engineering, other thing, to the right.</span> <span id="s362">Ninety five percent of the people which they took out from the houses, he pointed to the left which means to the transport.</span> <span id="s363">But before that, it is another thing I have to mention.</span> <span id="s364">People were running around crazy, starting to get a paper from the Judenrat and also from the Germans that...all kind of paper: red, green, with a stamp, without a stamp and everybody tried to do the best even with money to get the right paper.</span> <span id="s365">But nobody know what the right paper was.</span> <span id="s366">Each one was happy because he's got the right paper.</span> <span id="s367">Coming in to that place where he decided...Degenhof decided who's going to go right, who's going to go left, the paper was not important.</span> <span id="s368">It was just worthless.</span> <span id="s369">They took the paper, tear it up.</span> <span id="s370">So I was with my mother and the kid, my wife and my brother, and it was most of my family who went to the left to the transport.</span> <span id="s371">Went in to the transport where the cattle transport they had, and they took us in to the wagon.</span> <span id="s372">That was the last time I saw the city of Czestochowa before I came back from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s373">Now to tell you a story in that cattle train, I don't know how to start and I don't know how to end because it was like living through a whole life in that thing.</span> <span id="s374">First thing, people one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s375">You couldn't stand straight.</span> <span id="s376">You couldn't bend.</span> <span id="s377">You couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s378">It was just like one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s379">They took us 6 o'clock in the morning into that train.</span> <span id="s380">We were over there until about finished it loaded with all of us 2 hours maybe, more than that.</span> <span id="s381">Then they took us around back to the main station and over there we were waiting a time.</span> <span id="s382">Across the railroad station, there was another train that passengers...Polish people, they could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">They could ride, handle anything they wanted.</span> <span id="s384">When we stood each other, happened I was the lucky one...I was near a little window, where was with wire closed around that people shouldn't be able to escape.</span> <span id="s385">I looked through.</span> <span id="s386">Most of the people what they did to us, they spit on us.</span> <span id="s387">It happened one girl I know her.</span> <span id="s388">She worked for a Jewish family from my...not the house where I lived but house where I had my barber shop.</span> <span id="s389">When she saw me she said, "Oh, you are too here?"</span> <span id="s390">And in a way, she started crying.</span> <span id="s391">But more than 90 percent of the passengers in the other side of the train, they spit on us.</span> <span id="s392">And so we start rolling...start rolling to went nobody knew where we're going.</span> <span id="s393">In the middle of the night, was already about 18 hours in the train, we came to a side station which they pointed out this was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s394">Stood over there for awhile and inside that train, with God's help, it was hot like Hell and that was almost the end of September where usually in Poland, end of September is nice and cool.</span> <span id="s395">But at that time, just God helped them, not us.</span> <span id="s396">After about 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock start rolling again and we went through wilderness and all kind of thing.</span> <span id="s397">We came to a halt.</span> <span id="s398">I looked out and I see a sign which didn't mean nothing to me.</span> <span id="s399">The sign was Treblinka.</span> <span id="s400">Today, everybody almost knows what that word means.</span> <span id="s401">At that time was just a name, not a..</span> <span id="s402">.</span> <span id="s403">a little bit...a tiny little...maybe...maybe it was over there 40 families altogether, all waiting with them.</span> <span id="s404">Stayed looking out the window.</span> <span id="s405">More things came.</span> <span id="s406">From other parts of the country.</span> <span id="s407">They went in, after about 2 hours they came out.</span> <span id="s408">And all the trains empty.</span> <span id="s409">Another train also...over 60 trains with the town people, they came in.</span> <span id="s410">Went in, disappeared, 2 hours came back.</span> <span id="s411">And now was the time our train start rolling and we went in.</span> <span id="s412">Gate opened up, rolled in to the camp of Treblinka.</span> <span id="s413">10 men over there.</span> <span id="s414">We got in over there.</span> <span id="s415">The trains didn't go in like, you know, the first goes in.</span> <span id="s416">The engineer takes a train, but backwards because the engineer and the people they're working in the locomotive of the train, they shouldn't know what's going on over there.</span> <span id="s417">They were not supposed to...to see what is going on.</span> <span id="s418">That's why the pushed in the end of the train.</span> <span id="s419">And we went in.</span> <span id="s420">Out!</span> <span id="s421">Started yelling, "Out.”</span> <span id="s422">It opened up.</span> <span id="s423">I don't know how many dead ones was a..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">in the train because nobody counted we had in our train.</span> <span id="s426">We had on out...men on the right side at the open telling...woman at the left side at the barracks.</span> <span id="s427">We didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s428">And we didn't believe something what's going wrong.</span> <span id="s429">I know something is not usually that this is the last time we see each other.</span> <span id="s430">My wife, the kid and my mother went in to that left side.</span> <span id="s431">I my...mine little brother was at that time was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s432">And some of the Germans, Ukrainian and also the Jewish from the red kommando.</span> <span id="s433">"Take off your clothes.”</span> <span id="s434">Took off the clothes.</span> <span id="s435">Start taking off the clothes.</span> <span id="s436">All the people did.</span> <span id="s437">But myself...I don't know what it happened.</span> <span id="s438">A man...a Jewish man which he had a band, a red band, what called a red kommando went through...he recognized someone which was near me and he said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s439">"You see what I'm doing here.”</span> <span id="s440">So he said to him, "We need a few people.</span> <span id="s441">Go to the side.”</span> <span id="s442">"You need more?"</span> <span id="s443">"Yes, need more.”</span> <span id="s444">They took out about 16, 17 people.</span> <span id="s445">I was between them.</span> <span id="s446">Now this man which he recognized, he was married to a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s447">They took out his brother-in-laws, three of them; myself; my little brother they couldn't take out because was a kid, 13 years old.</span> <span id="s448">And a few more stayed on the side.</span> <span id="s449">We didn't see.</span> <span id="s450">People went in through the gate.</span> <span id="s451">Now we know what the gate was.</span> <span id="s452">It was the way to the gas chamber and we have never see them again.</span> <span id="s453">That was the first hour we came in.</span> <span id="s454">After that, we...the people, 18 or 16 people...more people came in from the...working people what they worked already before in the gas chamber, we had a order to clean up the place.</span> <span id="s455">Now clean up the place is not something you can take it clean.</span> <span id="s456">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s457">But in 5, 10 minutes this place had to look spotless.</span> <span id="s458">And it looked spotless.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Like there was never nobody on the place.</span> <span id="s460">So the next transport when it comes in, they shouldn't see what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: You were cleaning up the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: We were cleaning up in the outside.</span> <span id="s463">Tell you what mean cleaning up.</span> <span id="s464">Taking away all the clothes to those places where the clothes were.</span> <span id="s465">Now, not only the clothes, all the papers, all the money, all the...the...whatever somebody had with him.</span> <span id="s466">And they had a lot of things with them.</span> <span id="s467">Pots and pans they had with them.</span> <span id="s468">Other things they had with them.</span> <span id="s469">We cleaned that up.</span> <span id="s470">Still didn't know what's going on until this guy with the red bands, when we asked him what's happened to them?</span> <span id="s471">He said, "Be happy we're here because they're finished.”</span> <span id="s472">At night when they took us into the barrack...the barrack was near, I was just about...I would say 50 meters from the gate to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s473">It was at the same place where the people undressed themselves.</span> <span id="s474">The men undressed themselves, there was a well....just take out whatever... And over there we had the barrack we went to live in.</span> <span id="s475">Why I mention the well, because I tell you what the well was.</span> <span id="s476">People they knew already, not from the beginning like from Warsaw they transport...they started on the 22nd of July 1942, so people they know already what Treblinka is.</span> <span id="s477">That is not a working camp.</span> <span id="s478">That is not a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">That is extermination camp.</span> <span id="s480">From there nobody goes out alive.</span> <span id="s481">The minute when they came in, we find over there...took out from over there from that well, over 50 people.</span> <span id="s482">They jumped in.</span> <span id="s483">Instead to go into the gas chamber, they just jumped into the well.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Jumped into the well.</span> <span id="s485">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: The well.</span> <span id="s487">Yes.</span> <span id="s488">They drowned themselves.</span> <span id="s489">Took them out and that water we used to drink.</span> <span id="s490">Nobody got sick.</span> <span id="s491">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s492">At night, couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s493">Some of us which were...there were religious people and they found out that their parents or their wife or their children were killed which they didn't take out...people...where they're people which they have children.</span> <span id="s494">Mostly they took out people 25, 26, 28 years old.</span> <span id="s495">Some of them they were religious and they start saying the traditional Kiddish.</span> <span id="s496">That was the first night I was over there.</span> <span id="s497">In the morning, 5 o'clock the morning, the order.</span> <span id="s498">Out!</span> <span id="s499">Went out.</span> <span id="s500">Stayed in line to work.</span> <span id="s501">What was the work?</span> <span id="s502">The work in Treblinka like mostly was those clothes which were there were taking away from the people the night before, they day before they killed and there was piles up on the big places with clothes.</span> <span id="s503">They had to be divided.</span> <span id="s504">Like coat to coat, shoes to shoes, shirts, and also the quality of it.</span> <span id="s505">A cotton, other things, wool...that was the job.</span> <span id="s506">We called it sort kommando.</span> <span id="s507">Maybe you heard that name.</span> <span id="s508">Maybe not.</span> <span id="s509">So we worked over there.</span> <span id="s510">I myself I was a barber.</span> <span id="s511">Then at the third day or so it came...it came another order.</span> <span id="s512">They need barbers.</span> <span id="s513">It was mine town between the 16 people they took out, there was one more barber.</span> <span id="s514">But I had some with me friends you do.</span> <span id="s515">You're gonna be barber.</span> <span id="s516">They took also from other places, mostly from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s517">They got themselves about 14, 15 barbers.</span> <span id="s518">And they took us in to the other side of the place which is called Treblinka No. 2.</span> <span id="s519">Treblinka No. 2 means only the work by dead people in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s520">What they wanted us to do is to cut off the woman's hair.</span> <span id="s521">They took us in to the gas chamber...in the gas chamber before they gassed them.</span> <span id="s522">There were benches, about 20 benches...maybe less.</span> <span id="s523">And on a row of benches women were sitting and the barber went through cutting hair, with me cutting hair.</span> <span id="s524">The way the commandant...he was Jewish who...the way I know after that...I find out that he was converted but that doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s525">His name was Glesk.</span> <span id="s526">Maybe you heard the name.</span> <span id="s527">Eugene Glesk.</span> <span id="s528">He was the commandant of Treblinka.</span> <span id="s529">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s530">Very fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s531">He came over.</span> <span id="s532">He had a speech to us.</span> <span id="s533">He said, "Look, people.</span> <span id="s534">I don't want that the woman should know that they're going to be gassed.</span> <span id="s535">Make believe you're giving them a hair cut.</span> <span id="s536">They...they're going in to take a shower.</span> <span id="s537">It is...take a bunch of hair from here.</span> <span id="s538">Take a bunch of hair from here.</span> <span id="s539">Don't take off all the hair.</span> <span id="s540">Don't make them look like monkeys.</span> <span id="s541">And so we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Tell me what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: What was like it?</span> <span id="s544">We had scissors.</span> <span id="s545">From them we took bunches of hair.</span> <span id="s546">Cut off.</span> <span id="s547">Threw on the floor to the side, and about 2 minutes have to be finished.</span> <span id="s548">Not even 2 minutes be...because there was a line waiting to come up the next group.</span> <span id="s549">And that's how we worked.</span> <span id="s550">Inside it was very painful.</span> <span id="s551">Most painful was because some of the barbers they recognized their dear ones, like wives, mothers, even grandmothers.</span> <span id="s552">Can you imagine that you have to cut their hair and not to tell them a word because you were not allowed.</span> <span id="s553">If you say a word that they going to.</span> <span id="s554">.</span> <span id="s555">uh.</span> <span id="s556">.</span> <span id="s557">be gassed in 5 or 7 minutes later, there would be a panic over there and they would be killed too.</span> <span id="s558">After that, the transport was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s560">I'd not to leave the gas chambers for a minute.</span> <span id="s561">Can you tell me a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">You've talked about a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: You started to tell me about your barber friends who worked with you in the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Would you tell me about some of them and some of the families that they met there?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: It was just families like any other family.</span> <span id="s567">But the most thing it hurts when you know people.</span> <span id="s568">When a transport came in, you don't know the people.</span> <span id="s569">Those are people, but when it comes in somebody you associate or you are related, that's an entirely different thing.</span> <span id="s570">It hurts a lot more.</span> <span id="s571">We have.</span> <span id="s572">.</span> <span id="s573">I have friend.</span> <span id="s574">We worked together.</span> <span id="s575">We were friend in the same town together.</span> <span id="s576">Was a barber, a very good barber too.</span> <span id="s577">And he was working gas chamber with me.</span> <span id="s578">It happened that there came in one time his sister, one time his wife, came in his sister-in-law same thing.</span> <span id="s579">He start hugging and this and that.</span> <span id="s580">To take a half a minute more with her than with any other one.</span> <span id="s581">But this thing has to be done.</span> <span id="s582">He couldn't help himself.</span> <span id="s583">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s584">It was very, very horrible.</span> <span id="s585">But any other way it was, you get killed.</span> <span id="s586">Which it happened.</span> <span id="s587">Now let me...let me tell you a story.</span> <span id="s588">I had a very close a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s589">I worked with him together for years.</span> <span id="s590">His name was Dorfman Slamic.</span> <span id="s591">Very fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s592">Now two men from all the time where I was over there, they didn't want to stay with us together and work together.</span> <span id="s593">They run into the gas chamber by themselves.</span> <span id="s594">He was a barber, and the other one was a neighbor of mine.</span> <span id="s595">He did the same thing.</span> <span id="s596">That's two and the history...when the history of myself being in Treblinka .</span> <span id="s597">I didn't have the guts to do.</span> <span id="s598">I wish I could.</span> <span id="s599">I did not.</span> <span id="s600">But what could he do?</span> <span id="s601">Or get killed!</span> <span id="s602">To go together with him or wait maybe another day.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">And I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s604">If a humanbeing is in a situation like that, he thinks of every second, every minute...maybe...maybe there will be a change.</span> <span id="s605">Maybe something happened.</span> <span id="s606">Maybe there will be a miracle that he will survive.</span> <span id="s607">That people were not ready to get killed.</span> <span id="s608">People were not ready even to try to escape.</span> <span id="s609">And it happened to myself which I organized my escape.</span> <span id="s610">I organized another escape from 11 people which they escaped from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s611">But people that were not ready for it, they didn't want it.</span> <span id="s612">I had a friend of mine which is...was a leader from the...from the organization of the workers and I approached him.</span> <span id="s613">I said, "I'm planning an escape.</span> <span id="s614">Maybe we'll escape.</span> <span id="s615">You interested?"</span> <span id="s616">He said, "Look, Abe.</span> <span id="s617">I'm here already.</span> <span id="s618">Where I'm gonna go outside to the Pollack.</span> <span id="s619">They will kill.”</span> <span id="s620">Which is...was the truth.</span> <span id="s621">It was the truth.</span> <span id="s622">"So I rather stay here.</span> <span id="s623">So it's gonna be, it's gonna be.</span> <span id="s624">I'm gonna live another day...I'm gonna.</span> <span id="s625">If not, be killed.”</span> <span id="s626">Now that is one thing.</span> <span id="s627">Another thing is...which I want to mention.</span> <span id="s628">.</span> <span id="s629">I hear that story many, many times and it hurts me a lot.</span> <span id="s630">I'm going back to this same time that...uh...Jewish people went in like the sheep to the slaughter house.</span> <span id="s631">It hurts me a lot about that.</span> <span id="s632">I explain that to you why.</span> <span id="s633">People are not sheep.</span> <span id="s634">The way the Germans are organized to get the people killed is entirely different way.</span> <span id="s635">The first thing of not allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s636">The second thing is of not bring in food.</span> <span id="s637">Then they starve the people.</span> <span id="s638">They take away the clothes from the people.</span> <span id="s639">They take out the furniture from them, the better one.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">They take away the...the force, and then to starve them little by little until the people they lost their will to fight even the will to live.</span> <span id="s641">And to them was the same thing.</span> <span id="s642">What I'm gonna lose.</span> <span id="s643">I'm starving here.</span> <span id="s644">I got nothing here.</span> <span id="s645">Maybe if I go away and they would send me somewhere away, they promised...maybe over there I will stay.</span> <span id="s646">And this is entirely a different story than the story like some people they say, here especially people...Jewish people, "Why you went?"</span> <span id="s647">They don't understand that looking at a wife, at looking at a child, and not to have a drop of milk, even a drop of water for them...what could those people do?</span> <span id="s648">How could they fight?</span> <span id="s649">And with what?</span> <span id="s650">FIrst thing, you went...somebody was lucky.</span> <span id="s651">He went across the gate.</span> <span id="s652">Got killed on the other side because he got paid from the Germans.</span> <span id="s653">He got paid.</span> <span id="s654">For each Jew he got paid a liter of vodka.</span> <span id="s655">That was to them and he got paid with salt.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">He got paid with sugar.</span> <span id="s657">And even not for that time he was willing to do because to get rid of a Jew.</span> <span id="s658">And that is not happen to l, a thousand, or ten thousand.</span> <span id="s659">It happened to lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">The people they didn't go like sheep to the slaughter house.</span> <span id="s661">They were already willing to go the last way even to the gas chamber because their will was not decided by them.</span> <span id="s662">It was decided by hunger, other thing what they went through.</span> <span id="s663">Sicknesses, all kind.</span> <span id="s664">And now I want to tell you...I want to tell you about the thing...the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s665">Always, they ask me already about this thing.</span> <span id="s666">The gas chamber.</span> <span id="s667">How it looked?</span> <span id="s668">Very simple.</span> <span id="s669">Was all concrete.</span> <span id="s670">Was no windows.</span> <span id="s671">There was nothing in it.</span> <span id="s672">Beside on top of you, there was wires and it looked like, you know, the water going to come out from it.</span> <span id="s673">Had two doors.</span> <span id="s674">Steel doors.</span> <span id="s675">From one side and from the other side.</span> <span id="s676">The people went into the gas chamber from the one side.</span> <span id="s677">Like myself, I was in it doing the job as a barber.</span> <span id="s678">When it was full the gas chamber, the size of it was...I would say 18 by 18 or 18 by 17.</span> <span id="s679">I didn't measure that time.</span> <span id="s680">Just looked like I would say I look here the room around, I wouldn't say exactly how big it is.</span> <span id="s681">And they pushed in as many as they could.</span> <span id="s682">It was not allowed to have the people standing up with their hands down because there is not enough room, but when the people raised their hand like that there was more room to each other.</span> <span id="s683">And on top of that they throw in kids, 2, 3, 4 years old kids on top of them.</span> <span id="s684">And we came out the whole thing it took I would say between 5 and 7 minutes.</span> <span id="s685">The door opened up, not from the side they went in but the side on the other side and from the other side the...the group...people working in Treblinka No. 2 which their job was only about dead people.</span> <span id="s686">They took out the corpses.</span> <span id="s687">Some of them dead and some of them still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">They dragged them to the ditches, and over there they covered them.</span> <span id="s689">They digged ditches and they covered them.</span> <span id="s690">That was the beginning of Treblinka, the time when I was there.</span> <span id="s691">Later, they changed the situation over there by killing people the same way, but not take them to the ditches but to take them to be burned, to pile them on top of the other top, they burned.</span> <span id="s692">It was for those people...I brought you the picture.</span> <span id="s693">Three of them, they worked only by dead people.</span> <span id="s694">I myself which I worked in Treblinka No. 1, was little bit easier.</span> <span id="s695">Why was it easier?</span> <span id="s696">Because we...the people working in Treblinka No. 1...1, we took in the transports living people.</span> <span id="s697">All living people.</span> <span id="s698">And from living people, we got something.</span> <span id="s699">We went through a pocket.</span> <span id="s700">We find a piece...a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s701">We find sometime a bottle of water which was a really...some of them they brought in other thing to eat, but over there those people they worked in Treblinka No. 2, they had no chance.</span> <span id="s702">All they got is naked people going in and dead people taking out from the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: How long did you work as a barber in the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: In the gas chamber we were working as a barber over there between 2...little more than 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s705">Not for 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s706">And then they decided that the barbers will not go in anymore to the gas chamber to cut off the hair of the woman over there, but in the undressing barracks, they divided a part...let's say like you take here, divide a part and on this side they put the same thing.</span> <span id="s707">Benches around and we cut the hair off, not in the gas chamber anymore.</span> <span id="s708">That was the last time...the 3...the 2 or 3 weeks we worked over there, we worked.</span> <span id="s709">Nobody else worked more from Barrack No. 1 because they did not allow it.</span> <span id="s710">It was a gate between Treblinka l and Treblinka 2 to the gas chamber, also with barbed wires and it was some kind like trees, other thing through the wire it shouldn't be visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Abe, I need to ask you, if you can, before you...before we leave and...and go to this other job because now we don't know enough.</span> <span id="s712">Can you tell us...during those 2 weeks you were in the gas chamber working and I know it's hard, but can you tell us about some of the other people working in the gas chamber with you.</span> <span id="s713">Your friends first.</span> <span id="s714">What...what who were they and what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: They were common people like myself....growing up together.</span> <span id="s716">They were people I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">They're the people I know.</span> <span id="s718">Like there were people from Warsaw, people from other places I never knew.</span> <span id="s719">We just met over there.</span> <span id="s720">Same like I say about those people.</span> <span id="s721">Some of them I don't know.</span> <span id="s722">And like...uh... you know, I mentioned to you.</span> <span id="s723">I never...I never knew him.</span> <span id="s724">I saw him in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s725">So the people I knew...what kind of people they were?</span> <span id="s726">I'd say mostly were people...hard working people.</span> <span id="s727">One of them specially was a man...he was a fireman.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Matter of fact, he was related to Danny Kaye because Danny Kaye come from our place, his parents.</span> <span id="s729">And his name was also Daniel Kamiski which was the name of...uh...Danny Kaye.</span> <span id="s730">He wasn't a barber.</span> <span id="s731">I took him in.</span> <span id="s732">He was a nice man.</span> <span id="s733">He was next to me standing.</span> <span id="s734">And they were looking for a barber and I said, "Danny, how about you.”</span> <span id="s735">Fine.</span> <span id="s736">What's happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">They go in.</span> <span id="s738">Because over there, he did that job.</span> <span id="s739">He wasn't in the eyes of the German which another thing I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s740">People working in Treblinka, there wasn't a job that you work, you gonna work tomorrow.</span> <span id="s741">Every day they changed the people they worked there.</span> <span id="s742">If somebody worked in Treblinka a week, he was an old worker.</span> <span id="s743">He was very old because he worked there, he survived a week.</span> <span id="s744">Mostly they did...they changed.</span> <span id="s745">Every day they killed 2, 3 hundred, 4 hundred people of the people they worked in Treblinka and from the transport arriving, like myself they took out, they took out other people.</span> <span id="s746">So they were working over there the same way.</span> <span id="s747">And those people that I know they worked with me as a barber.</span> <span id="s748">The same they did.</span> <span id="s749">The same thing as I did.</span> <span id="s750">They had over there sometime their sisters coming, and I said it before.</span> <span id="s751">They had to do a job.</span> <span id="s752">The job was to prepare...to go...people to go into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s753">Not any other thing.</span> <span id="s754">Now, after that we worked over there only a few hours because a transport like cutting their hair... Let's say a transport like myself when I came in.</span> <span id="s755">When I came in, I came in from the town of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s756">Then came a transport from other places.</span> <span id="s757">It was 18 thousand people.</span> <span id="s758">Eighteen thousand people they took out, 16 or 17 people from the 18,000.</span> <span id="s759">And it happened a day I was there and I can remember...it was 4 or 5 days like that.</span> <span id="s760">Not all the time.</span> <span id="s761">Most of the time was between 12 and 15 thousand people.</span> <span id="s762">But happened 4 or 5 times there were 24 thousand people in one day.</span> <span id="s763">And it took time.</span> <span id="s764">Each transport took between 2 hours.</span> <span id="s765">No more than 2 hours.</span> <span id="s766">And it was .</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Everything spotless.</span> <span id="s768">The train would come in.</span> <span id="s769">You couldn't see any dead one.</span> <span id="s770">You couldn't see any blood one.</span> <span id="s771">Everything was shiny.</span> <span id="s772">The rest of the time...talking about myself because not everyone was a barber over there.</span> <span id="s773">But we did...after our job as barbers we worked in our places in the sort kommando, picking the clothes up, bringing the bundle from one place to other place.</span> <span id="s774">Taking the bundles to the...to the railroad place to load in the...in the wagons because they have to take those things in.</span> <span id="s775">Now there was a question also or some did ask me, "Why did they have to cut the women's hair?"</span> <span id="s776">Was simple, simple answer to that.</span> <span id="s777">Because they needed it.</span> <span id="s778">What they did from that was to make saddles for the horses.</span> <span id="s779">Now if you cut off hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose.</span> <span id="s780">If you cut the feather from a goose, when the goose is alive, that will never die.</span> <span id="s781">Whatever you do, you push it down, it goes up...stays up.</span> <span id="s782">And with human hair the same way.</span> <span id="s783">When you cut hair from a dead person, this hair just like the person.</span> <span id="s784">It's dead.</span> <span id="s785">But if you cut the hair from a live person, if you put in the saddle, the saddle will not push down because that was...that's why they cut their hair off.</span> <span id="s786">Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when they...where they make the saddles with it.</span> <span id="s787">Now the...while working over there...did all kind of work.</span> <span id="s788">At the time...let me explain the...the start of the...of the day.</span> <span id="s789">In the morning, 5 o'clock we had a order to get out.</span> <span id="s790">Get out.</span> <span id="s791">Went to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s792">Not just going forth like soldier 5 in a row to receive coffee.</span> <span id="s793">A little bit of black water and slice of bread.</span> <span id="s794">Daytime nothing.</span> <span id="s795">After the work, we received some kind of soup.</span> <span id="s796">And it was people working in the kitchen...excuse me the expression, the toilets and all the places.</span> <span id="s797">The hardest job and I think even harder working in the gas chamber cutting women's hair was when the transport came in and you had to take out people from the wagons.</span> <span id="s798">Crippled people, small children, which they lost their parents between like let's say they took one...the mother into one wagon, the children into another wagon they were not together so they were separated.</span> <span id="s799">But we have to take is...to take those people, the old, crippled people and the small...little small children is to the lazarette.</span> <span id="s800">Maybe you heard what...about the lazarette.</span> <span id="s801">Now lazarette usually means a hospital.</span> <span id="s802">Now over there wasn't a hospital.</span> <span id="s803">Was a big, very big ditch.</span> <span id="s804">And it was also with trees around.</span> <span id="s805">You couldn't see what was going on inside.</span> <span id="s806">In front of it was a man in a white thing with a red cross.</span> <span id="s807">It's just like going into a hospital, but going into that ditch...over there was Ukraine or German...shot in the head and into the ditch.</span> <span id="s808">And that was the hardest job to do.</span> <span id="s809">To take people, specially to have children... children a few months old...to take them in, throw them into the ditch where the...over there the fire was burning day and night at that ditch.</span> <span id="s810">All the thing what we find papers...all kind of thing, we threw in that ditch and that was going on as long as I was there.</span> <span id="s811">The fire was never off.</span> <span id="s812">All the time it was on.</span> <span id="s813">And on top of that, people and people are killed.</span> <span id="s814">Somebody...let's say...anytime when we couldn't go in to the latrine...to the toilet, we went to the side to do his, right away they killed.</span> <span id="s815">That happened to a close friend of mine.</span> <span id="s816">His brother's a barber.</span> <span id="s817">He's alive.</span> <span id="s818">A guy by the name of Sliska.</span> <span id="s819">He just stood on the side to do his...took him killed, into the ditch.</span> <span id="s820">And that happened all the time.</span> <span id="s821">Every time and all the time.</span> <span id="s822">Now it happened that one...one time it happened.</span> <span id="s823">A transport came from Ketrzyn.</span> <span id="s824">Ketrzyn is a little town next to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s825">Came a transport over there and a woman came out from that transport.</span> <span id="s826">Why I mention it?</span> <span id="s827">I'll tell you the story what it happened.</span> <span id="s828">That the one story which very, very seldom.</span> <span id="s829">She came out.</span> <span id="s830">In front of her was two men...two was moving with the red finger on.</span> <span id="s831">One of them...tall fellow about six two or six three, blond hair.</span> <span id="s832">Real German, but he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s833">And another one...his name was Solic Matter of fact, he was a barber.</span> <span id="s834">Well, he did a good job.</span> <span id="s835">What you mean a good job?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">For the Germans I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: And he was active.</span> <span id="s839">What that mean good job.</span> <span id="s840">There are people doing good, bad.</span> <span id="s841">He was quick.</span> <span id="s842">He organized it quick.</span> <span id="s843">He took the people away quick into the...out from the trains.</span> <span id="s844">But he didn't know they are Jewish people.</span> <span id="s845">He came out from the train with a razor and she cut the throat of both of them.</span> <span id="s846">Specially the tall fellow.</span> <span id="s847">I never knew his name.</span> <span id="s848">Was very, very handsome.</span> <span id="s849">He was more...looking like Germans than all the Germans together.</span> <span id="s850">And naturally, on the spot they killed her.</span> <span id="s851">Not with guns, with their shoes with anything they had, they killed her.</span> <span id="s852">And they took those two men into a hospital.</span> <span id="s853">I don't know where, but out from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s854">And they tried to arrest them whatever they want.</span> <span id="s855">This tall man they couldn't help.</span> <span id="s856">He died.</span> <span id="s857">They brought them back to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s858">The other one...he got killed, also brought back.</span> <span id="s859">When I left Treblinka .</span> <span id="s860">But the first man...that's the only funeral in Treblinka which was from the beginning until the end.</span> <span id="s861">What they did, they took him.</span> <span id="s862">They maked a grave for him, and wood thing.</span> <span id="s863">They buried him.</span> <span id="s864">Everybody stood...an order.</span> <span id="s865">That's the only one grave which a man...Jewish man was left in that Treblinka.</span> <span id="s866">A woman from Ketrzyn.</span> <span id="s867">Now during the time when...when I was there, it happened a lot of thing.</span> <span id="s868">What it happened?</span> <span id="s869">In the barrack I was in it, we were about 70 people one barrack.</span> <span id="s870">Every night of the work people, 5, 6 was missing.</span> <span id="s871">What mean were missing?</span> <span id="s872">They killed themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Hanged themselves with their...whatever they could get on them to strangle themself.</span> <span id="s874">Even my brother-in-law did the same.</span> <span id="s875">Uh...He married...he married a sister of my wife by the name of , a highly educated man.</span> <span id="s876">He was the leader of the...he was the leader of the Socialist Party Bundt had the name Bundt in Poland.</span> <span id="s877">He was a leader from that.</span> <span id="s878">He hanged himself.</span> <span id="s879">He couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s880">And that happened every single night.</span> <span id="s881">Three, four, five people.</span> <span id="s882">Beside people which they were killed by the Germans exchanging them for new ones which they came in from the new transport.</span> <span id="s883">Oh, it happened at one time to me.</span> <span id="s884">I got very sick in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s885">Very, very sick!</span> <span id="s886">And I went over to the commandant, to the German, I said, "Take me to the lazarette.”</span> <span id="s887">When I say take me to the lazarette, he knows exactly what it means.</span> <span id="s888">To be killed!</span> <span id="s889">Because I had an attack of the...how you call it?</span> <span id="s890">kidney and that was pain...I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s891">Unbelievable!</span> <span id="s892">So he said to me, "How long are you working here?"</span> <span id="s893">"Oh," I said, "I work here about 5 weeks.”</span> <span id="s894">"5 weeks.”</span> <span id="s895">Go to the kitchen and ask them to give you some Snupps.”</span> <span id="s896">And I was surprised.</span> <span id="s897">And everybody was surprised that he didn't take out of the gun and took care...what for you need that.</span> <span id="s898">Not that Jew.</span> <span id="s899">Could get 10,000 of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Get the other one.</span> <span id="s901">I went over there to the kitchen and I told him what .</span> <span id="s902">Whose going to give you whiskey?</span> <span id="s903">A little bit water you can have.</span> <span id="s904">I got a little water and then he told me to go into the barrack.</span> <span id="s905">That was the first time somebody went into the barrack in the middle of the day not going to work.</span> <span id="s906">And I laid down in the barrack.</span> <span id="s907">I had two cousins over there.</span> <span id="s908">They worked together with me, which they were taking out at the same time transport with me.</span> <span id="s909">One of them, he risked his life to find out what had happened to me.</span> <span id="s910">He came in to the barrack.</span> <span id="s911">He saw me.</span> <span id="s912">He never said a word to me.</span> <span id="s913">He run out and he said, "Abe is in the barrack.”</span> <span id="s914">At the night, they came in.</span> <span id="s915">Everybody on top of me.</span> <span id="s916">"Oh, you must be really the lucky one that they didn't kill you.”</span> <span id="s917">They didn't kill.</span> <span id="s918">I still was in pain.</span> <span id="s919">Over there, we had a transport coming in.</span> <span id="s920">Not one, but many transports coming in from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s921">A man came in by the name of Zello.</span> <span id="s922">He was captain in the Czechoslovakia army.</span> <span id="s923">Another one came in by the name of the Messiadic which was not the president Messidic.</span> <span id="s924">He must be some kind of a relation.</span> <span id="s925">He had a wife.</span> <span id="s926">He was Jewish or his wife was Jewish.</span> <span id="s927">I don't know.</span> <span id="s928">They came in.</span> <span id="s929">Was a doctor.</span> <span id="s930">What happened?</span> <span id="s931">When I told, he took out the tablets and said, "Abe, take the tablets," to me.</span> <span id="s932">I took the tablet.</span> <span id="s933">The following morning I never knew what that mean the sickness until three years ago now I got sick in Israel, also on the kidney.</span> <span id="s934">Now another practice.</span> <span id="s935">I worked in...I worked in a barrack where people were hiding.</span> <span id="s936">I did it myself too before I escaped from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s937">What was...the barrack was full of clothes...bundles maked out of clothes.</span> <span id="s938">So what we did we put the bundles in the barrack one on top of the other until to the roof.</span> <span id="s939">People they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s940">What they did they went in...in the day time during the work in the barracks and they remained over there.</span> <span id="s941">And they hid themselves between the clothes.</span> <span id="s942">Both it happened by accident when the clothes moved, could never go out and got choked there.</span> <span id="s943">At one time we took out from a barrack the size I would say maybe about 40, 60...40, 50 meters, over 30 people.</span> <span id="s944">Dead ones!</span> <span id="s945">I did the same thing when I escaped.</span> <span id="s946">But before that, I worked over there and I tried to help some people any way I could.</span> <span id="s947">At one time he came in, he was a kapo.</span> <span id="s948">His name was in Jewish Ben Yamin Yakoski.</span> <span id="s949">Have you heard that name?</span> <span id="s950">You did.</span> <span id="s951">He had a brother over there.</span> <span id="s952">Very, nice, religious individual boy.</span> <span id="s953">He was from a town of Yen Jeif, which is not far from Kielce.</span> <span id="s954">He came in he said, "Abe, I trust you.</span> <span id="s955">Tonight, my people...my brother they going...they're planning an escape.</span> <span id="s956">Eleven of them.</span> <span id="s957">What should I do?"</span> <span id="s958">He said.</span> <span id="s959">You know you...you have some landsmen from your town working outside...not in the barrack, but outside?"</span> <span id="s960">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s961">"Tomorrow morning after the appell you bring in your friends.</span> <span id="s962">If somebody comes in to you and tell their friends, they're working all the time here.”</span> <span id="s963">Naturally, I did whatever he told me.</span> <span id="s964">In the morning...group I worked with them...ll of them disappeared.</span> <span id="s965">Then it came in...the assistant commandant...friends which we call them the lackger, that name you heard already many times.</span> <span id="s966">He came in the barrack and he looked at me.</span> <span id="s967">"What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s968">I said, "I'm working on the cloth...looking what is there, cotton, this that.”</span> <span id="s969">"Are the same people working here what they worked yesterday?"</span> <span id="s970">I said, "Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Everybody's the same we're working.”</span> <span id="s972">It wasn't true.</span> <span id="s973">What those people...by crouching the other side of the gate, they left some kind of sign from the trees.</span> <span id="s974">At night they couldn't take away the little...this from the trees.</span> <span id="s975">And he saw that somebody went through that.</span> <span id="s976">He came over to me.</span> <span id="s977">He took my...I had...had a hat.</span> <span id="s978">.</span> <span id="s979">he took mine hat...he start knocking in a wooden block which hold , but I was like paralyzed.</span> <span id="s980">Didn't feel at all.</span> <span id="s981">Just for the thing what they had.</span> <span id="s982">I was scared.</span> <span id="s983">They're taking out to kill me.</span> <span id="s984">I didn't feel it all.</span> <span id="s985">Behind him, was a friend of mine by the name of Sidman, Eisack Sidman.</span> <span id="s986">He was standing with a knife over there behind him.</span> <span id="s987">And if he would take out the gun, he would kill him.</span> <span id="s988">But it happened that he knocked and knocked and I didn't say a word to him, so thought maybe I didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s989">He let me go.</span> <span id="s990">Then at night after work, people came in.</span> <span id="s991">"What happened?"</span> <span id="s992">I told them.</span> <span id="s993">For those people, they escaped.</span> <span id="s994">After that I found out what happened to them.</span> <span id="s995">From all those 11 people, 2 were alive when I returned from Treblinka to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s996">All nine other ones, they were killed by the Pollacks.</span> <span id="s997">They went back to their home town in Yan Jeif, and they were very, very rich.</span> <span id="s998">They were like, I would say, the Rockefellor.</span> <span id="s999">They had a possession.</span> <span id="s1000">They owned to .</span> <span id="s1001">They call themselves I would say in German, The Bundt's.</span> <span id="s1002">They got killed.</span> <span id="s1003">Two of men they tie your hands to escape.</span> <span id="s1004">I met in the ghetto of Czestochowa, when I came back from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1005">They couldn't stay there and they went somewhere away.</span> <span id="s1006">I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1007">That was one part, but the second part we...what we decide to run away.</span> <span id="s1008">The first thing is we had to get money.</span> <span id="s1009">When you go out...when you come to the Pollacks, it's impossible to live without it.</span> <span id="s1010">So we tried to get some money and that wasn't a hard job to get.</span> <span id="s1011">The money wasn't a hard job to get the money but to get the money was our job.</span> <span id="s1012">If they find on you one slota or one dollar, you get killed.</span> <span id="s1013">So about 8, 9 from our hometown.</span> <span id="s1014">One is still alive.</span> <span id="s1015">He is today 85 years old.</span> <span id="s1016">He lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1017">Yakia Bisner.</span> <span id="s1018">A friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1019">And this one, particular this one.</span> <span id="s1020">I took him away from the gas chamber three times.</span> <span id="s1021">He had such kind of eyes...you look at him you get scared.</span> <span id="s1022">And twice the German took him in, told him to go to the gate which going into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1023">And I was from the...from the side.</span> <span id="s1024">I threw clothes on him.</span> <span id="s1025">I took him away.</span> <span id="s1026">And the third time he went and he worked together with me.</span> <span id="s1027">We...we were together all the time and we collected money together to escape.</span> <span id="s1028">And matter of fact, he escaped before me.</span> <span id="s1029">Also organized this thing.</span> <span id="s1030">We decided who's going to go.</span> <span id="s1031">He went away with two other ones, which the other ones got killed where he's still alive.</span> <span id="s1032">When we collected the money...and going in to the barrack, the Ukrainian...they did something which is not normal.</span> <span id="s1033">Why?</span> <span id="s1034">In the middle of the night we came out from the barracks not walking, but crawling to the wires...to the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s1035">We want to go through them.</span> <span id="s1036">We were 7, 8...one was still inside and we had the money with us.</span> <span id="s1037">Also the same one the Sidman which I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s1038">And the Ukrainian they jumped on us.</span> <span id="s1039">We...we were the last straw... went back to the barracks, back to our place.</span> <span id="s1040">We don't know anything.</span> <span id="s1041">But they got him.</span> <span id="s1042">And they're going to kill.</span> <span id="s1043">What you got?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">We showed him.</span> <span id="s1045">Got money, a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1046">It happened they let him go.</span> <span id="s1047">Why they let him go?</span> <span id="s1048">I'll tell you why they let him go.</span> <span id="s1049">They took the money.</span> <span id="s1050">And they escaped.</span> <span id="s1051">Those two Ukrainians workmen...they escaped from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1052">Then we decided a group of 9 people is too much at one time.</span> <span id="s1053">We're going to organize a different way to escape.</span> <span id="s1054">Three at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">And we organized it.</span> <span id="s1056">One group went the first one.</span> <span id="s1057">Then another group they didn't succeed.</span> <span id="s1058">Two of men run away.</span> <span id="s1059">They third one got catched by a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1060">His name was Ella Loddick, Ella.</span> <span id="s1061">When the Ukrainian jumped on him, he jumped on the Ukrainian and he bit through his neck.</span> <span id="s1062">With his teeth he killed him.</span> <span id="s1063">And he run away.</span> <span id="s1064">I met him in the ghetto of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1065">He was over there, married.</span> <span id="s1066">He got married in that little ghetto after he got back from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1067">I was at their wedding.</span> <span id="s1068">A few weeks after he got sick and he passed away.</span> <span id="s1069">Now the third group I went with a friend of mine and a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s1070">And we did the same way I mentioned before, hiding between the clothes, make also...you know, each went into the ditch.</span> <span id="s1071">Three of us.</span> <span id="s1072">We kept the clothes apart.</span> <span id="s1073">At night, the Ukrainians, the Germans come in start hollering, "Rouse, Rouse.”</span> <span id="s1074">We don't know anything.</span> <span id="s1075">Then with their picks from their rifle, they start picking if somebody is not over there.</span> <span id="s1076">They left.</span> <span id="s1077">We worked over there until about 6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1078">About 8:30 was...winter beginning of January 43, we decide to leave.</span> <span id="s1079">Now to escape from over there is...was one chance.</span> <span id="s1080">What was one the one chance?</span> <span id="s1081">We had to go through that lazarette what the fire...what the dead people was burning.</span> <span id="s1082">We had to go through there.</span> <span id="s1083">Otherwise, it was impossible because it was six or seven row of barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1084">You went through one, you had to go through the second, the third.</span> <span id="s1085">Over there was only one.</span> <span id="s1086">When we maked through that ditch of the burning fire, we had the gate of the...with one barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1087">We decided that on a Saturday night to leave the place.</span> <span id="s1088">We took clothes.</span> <span id="s1089">We throwed the clothes on the barbed wire and lucky ones, nobody was in the tower...watching towers.</span> <span id="s1090">There was all around watch towers.</span> <span id="s1091">Saturday night we figured out because we saw so many times they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1092">They went to uh...to drink or they went with girls, out to Ukrainians, so we maked that.</span> <span id="s1093">We came out about 9 o'clock at night through that, start running and running.</span> <span id="s1094">We run all the way.</span> <span id="s1095">In the morning we find out about 6 o'clock in the morning, we were at the same place.</span> <span id="s1096">Almost a kilometer away.</span> <span id="s1097">And we heard the Ukrainian talking, so we were in Ukrainian place surrounded.</span> <span id="s1098">Finally, I looked through the stars and I went a different way.</span> <span id="s1099">Went different way, went to the River of Bug.</span> <span id="s1100">Stayed there until about...in the morning about 8:00, 8:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1101">Met a woman not far away.</span> <span id="s1102">She said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1103">The Germans are all over.”</span> <span id="s1104">"Let us in for just for over a day.”</span> <span id="s1105">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s1106">So we stayed there...stayed there a whole day like in a wilderness around us.</span> <span id="s1107">Then the following morning, we saw a man with his wagon and horse.</span> <span id="s1108">One of us went over...was a little village or something.</span> <span id="s1109">He said it's not far away, about 6 kilometers which is not far.</span> <span id="s1110">"Can you take us?"</span> <span id="s1111">He said, "I'm going with my horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s1112">If you want to go...after I don't know...I'll think about you.</span> <span id="s1113">You go.”</span> <span id="s1114">So he went from over there and we came in.</span> <span id="s1115">It was not a village, even smaller.</span> <span id="s1116">Maybe was about 15, 20 families living there.</span> <span id="s1117">And that time was...uh...the hard job started.</span> <span id="s1118">We were liberated from that...but we were not liberated from the...from the war...from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1119">And it start another painful, painful time.</span> <span id="s1120">Being outside, the head man from that little village came over to us.</span> <span id="s1121">He said, "I know who you are.</span> <span id="s1122">I know from where you come because we only 6 kilometers from the place.</span> <span id="s1123">We can smell.</span> <span id="s1124">You know...when the corpse are burning, we could smell it.</span> <span id="s1125">When the wind goes out our way.</span> <span id="s1126">What do you want to do?"</span> <span id="s1127">We said, "We want to go...we want to take the train to go to...back to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1128">"And that's a rough time.</span> <span id="s1129">I don't know how you're going to do it.”</span> <span id="s1130">"Okay, show us where it is the nearest station.”</span> <span id="s1131">He said, "First stay over here.</span> <span id="s1132">Stay over night.</span> <span id="s1133">Early in the morning, we'll see what we can do.”</span> <span id="s1134">Was a really nice man.</span> <span id="s1135">He brought over some milk and something to eat.</span> <span id="s1136">We left.</span> <span id="s1137">He said, "Don't go with the way.</span> <span id="s1138">I take you around the forest.</span> <span id="s1139">Usually it is about 17, 18 kilometers from that place, Treblinka, to that village where he took us by the name of San Draniki.</span> <span id="s1140">I remember every name of it.</span> <span id="s1141">He took us over there, said goodbye.</span> <span id="s1142">We was in the...we was also in the...in the...one night we stayed in the forest.</span> <span id="s1143">Second night we decided to go into the village.</span> <span id="s1144">A woman opened up the door.</span> <span id="s1145">This friend of mine went over.</span> <span id="s1146">"What do you want?"</span> <span id="s1147">"We want just for the day, give us a place.”</span> <span id="s1148">So she goes in to her husband, "Go up to the stable."</span> <span id="s1149">They had a stable.</span> <span id="s1150">Nothing was in the stable.</span> <span id="s1151">They were poor people.</span> <span id="s1152">So I went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">We stayed over there.</span> <span id="s1154">Cold.</span> <span id="s1155">Ice.</span> <span id="s1156">Cold.</span> <span id="s1157">It wasn't a stable like...stable you know, just a part was open.</span> <span id="s1158">Wide open.</span> <span id="s1159">WE were freezing over there.</span> <span id="s1160">We were over there for about a week.</span> <span id="s1161">At night, came up and they told us to go into his house.</span> <span id="s1162">His house was one room divided with something like this...some kind of paper .</span> <span id="s1163">We stayed in the back.</span> <span id="s1164">In the front there was a....his sister from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1165">She was a nice, young girl.</span> <span id="s1166">And all the boys they came around, and they had a good time and we couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s1167">We were afraid to breath.</span> <span id="s1168">To sneeze, forget about it.</span> <span id="s1169">And that was .</span> <span id="s1170">This one fellow by the name of Berkewitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">was a fairly good one, but we paid a lot of money to stay.</span> <span id="s1172">Every day we paid a lot of money in this room, and actually they didn't give a thing.</span> <span id="s1173">Potatoes cooked almost raw, that we shouldn't be able to eat a lot.</span> <span id="s1174">And when I explained the deal we paid them like thousand dollars a day.</span> <span id="s1175">We did give them the money to buy material.</span> <span id="s1176">We maked for them clothes, winter clothes.</span> <span id="s1177">Day to days, and all that.</span> <span id="s1178">Was very good material.</span> <span id="s1179">A brother-in-law of hers find out about...where you got so many clothes.</span> <span id="s1180">She said, "I'll tell you, but nobody has to know.</span> <span id="s1181">I have some Jews.”</span> <span id="s1182">"Where is he?"</span> <span id="s1183">"He's my house.”</span> <span id="s1184">So he came over, he said, "You come with me.</span> <span id="s1185">I take the machine...the sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1186">You come to me and you make for me clothes.”</span> <span id="s1187">I said, "Yes, I will make for you but they are my friends.</span> <span id="s1188">I will not go without them.”</span> <span id="s1189">"Come.”</span> <span id="s1190">Now this a..</span> <span id="s1191">.</span> <span id="s1192">some kind of little story.</span> <span id="s1193">I wrote that in a book.</span> <span id="s1194">It is in a book.</span> <span id="s1195">When we came over to that one, it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s1196">There was a man and a woman...what can I tell you.</span> <span id="s1197">Diamonds.</span> <span id="s1198">Didn't take money.</span> <span id="s1199">Just for the food what we ate.</span> <span id="s1200">And she maked the best food you can mention.</span> <span id="s1201">We didn't sleep in the stable.</span> <span id="s1202">We slept in the house.</span> <span id="s1203">In a bed.</span> <span id="s1204">And for us we didn't see.</span> <span id="s1205">.</span> <span id="s1206">first thing we didn't see anyone.</span> <span id="s1207">I myself for 4 months I didn't see a woman with clothes.</span> <span id="s1208">All I did is my job in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1209">All these people were all naked without any clothing.</span> <span id="s1210">First time I see a woman it was strange to me to see a woman.</span> <span id="s1211">And she was so nice.</span> <span id="s1212">They had a son about 9 years, daughter 7 years old.</span> <span id="s1213">His name was .</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">And we were over there over a week until I find a paper...newspaper and it was...a newspaper was a month from over there to Warsaw, from Warsaw to Czestochowa, which is a far...far away.</span> <span id="s1215">From over there to Warsaw is far, I would say about 68 miles and from Warsaw to our town it is about 150 miles.</span> <span id="s1216">Far away.</span> <span id="s1217">To walk is impossible.</span> <span id="s1218">We decided to go by train.</span> <span id="s1219">Whatever will be will be.</span> <span id="s1220">We'll go by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: At this point, we need to stop, change tapes, and then we can pick up with the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Abe, the tape is started.</span> <span id="s1224">We left as you were about to board a train for Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Can you tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Before I boarded that train, I got into a family.</span> <span id="s1228">I mentioned it before by the name of Suppel .</span> <span id="s1229">We stayed there about 8, 10 days.</span> <span id="s1230">Very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s1231">And he had a..</span> <span id="s1232">.</span> <span id="s1233">uh...brother- in-law.</span> <span id="s1234">He and his brother-in-law was taking us to the railroad to pick up the train.</span> <span id="s1235">Before we left (coughing) excuse me...their house...his wife start crying and she said, "Somebody from you survive, please write me a letter.”</span> <span id="s1236">And that was the end we saw them.</span> <span id="s1237">We went through the forest.</span> <span id="s1238">They went first.</span> <span id="s1239">They didn't want to go together with us naturally.</span> <span id="s1240">Before coming to the railroad station, from the forest under a tree...it came out a few Germans from the SS.</span> <span id="s1241">And how...where do you have your passports.</span> <span id="s1242">We find out that time that the German they took away all the passports from the public to change for a different kind of passport.</span> <span id="s1243">And we knew that.</span> <span id="s1244">So we told them, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1245">Yes.</span> <span id="s1246">It's true.</span> <span id="s1247">"Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1248">"Oh, we're going to take the train.”</span> <span id="s1249">Start looking around.</span> <span id="s1250">I was shaking.</span> <span id="s1251">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1252">That's a true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Because I didn't want to come in to their hand alive again.</span> <span id="s1254">So my mind was to escape and let them kill me, but this cousin of mine start, you know, pushing me like coming out from a trance...my, myself...where I am.</span> <span id="s1255">Who I am.</span> <span id="s1256">And I didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1257">They let us go.</span> <span id="s1258">Coming to the railroad station those two people, Mr. Suppel and his brother...was his brother-in-law went in to buy tickets, but the cashier at the railroad station saw us.</span> <span id="s1259">He said, "What you want to get tickets for them.</span> <span id="s1260">There are three of them.</span> <span id="s1261">You are two.</span> <span id="s1262">No, you cannot get any tickets.”</span> <span id="s1263">Why?</span> <span id="s1264">You gotta pay money.</span> <span id="s1265">And they came out and we told them to give them as much as as they asked for.</span> <span id="s1266">He did give them money and we had a ticket.</span> <span id="s1267">But luckily enough those people there didn't leave us.</span> <span id="s1268">They went with us to Warsaw which is about 60 kilometers from there.</span> <span id="s1269">We traveled.</span> <span id="s1270">Even they were not allowed to travel at night, but they went with us.</span> <span id="s1271">We arrived at Warsaw about 8 o'clock, and the train we supposed to take about quarter til 12 at night.</span> <span id="s1272">They went over to buy for us tickets, and the cashier said, "You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s1273">You know the law.</span> <span id="s1274">We can't sell tickets only 25 kilometers from this place.</span> <span id="s1275">And when you travel over there, then you buy other tickets for another 25 kilometers.”</span> <span id="s1276">And I was standing nearby and I took out a bunch of money and I put in the front of the window.</span> <span id="s1277">"Oh," he said, "Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1278">Yes.</span> <span id="s1279">I have...uh...all the papers from the...from the (which means like the President from the city)...he had the papers...he wrote on the name whatever we did give to them and we had already papers to go to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1280">Right we said goodbye to each other, we left.</span> <span id="s1281">We took the train.</span> <span id="s1282">Everyone in a different compartment.</span> <span id="s1283">We don't know each other.</span> <span id="s1284">In the morning, about 7 o'clock in the morning, 7:30 was still like half dark, we came into this station, Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1285">A cousin of mine, he lived before in a section which was mostly...uh...Christian people.</span> <span id="s1286">And this place wasn't included before in the ghetto, not in the first and not in the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s1287">Over there, went down, didn't see any Germans around, but Polish police.</span> <span id="s1288">We took a doreska if you know what that is.</span> <span id="s1289">I don't know how to say that in...in English.</span> <span id="s1290">What...what I call it in English.</span> <span id="s1291">I never know.</span> <span id="s1292">In Jewish they call it kind of thing, but it is a wagon driven by horses, a special passenger.</span> <span id="s1293">It took us to this place over there where he lived.</span> <span id="s1294">Over there, we went in.</span> <span id="s1295">Also in the hiding, it happened a friend of mine...very close of mine and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s1296">We grew up I was in the same house.</span> <span id="s1297">He didn't mention a word to me.</span> <span id="s1298">He never saw me in his life like...and I never saw him.</span> <span id="s1299">But we know it...we know we saw each other.</span> <span id="s1300">We stayed the whole day hidden.</span> <span id="s1301">At night through the forest, we went close to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1302">We came over to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1303">We wanted to go in and the ghetto was surrounded by Polish police, Ukraine, other kind.</span> <span id="s1304">Was very seldom, in fact was never was somebody wants to get smuggled into the ghetto which normally people wanted to get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1305">So I went into the policeman, Polish policeman, "We want to go in.”</span> <span id="s1306">"You want to go in?</span> <span id="s1307">You must be crazy.</span> <span id="s1308">What for you want to go in?"</span> <span id="s1309">We took out...I don't remember how much money.</span> <span id="s1310">We give it.</span> <span id="s1311">He looked away.</span> <span id="s1312">We sneaked in...in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1313">Was a small ghetto.</span> <span id="s1314">Beginning of January 1943.</span> <span id="s1315">People in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1316">What can I describe to you.</span> <span id="s1317">Very, very poor.</span> <span id="s1318">Without clothes, without food, without anything.</span> <span id="s1319">We got in over there.</span> <span id="s1320">I met a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1321">Very close friend.</span> <span id="s1322">We grew up together.</span> <span id="s1323">Up til today we are the closest.</span> <span id="s1324">He is the first one.</span> <span id="s1325">"Abe, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1326">You were sent away.”</span> <span id="s1327">"Yes, I was sent away.</span> <span id="s1328">I am here.”</span> <span id="s1329">Met a cousin of mine .</span> <span id="s1330">"Where are you coming from?"</span> <span id="s1331">"Treblinka.”</span> <span id="s1332">"What is Treblinka?"</span> <span id="s1333">We explained it to him.</span> <span id="s1334">Went into his room and we start to explain to him.</span> <span id="s1335">We start to explain to different kind of people.</span> <span id="s1336">We start to explain even to the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s1337">Nobody but the closest friends of mine or of theirs...they didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s1338">They said, "What do you want...why you wanta tell me a story that nobody who was transported from here is not anymore alive?"</span> <span id="s1339">I said, "That's right.”</span> <span id="s1340">"They are.”</span> <span id="s1341">"You people must be crazy?</span> <span id="s1342">And where you come from?</span> <span id="s1343">A sick house?"</span> <span id="s1344">I said, "No.”</span> <span id="s1345">But one thing...because we didn't ask them for anything...we didn't ask them for food.</span> <span id="s1346">We had money.</span> <span id="s1347">We didn't ask them for clothes.</span> <span id="s1348">We wore clothes.</span> <span id="s1349">Until one to another, the whole ghetto knew.</span> <span id="s1350">And the ghetto was about 5,000 people, all of them working in ammunition factory outside the ghetto which they took them every morning out from the ghetto and they took them to the factory.</span> <span id="s1351">Over there they worked by ammunition, and at night they brought them back.</span> <span id="s1352">We had no...no place of ours.</span> <span id="s1353">We went...uh...escorted to no place, but we hanged around.</span> <span id="s1354">It was very dangerous to be over there.</span> <span id="s1355">Young people not doing any work.</span> <span id="s1356">They came back at night.</span> <span id="s1357">Everybody noticed, especially me.</span> <span id="s1358">"Hey, Bomba, is back.</span> <span id="s1359">He's from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1360">He tells horrible stories which is unbelievable.”</span> <span id="s1361">And we had coming in many friends, asking about their families.</span> <span id="s1362">One I said, "They're dead.”</span> <span id="s1363">"How can it be?</span> <span id="s1364">How they die?"</span> <span id="s1365">Just asking question, "How?</span> <span id="s1366">How long did they go?</span> <span id="s1367">When they die?</span> <span id="s1368">And how they died?</span> <span id="s1369">Who was together with them?"</span> <span id="s1370">Whatever we could, we answered him.</span> <span id="s1371">I could answer people which I was with their family in the same wagon...how they locked it and how they lived through the journey to Treblinka and the last time I..</span> <span id="s1372">.</span> <span id="s1373">when I saw them.</span> <span id="s1374">It came so far that we were afraid that they're going to kill us because we're bringing in all kind of information which wasn't good for the Germans, wasn't good for the Ukrainians, even for the Jewish police wasn't good.</span> <span id="s1375">We're hiding different places, and then I had some friends...barbers.</span> <span id="s1376">One of them by the name of Balsome...he was the person...the personal barber of the man which he maked the selection.</span> <span id="s1377">He was the biggest murderer of the ghetto by the name of Degenhof.</span> <span id="s1378">And Degenhof said to him, "You know something.</span> <span id="s1379">I got information there are people here coming from Treblinka.”</span> <span id="s1380">He said, "I do not know," which he know very well.</span> <span id="s1381">He was also our friend, and we worked together as a barber and a few barbers worked with us.</span> <span id="s1382">He said, "I don't know anything.”</span> <span id="s1383">He said, "Don't tell me.</span> <span id="s1384">You know.”</span> <span id="s1385">He said, "I don't know.”</span> <span id="s1386">So he said to him, "You know something.</span> <span id="s1387">If they could...uh...run away, if they could escape from Treblinka I don't want to bother with them.</span> <span id="s1388">I don't know anything.”</span> <span id="s1389">And myself was a barber.</span> <span id="s1390">I went into the barber shop of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Had a barber shop working over there about, I would say about 10, 12 barbers.</span> <span id="s1392">They took me in.</span> <span id="s1393">And I worked and I lived with them together.</span> <span id="s1394">We ate together.</span> <span id="s1395">Two women.</span> <span id="s1396">One was the wife of the Balsome which he was the head man, like big leader, and the other was the wife of a partner of mine from before the war.</span> <span id="s1397">They did the cooking, everything.</span> <span id="s1398">At that time I had money.</span> <span id="s1399">Naturally, I supported them with everything I could.</span> <span id="s1400">And they had anything they wanted.</span> <span id="s1401">We did also in that small ghetto organized like a little restaurant where people, you know, cooking, buying this that.</span> <span id="s1402">What we did....I had a brother-in-law, and this other gentleman by the name of Eisner, he had a brother-in-law also.</span> <span id="s1403">And they were running around almost naked without anything.</span> <span id="s1404">What we did...we took out money and we said, "Here is a room.</span> <span id="s1405">You buy all kind of food you can get.</span> <span id="s1406">So who's gonna buy?</span> <span id="s1407">Alright.</span> <span id="s1408">You just do with it whatever you can.</span> <span id="s1409">Was three of us.</span> <span id="s1410">Jacob Eisner, and this friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1411">He just passed away not so long ago, Rappaport, Moshe Rappaport, and myself.</span> <span id="s1412">We went down in the street.</span> <span id="s1413">People coming from work, hungry, dirty, beaten up.</span> <span id="s1414">We handed them money.</span> <span id="s1415">Go up over there at the first floor.</span> <span id="s1416">There is a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1417">And you get food.</span> <span id="s1418">We supplied the food and we sent them over the customers that the people shouldn't go in like without anything, and I tell you this is the honest truth.</span> <span id="s1419">We did it as long as we could.</span> <span id="s1420">And we're working over there.</span> <span id="s1421">We organized also in that small ghetto some kind of resistance against...a few of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">One was also from Treblinka by the name of Eislevich.</span> <span id="s1423">He came from a town not far away from Rabonska.</span> <span id="s1424">And then it was also in January.</span> <span id="s1425">They tried to liquidate a number of people, like to take out from five thousand, about thousand of them in to be killed.</span> <span id="s1426">I was also on that place.</span> <span id="s1427">That was on the market place.</span> <span id="s1428">They took out all the Jewish people from that marketplace.</span> <span id="s1429">They divided them in groups accordingly the place where they worked...40, 50 in a group, and took out groups and they sent them away.</span> <span id="s1430">This friend of ours from Treblinka, Eislevich...he had a gun.</span> <span id="s1431">I don't know how he got it.</span> <span id="s1432">He took out the gun and he start to kill one of the Germans...the Gestapo man by the name of Ron.</span> <span id="s1433">That was the German's name, Ron.</span> <span id="s1434">But he didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s1435">He didn't even want to kill him.</span> <span id="s1436">He took apart...apart from the clothes.</span> <span id="s1437">Because of that they took out 27 people.</span> <span id="s1438">From the people they actually...I don't know they wanted to stay or not, but they took out a group of people...27 of them, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1439">Shot them in front of our eyes.</span> <span id="s1440">And this Eislevich with their boots, with their sticks they killed him.</span> <span id="s1441">And this friend of mine, who was also close with that Eislevich like myself.</span> <span id="s1442">He had his knife and I had a stick and I said, "What are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1443">Don't do it.</span> <span id="s1444">There will be more killing.”</span> <span id="s1445">He let it go.</span> <span id="s1446">And I still sounds the...the voice from one of my friends by the name of when he got killed, before he got killed.</span> <span id="s1447">He said to his girlfriend, "Goodbye, Honey Sauce.”</span> <span id="s1448">After that we went in back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1449">But the organizing inside the ghetto didn't stopped.</span> <span id="s1450">There were other groups.</span> <span id="s1451">It went out a group to the forest...some boys, younger...little older than myself and for a time we find out they got killed, but not by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1452">By the Polish ARKA.</span> <span id="s1453">The ARKA that is they called themselves they fighting for the liberation of Poland.</span> <span id="s1454">But actually, they were fighting for the liberation of the Jews in Poland which they helped the Germans to liquidate the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1455">And until June the 22nd, 1946, they find out that a group is organizing a resistance of the ghetto in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1456">They want to know who the leader is.</span> <span id="s1457">They took out a man, a friend of mine...very close friend of mine by the name of Poltashavichs.</span> <span id="s1458">He was such a nice fellow, such a quiet man.</span> <span id="s1459">They took him out to an open place and all the Jewish people around that place had to stay to look how he's beaten up almost to the end, just to say who is the leader.</span> <span id="s1460">But he didn't say it.</span> <span id="s1461">They killed him, and he didn't mention a word.</span> <span id="s1462">Now, that was the last day in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1463">A day after, they start liquidating the small ghetto which at that time was between 4 and 5 thousand Jewish people working in four different factories in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1464">One of them was by the name of Hassack .</span> <span id="s1465">The other one was Hosa Hassack, Bata, and there was one Slavanka where people worked.</span> <span id="s1466">The biggest amount of people they worked on which was almost about 3 thousand of them.</span> <span id="s1467">And I was working was in this same place here after the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1468">By liquidating the ghetto, there was a lot of people which they belonged to uprising group, and many of them digged holes, bunkers to be hidden and also I was in...I was involved with a group which we digged a bunker, a big bunker...a bunker about 50, 60 people in it.</span> <span id="s1469">We had inside food for 2 years hidden.</span> <span id="s1470">We had beds in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1471">We had everything you wanta mention.</span> <span id="s1472">And also we digged a way to go through the ghetto into the other side, to the Christian side.</span> <span id="s1473">Going in through that we had to go in to a big pile of garbage.</span> <span id="s1474">Under that garbage, we had hidden a tiny little door from the top to go into that.</span> <span id="s1475">At that time I knew already my wife...I met her there after I got back from the Treblinka...something like that I met her, and I said, "Regina, I have a place.”</span> <span id="s1476">We went over there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Do you mean the woman who later became your wife?</span> <span id="s1478">A: Became my wife.</span> <span id="s1479">Yes.</span> <span id="s1480">Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Regina.</span> <span id="s1483">And I'm going over to that place.</span> <span id="s1484">I'm opening up this and she said, "I won't go in.</span> <span id="s1485">If you want, you go in.</span> <span id="s1486">I don't want to go in.”</span> <span id="s1487">I said, "If you're not going in, I'm not going in either.”</span> <span id="s1488">What it happened, people went in and they with dynamite they destroyed the whole land of that strip about 6, 7 houses.</span> <span id="s1489">Took out 3, 4...3 stories, 4 stories, 2 stories and all the people got killed.</span> <span id="s1490">The rest of the people the Judenrat and most of the police they took to the cemetery and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1491">Before that it happened...I got to mention it.</span> <span id="s1492">Before that it was on Purim, 1943, the guard came over and he said to the Judenrat before...just shortly before that, because that what happened in June and Purim was in the end of March.</span> <span id="s1493">He said, "We got a contract with the British government.</span> <span id="s1494">We're going to release part of you and they're going to release some of our soldiers which they are under the British.</span> <span id="s1495">Some are doctors, engineers, rich people, electricians, and all kind.</span> <span id="s1496">By among they took 152 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">We will give you passports.</span> <span id="s1498">We will transfer you to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1499">Everyone was happy.</span> <span id="s1500">From them gonna give all they have, more than they had to be included in that group.</span> <span id="s1501">One of them...a doctor, Doctor Connon, with his wife.</span> <span id="s1502">An elderly man, a doctor, he fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1503">He didn't go.</span> <span id="s1504">What do you think they did to that group?</span> <span id="s1505">They took all those girls, about 150 people into the cemetery and they killed them.</span> <span id="s1506">And this doctor, because he fell asleep with his wife, was missing.</span> <span id="s1507">And then they liquidated the ghetto and they got rid of those houses with the people they were hidden in it.</span> <span id="s1508">They took us to the labor camp...to the...in Czestochowa .</span> <span id="s1509">Over there, we worked there from the end of June 1943 until the liberation.</span> <span id="s1510">The 16th of January 1945 we were liberated through the Russian troops.</span> <span id="s1511">And from over there...I worked there in my trade.</span> <span id="s1512">Only my trade a working, as a barber.</span> <span id="s1513">They needed barbers over there, so I worked over there.</span> <span id="s1514">I was very...I was almost fluently in the...in the German language, writing, and also in speaking it.</span> <span id="s1515">I never wanted to be any of this big people.</span> <span id="s1516">I was plain working man.</span> <span id="s1517">As a matter of fact, the director of this factory, it happened that this one of humanbeing I would call from the German government...a name by Director Litt.</span> <span id="s1518">He was in the parliament and he was also from the family of Franz.</span> <span id="s1519">He took the people and he said, "This is your home.</span> <span id="s1520">You're gonna stay here as long as you will be alive.</span> <span id="s1521">You're gonna be...you're not going back anymore to that ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1522">At that time I was...I was still in the ghetto, but when I came over he called, "Who knows German?"</span> <span id="s1523">I said, "I know German.”</span> <span id="s1524">"You're going to be the foreman of the barbers.”</span> <span id="s1525">I said, "No, There's an elderly man.</span> <span id="s1526">I respected him very, very by the name of Goldberg.</span> <span id="s1527">He was in our city a legislature, and he was a big man.</span> <span id="s1528">I said, "The job goes to him.”</span> <span id="s1529">And I..</span> <span id="s1530">.</span> <span id="s1531">and I worked as a barber until almost the end of it, when they start in 1945 when the front with the Russians came closer, they start to liquidate that factory too where we worked.</span> <span id="s1532">They took away every day people.</span> <span id="s1533">And I said to myself and also to a few friends, "I am not going anymore into a cattle train.</span> <span id="s1534">I know where this thing goes.</span> <span id="s1535">If anything happens, they're going to take me I'm gonna escape.”</span> <span id="s1536">And I even said to Regina, "Don't go after me.</span> <span id="s1537">You don't know me any more.</span> <span id="s1538">I don't know you any more.</span> <span id="s1539">Just you wait.</span> <span id="s1540">If I go, I will escape.</span> <span id="s1541">I will not go in the wagons.</span> <span id="s1542">If they kill me, I will not go in the wagons.”</span> <span id="s1543">At day time, they took out...a day before, over 2,000 women.</span> <span id="s1544">Day after, they took out a thousand men, and they send them...the women they send to Ravensbruck, Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1545">The men they sent to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1546">I didn't go with that group.</span> <span id="s1547">And the afternoon, seeing what's going on over there, that the Germans are getting nervous.</span> <span id="s1548">Some of them did try to escape, and I tried to go through the wires.</span> <span id="s1549">So one of the Ukrainians said, "Look, don't do that.”</span> <span id="s1550">The voice was different than a day before.</span> <span id="s1551">He begged us...not he ordered us, but he begged us that we shouldn't escape now.</span> <span id="s1552">Later it was gonna get dark.</span> <span id="s1553">What happened?</span> <span id="s1554">We saw...myself and some other of them...some of the Germans, they were carrying bombs to blow up the factory with the people, but it was so fast.</span> <span id="s1555">I wasn't there already.</span> <span id="s1556">I went outside by myself.</span> <span id="s1557">Then it happened that I..</span> <span id="s1558">.</span> <span id="s1559">there was too many Germans.</span> <span id="s1560">I couldn't go through.</span> <span id="s1561">I came back and I said to Regina, "This time, you're going with me.”</span> <span id="s1562">I took her out the wires.</span> <span id="s1563">We went around.</span> <span id="s1564">Imagine that I..</span> <span id="s1565">.</span> <span id="s1566">I would say I was almost like born in the city, and I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1567">The place where I wanted to go couldn't go through.</span> <span id="s1568">It was full of Germans.</span> <span id="s1569">On the other side I wanted to go to the old town of the city.</span> <span id="s1570">Everything inside was burning.</span> <span id="s1571">Well, I decided to go a different way, just to go near that place.</span> <span id="s1572">I had a friend of mine, a Christian friend.</span> <span id="s1573">I had many, many of them before the war, by the name of Berenski, Adolph Berenski.</span> <span id="s1574">Very, highly educated man.</span> <span id="s1575">And I tried to go...to get to him, but wherever I went I couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s1576">And there's another story with him either.</span> <span id="s1577">It is worthwhile mentioning it.</span> <span id="s1578">This friend of mine, when I got back from Treblinka, he had a factory.</span> <span id="s1579">He had a big factory.</span> <span id="s1580">A rich man, rich boy.</span> <span id="s1581">He was married.</span> <span id="s1582">A rich boy, fine educated.</span> <span id="s1583">He wanted to divide a part of the factory and to make a small room into...put me in that part.</span> <span id="s1584">Me, the two friends of mine from Treblinka and Regina and some of...one friend...one of our other friend had a girl or so.</span> <span id="s1585">He said, "I have everything ready.</span> <span id="s1586">I just want you to come over there.”</span> <span id="s1587">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1588">I had no feeling for it.</span> <span id="s1589">I had no heart to do it.</span> <span id="s1590">In my heart, even we grew up together I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1591">Don't ask me why.</span> <span id="s1592">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1593">And I didn't go.</span> <span id="s1594">Now listen carefully to it.</span> <span id="s1595">He did a lot of for some of his friends, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1596">He sent in food.</span> <span id="s1597">He sent in clothes to the concentration camp where we were and he helped them a lot.</span> <span id="s1598">After the liberation I found out a story, an unbelievable story.</span> <span id="s1599">One of his girlfriend, which was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1600">In fact she is now...she's living now.</span> <span id="s1601">I just saw her not so long ago.</span> <span id="s1602">He did a lot for her and for her sister and some of the family.</span> <span id="s1603">He had a girlfriend, a Christian girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1604">You know after going around a time with her, it happened she got pregnant.</span> <span id="s1605">A Christian girl got pregnant.</span> <span id="s1606">Why I'm telling you this story is she...this girl, she was with a sister.</span> <span id="s1607">They had two sisters, Jewish sisters hidden in their house.</span> <span id="s1608">He knew about it, but he wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1609">When he ordered her to get rid of the pregnancy and he didn't want to marry her, he went to the Gestapo and to the other...and he told them that those two sisters had hidden two girls in their bunker.</span> <span id="s1610">They took them out and they killed them, and the two sisters...they took away.</span> <span id="s1611">They send them to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s1612">This girl got rid of the pregnancy and she was working in the Ravensbruck for a time.</span> <span id="s1613">She was liberated.</span> <span id="s1614">She got back to Czestochowa, and he was in the city already a big man.</span> <span id="s1615">Everybody knew him.</span> <span id="s1616">Nice, fine man.</span> <span id="s1617">Nobody knew about...knows about his story.</span> <span id="s1618">When she got back, she went to the...Polish police at that time, and she told them the story.</span> <span id="s1619">And they called them in.</span> <span id="s1620">"Is that this?"</span> <span id="s1621">He said, "Yes, it's true.”</span> <span id="s1622">They jailed him, and he got 15 years in jail.</span> <span id="s1623">After living in jail or a year, a little more than a year, he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1624">That's the man I didn't trust him.</span> <span id="s1625">I didn't go to him.</span> <span id="s1626">And something...something is luck.</span> <span id="s1627">We had all kind of people.</span> <span id="s1628">We had in the ghetto even Jewish people...I don't have to tell you, if you are in this kind...they working...they were working against the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1629">I'm sorry to say that this true.</span> <span id="s1630">And that happened.</span> <span id="s1631">It happened in our...in our town.</span> <span id="s1632">We had a few men.</span> <span id="s1633">I don't have to mention the names.</span> <span id="s1634">If you want I could mention it.</span> <span id="s1635">Yes?</span> <span id="s1636">I don't think so which is very...because we are Jewish people, we shouldn't tell stories like that.</span> <span id="s1637">But for the, you know, documentary and for the history, everything has to be open.</span> <span id="s1638">One of them was a Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1639">He was a policeman.</span> <span id="s1640">The other one was by the name of Slemmer.</span> <span id="s1641">There were two brothers.</span> <span id="s1642">One of them was involved.</span> <span id="s1643">The other wasn't involved.</span> <span id="s1644">Was a barber.</span> <span id="s1645">Nice man.</span> <span id="s1646">But because he was with his brother all the time, take him also.</span> <span id="s1647">One of them was a baker.</span> <span id="s1648">He was head man before the war from the bakers, even he could write and read.</span> <span id="s1649">Well, he got rich.</span> <span id="s1650">His really name...they call him Kollibike.</span> <span id="s1651">That's how they called him.</span> <span id="s1652">And there were two more boys.</span> <span id="s1653">I don't want to mention the names because their two brothers are alive, and I'm close with them.</span> <span id="s1654">They were working against.</span> <span id="s1655">What that mean against?</span> <span id="s1656">They organized a group from those...one of them, the Kollibike, and that policeman, Roseberg, he worked with the German together.</span> <span id="s1657">Announced it for the Germans, whatever was going on, who is organizing an escape, who is organizing an uprising.</span> <span id="s1658">We find that out.</span> <span id="s1659">And in our ghetto, we have a group of people...we took not all at one time...one everyone...a wife to a house...it was not far from my house.</span> <span id="s1660">Over there we had lawyers, real lawyers.</span> <span id="s1661">We had also a prosecutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">We had judges, real judges before the war.</span> <span id="s1663">It was a trial.</span> <span id="s1664">They tried him for treason against the Jewish people, and we decided death penalty.</span> <span id="s1665">And death penalty was done on the spot.</span> <span id="s1666">On the spot and in a bottle, wrote down the whole story, buried the bottle.</span> <span id="s1667">And we did that with him and the other one.</span> <span id="s1668">The other group of four people, they didn't do that.</span> <span id="s1669">They didn't work together with the Germans, but what they did is they organized themselves a little group and they went in the name of the partisans to the people...Jewish people which they knew they had money, hidden money.</span> <span id="s1670">We offered the partisan.</span> <span id="s1671">We don't want money and this and that and in the meantime, they grabbed the money and spent the money, all kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1672">And people and they didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1673">And they decided to get rid of them, and they got rid of them.</span> <span id="s1674">That was going on and on.</span> <span id="s1675">And barely liquidation...and I tell you liquidation was very horrible because there were old people in bunkers hidden all the time.</span> <span id="s1676">There were young people and people that went to work and they had their parents in the bunkers.</span> <span id="s1677">People went to work and they had their children in the bunkers and all of a sudden, you know, you cannot go back.</span> <span id="s1678">And there were bunkers, some of them which because of children they were crying and other thing.</span> <span id="s1679">They find out about it, and all the people got killed.</span> <span id="s1680">And that is almost til the end of this... Now I want...I wanta go back to the time in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1681">I didn't mention that, but I have to mention it.</span> <span id="s1682">When I worked in the gas chamber, that is very, very important voice to me.</span> <span id="s1683">By cutting a woman's hair, I met a girl over there.</span> <span id="s1684">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1685">Miss America is a beast according to this girl.</span> <span id="s1686">A beauty.</span> <span id="s1687">A beauty from beauty land.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">While cutting her hair, she looks at me she says, "Look, I see you are a young man.</span> <span id="s1689">Do something that you should be able to escape and go over...tell the people what is happening here.</span> <span id="s1690">Especially, go.</span> <span id="s1691">Maybe my father is alive.</span> <span id="s1692">I know he is alive because he was a pharmacist in a little town.”</span> <span id="s1693">I said to her, "Look, what are you trying to do?</span> <span id="s1694">Can I escape from death?"</span> <span id="s1695">She insisted, she said, my name is Salli Levinson .</span> <span id="s1696">I am from a little town by the name of Koanst in Poland.</span> <span id="s1697">My father is the head man from the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1698">Now he is a pharmacist and tell what is going on what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1699">And you know something, behind my mind I had all the time in me and in a little way that pushed me a little bit because of her words to do it.</span> <span id="s1700">Over there in that...in that little .</span> <span id="s1701">Oh, I tell you...I tell you the reaction with this with other people, they came in.</span> <span id="s1702">Coming in to the gas chamber, the woman mostly...the men we didn't do.</span> <span id="s1703">We didn't cut their hair.</span> <span id="s1704">Only women.</span> <span id="s1705">But when they came in they people from Poland...from what city they come forth doesn't matter,.</span> <span id="s1706">.</span> <span id="s1707">about 50, 60 percent they knew already they're not going to take showers.</span> <span id="s1708">They're going to be gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">They knew it.</span> <span id="s1710">There wasn't any...any outcry.</span> <span id="s1711">There wasn't any panic.</span> <span id="s1712">They were I would say released from their pain, from their going through what they went through all the time until to the end of their life.</span> <span id="s1713">But most what it happened when we have transports from other part of Europe, like from Czechoslovakia, from...from Austria, from Germany, from Yugoslavia, those people they didn't know.</span> <span id="s1714">Until going in to the gas chamber, they couldn't believe that is their last wake.</span> <span id="s1715">First thing, they didn't come by cattle train.</span> <span id="s1716">They came in.</span> <span id="s1717">.</span> <span id="s1718">in the big wagons, the pullman wagons and they were sitting in comfortable.</span> <span id="s1719">Some of them were playing cards.</span> <span id="s1720">Some of they...some of them, you know, they were having a good time.</span> <span id="s1721">At the railroad stops, they could walk out the trains to go over to the places where they could buy coffee, drinks, other things, and go in back to the train.</span> <span id="s1722">When they came in and I remember at one time, I happened I went into the train in Treblinka like that.</span> <span id="s1723">And told the people to go out.</span> <span id="s1724">One of the...was from the Germany, they came.</span> <span id="s1725">He had a fight with those people.</span> <span id="s1726">He wanted to take his umbrella with him.</span> <span id="s1727">He wouldn't...he wouldn't go with umbrella, and... Anyway, we crossed.</span> <span id="s1728">I told him the way you go you don't need anymore umbrella.</span> <span id="s1729">Well, it didn't come to his mind.</span> <span id="s1730">Those were the people they didn't believe.</span> <span id="s1731">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1732">But the people from Poland, around Poland.</span> <span id="s1733">They all...they believers.</span> <span id="s1734">Now one particular transport I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1735">Come to Treblinka from a little village not far away, about 12 kilometer away.</span> <span id="s1736">This time when it was Poland I..</span> <span id="s1737">.</span> <span id="s1738">i went over there.</span> <span id="s1739">They came in not by train, not by wagon, but Ukrainian and the German took him by foot.</span> <span id="s1740">It was some kind of holiday.</span> <span id="s1741">Don't remember what kind it was exactly.</span> <span id="s1742">They went in...covered head, and calling up the out-cries, , and they went into the gas chamber at that time when outside we didn't work.</span> <span id="s1743">It was long time we didn't work.</span> <span id="s1744">What was on?</span> <span id="s1745">This...uh...commandant or was commandant...lager, .</span> <span id="s1746">He was a sportsman.</span> <span id="s1747">He organized a box match.</span> <span id="s1748">Fighters, really fighters.</span> <span id="s1749">We had a man.</span> <span id="s1750">He was in his class, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1751">You heard of thing.</span> <span id="s1752">Now there was another...another one from Warsaw and this one came from the...from the...from jail.</span> <span id="s1753">He was not kosher man.</span> <span id="s1754">Even in Treblinka was...Yomkiller they called.</span> <span id="s1755">They had a fight.</span> <span id="s1756">A regular fight.</span> <span id="s1757">Here you gotta fight.</span> <span id="s1758">You got entertainment and 10 feet away a bunch of people I would say maybe 200, 250 men, woman, children walking into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1759">If we could sit 2 hours more...it's very hard to describe and to tell every second, every minute and every hour or day what was going on in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1760">Treblinka wasn't a camp for work.</span> <span id="s1761">It wasn't anything.</span> <span id="s1762">Only what we people did, we worked by dead people.</span> <span id="s1763">And that was going on until the uprising in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1764">The uprising I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1765">I know a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1766">I was almost involved about it.</span> <span id="s1767">I know exactly how it happened.</span> <span id="s1768">I know who was involved.</span> <span id="s1769">The uprising was in August 1943 where the camp was liquidated.</span> <span id="s1770">Everything was liquidated and nothing is showing over there, besides what they put up...the Polish government put up just symbol stones.</span> <span id="s1771">And coming over there that I had to mention that because this is the first time...and I don't know I'm gonna go again.</span> <span id="s1772">I was there a couple months ago.</span> <span id="s1773">At that place when I went in with all my family, and I looked at the place and had arguments this and this, this and that.</span> <span id="s1774">I said, "No, this place was only a Jewish place.</span> <span id="s1775">If you say Auschwitz, if you say Buchenwald, Dachau, there were other nations which they were gassed too.</span> <span id="s1776">I cannot deny this.</span> <span id="s1777">But this place in Treblinka was strictly for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1778">Besides 3 or 4 wagons, not trains, but wagons shipped...ships, they took them in and they gassed them together with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1779">Not any other one.</span> <span id="s1780">If somebody came in, let's say what it was a Aktion against people, and they took him into the wagon and someone had business in the ghetto at the same time he didn't know because nobody knew, it could happen, 1, 5...little more, maybe a little less got in in the trap and they couldn't get out...go out for no money at all because whoever was in Treblinka, there was no way out.</span> <span id="s1781">Whatever they saw, they had to finish them up.</span> <span id="s1782">So it could be.</span> <span id="s1783">Beside that, there was no other camp which was strictly Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Now also for the story, if you say mostly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: We have to stop and pause and change tapes.</span> <span id="s1786">We'll change tapes and then we'll go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: The tape is on.</span> <span id="s1789">Before they start the tape, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1790">Treblinka?</span> <span id="s1791">Did you know Ivan the Terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1793">Yes.</span> <span id="s1794">I knew him very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s1796">We're going to go back to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1797">What can you tell me about Ivan the Terrible in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Oh, I was in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1799">I saw Ivan the Terrible.</span> <span id="s1800">I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s1801">I saw many times I did not work under his control because after liquidating the cutting the hair in Treblinka No. 2 in the gas chambers, I never went back again to Treblinka 2, so I got not involved with him, but I know him.</span> <span id="s1802">I saw him going around in the...in Treblinka No. 1 where we worked and our people from the Sort kommando and other work what the...we people did.</span> <span id="s1803">Many times I saw him and that is without hesitation it is him.</span> <span id="s1804">It is the same.</span> <span id="s1805">The same one.</span> <span id="s1806">And I got friends of mine, at least five, six of them.</span> <span id="s1807">I was together with them.</span> <span id="s1808">Every one of them recognized him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: As who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: As Ivan the Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: You talking about later, John Demyonim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: John Demyonim.</span> <span id="s1813">Yes.</span> <span id="s1814">Everyone recognized him.</span> <span id="s1815">And let me tell you, if they say that people sometime they.</span> <span id="s1816">.</span> <span id="s1817">uh... don't recognize, they forget and the other thing.</span> <span id="s1818">I was a few times as a witness in Germany against some Nazis in...uh...in...uh....</span> <span id="s1819">in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: I was a..</span> <span id="s1822">for instance, .</span> <span id="s1823">You heard the name?</span> <span id="s1824">His was in...in...uh...Frankfort.</span> <span id="s1825">There was no trial like it's going on in the other part of countries and especially the United States.</span> <span id="s1826">When I came in we were over there 10 or 12 witnesses.</span> <span id="s1827">Riceman.</span> <span id="s1828">Maybe you know the name?</span> <span id="s1829">Sam Riceman was my friend from Montreal.</span> <span id="s1830">He's not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s1831">Passed away.</span> <span id="s1832">Catholic.</span> <span id="s1833">He was from my home town.</span> <span id="s1834">Was many of them.</span> <span id="s1835">At times we were at least 12 or 14 witnesses at the trial.</span> <span id="s1836">Coming in over there, it was a different style of trial.</span> <span id="s1837">I have never seen that trial.</span> <span id="s1838">I can tell you my part.</span> <span id="s1839">I cannot tell you other parts because I wasn't there when testifying from other ones.</span> <span id="s1840">When I came in...State your name, so and so, so and so.</span> <span id="s1841">Fine.</span> <span id="s1842">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Sit down.</span> <span id="s1844">Swear.</span> <span id="s1845">Okay.</span> <span id="s1846">You know against who you are a witness?</span> <span id="s1847">I said, "Yes, I'm a witness against Joseph .</span> <span id="s1848">His name in Treblinka was .</span> <span id="s1849">And I'm here to testify it.</span> <span id="s1850">"Well, if you're going to testify, you know who the man is?"</span> <span id="s1851">"I know.</span> <span id="s1852">I worked there so many times.”</span> <span id="s1853">"Will you recognize him?"</span> <span id="s1854">I said, "Yes, I will recognize him.</span> <span id="s1855">I think so will recognize him.”</span> <span id="s1856">So they just said to me, "He is here.</span> <span id="s1857">Point your finger where he is?"</span> <span id="s1858">Now you got a mob of people between 4 or 5 hundred.</span> <span id="s1859">Civil clothes.</span> <span id="s1860">I have never seen the man in civil clothes, and also the other ones....I have never seem them.</span> <span id="s1861">Now that wasn't myself...me myself, but the minute I raised my eyes and I looked around and I saw his eyes, I said, "This is the man.”</span> <span id="s1862">You know, like you coming in and the man sits on his bench and you say again, "No, you have to point out which one it is.”</span> <span id="s1863">They called him on the witness...on the stand and I testified.</span> <span id="s1864">Now, talking about Demyonick.</span> <span id="s1865">We were 14 people forth.</span> <span id="s1866">Every one...every single one not seeing him in the military clothes, only in the civil clothes, pointed out him and recognized him.</span> <span id="s1867">You wanta tell me that man...like .</span> <span id="s1868">like , like , and more of them they worked with them for 13 months.</span> <span id="s1869">Day and night they don't recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">He...only his excuse is only...and that's the only one.</span> <span id="s1871">That's another one.</span> <span id="s1872">He is not the same.</span> <span id="s1873">For he doesn't know...he does not remember where he was those two years.</span> <span id="s1874">The same time it happened...it happened to .</span> <span id="s1875">He blinks.</span> <span id="s1876">Two years he blinks.</span> <span id="s1877">He doesn't know.</span> <span id="s1878">But we know.</span> <span id="s1879">We know.</span> <span id="s1880">We know our good friends and we know who's real.</span> <span id="s1881">We will remember all the time of our life.</span> <span id="s1882">We will remember our enemies.</span> <span id="s1883">No question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s1885">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1886">A: You are welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Tell me about...very briefly, about liberation and Czestochowa and what you and your wife did afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Oh, liberation in Czestochowa going.</span> <span id="s1889">We were liberated ourselves, January 16.</span> <span id="s1890">Going out from there we had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s1891">Luckily we went in at the night before the...we were liberated...that I escaped from over there with my wife, went into a Polish house, and the fight was going on.</span> <span id="s1892">We pretended we were Christian which I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1893">My face has a good face.</span> <span id="s1894">I mean for .</span> <span id="s1895">And we stayed in their house.</span> <span id="s1896">In the morning, one woman came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">She said, "So many people is outside.</span> <span id="s1898">I think that concentration camp people is all outside.”</span> <span id="s1899">When my wife heard this and I did also she said to me in Yiddish because she did...the woman where we were in that place and there were so more friends, neighbors, they didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1900">She said in Yiddish, "Come.”</span> <span id="s1901">I go out and I see.</span> <span id="s1902">So I went over there and I went to that friend of mine which I mentioned before, Adolf Berenski.</span> <span id="s1903">I was in his house for awhile, then I met another Pollack.</span> <span id="s1904">He said, "Abe, you gotta come to me.”</span> <span id="s1905">I went over there to him.</span> <span id="s1906">I was in his house for two days I think and then a rumor what's going on that the German is coming back.</span> <span id="s1907">So what he did he said, "Oh, Come here.</span> <span id="s1908">.</span> <span id="s1909">So I went to other friends.</span> <span id="s1910">They want...I was in Treblinka with them.</span> <span id="s1911">I went over there to them and we stayed for awhile.</span> <span id="s1912">Until we start to get together but I don't want to be too long in my home town.</span> <span id="s1913">I went back to that place, Boyden-Obersladzen, met some other friends, and I met another friend from Treblinka by the name of Borax, Gustaf Borax.</span> <span id="s1914">Maybe you heard that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">He's now an elderly man.</span> <span id="s1916">He's about 90 years old at least.</span> <span id="s1917">I hear he lives Haifa.</span> <span id="s1918">I met him.</span> <span id="s1919">We opened up a barber shop in...over there and we had a very...that was in beginning of March 1945.</span> <span id="s1920">We had a nice apartment from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1921">The apartments were empty because they...they run away.</span> <span id="s1922">They were afraid for the Russians.</span> <span id="s1923">Most of them they went on the...on the west side, because they wanted to be behind American or English instead of the Russian.</span> <span id="s1924">Any way it happened it didn't took too long, just across my barber shop was a jewelry store.</span> <span id="s1925">A man, their brother, their two sons...staying in the barber shop working over something...shots across the street came in from the ARKA.</span> <span id="s1926">They killed the son and the father.</span> <span id="s1927">The same day I came home and I said to the
