1995</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Start off by telling me your name at the time of war, and where you were born, and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name at the time of the war was Fela Yakomovich (ph) in Yiddish, and I lived in a small town called Ozerkoff (ph) in Poland.</span> <span id="s13">I was born the tenth month, the fifteenth day of 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Tell me a little bit about the town you were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: It was a small town.</span> <span id="s16">The way I understand -- I didn't know at the time but after the war, people that were older than I am told me that the population was like 15,000 all together, and almost one third of the population were Jews.</span> <span id="s17">It was a nice little town.</span> <span id="s18">We had natural springs there on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s19">There were the birchwoods and little cottages where people came in summer for vacation.</span> <span id="s20">Life was, I would say considering all the circumstances in Poland, I felt happy, because I had a good home.</span> <span id="s21">My father was by trade a jeweler and watchmaker.</span> <span id="s22">Watches he sold and repaired but jewelry which most of the time wasn't costume made, people didn't think much of costume jewelry.</span> <span id="s23">If they ordered a piece of jewelry it had to be either silver or gold, and it was ordered and my father made these things to order.</span> <span id="s24">Many times I used to stand there fascinated watching him pour the gold.</span> <span id="s25">It was just like liquid poured in a form and how he fashioned all this.</span> <span id="s26">And also the finish and the engraving.</span> <span id="s27">It was something -- he was a good craftsman.</span> <span id="s28">We were not rich.</span> <span id="s29">We did not have a home of our own.</span> <span id="s30">Where we lived was a big building, an apartment building.</span> <span id="s31">It was going from one side of the street corner into the marketplace.</span> <span id="s32">But it was one building, but the other side, because it was on the other side of the street, naturally it had a different name, this street.</span> <span id="s33">We lived on the side where it said Listopadova (ph) and the number on the street was 17.</span> <span id="s34">Upstairs we lived the business together.</span> <span id="s35">There was a lot of that in Europe -- people had combined things.</span> <span id="s36">Downstairs my grandmother had for a long time a grocery store, but in the later years she retired and naturally she came to live with us, with Grandfather.</span> <span id="s37">But Grandfather died before the war, and I think he was fortunate enough, the only one to die a natural death from the immediate family.</span> <span id="s38">I have a sister, which survived.</span> <span id="s39">I had two brothers, a mother, and my grandmother lived with us.</span> <span id="s40">I was going to school the year of 1939 -- I was not quite 13 years old, but I was through with public school, all the grades.</span> <span id="s41">I had skipped some classes, this is why I finished early.</span> <span id="s42">So that was the time of vacation in between.</span> <span id="s43">My parents tried to decide what would I go into.</span> <span id="s44">We were very Orthodox, very religious.</span> <span id="s45">My father was one of the Hasidim -- belonged to one of the Hasidic sects, it was called the Alexander Hasidim (ph).</span> <span id="s46">So, he did not want me to continue.</span> <span id="s47">Their high school, which was called gymnasium, was also a paid school.</span> <span id="s48">You did not get that free.</span> <span id="s49">It was a higher school of learning, and naturally we didn't have one in the beginning, and because we were so religious and so sheltered my father wasn't going to let me go in the big city to continue this education.</span> <span id="s50">So, what should I be doing, right?</span> <span id="s51">First my mother thought maybe I should be a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s52">I said not on your life, because you know how the apprenticeship in Europe was for a dressmaker girl?</span> <span id="s53">First, you were bound for so many years there, and the first couple years all you did is to clean her house.</span> <span id="s54">She never showed you anything.</span> <span id="s55">You had to pass this test, you know, but I had a friend that owned one of those web where -- textile, web, I don't understand how you say this machine that they made material, textile mills –</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: A loom?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: A loom, that's right.</span> <span id="s58">They did that at home.</span> <span id="s59">The textile industry was very prominent in Lodz and that spilled over to our little town because we were about only 14 kilometers from Lodz.</span> <span id="s60">Almost like a suburb.</span> <span id="s61">I used to go and visit her and watch her, after school she was doing all this and I thought it was fascinating.</span> <span id="s62">In the same street there was a factory, textile factory, the owner was Jewish and she said, "Oh he takes apprentice girls if you want to learn this trade."</span> <span id="s63">So, I don't know how I persuaded my father to let me do it, because he didn't think something like that I should go work in a factory, after all, but I said, " I am not going to go there."</span> <span id="s64">Here if he takes me in, even at the age of 13, there were no labor laws over there, so you could earn money if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s65">So, these couple months until the war came out I learned and I worked there for a while.</span> <span id="s66">I was happy because I got paid for it and I felt very important.</span> <span id="s67">Also, because I didn't continue school, we did sort of at home learn some more.</span> <span id="s68">I don't know what kind of education my father had, but he was so wise and he knew so many things that I really don't know where he learned all this.</span> <span id="s69">So, we just kept on learning from them.</span> <span id="s70">We also had a habit of reading a lot.</span> <span id="s71">Then my father was busy working and had no time to read the newspapers, my mother would sit next to him and read him aloud the newspapers and I remember her chuckling about when the world news in this paper about certain things that happened in America.</span> <span id="s72">And that's what we would call the United States, and she shook her and used to say, "Only in America things like that can happen."</span> <span id="s73">It was something unbelievable whatever it was I can't remember.</span> <span id="s74">Anyway, she was marveling at the things that were happening here, even at that time.</span> <span id="s75">So, like I said, I was sheltered.</span> <span id="s76">I was happy.</span> <span id="s77">Until this fatal day when Germany marched into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Just let me ask you one question.</span> <span id="s79">When you were reading in the newspapers were you reading about Germany and Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s81">My mother used to read and she used to be very stressed about it.</span> <span id="s82">Refugees, people from Germany, Jewish people, came through the town, and I remember that she was collecting, going around and collecting clothes for them and other things.</span> <span id="s83">We donated a lot of things to them.</span> <span id="s84">My mother could not get over it because when she was a girl going to school, quite young, the part where we lived was once Russian and once Austrian or Hungarian.</span> <span id="s85">I guess she was in grade school or whatever.</span> <span id="s86">Anyway, then she lived downstairs with my grandparents of course.</span> <span id="s87">After she came home from school she used to hang around the store and the Germans that came into the store, they were so polite, and she says, "I was a little girl and they came in they greeted me, and kissed my hand, and called me Fräulein Marta."</span> <span id="s88">That was her name, and she said, "I can't understand that those should be the same people, and that they would get so insane and follow a man, an evil man like him."</span> <span id="s89">It was unbelievable, and what we counted on is for the world to stop him.</span> <span id="s90">But it didn't happen, we know that.</span> <span id="s91">Just it seems like to her unbelievable that nobody stood up against him and let him get away with whatever he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So, you were starting to tell me how things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Well, there was a battle a little whiles away from our city.</span> <span id="s94">The city was called Kutno (ph).</span> <span id="s95">Soldiers, German soldiers were marching through there.</span> <span id="s96">And while they were marching through the city, they used to stop and do some looting and rounding also.</span> <span id="s97">Because it was so close and shrapnels were falling in the city, we all took shelter in the courtyard in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">There was a building which was a theater before the war, a movie house, so all the neighbors gathered and we slept in that building.</span> <span id="s99">We made sort of an improvised bedding, the stove was there.</span> <span id="s100">We brought our food and we slept there, but when the soldiers were marching through and trying to loot the homes, some of the Polish people pointed out where we were and made us go out there and they just took whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s101">To the end, there was nothing left to take, so the last soldiers that came up in the house and went all over the place and couldn't find anything, you know what they took?</span> <span id="s102">My father had all these accessories for fixing watches and people broke the glass on top.</span> <span id="s103">He fixed, he put all different kinds of shapes of glass for all different watches.</span> <span id="s104">They picked up handfuls and put in their pockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Just the glass, would you believe that?</span> <span id="s106">We just shook our heads and didn't know what are they going to do with this.</span> <span id="s107">The battle lasted there for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: September?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s112">They entered our city to stay -- I think what -- I don't remember the day, but according to the paper I got from my home town, it was supposed to have been September 5.</span> <span id="s113">I know they came in real early.</span> <span id="s114">The first day, 25 Jews were shot right there, on the streets.</span> <span id="s115">I don't know how they could know these people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s117">I wasn't on the street.</span> <span id="s118">I just know that would happen.</span> <span id="s119">So, you see, there was panic.</span> <span id="s120">Everybody run, hiding in their homes.</span> <span id="s121">We just sit there not knowing what would happen.</span> <span id="s122">And then again, they came into your homes and then they took household goods.</span> <span id="s123">Pillows, pictures if you had anything of value, whatever they thought they wanted, they took.</span> <span id="s124">Businesses were taken over, Jewish businesses, of course.</span> <span id="s125">On our street, there were quiet a few enterprises, there were stores, you know.</span> <span id="s126">On the left side we had a family that run a store where you bought material and made clothes, coats and clothes.</span> <span id="s127">Then the lady that took over my grandmother's store, she had a little grocery store.</span> <span id="s128">Next to it was a tinsmith, like he was fixing pots and pans and all that.</span> <span id="s129">Then was another large family that was selling pots, and pans, and sweaters, all kinds of glassware.</span> <span id="s130">Like in New York they have the Pottery Barn, and it was something like that, on a small scale.</span> <span id="s131">Farther down you had other stores.</span> <span id="s132">Across the street there were shoe stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">There were all kinds of little enterprises and everybody made a living because it was a industrial town.</span> <span id="s134">There was a couple textile factories and the rest of the population made a nice living, so that was it.</span> <span id="s135">But all of this had stopped.</span> <span id="s136">They took over city halls naturally, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s137">And from then on the orders came.</span> <span id="s138">Right away, the first days Jews were beaten on the streets, wherever you showed up.</span> <span id="s139">Our two synagogues were burned down.</span> <span id="s140">The rest of the walls that remained standing the Jewish people were forced to dismantle.</span> <span id="s141">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s142">There's not a sign left in the city of the synagogues.</span> <span id="s143">Nothing to remind you if you didn't know they were there.</span> <span id="s144">So, you see life was hard.</span> <span id="s145">Then all the rules came out.</span> <span id="s146">We could not enter any stores.</span> <span id="s147">We still lived where we did originally when the war started, but we could not enter any stores to buy any provisions.</span> <span id="s148">We were not allowed to walk on the sidewalks, only on the middle of the road.</span> <span id="s149">Later on, the arm bands came with the yellow stars.</span> <span id="s150">We had to form, like in every city a Jewish administration.</span> <span id="s151">And they had to follow orders.</span> <span id="s152">The orders came to them, they had to carry them out.</span> <span id="s153">Otherwise they come in and did twice as much damage as originally they wanted, whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s154">So, it was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Right away they demanded so many young men, single men, supposedly for labor into Germany.</span> <span id="s156">But we knew later on that it wasn't so.</span> <span id="s157">These people send us one time a post card that they were well and we should send them food.</span> <span id="s158">People did, but you know they never received and these people never survived the first couple days, that was it.</span> <span id="s159">I think they did exterminate them right away, these first transports.</span> <span id="s160">That's what we were told.</span> <span id="s161">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s162">Some of them probably went into camps.</span> <span id="s163">Like my husband, when he was grabbed on the streets of Lodz.</span> <span id="s164">He said, "I built some of the camps."</span> <span id="s165">He said, "I helped them put the walls up," so you see, some of them probably went that way and didn't survive or whatever happened.</span> <span id="s166">Anyway life was hard, we did not have enough access to medication, to real food that we needed.</span> <span id="s167">So, you see older people, babies, sick people died, lack of medication, lack of facilities too or lack of food.</span> <span id="s168">The first victims right away, and quite a few every day, quite a few.</span> <span id="s169">It was hard.</span> <span id="s170">Then if you walked down the streets, they grabbed you off the street and made you clean the roads or whatever, beating the people, making fun of them.</span> <span id="s171">Some of the religious people, the Hasidic people they caught.</span> <span id="s172">Like in every city they made them wear the prayer shawls, and run back and forth, and cut their beards off.</span> <span id="s173">It was their favorite pasttime in every city.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did this happen to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, it did not happen to my father.</span> <span id="s176">My father, actually had a small beard, very neat trimmed, you know.</span> <span id="s177">But we -- my father ended up to be almost the only one in his trade in the city, and so from the beginning on we were forced to work for them.</span> <span id="s178">The local people pointed out that he was the craftsman.</span> <span id="s179">They came in and brought all their watches to repair and of course the gold they robbed from whoever they found.</span> <span id="s180">My father had to fashion other jewelry for them which they sent home.</span> <span id="s181">Some of them not even said thank you but some of them surprisingly brought some provisions, some food, which we appreciated very much but you couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s182">You were afraid to say anything.</span> <span id="s183">You were grateful for whatever you got, no matter which source it came.</span> <span id="s184">It was hard to live and we were growing children and denied everything right away.</span> <span id="s185">It just didn't do good for our health and for our morals, because of this and trying to figure out what was going on, it was confusing.</span> <span id="s186">We just lived from day to day, not knowing what the next day will bring.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Was there any sense of normalcy?</span> <span id="s188">Did you have friends, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I had friends as long as we could, we did communicate with one another.</span> <span id="s190">But it was more dangerous.</span> <span id="s191">You were afraid to go out on the streets.</span> <span id="s192">Sometimes they just picked you off the streets and you disappeared not knowing where you went.</span> <span id="s193">So, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s194">Most people stayed close to home.</span> <span id="s195">They also liquidated the library.</span> <span id="s196">There were a lot of Jewish books in the library, so at the time of liquidation whoever was close grabbed a few books and they just made a circle around the people.</span> <span id="s197">I remember quite a few of them finding their way into our home.</span> <span id="s198">We used to read them in the evenings where we had to cover the windows that the light shouldn't be visible outside.</span> <span id="s199">We used to sit -- that was the only thing you could do is talk and read.</span> <span id="s200">You could not observe any holidays any more.</span> <span id="s201">In your own home if possibly, you could get away with it, you know.</span> <span id="s202">My father still prayed every morning and he went into the bedroom and closed the door real early in the morning.</span> <span id="s203">We were hoping nobody would come to see that, but he observed as long as he could possibly the circumstances let him do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Were you ever subject to any punishment or did you see any beatings or hangings or any sort of that brutal treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Well, I was grabbed once from the street and made to scrub school halls and they really were not dirty, it was just mean.</span> <span id="s206">A whole day long from morning till night.</span> <span id="s207">Somehow, by some miracle they let me go.</span> <span id="s208">When I came home, my parents were really upset and they thought they would never see me again.</span> <span id="s209">What happened was, yes, I saw hangings.</span> <span id="s210">One day we were marched into the marketplace.</span> <span id="s211">All of us, we had to be there.</span> <span id="s212">Sick people, even a woman that just had a child had to come with the baby there.</span> <span id="s213">All lined up, they marched in ten young Jewish men and the girls were errect and they were going to be hanged there.</span> <span id="s214">We all had to be witness, we all had to watch this.</span> <span id="s215">They claim they committed a crime against Germany by violating the curfew, supposedly stealing something, any kind of excuse to do this.</span> <span id="s216">The last minute before hanging they announced that they would let one of these men go free if the Jewish people could collect enough money to ransom him out.</span> <span id="s217">Of course we wanted to save this person.</span> <span id="s218">People gave money.</span> <span id="s219">They let one man go but this is what I always tell everybody how cruel that was because all these 10 people standing there each one of them praying and hoping he would be the one picked and be saved.</span> <span id="s220">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s221">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s222">So, life was hard, like I say.</span> <span id="s223">People were dying every day.</span> <span id="s224">We just tried to survive from one day to the next, but we know that Hitler's goal was to erase the Jewish people from Europe and if possibly he would go farther, it would be more.</span> <span id="s225">That was his goal.</span> <span id="s226">So, people were not dying fast enough even matter what they starved us and beat us, they thought the process is too slow, and to get a hold of us much faster, they wanted us in one place, so the cities, the small little places, hamlets and little cities were concentrated and each district in one large ghetto.</span> <span id="s227">We lived in our Ghetto until 1942 under these circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Now, did they move you, how did all of this take place?</span> <span id="s229">A: They told us to line up.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I have to go back because I forgot an important thing.</span> <span id="s232">Is that all right?</span> <span id="s233">Okay.</span> <span id="s234">Before we were sent to the ghetto in our home town, they still wanted to reduce the population in half in our home town before they separated us in the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s235">We were first of all we were two years in a ghetto in Ozerkoff.</span> <span id="s236">So, they wanted less people, so one day we were assembled in the school auditorium, men, women, and children.</span> <span id="s237">There were Nazis in front of us and we were told to strip naked and parade in front of them.</span> <span id="s238">They looked us over like a bunch of cattle and we were stamped like a bunch of cattle with a letter A or B.</span> <span id="s239">We were told to get dressed, go home, and wait for further orders.</span> <span id="s240">In a couple weeks or in a week, I can't remember the length of time, then we were told again to assemble in the marketplace.</span> <span id="s241">There we were surrounded by trucks, machine guns and all these Nazis and told that the people with the letter A go to one side and the people with the letter B go to the next side.</span> <span id="s242">The people with the letter B they herded on those trucks and drove them away.</span> <span id="s243">This is where my grandmother went.</span> <span id="s244">My eighty-some-year-old grandmother.</span> <span id="s245">I was told after the war that those were the first experimental gassings with the exhaust pipe in those trucks.</span> <span id="s246">So, this is how she died.</span> <span id="s247">If this is really the way it happened, it was a horrible death.</span> <span id="s248">After that we were herded.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Before we stopped the tape, you were talking about this selection.</span> <span id="s250">They took away half of the population which was marked B, what did that mean?</span> <span id="s251">Who was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Sick people, children, older people, mothers of children, those people they got rid of because they thought women with children, their children would be a hindrance.</span> <span id="s253">They couldn't work.</span> <span id="s254">The younger people they left using them for work.</span> <span id="s255">Those are the people that went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Now, just tell me when you were standing naked in front of all of these Nazis having to parade around, that must have been a very unusual experience.</span> <span id="s257">I'm wondering if it was more difficult for the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I think I was shocked because I had never seen a naked male, not even my own brothers.</span> <span id="s259">It was shocking.</span> <span id="s260">I just looked around myself and saw everybody walking ahead so I figured this is what I have to do, trying to shield yourself, you know parts of your body because it was so embarrassing.</span> <span id="s261">But they just -- they were so impersonal, just picking up that stamp going like this, you know, like canceling things out.</span> <span id="s262">This is the way it looked to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: What was the stamp?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: It was like you stamp a paper, the same kind of ink.</span> <span id="s265">They told us to be very careful to see that it doesn't erase.</span> <span id="s266">That they would be able if they wanted to check this, if it's the truth which side we are going so they would be able to check this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Where did they stamp you?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: On our bare body, up here, so we sort of walked around and slept on one side trying to see-- because ink does erase, this type of an ink, especially on your body.</span> <span id="s269">That is what we had to do.</span> <span id="s270">Now after these people were taken away, they created in our home town a ghetto in the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s271">We were surrounded by guards, like three, four families in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Of course no sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s273">I remember we had this one long bed in this little room.</span> <span id="s274">We all slept this way to have enough room to sleep, sideways you know.</span> <span id="s275">This is how we slept, and whatever provisions we got, we cooked together and shared the portions of food.</span> <span id="s276">One time they thought they did us a favor and they gave us some horse meat which was contaminated.</span> <span id="s277">People got very ill and some of them died.</span> <span id="s278">One of them was my sister.</span> <span id="s279">She was very, very ill at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: She died?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s282">But from the ghetto every morning we had to gather in front of the gates.</span> <span id="s283">They marched us out into the city to a certain destination where were worked for their industry.</span> <span id="s284">Almost all the population worked one place or another making warm shoes or we made little fur jackets from rabbit fur for the Russian front for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s285">There were different phases of doing this.</span> <span id="s286">One was the cutter, one was the pattern maker, and then the putting it together, the inspection and finally putting it in the boxes and so much had to be put out every day.</span> <span id="s287">When the day was over, we were marched back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">Naturally, we tried to make something to eat, and rest up, and somehow to communicate with your neighbors and whatever you could, if you still had the strength when it was warm outside just to walk outside and just walk a little bit, feeling a little more free than being so confined in one place.</span> <span id="s289">Of course we were not free, we were isolated, but it felt much better and this is the way we sort of communicated or associated in this little ghetto.</span> <span id="s290">But that was not -- they used to come into the ghetto and line us up and pick out people out of this line for deportation.</span> <span id="s291">Whenever they had a whim they would just come in and get people.</span> <span id="s292">I remember one time standing in this line.</span> <span id="s293">My youngest brother was behind me in between and he was so small and we found a box.</span> <span id="s294">We put him on top of the box and sort of hid this box between our legs.</span> <span id="s295">But there, I was again sick.</span> <span id="s296">I had a bad infection, I remember, on this side of my face.</span> <span id="s297">My whole side of the face was covered up with a scarf, with a white scarf and this black salve put on it.</span> <span id="s298">You could see it through and this S.S. man was walking back and forth picking out people, looking this way and that way.</span> <span id="s299">The third person from me was a brother of my friend.</span> <span id="s300">He had a big birth mark, a red one on his face and he looked at him and he said, "Out."</span> <span id="s301">And I can't understand how he walked by that many times in front of me and did not take me out of this line.</span> <span id="s302">This is something that I will never understand the rest of my life, but it happened that way.</span> <span id="s303">When I tell people, they say, "It wasn't your time to die."</span> <span id="s304">That's all I can figure out.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What about the organization of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s306">You had a Judenrot or some sort of Jewish organization that administered the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Not much of it in our home town.</span> <span id="s308">There wasn't much.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: How did you get your food, how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Rations.</span> <span id="s311">They used to send it in.</span> <span id="s312">There was some kind of administration but they were not very effective, you see.</span> <span id="s313">In the beginning before we were in the ghetto, there were representatives and an administration and you went for your food there, even for your heating material.</span> <span id="s314">Because when winter came around, we didn't -- like I said I think to you before, we did not get the regular coal.</span> <span id="s315">It was some kind of a substitute.</span> <span id="s316">It was wet and it came in blocks almost like bricks and it was called torf (ph).</span> <span id="s317">It smelled terrible when we were burning it, but we had no choice.</span> <span id="s318">This is what we used to get, but in the ghetto I don't remember really how we heated this place in winter.</span> <span id="s319">We lived like that in Ozerkoff from the end of 1940 until 1942 and this is when they decided that they want the Jewish people concentrated in one larger place.</span> <span id="s320">This way they can get a hold of us much faster.</span> <span id="s321">So, they liquidated all the little cities, and hamlets, and every district and deported the people to the larger ghettos.</span> <span id="s322">We found ourselves in the second largest ghetto in Poland, in Lodz.</span> <span id="s323">There we were taken by street car.</span> <span id="s324">There weren't that many left of us.</span> <span id="s325">You can imagine that we fit in a row of street cars there and walking in the line to those street cars, you always have to line up.</span> <span id="s326">By some miracle that these people who lived a little distance from us, the father, the family was intact and the man was blind.</span> <span id="s327">So, he was like in front of me walking but he couldn't see exactly to keep in line, so his movement was like moving out of the line, and the Nazi walking next to us thought he was trying to escape and he shot him dead.</span> <span id="s328">And another man and my father carried this dead man into the street car and carry him along into Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">So, we arrived in Lodz and the place called Baluter-Mark (ph), Balutzkerinek (ph) in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">There we were all lined up and we were told to give up all the gold or whatever we have because if they would search us it would be much worse.</span> <span id="s331">So, anyway, everyone gave up everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: How much did you take with you to Lodz in terms of personal --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Just personal belongings that's all you could take, but sometimes people took on themselves, on their person, jewelry.</span> <span id="s334">You know no matter how much they searched, some people smuggled it through.</span> <span id="s335">They risked their life, but people did that.</span> <span id="s336">So, then, we were marched into the ghetto assigned to a place to live, also with several people.</span> <span id="s337">The first we lived on a street called Linarskenein (ph), but that was just like a weigh-station because we had no place to go and we sort of slept on the floor there even.</span> <span id="s338">There wasn't even a bunk bed or anything.</span> <span id="s339">Later on, this other room, these two rooms got vacant and me and another family were assigned to this street.</span> <span id="s340">It was called Berkayoselovicha (ph) and we lived on that street.</span> <span id="s341">Each one of us has to be assigned to a work place, and there what would you call the work places were called in Lodz, "resorts."</span> <span id="s342">This is what they called them.</span> <span id="s343">I don't know for what reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Who assigned you?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I don't know, I think the Jewish Admin -- or wherever.</span> <span id="s346">They wanted us to work.</span> <span id="s347">This is where they send.</span> <span id="s348">Each one of us got a Russian card and the provisions were -- the only time you could get your provisions was after a whole day's work.</span> <span id="s349">Then you stood in line, I don't know how long just to get even your loaf of bread or the other provisions.</span> <span id="s350">Sometimes people fainted dead away, in these lines, but we had no choice, you see Ghetto Lodz had thousands of people, not only from Poland, but they had people from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s351">It was confusing.</span> <span id="s352">At the same time they were shipping us in from all over, they were deporting people from Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s353">It was like coming and going, coming and going every single day.</span> <span id="s354">It wasn't safe on the street.</span> <span id="s355">You never knew if you went to the destination of your work if you'd return because they could grab you on the street and just cart you away.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: That was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">Of course the leader of the Lodz Ghetto was Haim Rumkosky (ph).</span> <span id="s359">He was the king.</span> <span id="s360">Everyone knows that.</span> <span id="s361">He even had money printed and I think his picture was on it.</span> <span id="s362">That much I don't -- but I know it would have to be that way.</span> <span id="s363">He taught -- this ghetto would be forever because we did such important work for the German government.</span> <span id="s364">Military orders and whatnot all, so for the time being he thought we were safe.</span> <span id="s365">What was safe there?</span> <span id="s366">I wasn't safe.</span> <span id="s367">First of all we were hungry.</span> <span id="s368">What they gave us wasn't enough to live on.</span> <span id="s369">People were dying, hundreds every day.</span> <span id="s370">Some managed to bury the people on their own, but some of them couldn't so they were buried -- they came down and picked up the dead bodies in a bag and buried them in one grave.</span> <span id="s371">It was hard walking down the street.</span> <span id="s372">There were some children that by miracle survived, and still were in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s373">And you saw them standing on the streets, raggedy, swollen, hungry, asking for food.</span> <span id="s374">Who had anything to give them?</span> <span id="s375">We were starving ourselves, but it was something hard to take, even when you were hungry because you felt I can't do anything.</span> <span id="s376">You felt helpless.</span> <span id="s377">And we lived there for two years, but in between there, like I said, there were called deportations, different phases.</span> <span id="s378">It was called lists, so they send lists, they send the order to the administration.</span> <span id="s379">They wanted that many young people, let's say single people, the oldest from the family, supposedly for labor.</span> <span id="s380">So the administration had to make a list who should be going to these deportations.</span> <span id="s381">That was called the "Time of the Lists."</span> <span id="s382">Then there was the time of the shpera (ph).</span> <span id="s383">They sealed off the streets and they came in with the trucks and just grabbed people out from the homes and took them away.</span> <span id="s384">They also, I think, came several times to the hospitals and took people out.</span> <span id="s385">But despite of all this, there was -- people were determined to normalize this life.</span> <span id="s386">I know for a fact that there were several organizations, several culture places.</span> <span id="s387">Of course I never went because my parents were too protective.</span> <span id="s388">After I came home from work, they were so afraid that something would happen to us if we go out, that they just did not permit us to join any of these things.</span> <span id="s389">But I know that there were cultural events held and people even went like to schools.</span> <span id="s390">It was forbidden of course.</span> <span id="s391">It was like in hiding, but it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Who was organizing all these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I think there were teachers there and other people that were capable to do that.</span> <span id="s394">Q: Was there an actual underground or resistance organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Lodz -- I don't know if there was much underground.</span> <span id="s396">You see Lodz Ghetto was a little different than let's say for instance Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s397">It was sealed much tighter and it was hard to get out.</span> <span id="s398">We had little communication with the outside world.</span> <span id="s399">That's why it was harder to do anything.</span> <span id="s400">Even less heroic what Warsaw Ghetto did.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did people have radios?</span> <span id="s402">Did you have any idea what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: We knew.</span> <span id="s404">We didn't have a radio, but someone must have because news came filtering through to us.</span> <span id="s405">We knew what was going on on the fronts.</span> <span id="s406">You see, we heard that the Russians were advancing and the Allies were bombing, but because we were in such terrible situation, and because my father always said that this war was going to be a lightning war.</span> <span id="s407">He used to say in German, a blitzkrieg, because of all the technology and the air warfare, this war was going to end fast, but it didn't.</span> <span id="s408">You see, it dragged on and that's why when all these news kept on infiltrating into the ghetto, we listened to it, hoping but somehow it sounded unbelievable that Hitler is being defeated or he is losing a battle because he is so almighty and look what he was doing to us.</span> <span id="s409">We were helpless and we could not defend ourselves, so it was do we believe or do we not believe what we are hearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: You talk about the deportations.</span> <span id="s411">Let's take the first period, that "Time of the Lists."</span> <span id="s412">Was there any logic to who was getting deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Of course, people you mean from Lodz, the original people who lived in Lodz or what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Well, what segments of the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s416">They took, let's say, my sister had a friend who's parents were taken away at home.</span> <span id="s417">She was alone.</span> <span id="s418">She was single.</span> <span id="s419">There was no family there so they used to take single people first like that.</span> <span id="s420">Then young able bodied people because they told them these people are going for labor into Germany.</span> <span id="s421">But you see, those people really disappeared.</span> <span id="s422">There's not a trace of these people left that went with the lists.</span> <span id="s423">They were all exterminated, and we know that for a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What about -- the lists, I assume, were made up by Rumkosky and his -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: What about old people, sick people, children --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, these were naturally deported.</span> <span id="s427">These were deported.</span> <span id="s428">Sick people and old people had not place in Hitler's programs.</span> <span id="s429">They were not useful at all.</span> <span id="s430">They go first because they can't even work.</span> <span id="s431">He worked us to death.</span> <span id="s432">That's what he wanted anyway, but in the meanwhile, we were young, and we were healthy and we were useful.</span> <span id="s433">So, we survived as long as they felt that they can work us to death.</span> <span id="s434">At least they have something out of us.</span> <span id="s435">But older people, sick people, were of no use to them, so naturally those people were exterminated right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Were there regular selections on the streets that you saw or you were a part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Not in Lodz, I have not seen that.</span> <span id="s438">I just know of -- yes, because my sister's friend went, you know, with those lists, she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you ever see or hear Rumkosky?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: He drove by once in this horse and buggy carriage.</span> <span id="s441">This was the only transportation, sitting like a king there.</span> <span id="s442">He was grey and old at that time already and thinking God knows who he is.</span> <span id="s443">You know, it was like a man of life and death almost.</span> <span id="s444">Some people say -- after the war we had one time a discussion in Milwaukee after we saw the film about Lodz Ghetto, we had a discussion about Rumkosky and some people said that he was forced to do what he was doing, but I don't see it that way.</span> <span id="s445">Me, personally, I don't see it that way.</span> <span id="s446">Because if he would have been forced to do it, he would have a different attitude than what he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: What was his attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Like he was the king and he was going to last forever and rule this kingdom here because he's so safe and secure because we are doing such a job for Germany that they can't do without us.</span> <span id="s449">That was his main idea, that that's why we are safe, but no Jew was safe in Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s450">We know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Tell me about the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, there were different places of work.</span> <span id="s453">My father was assigned to a shop called the machine shop, repaired their sewing machines and all other instruments which were shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s454">My brother, my older brother worked in a steel shop.</span> <span id="s455">My sister worked in a place called Marishean (ph), and that they were making straw shoes.</span> <span id="s456">The method of making is really interesting.</span> <span id="s457">They bought all these stacks of straw.</span> <span id="s458">They lined them up on the ground next to their feet, put water on it, and they had to stamp on the straw to make it softer.</span> <span id="s459">Then they used to braid the straw with their hands and shape them into shoes for the soldiers on the front.</span> <span id="s460">And she always used to come home with bleeding hands from this job.</span> <span id="s461">My little brother, I exactly don't remember where he worked, would you believe it.</span> <span id="s462">I know that he went to work every day and I worked in a place where they were embroidering emblems for the uniforms.</span> <span id="s463">My mother had brought-home work.</span> <span id="s464">There was such a thing.</span> <span id="s465">It was called in Polish halumintzfau (ph).</span> <span id="s466">She could bring the work home.</span> <span id="s467">She was tearing all kinds of rags apart, making strips, braiding the strips and fashioning rugs.</span> <span id="s468">What they needed that for, I have no idea, but that's what she was doing and every day she had to make a certain amount and deliver it the same day.</span> <span id="s469">So that was the work we were doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did you have any sense that women were treated differently than men in terms of --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s472">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s473">We all had to work.</span> <span id="s474">I think that maybe the men did some more hard physical labor than the women, but I can't tell you exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: But you didn't feel different.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, no I did not.</span> <span id="s477">As far as deportations and treatment like that, we were all treated equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">That's the way I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: In the factories or the "resorts," were you ever aware of efforts to kind of sabotage the production of hunger strikes or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No, no, maybe in different places where people were things might have happened, but where I worked I never encountered, and people did not there go on hunger strikes.</span> <span id="s481">We were at the point of starvation and I don't think people could last two or three days if you went on a hunger strike.</span> <span id="s482">That's the way I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: You were at home with your family at night?</span> <span id="s484">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Do you remember what you talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Always trying -- first of all we were trying to put food on the table.</span> <span id="s487">Then you tried to keep clean, which was a hard thing to do.</span> <span id="s488">Washing clothes was a task within itself, because we had no water.</span> <span id="s489">You had to walk like almost a half a mile with a pail to get water.</span> <span id="s490">Then you had this board that you rubbed on and you boiled the clothes on top of the stove if you possibly could.</span> <span id="s491">That was another chore which required a lot of time.</span> <span id="s492">But sometimes before the curfew set in, we had some neighbors that were from our home town that used to come over and just sort of talk things over.</span> <span id="s493">My father was always the one very optimistic, thinking that this will end soon and that he hoped to be alive when this happened.</span> <span id="s494">But it didn't happen that way.</span> <span id="s495">He didn't live to see that.</span> <span id="s496">Slowly though, he did repair work at home.</span> <span id="s497">Somehow he got some instruments.</span> <span id="s498">He was repairing watches in the house.</span> <span id="s499">People in the ghetto, believe it not, some of them could afford to do that.</span> <span id="s500">Sometimes they paid and money was helpful because every place no matter how much you starve there is always a little market where you could buy for higher prices something to help yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Even in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Even in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s503">One day one of the Jewish policemen, the ghetto policemen and said to my father he's being summoned to Gestapo headquarters on Bolitzkerenik (ph), and we thought what did my father do?</span> <span id="s504">He will never come back alive, you know.</span> <span id="s505">But you see, before they took all the -- took us out of Ozerkoff Ghetto, we all had to register that you were a tradesman or whatever, they looked through this list and summoned my father to do some work for them.</span> <span id="s506">When he came back it was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s507">He came back with work, watches to repair and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s508">And they walked him back, the Jewish police, back there when he was done with his work to return the work.</span> <span id="s509">And would you believe that now and then some of them would give him some food for the work, even those Gestapo people?</span> <span id="s510">It was amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What kind of food did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Bread.</span> <span id="s513">Bread was the staple.</span> <span id="s514">Bread was something we craved.</span> <span id="s515">Bread was something that I dreamed of.</span> <span id="s516">We always said someday -- in the camps where I was, we always used to say we didn't dream about eating cake or meat or whatever.</span> <span id="s517">We used to say if ever the time comes all I want is a loaf of bread and eat enough that I feel my stomach is full.</span> <span id="s518">This is what we want, just a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s519">So, bread was very important, to the point we were starving so much that sometimes when a person died in a family in the ghetto, they did not report him for a couple days so that they could pick up the bread ration and help themselves for a little bit.</span> <span id="s520">So, you can imagine how desperate you were and how hungry you were to go to such measures to get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Was that it?</span> <span id="s522">Did you eat anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They gave us potatoes.</span> <span id="s524">Certain other stuff, whatever was available.</span> <span id="s525">Sometimes they gave us canned food, canned meat, but that was called, you had to be at work every day.</span> <span id="s526">They made a day when if you were at work that day, they picked at random a day and if you were there, it was called in German the schteichtag (ph).</span> <span id="s527">If you happened to be working that day, you could get a portion of that conserved meat, and it was mostly horse meat anyway.</span> <span id="s528">That was the treat of a lifetime, I'm telling you.</span> <span id="s529">They gave us vegetables, a lot of carrots.</span> <span id="s530">And those white carrots, you know, those long big, I don't know what they were called here, but we called them white carrots.</span> <span id="s531">They had the shape of a carrot and we ate a lot of that.</span> <span id="s532">So, all different kind of staples that they felt weren't really -- beyond their dignity to eat, you know, they just brought into the ghetto and we got a certain amount of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Did you work every day?</span> <span id="s534">A: Yes, except Sunday, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What did you do on the day you didn't work?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Cleaned, did our clothes or tried maybe to go outside and see what's going on if you ventured, it you dared to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: You had mentioned to me that there was some little ponceon (ph) or someplace where workers could go?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s539">You were rewarded if you were a good worker and you made enough production in the ghetto, and the foreman was favorable to you, they had also foremen there, you know, the one that told you what to do, then you were rewarded.</span> <span id="s540">There was a place like sanatorium and you were rewarded with seven days to go to this sanatorium to rest up.</span> <span id="s541">One of my family, my older brother which was younger than I am, but he was the older of the brothers, he got rewarded and he went for seven days there.</span> <span id="s542">When he came back he told us how wonderful it was to get three meals a day and to be able to rest and all of us in the ghetto dreamed about going there even for such a short while and being treated like that.</span> <span id="s543">So, there were a lot of songs in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s544">People were making up songs about Rumkosky in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s545">A couple words I do remember in Yiddish, and then there was this song about the Heime (ph).</span> <span id="s546">That we sung in Polish.</span> <span id="s547">We always made up songs, Yiddish or Polish so a couple songs, those couple verses about Rumkosky I remember and a couple verses from that Heime.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Can you sing or say them?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, I won't sing, but if you want me to say.</span> <span id="s550">First about Rumkosky.</span> <span id="s551">Okay, it was like this.</span> <span id="s552">"Rumkosky, Haim..." (speaking Yiddish).</span> <span id="s553">I don't know whoever understands this.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Can you just in a sentence or two just tell me what it's about?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s556">Rumkosky, Haim is a very good man.</span> <span id="s557">He will still treat us, we will eat rolls with butter.</span> <span id="s558">This will be our treat and what can we do?</span> <span id="s559">We Jews, what can we do?</span> <span id="s560">It's a terrible thing that happened to us,what can we do, that we are hungry and our stomach demands food every single day.</span> <span id="s561">It doesn't understand about the situation and about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s562">The stomach demands the food.</span> <span id="s563">So, in Yiddish it sounds a little different.</span> <span id="s564">It has a better meaning, but everything loses in translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What was the other song?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: The other song was in Polish.</span> <span id="s567">Do you want me to say it in Polish?</span> <span id="s568">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: (Speaking Polish).</span> <span id="s570">Q: What was it about?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: It was at the end of the city stands this place called the Heime and it's a jail without bars.</span> <span id="s572">I would like to be there for many years.</span> <span id="s573">There is this guy called the director, the commissar, they come and entertain you and they give you food to eat.</span> <span id="s574">This is the dream of the ghetto that you dream from day to day and living from day to day this is what we dream.</span> <span id="s575">Only I am very sad that this, what I'm having here is only for seven days, a short seven days, that it couldn't go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Even though you said that you couldn't go out, your father wouldn't let you go out at night, but I mean, did you have a sense that there was a humor and a camaraderie in the midst of all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: There was.</span> <span id="s578">I think people were meeting.</span> <span id="s579">They had certain organizations.</span> <span id="s580">I think there was even little entertainment probably.</span> <span id="s581">I was not aware of it because of that reason.</span> <span id="s582">But I know there was some culture in Lodz Ghetto, of course.</span> <span id="s583">We all tried -- people tried to resist this drudgery and this ghetto and tried to make something normal out of it so we could exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">You see, with us, it was again being in the evening home and talking if you didn't have anything to read, it was just oral support.</span> <span id="s585">My father knew a lot of stories.</span> <span id="s586">He was a good story teller, and my little brother, he was a natural.</span> <span id="s587">After he came home from this resort, before my mother made the supper and it was light enough, he used to go out there in the corner and meet some other little boys and he used to spin stories out of his head and everybody ran after him and used to say "Yankele, tell us another story, please tell us another story," and it was just so exciting to them.</span> <span id="s588">That little boy, I think, not because it was my brother, but if he would have grown up, he would have been a genius he was so smart.</span> <span id="s589">It was unbelievable because he went to a religious school, at home because he wore all the Hasidic garb, and the director of the public school was trying to persuade my father he should let him go to the public school because he's such a smart boy, he would have loved to have him there.</span> <span id="s590">But you see, like I said, boys, Polish boys a lot of them were anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">My father said to him, "I understand in the class you can see that no harm would happen to him because the way he looks, but if recess time and the kids go outside, you can't be everyplace and shield him from all the beatings or whatever things would happen out there."</span> <span id="s592">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Were you aware of in the Lodz Ghetto, various social welfare efforts, medical stations or soup kitchens?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: There were infirmaries and so-called hospitals.</span> <span id="s596">There were also soup kitchens, but we never got food out of the soup kitchen like soups directly.</span> <span id="s597">What I think is people that didn't work or sick people that they got help from the soup kitchens.</span> <span id="s598">The only thing that we got from the soup kitchens that other like people like us that stood in line waiting for the potato peelings to be thrown out.</span> <span id="s599">We brought big sacks home, washed these potato peelings, ground them with a meat grinder, and we made potato pancakes out it.</span> <span id="s600">And sometimes when we didn't get enough, if you happened to have coffee grounds left over, you mixed the coffee grounds with the potato peelings so you had something more to eat.</span> <span id="s601">I remember eating that.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Did it taste good?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: It tasted delicious at that time.</span> <span id="s604">One time we got raw oatmeal.</span> <span id="s605">What a treat, and a little bit of oil and brown sugar.</span> <span id="s606">A ration that was very unusual to get in the ghetto, so you mixed a little oatmeal, a little bit of oil and brown sugar and we ate it like that.</span> <span id="s607">I kept on saying, "Oh how delicious is this.</span> <span id="s608">Why didn't I ever think before the war to eat something like that?"</span> <span id="s609">Anything was delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I bet you didn't eat it after the war?</span> <span id="s611">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: How long were you in Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Two years, from 1942 to 1944.</span> <span id="s614">1944 was the year when they started liquidating the Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s615">You see, most of the other ghettos were liquidated already.</span> <span id="s616">It seems like we were almost the last ones.</span> <span id="s617">1944 slowly they made up, the Gestapo asked every day so many people have to be resettled, they said, for labor.</span> <span id="s618">The ghetto has to be liquidated and the people will be resettled.</span> <span id="s619">So they demanded so many people every day for these deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Did you know where they were being resettled?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s622">You know, there were whispers, terrible whispers, about places like that, about shooting people.</span> <span id="s623">But it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s624">We just somehow couldn't understand that one human being was capable of doing something like that to another human being no matter who he was.</span> <span id="s625">How can people do this?</span> <span id="s626">So it was like unbelievable.</span> <span id="s627">Maybe they're making more of it than it really is.</span> <span id="s628">Fooling ourselves, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s629">So, up to the point with the lists and the sealing off the streets, these deportations they dragged people out but here they didn't want to bother anymore with that.</span> <span id="s630">They didn't want to put a lot of effort in this.</span> <span id="s631">So to the end after the first people, they announced that every family that would come quick would receive, each person will receive a loaf of bread and some jam.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Who made this announcement?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: It came through the Jewish Administration from the Gestapo that this is what we'll receive.</span> <span id="s634">So, people went.</span> <span id="s635">A loaf of bread was magic.</span> <span id="s636">People went.</span> <span id="s637">There was no more like, hesitance.</span> <span id="s638">No more trying to hide any place.</span> <span id="s639">People went and in the beginning we sort of tried to, like moving to the back of the line.</span> <span id="s640">You know, when you stand in a line.</span> <span id="s641">We tried, but finally there was no way we could avoid it.</span> <span id="s642">So, one time they also told us to take personal belongings.</span> <span id="s643">Make bundles and take along, of course we're only going for resettlement.</span> <span id="s644">You know that.</span> <span id="s645">So, we made some bundles, each one of us clutching that loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s646">We reported for deportation.</span> <span id="s647">We were taken into a train depot where all these cattle cars were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s648">So many people counted up in one of the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s649">I really don't remember the exact count, 60, 70, I don't know.</span> <span id="s650">I just know we were packed in there like herring.</span> <span id="s651">One pail thrown on the floor for all our humanly needs and the doors were shut.</span> <span id="s652">The train started moving and panic right there.</span> <span id="s653">People were crying.</span> <span id="s654">People were screaming and it was hysterics because what's going on?</span> <span id="s655">What will happen?</span> <span id="s656">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s657">You could hardly sit unless you sat between somebody else's legs.</span> <span id="s658">The movement of the train and people needing to relieve themselves by the time this pail filled up and started sloshing around all that stuff, you can imagine the smell and the situation in that wagon.</span> <span id="s659">We traveled the whole night through, and when it got to be light outside, the train slowed down.</span> <span id="s660">There was always a little window, even in a cattle car, so the man next to it tried to peek out and see where are we going to because it was slowing down real fast.</span> <span id="s661">He turned around and said, "Oh, I can see barbed wire.</span> <span id="s662">It's some kind of a camp.</span> <span id="s663">People in striped uniforms busily walking back and forth.</span> <span id="s664">Hey, maybe we really did come for resettlement and for work," trying to console ourselves and giving a little bit of courage to what was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s665">Finally when the train stopped these same people, the prisoners from there, they were the ones that came to the wagons when the door was open to guide us into the camp to tell us what to do.</span> <span id="s666">The bundles were left standing there.</span> <span id="s667">They told us they would bring it to our places.</span> <span id="s668">It has our name on it, of course they will know where to look for us.</span> <span id="s669">There were three dead people on the wagon while we were coming out.</span> <span id="s670">We didn't realize that they didn't survive the journey.</span> <span id="s671">Women and men were separated and told to line up in five and move forward each one of holding still the rest of that bread.</span> <span id="s672">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s673">Where did we come to?</span> <span id="s674">Someone whispered next to me to this prisoner, "Hey, what is this place?</span> <span id="s675">Where did we come to?"</span> <span id="s676">He said, "You're in Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s677">Okay, we knew of atrocities but the names of the camps we didn't know.</span> <span id="s678">It didn't ring a bell.</span> <span id="s679">We didn't know what Auschwitz was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Looking forward to the gate to walk in, we saw the sign, the famous sign that said in German Arbeit Macht Frei, English, work makes you free.</span> <span id="s681">Big joke.</span> <span id="s682">My father, my two brothers on the other side in the line.</span> <span id="s683">My mother, my sister and I in one side and two more people.</span> <span id="s684">Always in five.</span> <span id="s685">That was their military thing, lining up in five.</span> <span id="s686">Moving forward and my brother was on one end on the edge and I was on the other looking over to him.</span> <span id="s687">He said to me, "Why do you just hold the bread?</span> <span id="s688">Eat some of it.</span> <span id="s689">You need your strength.</span> <span id="s690">We're only going to showers and we'll meet again."</span> <span id="s691">I still didn't.</span> <span id="s692">I looked at him, and that was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s693">I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s694">That was it.</span> <span id="s695">So, anyway, we moved forward.</span> <span id="s696">Finally we came in front of these S.S. with their canes, sort of like batons pointing to the left, to the right.</span> <span id="s697">My mother was in the middle.</span> <span id="s698">She was dragged out right away.</span> <span id="s699">I still remember what she was wearing.</span> <span id="s700">A beige sweater and a blue dress with little flowers.</span> <span id="s701">She looked back, but we could do nothing.</span> <span id="s702">He dragged her out and pointed to the left.</span> <span id="s703">My sister was told to go to the right.</span> <span id="s704">When I stepped forward he looked at me hesitating, saying in German, "How old are you?"</span> <span id="s705">I could not speak I was so stunned.</span> <span id="s706">I couldn't -- it didn't register what was going on here, not at all.</span> <span id="s707">I couldn't figure out what was going on here.</span> <span id="s708">So my sister standing on the side said, "Oh she's old enough.</span> <span id="s709">She can work.</span> <span id="s710">She's strong."</span> <span id="s711">I don't know why she said that.</span> <span id="s712">We didn't know which side is good which side is bad.</span> <span id="s713">She just said that by instinct, you know.</span> <span id="s714">So, he stood hesitated and pushed me towards her.</span> <span id="s715">Over there again, we had to line up moving forward closer towards the shower.</span> <span id="s716">Before we entered we had -- walking farther down the line we were told to strip naked and this on line always in five they looked us over again, anyone that had a birth mark or a scar from surgery or some women if they were middle age that survived the first selection and had some wrinkles on their body, were also taken out of this line.</span> <span id="s717">From then, before they took us into the shower, they shaved the hair on our bodies.</span> <span id="s718">Every place a person has hair has been shaved.</span> <span id="s719">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s720">My sister was standing next to me and I didn't really know who she was.</span> <span id="s721">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s722">We had to call out to each other to realize who we were.</span> <span id="s723">Then in these shower stalls, so-called shower stalls, a couple drips of water came down, running to the other side each one of us were given a dress.</span> <span id="s724">And what they did usually, on purpose, as the tall persons got a small dress and a small person like me got a huge dress.</span> <span id="s725">There was a problem which we did ourselves adjust exchanging the clothes between ourselves.</span> <span id="s726">From there they lined us up again of course in five, marched into an open field and told to sit down.</span> <span id="s727">We were surrounded and guarded by women, hardened criminals that were there I think for a couple of years, and they were the so-called kapos.</span> <span id="s728">And they had canes, walking around with these canes and making sure we sit in an orderly line of five on the ground, on the bare ground there in an open field.</span> <span id="s729">Well, the air was heavy there , but seeing so many people, we thought maybe it comes from some kind of an industry.</span> <span id="s730">There are so many people, someone must be doing some work.</span> <span id="s731">So, this is what we always thought, but they straightened us out.</span> <span id="s732">Trying to move to warm ourselves one and another's bodies because it was a very raw day, windy, and Auschwitz is not so far away from the Carpethian Mountains so the air is always sharper.</span> <span id="s733">We were called.</span> <span id="s734">They screamed at us and called us a bunch of cattle, pointing out to those big chimneys, that smoke, black smoke was belching out of there and saying, "You're not worth anything anyway.</span> <span id="s735">Tomorrow this is what's going to left of you.</span> <span id="s736">Look up there, you see this?</span> <span id="s737">This is what is going to be left of you."</span> <span id="s738">So you can imagine how we felt, but still somehow, it didn't penetrate.</span> <span id="s739">We didn't really and truly realize in what kind of a situation we were.</span> <span id="s740">We were numb.</span> <span id="s741">Dehumanized there already at this point.</span> <span id="s742">So, we just sat there.</span> <span id="s743">Somehow it didn't happen that way.</span> <span id="s744">In the morning, they lined us up and marched into a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you stay in this field overnight?</span> <span id="s746">A: Yes, on the field we sat all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: I just need to clarify one other thing.</span> <span id="s748">Do you remember what month this was in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I think it was the end of August.</span> <span id="s750">So, they marched us into a barrack.</span> <span id="s751">There were 500 women of us, always, in this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: All from Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes, from the ghetto, we were all women out of the Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s754">Naturally some of them were not natives of Lodz City, like I, from all different little places, and even some of them from different parts, from different countries, that happened to be deported into the Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s755">We had one woman we called "the Francisca."</span> <span id="s756">She was originally French and was deported there and she used to swear in French something terrible, and she was mad after a while, but the others were mainly from Poland and the same place.</span> <span id="s757">So many women assigned to one bunk, just plain, bare bunks and another one of those prisoners ruling the barrack, and she was -- her title was the Blockova (ph).</span> <span id="s758">A barrack was called a block and she was the Blockova.</span> <span id="s759">She ruled this place like a queen.</span> <span id="s760">You had to do everything according to what she told you.</span> <span id="s761">You could not on your own go and relieve yourself if you had to do it.</span> <span id="s762">Only when she told you it was time.</span> <span id="s763">Some people could not control themselves, and she used to beat with that cane people half dead almost.</span> <span id="s764">With the rest of the barracks, every morning when it was still dark out there, we were lined up and counted.</span> <span id="s765">The German tzail-a-pelle (ph).</span> <span id="s766">You could stand there for hours if they thought the count wasn't right.</span> <span id="s767">It could rain, it could storm, and we had to stand there and be counted and be sure we were all there.</span> <span id="s768">At noon, we were lined up again, always lined up.</span> <span id="s769">Five women were handed a bowl, some soup in that bowl.</span> <span id="s770">We did not get any spoons so we had to count swallows and be sure we didn't take too many swallows to it would be enough for all the five of us.</span> <span id="s771">That was the thing.</span> <span id="s772">We were there for several days, I really don't know exactly how many, but let me tell you, every day was like eternity, it was never thinking that we would ever get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: You didn't work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No.</span> <span id="s775">I don't know if it's true, but after the war, the assumption was that the end of 1944 they were bringing in people for extermination at such rate that the gas chambers could not accommodate them.</span> <span id="s776">You see, we were marked strictly for extermination because we did not get any tattoos anymore.</span> <span id="s777">That was the thing.</span> <span id="s778">So, people were just sitting piled up waiting their turn and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s779">We were just sitting in these barracks like waiting out turn to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s780">And somehow one morning at the tzail-a-pelle they took this whole group of 500 women from this block, drove us into a shower, gave us some more clothes, some wooden shoes, underwear different dress, a little portion of bread and again into a cattle train.</span> <span id="s781">There were less of us in each train, we had more room, a pail for our needs.</span> <span id="s782">The train started moving again.</span> <span id="s783">A couple stations I remember they stopped opened up this door and the S.S. man that guarded us told us we could empty that pail, so we figured that's better treatment than what we had before.</span> <span id="s784">We traveled several hours and final destination we ended up in the city of Hamburg, but our camp where we dwelled was outside of the city in a place called Tzazel (ph) and the station where we traveled into the city for work was called Popinville (ph).</span> <span id="s785">The camp was Tzazel.</span> <span id="s786">It was a sub camp of Noyagomen (ph).</span> <span id="s787">There we were assigned to barracks.</span> <span id="s788">The barracks were much smaller and every morning of course we lined up again for tzail-a-pelle.</span> <span id="s789">After that, we were released back and took turns going to pick up the ration of bread for the whole day.</span> <span id="s790">I remember we were in a real -- I and my sister found ourselves in a real small barrack.</span> <span id="s791">There were about 15 women only there, which was very lucky.</span> <span id="s792">It was unusual, so we took turns.</span> <span id="s793">Every day another woman went out and brought the bread which we divided by some miracle we found a string.</span> <span id="s794">We had to see that it was the same so we made a measure out of that string and cut the bread accordingly so each one had the same amount.</span> <span id="s795">Coffee, they gave us something warm to drink, the so-called coffee.</span> <span id="s796">It was slop, but we didn't have any other utensil except the pail that we used during the night for our needs because there was a curfew after a certain time in the camp and we could not even go to the latrine.</span> <span id="s797">So, whoever's turn it was to go get the provision, emptied the pail, swished it out with cold water and this is where we brought the coffee.</span> <span id="s798">And this is what we did drink from.</span> <span id="s799">You can imagine how dehumanized we were.</span> <span id="s800">It didn't matter where this stuff came from, as long as you could keep warm, as long as you could fill your stomach.</span> <span id="s801">That's what it mattered.</span> <span id="s802">The conditions were a little better in this camp.</span> <span id="s803">On the weekend, on Sundays we could wash our clothes.</span> <span id="s804">Naturally we had nothing else, so we walked around in our coats, the so-called coats they gave us, our underwear and dress were washed and hung out or in winter by that little stove that we had and dried it out and if it didn't dry in winter good enough by the time we had to put it on, we had to put it on the way it was.</span> <span id="s805">It just dried up on you.</span> <span id="s806">Wooden shoes, every morning we were divided into groups, certain people stayed right there in Tzazel.</span> <span id="s807">They were marched to Popinville and they were digging foundations for little houses they built for people that were bombed out in the big cities.</span> <span id="s808">But it seems like I was always the unfortunate one traveling into the city of Hamburg and my job was cleaning the rubble from the streets, from the bombs that destroyed the homes.</span> <span id="s809">We had to clean up the rubble on the streets, put it in wheelbarrows and push it into a certain destination.</span> <span id="s810">That was the beginning of 1945.</span> <span id="s811">At that time already when the Allies started bombing day and night, Hamburg, of course Hamburg was an important harbor city, so their aim was to destroy anything that was of importance to the Germans.</span> <span id="s812">Three, four times, even sometimes five times a day they came.</span> <span id="s813">We worked in a place called in German the Heileche-gaistvelt (ph), and it was a radar station right next to us.</span> <span id="s814">Everytime you could hear the little house up there, that radar turning and beeping, we knew that the Allies were coming to bomb.</span> <span id="s815">And it was funny, when the first alarm sounded for the Germans to take cover, the population, we watched them run with their suitcases and their buggies and their children and a great panic trying to hide before this disaster.</span> <span id="s816">We looked at one another and we were laughing because this did not represent this big superman race.</span> <span id="s817">They were scared.</span> <span id="s818">They were just like you and</span></p> <p><span id="s819">I.</span> <span id="s820">They were afraid to die, you know, so and now finally they came to the realization that Hitler cannot save them in any other way.</span> <span id="s821">It gave us great satisfaction.</span> <span id="s822">The only thing we didn't know if you ever live to see.</span> <span id="s823">We knew that Hitler was losing the war.</span> <span id="s824">Seeing the situation in the city, we knew he could not win this war, but if he ever would be alive to see that, that was a big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Did you have any contact with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, you mean the German people?</span> <span id="s827">No.</span> <span id="s828">One time, only while we marched in the middle of the road to work, some German woman walked up to the guard and asked him who we were.</span> <span id="s829">We were wearing wooden shoes, kerchiefs on the head, we had shaven heads and numbers on the back and front, and the guard told her that we were prostitutes, that's why were were punished.</span> <span id="s830">We did not have contact with them, but sometimes we walked on the way back to camp into the train we walked past prisoner of war camps and sometimes they would feel sorry for us and throw some food in between us to be picked up.</span> <span id="s831">You see they were treated differently.</span> <span id="s832">They used to get packages from the Red Cross and also probably from home.</span> <span id="s833">I have no idea, so they did that.</span> <span id="s834">I think we passed by this French camp and this one woman that was French, she could speak to them and she naturally got a lot of food from them and a lot of support.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Were there a lot of camps in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I think in Hamburg there were a couple of prisoner camps, like I said I could not distinguish at that time what language.</span> <span id="s837">I just know that she spoke French and I knew those had to be Frenchmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Was your camp a woman's camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes, strictly women where I was in Tzazel, that was all women.</span> <span id="s840">Q: How large of a camp was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: 500 women.</span> <span id="s842">It was a small camp.</span> <span id="s843">That's all there was there, all these 500 women.</span> <span id="s844">Q: From your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: So, you were -- had there been people there before you?</span> <span id="s847">Was the camp just --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s849">There could have been something else, some kind of a German thing, which I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Were the guards better there?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, they treated us better, of course, than in Auschwitz, not that they were real fond of us, but if you watched your step you didn't get beaten up.</span> <span id="s852">You just had to work and be on your toes that they wouldn't catch you like they would say, slacking off.</span> <span id="s853">Some women were beaten, and we had SS women and I tell you these were worse than the men.</span> <span id="s854">Some of them were just vicious, just waiting for a chance to pounce on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Who were the kapos?</span> <span id="s856">From where were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: We didn't have in this camp kapos.</span> <span id="s858">We had like two women from the prisoners that were like inside administering the camp, from inside.</span> <span id="s859">Just like administration in the ghetto, there were two women and they were Czech women.</span> <span id="s860">I remember their names.</span> <span id="s861">One of them was Vera and one of them was Gerda.</span> <span id="s862">But then, we also rebelled and decided we should have a representative, a Polish representative, and this girl, she really worked hard at it, that she should be the one, and they picked her.</span> <span id="s863">And she happened to be a girl from my father's home town and she knew the family so it was -- so this is what happened.</span> <span id="s864">We had an infirmary in the camp.</span> <span id="s865">There was a Czech woman that claims that she was a doctor.</span> <span id="s866">She was the one that you did see, but the way she was doing things, I myself at that time could question her ability to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s867">But this is what we had, and we had to be satisfied with whatever help we could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: For example?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: You cut yourself, you had a wound, or a fever, you were ill, you had a fever, to go for some kind of a medication, those minor things.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: What did this Czech woman do that made you doubt her abilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: She -- well there was this incident when I got blood poisoning in my hand at the place where I was working.</span> <span id="s872">I must have hit a rusty nail and I had so much pain I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s873">I was howling with pain, so I went to this infirmary and she looked at it and she kept on poking at this with her instruments like trying to open this up by herself and she didn't know what to make of it, you see.</span> <span id="s874">The funny part, like I said, the situations I was in I thought I wouldn't survive, and this was another one of those situations and this labor camp, for some reason, I have no idea for what reason, I and another couple of women that needed to take care of some teeth that had to be pulled were picked with one S.S. woman and we were taken into Hamburg into a prisoner of war camp to a doctor there.</span> <span id="s875">They had a doctor there, which was a prisoner of war to take care of this.</span> <span id="s876">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s877">It's just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s878">I walked in there and he looked at my finger right away.</span> <span id="s879">I didn't know what he was saying, but the thing I could see was this and like this and this is what he would do.</span> <span id="s880">Then he pointed at this plain wooden table.</span> <span id="s881">I should just go and lay down there.</span> <span id="s882">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s883">I lay down.</span> <span id="s884">He took a bottle of ether and poured it on top of my face and my nose.</span> <span id="s885">Have you got an idea the sensation I had?</span> <span id="s886">I was choking.</span> <span id="s887">I couldn't breathe.</span> <span id="s888">All these bells were ringing in my ears and I thought, "Well, this is it.</span> <span id="s889">I am dying."</span> <span id="s890">I really thought I was dying.</span> <span id="s891">But I woke up -- after I woke up -- when I woke up I was sitting already in a chair, and my finger was bandaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Then afterwards I had to go for changing the bandage in the infirmary then I could see what he did.</span> <span id="s893">My nail was gone completely.</span> <span id="s894">He cut part of my finger off, and there was a bandage between -- my finger was like that thick.</span> <span id="s895">There, there's a mark, you can see, you can see this.</span> <span id="s896">Look, my finger is much smaller than the other.</span> <span id="s897">And to this day, I can't do much with this.</span> <span id="s898">There's not the right sensation that I can function right with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Was the doctor a German doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: He was a Frenchman or Italian.</span> <span id="s901">I don't remember what it was.</span> <span id="s902">It was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s903">It was in a prisoner of war camp that we went to.</span> <span id="s904">Then after all this, waking up from this anaesthetic, we walked back for almost close to two miles to that train to take us back to the camp.</span> <span id="s905">On the way there, this woman from -- this Polish woman that she -- that was in the camp, she went along, and she felt so sorry for me.</span> <span id="s906">She had some extra food, and she gave me something to eat, but that was very wrong because on the way the anesthetic and the food, I threw up so many times on the way, I thought I would never make it alive back to camp.</span> <span id="s907">But somehow, like I say, determination and strong will sometimes helps to survive this.</span> <span id="s908">My finger was sore for a long time.</span> <span id="s909">A couple days I stayed in the camp and then I went to work back, because you were afraid.</span> <span id="s910">You just didn't know how good it was to be in the infirmary.</span> <span id="s911">There was this fear remembering from the ghettos that it wasn't safe to be sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">That's what it is.</span> <span id="s913">Slowly it healed up.</span> <span id="s914">It took a long time naturally, with no food, you know, and healing takes a long process at that time with proper nourishment.</span> <span id="s915">But somehow I did survive.</span> <span id="s916">So you see, I don't understand these coincidences and I don't understand what happened.</span> <span id="s917">It seems like a miracle that I did survive and this is what happened to me.</span> <span id="s918">It's no fairy tale, it's registered there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Did you build up friendships, relationships, with the other girls in your --?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Two, two girls from Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s921">There were four of us, my sister and I and two other girls.</span> <span id="s922">We always kept together.</span> <span id="s923">If we were separated working somewhere else, if they just happen to work close by to German people like they were in the village right there digging those foundations, some of the German people took pity and gave them some food.</span> <span id="s924">So, they used to bring in the camp, and we used to share.</span> <span id="s925">We used to divide all this among ourselves and also give our moral support keeping together, encouraging one another just to keep on going.</span> <span id="s926">It was very important there to have someone.</span> <span id="s927">You didn't feel so alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: What kinds of things did you -- do you remember what you talked about or did you dream about?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s930">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s931">We talked about home and we dreamed about having a loaf of bread to eat and thinking maybe, maybe there's a chance that we would live through this, and there will be an end.</span> <span id="s932">We talked about a lot of recipes and things we used to eat at home and then once it got out of hand we'd say, "Stop, stop, we are starving.</span> <span id="s933">We can't take this anymore, it's too much."</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Did you ever laugh?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Not a lot, believe me.</span> <span id="s936">No.</span> <span id="s937">There weren't many causes to laughing in these places.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Did you -- I mean, you were young women, did you talk about guys at all?</span> <span id="s939">Did you think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Not in this situation, none of us did.</span> <span id="s941">We were primarily occupied with the thing of survival.</span> <span id="s942">That was not in your mind.</span> <span id="s943">How could you?</span> <span id="s944">I don't know how it was in other camps.</span> <span id="s945">We were never near other men at that time.</span> <span id="s946">You see, in the ghetto, friendships were formed sometimes with other young men, and some women even got married in the ghetto, but in the camps where I was it wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s947">You had no contact with any man, so we never thought about it.</span> <span id="s948">All we thought about was food.</span> <span id="s949">How to survive, how to fill your stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: You never had urges or anything like that?</span> <span id="s951">A: Never thought about it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Were there any efforts for people to get out of there, to try to escape when you were in the towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No, there was no where to go.</span> <span id="s954">We wore all these funny clothes.</span> <span id="s955">We had shaven heads, and the Germans themselves were rationed.</span> <span id="s956">You know, we didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s957">How do you chance knocking on the door thinking this is a good German he will take you in?</span> <span id="s958">You had to have a place to hide somewhere and you couldn't hide on your own because you needed food.</span> <span id="s959">You would starve to death right there.</span> <span id="s960">There weren't any options.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Was there much punishment or beatings, or -- A: There were beatings, yes, there were beatings.</span> <span id="s962">Q: Were there selections in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: No, not in this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Anything else you can thing of to tell me about Tzazel, your daily life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Our daily life, what was it like?</span> <span id="s966">Work, coming home, trying to -- after we came home we lined up and got our soup.</span> <span id="s967">And we prayed that we got some potatoes in this soup, not just a bowl of water floating around.</span> <span id="s968">That was our main concern.</span> <span id="s969">And the piece of bread that we got in the morning had to last us all day long.</span> <span id="s970">Some people could not control themselves and they ate it right away and later on they just were terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s971">We always divided it in half.</span> <span id="s972">One for the morning, one for lunchtime, because we didn't get anything else.</span> <span id="s973">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">One time only, I remember by chance, we didn't go into the city to work.</span> <span id="s975">They took us with a boat across the Elbe.</span> <span id="s976">The water was called Elbe, and we were loading bricks on a boat.</span> <span id="s977">The village was called Krantz (ph).</span> <span id="s978">I remember that vividly.</span> <span id="s979">And the farmers, there was mainly farmers there, and they felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s980">I don't know how they risked it.</span> <span id="s981">They brought a sack of potatoes and we cooked those potatoes and we thought we were in heaven.</span> <span id="s982">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s983">But it was only like a few days it lasted and it was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: You were able to cook those in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes, they made it possible there on the place where we were working, not in the camp, right there, for lunch.</span> <span id="s986">That's where it was.</span> <span id="s987">So it was amazing, certain things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: One more question that maybe a little abstract, but during the time in these camps, did you ever think about being Jewish?</span> <span id="s989">Did you pray?</span> <span id="s990">Were you at all conscious of the Sabbath or a holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: We knew when the holidays were.</span> <span id="s992">We couldn't do much about it.</span> <span id="s993">We just commemorated in our hearts.</span> <span id="s994">We were conscious.</span> <span id="s995">We know we were Jews.</span> <span id="s996">The only question was why do we have to be punished like that because we are Jews?</span> <span id="s997">What did we do to deserve something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Did you ever resent being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: I envied the other people because they were not subjected to this.</span> <span id="s1000">They didn't have to worry about their lives.</span> <span id="s1001">They were never in danger, never persecuted the way we were.</span> <span id="s1002">So, I envied them.</span> <span id="s1003">And sometimes, you know, when you're a child you question, why was I born a Jew?</span> <span id="s1004">Why wasn't I born a Christian to avoid all these persecutions and all this harassment?</span> <span id="s1005">So, there were sometimes questions.</span> <span id="s1006">After I was liberated and found out that none of my family survived, I was in a great rage for a while.</span> <span id="s1007">I did not pray.</span> <span id="s1008">I did not believe for quite a few years, because I could not -- it could not get through to me that there is a God and he could look down and allow this to happen.</span> <span id="s1009">That's the way I felt.</span> <span id="s1010">But you go back eventually because you have to have faith.</span> <span id="s1011">That's what happens.</span> <span id="s1012">Try to justify but still in my mind I don't justify what happened.</span> <span id="s1013">I can't justify it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: How long were you in Tzazel?</span> <span id="s1015">A: About nine months only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s1017">How did you get out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Well, the Allies came close by to liberate the city, an we know that Hitler was determined to destroy the Jewish people, even when he was losing the war, we had to go down with him.</span> <span id="s1019">So, he tried -- Hitler was determined that the people would be moved, evacuated, not being liberated.</span> <span id="s1020">So, one day again, we were transported by train, taken out of Tzazel, Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1021">We traveled several hours, and after several hours we got out of this train and found ourselves in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1022">That was something that at first didn't register what we did see there.</span> <span id="s1023">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1024">It was the beginning of April, the first days.</span> <span id="s1025">The camp was in disarray.</span> <span id="s1026">They did not bury the bodies anymore.</span> <span id="s1027">Dead bodies standing up in one pile like cardboard.</span> <span id="s1028">The rest of them strewn all over the ground.</span> <span id="s1029">They assigned us a barrack.</span> <span id="s1030">There was 500 women in one barrack.</span> <span id="s1031">Nothing, just bare floors, and this is where we were.</span> <span id="s1032">No food, we did not get any food.</span> <span id="s1033">We did not work anymore.</span> <span id="s1034">The water was turned off completely, nothing.</span> <span id="s1035">There was only a skeleton crew of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1036">The camp was mainly guarded by their volunteers, militia that joined their ranks.</span> <span id="s1037">Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, they were guarding the camp from outside.</span> <span id="s1038">The way, after a while, I knew we were on the barbed wire, but there were other camps on the other side.</span> <span id="s1039">A man camp, men were there and also some children were there.</span> <span id="s1040">But in our place, there were only women.</span> <span id="s1041">You came into a camp, there were only women and different barracks and you did nothing.</span> <span id="s1042">In the beginning they attempted to count us in the morning.</span> <span id="s1043">Soon, they abandoned this also.</span> <span id="s1044">We didn't work anymore.</span> <span id="s1045">All you did is just walk around in a daze and make some sense of what is going on here, you know.</span> <span id="s1046">Dead people all over the place, typhoid fever, dysentery, lice, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: How did you make sense of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: None of it, we just -- like I said, we were in a daze.</span> <span id="s1049">What was there didn't completely register in our mind.</span> <span id="s1050">What are we doing here?</span> <span id="s1051">What is it?</span> <span id="s1052">It's something that we didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1053">What is it?</span> <span id="s1054">What's going to happen here.</span> <span id="s1055">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s1056">Outside of the camp they had collerabi laying up that high.</span> <span id="s1057">That was supposed to be food but they didn't feed us anymore and since it was a very warm spring they decomposed and smelled so horrible and with the rest of the dead bodies, the stench was terrible.</span> <span id="s1058">You could almost choke, breathing that air there.</span> <span id="s1059">And, you know, still, we were so starved that some of the prisoners tried to grab that decomposed food and eat, and these guys that was guarding us, they were wearing arm bands of surrender but they still were shooting at the prisoners trying to grab a hold of this and quite a few people were shot close to liberation that way.</span> <span id="s1060">We came to this camp with a little bit of bread, the four of us, my sister and I and our two friends.</span> <span id="s1061">We ate this and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1062">Nothing, we just didn't know what is going to happen here.</span> <span id="s1063">My sister -- I don't know where my sister found a potato.</span> <span id="s1064">Another miracle, she found a potato so we shared this potato every day a slice each one of us just to hold us together.</span> <span id="s1065">We walked outside and people dropped dead in front of you.</span> <span id="s1066">You just kept on walking.</span> <span id="s1067">You didn't even pay any attention to that anymore.</span> <span id="s1068">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1069">I met -- we met a woman from our home town.</span> <span id="s1070">I looked at her, and I thought, "Oh gee she looks wonderful."</span> <span id="s1071">In Bergen-Belsen, unbelievable of all the circumstances, we met a woman from our home town.</span> <span id="s1072">She came over and talked to us and she said, "I hope that I live to be free some day.</span> <span id="s1073">Do you think I will survive?</span> <span id="s1074">What do I look like it to you?"</span> <span id="s1075">And I answered "Oh, you look wonderful," but you know what?</span> <span id="s1076">She was swollen.</span> <span id="s1077">The next day she was dead.</span> <span id="s1078">So, you see this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1079">We were walking corpses, all of us not knowing who would go the next day.</span> <span id="s1080">So, you see we were getting weaker every day and the barrack was so small that if you wanted to lay down and sleep you had to go between somebody's legs.</span> <span id="s1081">Somebody had to stretch their legs and you'd put your head in between, and if you were on the other end, and you had to go out on the latrine, all the sand and all the dirt were falling on top of you from these people passing you by.</span> <span id="s1082">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s1083">Some people were so desperate and so thirsty, that they went to the place, the so called latrine, and they licked the sweat from the walls for water.</span> <span id="s1084">You know, that's why we had so many diseases there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: You didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s1087">I don't remember doing it.</span> <span id="s1088">But the last day when there was no more potatoes we were so weak I could barely walk any more and I told my sister and my friends that I'm just going to go into the barrack and lay down.</span> <span id="s1089">I want to die in there.</span> <span id="s1090">I don't want people stepping over me, you know, lay there like a -- sort of like a dog or anything.</span> <span id="s1091">You just walk by and -- so we all went in there.</span> <span id="s1092">We all lay down.</span> <span id="s1093">One of them, it was the youngest, she thought before she laid there and give up she has to take one more look what was going on out there in the camp.</span> <span id="s1094">She came back to me and said, "You know what, there is something funny going on out there."</span> <span id="s1095">I told her, "You're hallucinating from hunger.</span> <span id="s1096">Why don't you leave me in peace?</span> <span id="s1097">Let me die in peace.</span> <span id="s1098">I have no strength.</span> <span id="s1099">I cannot make efforts to go and look what you think is going on there."</span> <span id="s1100">She persuaded my sister to go out.</span> <span id="s1101">My sister did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">And she came back, she came back running.</span> <span id="s1103">I don't know where she got the strength to do that.</span> <span id="s1104">And she said to me "Get up, get up.</span> <span id="s1105">Everybody is on their feet.</span> <span id="s1106">Everybody is running.</span> <span id="s1107">There's a man sitting."</span> <span id="s1108">I don't know was it a jeep or a tank, to this day I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1109">He was speaking through a loudspeaker in a different kind of language.</span> <span id="s1110">We don't understand the language, but somebody is translating.</span> <span id="s1111">The gates are opened.</span> <span id="s1112">Everybody is running.</span> <span id="s1113">I think she said, "We are free.</span> <span id="s1114">We are liberated."</span> <span id="s1115">It was -- a thousand times I talk about it and every time I cry.</span> <span id="s1116">So, she grabbed me, I walked out, and I looked there.</span> <span id="s1117">It didn't register what I have seen.</span> <span id="s1118">Is this really true?</span> <span id="s1119">So, I told her that she has to grab me here, she has to slap me or pinch me, to make me realize that I am alive and this is what really happened.</span> <span id="s1120">We are free, we are free.</span> <span id="s1121">The English Army liberated us the 15th of April.</span> <span id="s1122">It wasn't their main aim.</span> <span id="s1123">They were just passing by.</span> <span id="s1124">That's what I was told.</span> <span id="s1125">To a different destination, but they were attracted by the stench that came from this place and they wanted to investigate to see what was going on and this is what they found.</span> <span id="s1126">They were astounded.</span> <span id="s1127">They did not have enough food.</span> <span id="s1128">They did not have enough medication.</span> <span id="s1129">They did their best they could in the beginning to help.</span> <span id="s1130">And it was really heart-breaking to see those live corpses that were laying, you know, in the camp getting a piece of bread with the last strength tried to hold it with it falling out of their hands because they died in the minute they were liberated.</span> <span id="s1131">They were so far gone in starvation that it didn't help.</span> <span id="s1132">You know, we the survivors were really lucky.</span> <span id="s1133">I estimate that 20,000 died after liberation, but I think it's much more.</span> <span id="s1134">Someone says 28, someone says 30 people died of diseases and starvation.</span> <span id="s1135">It didn't help -- the medicine didn't help any more, and the food didn't help any more.</span> <span id="s1136">They were at that point that they couldn't heal them anymore.</span> <span id="s1137">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1138">So, I was a free person.</span> <span id="s1139">And from then on, another chapter in my life had started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: How long did you remain in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Not very long, for a couple months.</span> <span id="s1142">The reason was that the youngest friend got a message from the American zone that two brothers are alive and they would come, they wanted her to come to the American zone.</span> <span id="s1143">And since we didn't find anyone, you know, lists came every day from different liberated places, with people's names, we never found anyone on those lists, and then her brother's came, she persuaded us to travel along.</span> <span id="s1144">We thought, well maybe by any chance what have you got to lose?</span> <span id="s1145">This is a camp and over there is a displaced camp, why don't we stay together for a while yet?</span> <span id="s1146">We were liberated together.</span> <span id="s1147">Maybe by some chance we will find someone there.</span> <span id="s1148">So, we traveled with them to Faldafeng (ph), the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Freight trains, coal wagons, one time we ended up in a passenger car and he passed us by but the guys that were traveling, her brothers, the conductor came over to them, and you know what he told them?</span> <span id="s1151">He should go to Hitler for payment.</span> <span id="s1152">I thought that was funny at that time, you know, but we didn't have any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: I don't want to necessarily have you to go over everything that you told this morning.</span> <span id="s1154">You talked quite a bit about Faldafeng.</span> <span id="s1155">Now, just a few questions, did you ever think about going back to Lodz?</span> <span id="s1156">I know that was a very busy place after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Lodz wasn't my hometown.</span> <span id="s1158">The little place Ozerkoff where I was born and I lived until the war came and until we were transported to the Lodz Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1159">In the beginning no, we knew there was no one left.</span> <span id="s1160">It was Communist and everyday I experienced the feeling that I was a Jew by deed and by names, the Polish population let us know we were just Jews and not really welcome where we even grew up and lived there for generations.</span> <span id="s1161">So, it wasn't a place I really wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s1162">We really didn't want to stay in Germany either.</span> <span id="s1163">Too much Jewish blood spilled there.</span> <span id="s1164">You sit in these displaced camps, waiting where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s1165">It was a no-win situation, even after survival.</span> <span id="s1166">Sitting in a displaced camp trying to figure out which country will allow you to emigrate and make a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: How did you decided where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: As a child, I heard so many wonderful things about the United States.</span> <span id="s1169">I was not able to travel to -- at that time they had these illegal allias to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1170">I wasn't strong enough to survive a journey like that.</span> <span id="s1171">So, I thought I need a place where I could feel more relaxed and more sure of myself.</span> <span id="s1172">I would love to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1173">There were choices.</span> <span id="s1174">You could go to Canada.</span> <span id="s1175">Some went to Australia.</span> <span id="s1176">But I preferred the United States.</span> <span id="s1177">I always heard my mother admire the United States and think well of it that people could live free here.</span> <span id="s1178">This is where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1179">This is the place I chose, finally, when we were allowed to emigrate from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: This was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: 1951 I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: What was your first impression when you arrived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Of disbelief.</span> <span id="s1184">First of all, we did not know English.</span> <span id="s1185">It was a new ball game.</span> <span id="s1186">You had to learn all over.</span> <span id="s1187">It's like being newborn again.</span> <span id="s1188">Different customs, different way of living.</span> <span id="s1189">The way people shopped and the way you lived and what you did and because we had missed our education, it was hard for us to make a living and not knowing the language either, you did menial work, whatever was suitable for you at that time.</span> <span id="s1190">We had no choice, you know, but we worked hard.</span> <span id="s1191">My husband and I were very determined to succeed here.</span> <span id="s1192">We saw the freedom that we had here.</span> <span id="s1193">Although in the beginning I was wary of uniforms and I walked down the street and I saw policemen on my side of the street, I'd cross the street.</span> <span id="s1194">There was something -- like in the camp after I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1195">The gates were opened and when I finally decided I would venture beyond escape I kept on looking back, if nobody was going to shoot me in the back for walking out of this place.</span> <span id="s1196">It was being very insecure and not really you were free, and not really believing that you were finally free and you could live a life of your own without being afraid.</span> <span id="s1197">So it was the food, amazing what you could buy in the supermarkets.</span> <span id="s1198">The choices you had, what you could eat.</span> <span id="s1199">It was something I never dreamed of.</span> <span id="s1200">Even living in Poland and considering ourselves middle class people, we always had a enough to eat, and it was nourishing food, but this we called luxurious food that people ate every day here.</span> <span id="s1201">We couldn't get over it.</span> <span id="s1202">And the way the big department stores worked.</span> <span id="s1203">In the beginning people were so friendy where I came to Shaboigen (ph).</span> <span id="s1204">Everyone said hello to you on the street.</span> <span id="s1205">Everybody tried to communicate and the people I met always said, "Listen to what we say and just try word by word speak.</span> <span id="s1206">We will help you along."</span> <span id="s1207">Naturally we had to go to vocational school because we wanted to be citizen of this country.</span> <span id="s1208">So, you had to go and learn English and about the government.</span> <span id="s1209">We did this right away.</span> <span id="s1210">I wanted to belong somewhere.</span> <span id="s1211">I wanted a place that I could call this is my country and I'm welcome here.</span> <span id="s1212">So, we went and in 1957 we got to be United States citizens.</span> <span id="s1213">Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1214">My older daughter was born in Germany and she was so envious we got our citizen papers.</span> <span id="s1215">I think she was 11 or 12, she could have waited until she was 18 and got automatic citizenship, but she wanted to be a citizen right away, so we had to go to the courthouse and she went through the whole process.</span> <span id="s1216">She was very proud to present her citizen paper -- she envied her sister.</span> <span id="s1217">Her younger sister was born here and she was a natural citizen and she envied her this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: How did you get to Shaboigen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Well, you see, actually my destination was Trenton, New Jersey, but my sister came two years before me and her destination was Shaboigen.</span> <span id="s1220">Every city -- every Jewish community decided to take in so many people.</span> <span id="s1221">Since there were only the two of us, she wanted us to be together and asked the local Jewish council to bring us over here.</span> <span id="s1222">This is how I ended up being in Shaboigen also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: I think there may be a few stories we might have missed.</span> <span id="s1226">When you were in Tzazel and you were working in Hamburg, as I understand it there was a situation where your guard was trapped or injured.</span> <span id="s1227">Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: He was not injured.</span> <span id="s1229">The thing is that they were bombing the city like I said before, day and night, the flyers came.</span> <span id="s1230">The German population fled into the bunkers, but we had only a basement to go into.</span> <span id="s1231">They did not think of our safety.</span> <span id="s1232">They just didn't want the flyers to see any movements from above, so we were herded into this basement and this is where we stayed through the bombing until it was all clear.</span> <span id="s1233">So, one day, these flyers came so close and the bomb fell so close we all from the impact of it, from them, we all flew on top of each other and the lights went out.</span> <span id="s1234">This was the end, we thought.</span> <span id="s1235">We were buried alive.</span> <span id="s1236">When the all clear sounded and we made our way back up, we saw, see I consider all these savings like a miracle, we saw why we were saved.</span> <span id="s1237">The bomb fell a distance away.</span> <span id="s1238">It did not explode.</span> <span id="s1239">It made a huge hole.</span> <span id="s1240">We could see that bomb in one piece, but the rubble that was flying buried our guard, the S.S man up to here in that rubble.</span> <span id="s1241">He was leaning against the wall of that basement where we were downstairs.</span> <span id="s1242">See, he was not allowed to go in with us -- not together, you know -- so he was leaning against the wall, and he stood there helplessly buried into this -- in this rubble.</span> <span id="s1243">Well, who do you think digged him out?</span> <span id="s1244">We did.</span> <span id="s1245">And you're always astounded, why did you do that?</span> <span id="s1246">So what should we do?</span> <span id="s1247">What choices did we have?</span> <span id="s1248">We had wooden shoes coats with marked numbers, shaven heads, and a strange city that we don't know anyone.</span> <span id="s1249">Where do you think you could run without any money and without any destination?</span> <span id="s1250">Any door you would open, maybe they would denounce you.</span> <span id="s1251">Sooner or later someone will come and free this guy, then they will hunt us down, one two three.</span> <span id="s1252">We stand out in a crowd, right?</span> <span id="s1253">Because we were running away, we would be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1254">None of us wanted to die.</span> <span id="s1255">Because of the situation in Hamburg, each one of us deeply in heart hoped that by some miracle, by some chance, we will survive this, which did happen, that's why I am here to tell this story.</span> <span id="s1256">So, it was a good thing that we did not try to run away, but before I finish telling the reason, every place I speak everyone is astounded.</span> <span id="s1257">They couldn't figure out in the beginning why we did this, but there was no choice.</span> <span id="s1258">We had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Did you stand around and look at each other and say, "What should we -- should we do it?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Well, one started doing it so we just all helped along.</span> <span id="s1261">He did not even -- he didn't say anything, just went about his business, you know, the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Did he treat you more kindly afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: I really can't remember that.</span> <span id="s1264">Some of them were nice guys.</span> <span id="s1265">Some of them were like they were forced into this service, but you know we never had any personal contacts.</span> <span id="s1266">They never expressed their feelings or whatever they felt about this place that we would know exactly what they were thinking.</span> <span id="s1267">But some of the actions, you know, talked for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Maybe I missed something, this particular guard was male?</span> <span id="s1269">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Were most of your guards in your camp women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Most of them -- no, they were sort of half and half I would say.</span> <span id="s1272">Q: This was a women's camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: It was a women's camp, but we had men in the beginning, then women guards, women, S.S. women started coming in and they also marched with us to work, watched us and like I said before, they were more vicious, some of them, than the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Were any of the men to your knowledge flirtatious at all with the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Maybe, I don't know that for sure.</span> <span id="s1276">Maybe, with those people that were on top, that they had to be in contact, like convey the messages what we should do or whatever, it could happen.</span> <span id="s1277">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And actually, because we're so out of order will you just state for the record where we're talking about.</span> <span id="s1279">When we're talking about a camp, where are we now again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: In Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: And the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Well in the city of Hamburg when we digged this guy out of the rubble.</span> <span id="s1283">Q: Right, but the camp you were part of at that time was which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: We were at Noyangomen.</span> <span id="s1285">It was a subcamp of Noyangomen, which was also an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1286">So, you see, like taking us out from Auschwitz, it was no big deal to them.</span> <span id="s1287">They could always get a hold of us and exterminate us whenever they felt like it.</span> <span id="s1288">It was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1289">We were treated better than a real concentration camp or an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1290">But we were never sure of our lives from day to day what's in their mind and what they could do with us.</span> <span id="s1291">So it was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Were you taken directly to Tzazel, or did you spend any time in Noyangomen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: We spent -- no, not in Noyangomen.</span> <span id="s1294">From Auschwitz, actually we were taken directly into the city of Hamburg while they were preparing this camp in Tzazel, we stayed in sort of a huge building.</span> <span id="s1295">It must have been a military building.</span> <span id="s1296">One side was leaning against the water there.</span> <span id="s1297">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1298">There the 500 women were also in barracks with the same people were ruling it and then after several weeks we were transported into Tzazel there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Did most of the 500 make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Some of them died after liberation of typhoid fever, quite a few of them from our group, but I would say quite a few of them made it too.</span> <span id="s1301">Our -- my two friends and my sister, they made it.</span> <span id="s1302">We were liberated together.</span> <span id="s1303">One of them died after the war here in the United States, several years ago.</span> <span id="s1304">She died of cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: What did you learn about your family and how did you learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: We learned from -- first of all my mother was taken out of line and went to the wrong side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">We learned the other side meant extermination.</span> <span id="s1308">About my father and two brothers, we weren't sure, but this man which was a neighbor in Lodz Ghetto, he was in the line behind them.</span> <span id="s1309">He told us that they went to the wrong side.</span> <span id="s1310">Still, we searched.</span> <span id="s1311">By some, by some coincidence we thought maybe by some miracle, maybe they did survive, even going the other way.</span> <span id="s1312">It happened.</span> <span id="s1313">Very few, but it happened.</span> <span id="s1314">So, we still fooled ourselves.</span> <span id="s1315">You know, we -- when we were separated, we made sort of a pact that if we survived and could get back to the home town where we came from, we would meet there, but I never had a chance to go back.</span> <span id="s1316">After I was so many years in the United States that nagged me, thinking maybe, I haven't found anybody anyplace maybe some one is in my home town, maybe somebody that survived.</span> <span id="s1317">I went back in the year of 1978, ended up in my home town there was, like from close to 5,000 Jews, it was like a dead city.</span> <span id="s1318">One Jewish man lived there.</span> <span id="s1319">One person, would you believe that?</span> <span id="s1320">Of course, there was hardly anything Jewish around.</span> <span id="s1321">My sister knew I was going and she said, "Remember to go to the cemetery."</span> <span id="s1322">The only one that died a natural death was my grandfather, "Go visit his grave."</span> <span id="s1323">So I asked this man he should take me to this cemetery.</span> <span id="s1324">He said, "What cemetery?"</span> <span id="s1325">You know, they made a pasture out of the cemetery and they took all the stones, you know, the matzevos (ph), and they made a sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1326">And when I looked at Schindler's List, the movie, and I saw that, and I says, "Oh my God, he did exactly the same thing in other places."</span> <span id="s1327">After liberation, this man petitioned the Polish government to get this sidewalk out, but you know they don't come out in one piece and not exactly the same shape anymore.</span> <span id="s1328">All these stones were taken back in the place where the cemetery and they're just laying there in two piles of rubble.</span> <span id="s1329">It was impossible to distinguish who was who and there was no graves.</span> <span id="s1330">It was like nothing.</span> <span id="s1331">That's what there was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: How did you find this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Should I tell you something?</span> <span id="s1334">The minute I walked into the city, my younger daughter traveled with me, I knew right away where I was.</span> <span id="s1335">I saw the place where we lived and because I was standing there looking around, it's such a small place, that one guy walked over to us and said, "What are you looking for?"</span> <span id="s1336">And I said, "Well, I used to live here once."</span> <span id="s1337">Then he knew right away I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1338">So he said, "I'll take you to a man here, he lives here," and he took us to this guy.</span> <span id="s1339">So this is how we did communicate.</span> <span id="s1340">You know, I went back to Auschwitz that year.</span> <span id="s1341">I traveled a little bit and I thought I have to go back there.</span> <span id="s1342">My younger daughter was hysterical.</span> <span id="s1343">She almost had a nervous breakdown going there.</span> <span id="s1344">It was like she was -- after a while she said her feeling, she thought I'm not safe here.</span> <span id="s1345">Here they come to exterminate me too.</span> <span id="s1346">Then she looked at all these things, but what I wanted to do, and the reason I went back is, this is where I left my parents.</span> <span id="s1347">This is where I left my brothers.</span> <span id="s1348">I don't have a grave.</span> <span id="s1349">You know, it comes a High Holiday, people go on the cemetery before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1350">They say prayers.</span> <span id="s1351">I have no one.</span> <span id="s1352">I have no where to go and here I am in Poland and I have this chance.</span> <span id="s1353">So, I went and said Kaddish and sort of communicated, and I felt good.</span> <span id="s1354">I paid my last respects to them there.</span> <span id="s1355">So, I have a little peace of mind that I did that.</span> <span id="s1356">It made me feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: How do you think you survived all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1359">When I talk about it, some people say, "It wasn't your time to die."</span> <span id="s1360">And when I go and speak in places, they say, you see, you survived so you will be able to tell us what happened.</span> <span id="s1361">So this is their interpretation.</span> <span id="s1362">You had to be here to tell us what happened so we know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Do you think it required any special inner strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Well, my sister, for instance, cannot do that a lot.</span> <span id="s1365">She does it where she lives in Milwaukee now, once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: I mean the actual surviving, do you think that that took something special?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: It did.</span> <span id="s1368">It took determination.</span> <span id="s1369">It took will power because I know that a lot of women were in the same situation.</span> <span id="s1370">They were just as weak as I.</span> <span id="s1371">They gave up.</span> <span id="s1372">When you give up, you die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: But you didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s1375">I don't know why I kept on going and like people said to me when they look at me, "Amazing that you could push that wheelbarrow with all this rubble.</span> <span id="s1376">You're so little."</span> <span id="s1377">I said, "You'd be amazed what you can do under threat and determination if your life is at stake."</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Did you ever want to die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: There was a time where we thought -- there were instances where I thought what is it all for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">There's no end to it.</span> <span id="s1381">What's going to happen?</span> <span id="s1382">And I thought, "Maybe it's better to be dead and not suffer any more."</span> <span id="s1383">But then, I talked myself out of it, because my parents always said, "Remember life is precious and hold on to it as long as you can."</span> <span id="s1384">My father was very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1385">He was a Hasid, but when all this came out and we were observing the kashrut, the laws, you know, but then all this came out, he said that the Bible interprets anything, any measures to survive and live are excused.</span> <span id="s1386">So, it's excused to eat anything that help you to survive.</span> <span id="s1387">That's the way he felt, and I always remembered that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: One more question, I'm sure that when you think about or dream about these years and I'm sure it's often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: I do dream a lot, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Are there a couple really strong images that constantly come back to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1392">The time when I lost my parents, the time of liberation, that all comes back to me, and sometimes I have nightmares after this.</span> <span id="s1393">I wake up my heart beating, the Nazis are chasing me, I'm trying to hide, and every hiding place they find.</span> <span id="s1394">One time I was running so fast I was out breath and I thank God that I woke up.</span> <span id="s1395">I could hardly catch my breath while I was waking up.</span> <span id="s1396">I could remember everything so vividly.</span> <span id="s1397">So, it's hard.</span> <span id="s1398">I think the Holocaust will walk with the survivors till the day we die.</span> <span id="s1399">It's a part of us, you know.</span> <span id="s1400">It will always be with me.</span> <span id="s1401">It'll never leave me, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Is there anything else you want to say?</span> <span id="s1403">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: No, just that I'm glad that I'm living in this country, and I'm grateful for the people that want to listen to me and maybe, doing this, maybe I'm doing something good.</span> <span id="s1406">I know the children in schools are listening.</span> <span id="s1407">I know from their comments because they write me notes.</span> <span id="s1408">I get stacks of letters and from their comments I can see that they were listening to me, because I know that they quote certain things that I said.</span> <span id="s1409">It made me feel that I'm doing something good and useful in this world, and maybe I will not change the world, but I have a tiny little part in trying to do that.</span> <span id="s1410">This is very satisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
