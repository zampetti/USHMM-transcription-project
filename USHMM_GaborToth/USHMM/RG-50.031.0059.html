id="s12">Q: Where are you from and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born March 7, 1928 in Usura (?)</span> <span id="s14">, Czech.</span> <span id="s15">I had one brother and one sister, both older.</span> <span id="s16">I was the baby.</span> <span id="s17">I was spoiled growing up because of being the youngest.</span> <span id="s18">We lived a middle class life in a gorgeous country.</span> <span id="s19">My father owned a hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">0:62</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Did your family participate in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My father was a atheist and my mother was Jewish- very religious.</span> <span id="s23">I really don't remember much but I do not remember any poor Jews.</span> <span id="s24">We did not meet any other class of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">1:00</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did you feel any discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, there was much antisemitism.</span> <span id="s28">I did have many Catholic friends at school.</span> <span id="s29">One day the Germans came and put us in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s30">People did not know what was hitting them.</span> <span id="s31">My brother had a physician friend in the Hungarian Army.</span> <span id="s32">He tried to get him to help me to escape Budapest.</span> <span id="s33">I did not want to leave my parents.</span> <span id="s34">Father died on the way to Auschwitz of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s35">He had a high fever and died in hospital with dignity.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">2:52</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Can you actually tell us about arriving at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Very crowded cattle cars.</span> <span id="s39">People were all sick.</span> <span id="s40">It was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s41">I don't know how many days we were in the cars.</span> <span id="s42">I saw the crematorium, smelled the burning people but never expected anything.</span> <span id="s43">I can't go into much more detail because I can't remember much.</span> <span id="s44">April 1944.</span> <span id="s45">I feel like I am relaying to you an experience I saw on a film a long time ago and vaguely remember what happened.</span> <span id="s46">I don't like to talk about the experience.</span> <span id="s47">Brutality was so unexpected that at the time what was actually happening never crossed our minds.</span> <span id="s48">The soldiers ripped our earrings of and stepped on my father's picture.</span> <span id="s49">They put us in barracks.</span> <span id="s50">They took our clothing and gave us some rags to wear.</span> <span id="s51">I had no shoes.</span> <span id="s52">There were 13-14 people per bunk.</span> <span id="s53">2 Times per day there was roll call.</span> <span id="s54">4:30 we were woken and we stood in the court yard for three hours.</span> <span id="s55">We were strongly advised to stand straight.</span> <span id="s56">All the beautiful girls had their long hair cut.</span> <span id="s57">I never remember seeing any women molested by the soldiers.</span> <span id="s58">The German's had no need to molest us unkempt, dirty soldiers.</span> <span id="s59">I used to comb all the German women's hair for an additional slice of bread.</span> <span id="s60">I gave it to my 13 year old cousin because she was large for her age.</span> <span id="s61">We were given one scoop of soup each day and one slice of bread.</span> <span id="s62">The heat in the summer of 1944 was parching.</span> <span id="s63">We sat crouched between the barracks to avoid it.</span> <span id="s64">One day an older girl told me that there was going to be a selection for a labor camp and that she should look her best for it.</span> <span id="s65">I was given wooden shoes and brought to a big white building, it looked like a crematorium.</span> <span id="s66">It was a factory.</span> <span id="s67">I worked 13 hour days.</span> <span id="s68">Survival here was much easier than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s69">If you did work you were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">5:14</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What were your memories of liberation itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: It took place April 1944.</span> <span id="s73">The air raids were frequent.</span> <span id="s74">It was obvious that the Americans were coming closer.</span> <span id="s75">During this time we were not able to talk to the Germans.</span> <span id="s76">One day the bombing stopped and I heard American voices outside and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s77">Most of us didn't want to go on living because we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">5:65</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: If there's something else you would like to say please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: I feel like I have said a lot but have said nothing.</span> <span id="s81">It would require an in depth searching of myself before I could say anything with more meaning.</span> <span id="s82">I think I spoke too lightly about what was happening.</span> <span id="s83">If I went into depth I would not be able to go to work tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s84">I feel very empty, extremely empty.</span></p> <p><span
