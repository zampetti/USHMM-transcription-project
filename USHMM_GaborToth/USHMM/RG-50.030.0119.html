id="s509">And he was involved in this uh, activities of these criminals, and they were friends, very close friends, before and also in the camp.</span> <span id="s510">But then they divided the Jews, as Willy Nahman was a Jew and sent him to uh, to Neuengamme and later to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s511">But as a prisoner, for this also, later these criminals from Hamburg, from Sachsenhausen, about thirty of these criminals, they had choose them, and brought them to Auschwitz, and make of them kappos and the blockeldester.</span> <span id="s512">You know, the bosses of the, which helped.</span> <span id="s513">And so when we came on this block, and Willy Nahman with us, he was also, he took a number I know, 720777, yes 47, 47 was his number.</span> <span id="s514">He had, we were given the numbers, I still remember exactly.</span> <span id="s515">And so we, we were on this block and on this there block some new prisoners coming to the deportees from Belgium, I remember.</span> <span id="s516">And these were all prisoners.</span> <span id="s517">The blockältester told you will train these new prisoners in how they should mitseup, mitseup (ph), how they should keep the discipline in the camp.</span> <span id="s518">And you will get a little, a bit more of their soup for this trip (ph).</span> <span id="s519">And when we are train, this soldier blockr master (ph) came, you know, the boss who was __________ and he saw the Willy the Nahman, oh _______________, you old friend, you are here, how are you, and he told, he uh booked (ph) him and kissed

Polacks.</span> <span id="s521">They were all against the Poles.</span> <span id="s522">They were not very accepted from the Germans you know.</span> <span id="s523">And so he told no, look, so I will give you the best of beds, yes, do us and you will get food and so.</span> <span id="s524">And so, we were, that was the first step.</span> <span id="s525">And now we were on the second floor.</span> <span id="s526">You know there are three bunks all there.</span> <span id="s527">And we were on the third, and now we on the first row, and we saw how the stubnitz you know what is a stubnitz.</span> <span id="s528">These were the aids of the blockältester the prisoners who prepared the food, who they kept for cleanness, who punished, yes, who were very severe to the, and they were aid of the - there were about four or five these prisoners, stubnitz.</span> <span id="s529">It is the aids.</span> <span id="s530">They were prisoners, but were the aids of the blockältester and they did what he would.</span> <span id="s531">So we knew that always when they were prepared the food for them, so they cut a little of bread, they cut a little of margarine, they cut a little of marmalade, yes.</span> <span id="s532">And they give smaller portions to the, and what they make they organized for the blockältester vodka, spirits, liquers, and sausages and so.</span> <span id="s533">And they brought him, uh, he had his own uh room in the block, yes.</span> <span id="s534">And they brought him always, he got the full, a good supper and all.</span> <span id="s535">So they take care.</span> <span id="s536">And he didn't care what they are doing with these prisoners, if they gave them the full portions, you know, the full rations or not.</span> <span id="s537">And we saw it from the, although we knew this practice already from Neuengamme, and we were curious if they will also steal it for us, for our rations.</span> <span id="s538">And we, they manipulated it and they brought uh, you know, they have that butter toast they make, chips of the margarine which they stole, and they make this chips for the block master (ph) and they eat and they also give to the blockältester yes, the sausage.</span> <span id="s539">And we told them, and we saw they didn't stop before on the rations for us, they also kept.</span> <span id="s540">So we told them, look, it's not true.</span> <span id="s541">We are all heflings , and so we, you should not betray us.</span> <span id="s542">Yes.</span> <span id="s543">Oh, you are Jews.</span> <span id="s544">So they were very harsh to us, and very bad.</span> <span id="s545">And so, they give us a very hard work - we should take from the kitchen, you know, these kettles that are very heavy, and we should brought these kettles of soup to the block.</span> <span id="s546">Yes, it was very heavy, and we should get them a little soup more.</span> <span id="s547">And we saw how they are are handle and smuggle these spirits _______ and all these things and from the ________ we observed.</span> <span id="s548">And so when we were going to this uh and brought these very heavy trunks (ph), with these kettles yes, it was 200 liters, so once there was a lagerältester, you know, lagerältester , was the boss of the whole camp, the prisoner boss, and he also was a criminal and really was going and he was, he Willy let fall these trunks, and he __________ yes, and they meeted them, and they were friends, and he asked him, look what is, what is, how are you and so on.</span> <span id="s549">He told look these boys they are betraying us and they are cutting off this and this and this.</span> <span id="s550">He told this and there, when he told, and they are handling spirits.</span> <span id="s551">(Spirit is liquor.)</span> <span id="s552">Liquor.</span> <span id="s553">Oh, when he said liquor, what, liquor, where is it.</span> <span id="s554">Yes.</span> <span id="s555">(Laughter) And he came with two SS men on this, in this project (ph), and they have this liquor, two or three, and they really brouhgt them, and they took and they immediately they changed this stubnitz (ph) to the penalty company.</span> <span id="s556">This Polish.</span> <span id="s557">And we should be on there, on there, we were replaced.</span> <span id="s558">(You were replaced.)</span> <span id="s559">Yes, but this was the career (ph) but the blockältester didn't like it also and the, we told him, look, we will get your food, your food-vodka or don't care.</span> <span id="s560">He shoot him.</span> <span id="s561">But that was break through in the Polish heirarchy, and the Poles are very angry.</span> <span id="s562">The other Poles, you know, very angry that we got such a protection from the lagerältester and so on.</span> <span id="s563">And so we were in danger.</span> <span id="s564">Our blockältester as well.</span> <span id="s565">So he told us, look, there is a camp in Birkenau, it is a nice camp, a new camp, and they are needing for slosher (ph) and you are blacksmiths, and so you are in _________ and this is a fantastic camp and there is lying, the money and gold (ph) and money and milk on the

<span id="s569">And one day there came an assessment at Birkenau, was about three kilometers, two miles away from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s570">And we came, the SS men came for us and we was going on that card (ph) of assessment, and first time we saw what he meant.</span> <span id="s571">First the prisoners, female prisoners, their head was shaved and they looked awful.</span> <span id="s572">And when we saw the presence of the hats right, that we should not see them.</span> <span id="s573">But we saw them.</span> <span id="s574">We were shocked.</span> <span id="s575">When we

were many private firms which were contracted by the SS, and these private firms had so-called civil workers.</span> <span id="s636">(Civil workers?)</span> <span id="s637">Civil workers who were the experts in some food, in some, some experts in some disciplines, yes.</span> <span id="s638">To make roads and to build this and this.</span> <span id="s639">And this had a bunch from Gestapo and they

prisoners, only this guard, yes.</span> <span id="s641">And the guard always was, they only give orders what to do, but we should never speak with them.</span> <span id="s642">But nevertheless, this

that we have the tools and bring it to this and this kappo (ph).</span> <span id="s653">And we didn't knew how dangerous this is.</span> <span id="s654">We didn't know what he send us.</span> <span id="s655">So we thought, and we were not catched at this time.</span> <span id="s656">So we were, yes, we were in his protection.</span> <span id="s657">And as I _________, so I have these twenty marks, you still remember, and we told him, so the kappo (ph) is so nice to us, yes, and we should give him a present.</span> <span id="s658">So we five, our group.</span> <span id="s659">So we decided, we did, Willie Nachtman and I, we would go to this Winand (ph), this kappo, he had his own room, and we came to him, and uh, he had very good supper with rootgaren (ph), with sausages, and this, this, and we told him, look, you are very nice to us, and we will give you present.</span> <span id="s660">And we brought him this, this, this twenty marks.</span> <span id="s661">And he laughed

and later there was a need of slosher, there was a need of installers, tilers, of electricians, and so it came and built, and they make a maintenance squad, prisoners maintenance squad.</span> <span id="s668">And the uh sharführer (ph), an SS man, and he asked us to keep all technical installment in the camp in order.</span> <span id="s669">And so he always took a professional for every, and we worked then regularly.</span> <span id="s670">We had a, a workshop, and so we knew the organization, we had connections to the kappos, and so we observed what is it.</span> <span id="s671">So during this two years, this twenty-eight months exactly, so I could observe, and we were going from one camp to another.</span> <span id="s672">There were several camps in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s673">And we had a boomshk (ph), you know, a permit, that we are authorized to repair these pipes and this and this and this.</span> <span id="s674">And we always get from this sharführer (ph) a letter where we should go.</span> <span id="s675">By the time we could choose alone the work where we will go, and we brought him always something, what he would have, a gold or something, what will you bring.</span> <span id="s676">He knew, he used us to organize for him.</span> <span id="s677">From Kanada (ph), from sonderkommando so.</span> <span id="s678">And by this, we, we, the best ______, we had no hunger.</span> <span id="s679">We had so many to eat that we could support about twenty others, yes.</span> <span id="s680">And when we came in the kitchen, there were in every camp kitchen forty kettles of uh steam kettles, where it was cooked, the food for all these prisoners, and uh, they asked we should repair these kettles, and by the time we learned how to, in the beginning we didn't know nothing, but later we knew how to handle it, to repair and we always get some food for this repairing, from the SS men, from the accessory men, that they were, couldn't handle it and they needed it and so.</span> <span id="s681">And so we could organize food for other people and to help them.</span> <span id="s682">But then I saw what it was not possible that we could survive.</span> <span id="s683">I saw it was not possible.</span> <span id="s684">Why?</span> <span id="s685">That we were secret keeper.</span> <span id="s686">Yes.</span> <span id="s687">________ like the sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s688">We see so much, so we got on the list of secret keepers.</span> <span id="s689">(Secret keepers?)</span> <span id="s690">Secret keepers, bearers (ph), ah, yes, you know, secret bearers (ph).</span> <span id="s691">And we knew, we should be killed, we should be shot, and there were some periods that they would exchange us.</span> <span id="s692">But the other

reports.</span> <span id="s696">So what I observed every day I came to the ramp, I saw the selections exactly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s698">You said that saw the cremetorium being built.</span> <span id="s699">Describe, can you talk about how it was built, and when, and when the first gassings started in the cremetorium itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: The cremetoria were built up, yes, and they were ready I think in March, the first cremetorium in March was put in operation.</span> <span id="s701">(March '42?)</span> <span id="s702">Yes.</span> <span id="s703">We cannot came to the cremetoria when they were operating, but when they were not operating some pipes were leaking or something was necessary, an electrician also.</span> <span id="s704">So we came and the guard there, and the guard was very exacting.</span> <span id="s705">He couldn't speak with the people in this cremetory, it was sonderkommando, but we saw, we saw the corpses.</span> <span id="s706">We saw not the - and this, you know, as I told you, this, this uh bunkers, these adapted cremetories, stopped the work and the sonderkommando came, but not I must, I forgot to tell you one very important thing.</span> <span id="s707">How I came to contact this underground.</span> <span id="s708">So there still was, as I told you, a block when the sonderkommando was guarded, and there were about three hundred men, and they were under the guard always going to this Birkenau, to this woods, and they came back and they, it was prohibited to contact them.</span> <span id="s709">And when I was going with my uh, with my box and one of these blocks, sonderkommando, blockältester, the Jew, when I came nearer I saw that he was a Jew, and here S S, Slovak, you know, a very nationality, he had a sign.</span> <span id="s710">When you have this Jewish uh David Star.</span> <span id="s711">So you have inside the sign if you were Greek, G, if you were Czech - C, if you were Slovak, an S.</span> <span id="s712">So I saw Slovak, so I asked him that is my countryman.</span> <span id="s713">______________ What are you doing here, I asked him where from you are, and so.</span> <span id="s714">We were _______, we were friends.</span> <span id="s715">Even _____________.</span> <span id="s716">And he told me this--I never forget: "We are Chevra Kaddisha."</span> <span id="s717">You know what is the Chevra Kaddisha.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s719">Explain it to the camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s721">Chevra Kaddisha, so it is a saint [NB: sacred] burial society of Jews.</span> <span id="s722">So I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s723">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s724">And he told me, "Look.</span> <span id="s725">There...in the woods about two miles, there are some adapted gas chambers from the farm houses.</span> <span id="s726">And this sonderkommando is pulling out the corpses of the deported people who are in...the forced by the SS men.</span> <span id="s727">And after they are dead, so they are pulling their corpses from this _____.</span> <span

<span id="s731">Yes.</span> <span id="s732">And the water for the whole vicinity.</span> <span id="s733">And so it was decided to burn---not to bury, to burn.</span> <span id="s734">So now this sonderkommando was more...hundred more people; and they are digging out these graves, mass graves, and the decaying corpses they are lying them on their on their lorries--small wagons--narrow way,

night shift."</span> <span id="s739">And he asked me if I can make a lock or something to repair for him.</span> <span id="s740">And so he told, but I would not believe it.</span> <span id="s741">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s742">And he told me (whispered), "You don't believe it."</span> <span id="s743">I couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s744">Look, I was three years in the camp at the time.</span> <span id="s745">"And look, so you will see it."</span> <span id="s746">And I didn't know.</span> <span id="s747">A few days, came an SS man for me to this kapo.</span> <span id="s748">He needs a schlosser [Ger: "locksmith, mechanic or fitter"], a blacksmith, to repair a bearing in this wagon.</span> <span id="s749">You know a bearing.</span> <span id="s750">And he took me and brought me there, and he stand nearby me when I make this metal (ph), this bearing house from this wagon which was broke.</span> <span id="s751">And I saw it.</span> <span id="s752">I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando, Slovak prisoners, uh buried...uh took...digged out these open graves.</span> <span id="s753">And as they came, the corpses put on these wagons, and brought them back where they were.</span> <span id="s754">And from far, I saw also this white bunk house, bunkers--this farm house, where this...I saw it.</span> <span id="s755">So from this, moment I believe it.</span> <span

from these one thousand men, three hundred; and they brought...they used them for this sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s758">Yes, and there was the first sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s759">And short after, I think in December, they organized a mass escape.</span> <span id="s760">And somebody traited...was a traitor and who thought he will save his own life, and he told it to the SS men.</span> <span id="s761">And the whole sonderkommando was uh ...one day the whole sonderkommando, and they took them to Auschwitz I and they shot them and burned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Tell me about the mass escape which was planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes, the mass escape of this sonderkommando was planned at that time was possible to escape, the fences were not so tight, Birkenau, it was in the middle of the woods and so on, and there were some escapes, yes, but you must see that people refused to work.</span> <span id="s764">But in the moment when they refused to work, or didn't work good, the _____ they shot, the SS men shot them, on the spot, yes.</span> <span id="s765">And uh this, and their blockältester (ph) this Rosin (ph) ______________________, and still he is living.</span> <span id="s766">You should hear him.</span> <span id="s767">Yes, I will give you that.</span> <span id="s768">This Rosin, Arnold Rosin (ph), he is the only one from this other commando who survived.</span> <span id="s769">Only first.</span> <span id="s770">Others, all were destroyed, yes.</span> <span id="s771">It is in my articles.</span> <span id="s772">How, it is interesting how he survived this.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Tell how, describe the plan of the revolt, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I know, look, they tried that they will go, they will uh, they will go far behind the, the uh fenced, behind the area of the, there was no fence.</span> <span id="s775">Behind the area where the, the bunkers were yes.</span> <span id="s776">It was not fenced.</span> <span id="s777">There were SS men, the guards, they were surrounding them, yes.</span> <span id="s778">And they told, they were, they were uh, inbofond (ph).</span> <span id="s779">There were some guards they will kill and they will go to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s780">They organize some cars, yes, and an SS man was involved in this who was a Slovak SS man, yes, a Slovak.</span> <span id="s781">And uh, they believed him, and uh, there very exact uh details are not now, maybe there was once, but that, that, and the fact that it was uh, told to SS men, yes, and the one who told it, yes, they killed him with an axe.</span> <span id="s782">This traitor, they killed him.</span> <span id="s783">They killed him, but it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: The Jews killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Yes, the Jews killed him.</span> <span id="s786">The name isn't known at all, in the details.</span> <span id="s787">And so, and exactly four days or five days later came a new transport from Polish ghettos, and from this transport they took a new sonderkommando, about three hundred men, and from this survived several and I have very detailed uh testimonies of them, and so, and also from this Rosen (ph).</span> <span id="s788">From this Rosen (ph) I have this hugh, he escaped later from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s789">Uh we know how he saved Europe, how he saved.</span> <span id="s790">Look, it was forbidden to get from this sonderkommando commando, to the other _____________, to transport to another, nobody could go away from this other commando.</span> <span id="s791">But this Rosen (ph), he found a, bread, you know, a whole bread, and when he break this bread, inside in this bread was a golden chain and a gold watch, yes.</span> <span id="s792">Inside, from the deportees.</span> <span id="s793">Someone told it will save his life, so brought him this.</span> <span id="s794">And so he was on the block and he gave this a ______ to the blockältester, _______________.</span> <span id="s795">(Say it again in English.)</span> <span id="s796">Yes, the blockältester was the boss of the block, normally a prisoner or ______________.</span> <span id="s797">And the schreiber [Ger: scribe], the clerk, who was his aide, was also.</span> <span id="s798">And he corrupted, he gave these valuables, these forms to them and they asked him they should transfer him to another block.</span> <span id="s799">Even it, it was written, they did it by the way he is a ill and so on.</span> <span id="s800">Even so, and through the infirmary they got him in another block, you known, transmitted.</span> <span id="s801">SO he was not there, in this block.</span> <span id="s802">And so he saved his life, and he is still living, yes.</span> <span id="s803">Arnold Rosin (ph) is his name.</span> <span id="s804">So this I will, (let's come back to you), yes, so now you see, so I, how I make the first contact with this other commando with all these people.</span> <span id="s805">So I had a survey, how, what, how the barracks.</span> <span id="s806">And so I give it to underground and it was the central, was in Auschwitz I, but there was some prisoners, Shmuleski and so on who came in this Auschwitz I who was a tiler you know from the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: O.K. Slow down and explain a little more about this whole underground network and your involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yes, so there was an underground of mainly, in the Polish camps, yes, the Polish, but non-Jews.</span> <span id="s809">And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp, in the main camp.</span> <span id="s810">And the head of this, this I didn't knew at that time, but how was it, Cirankiewicz (ph), later the Minister President of the Polish Republic, he was and he was at that time uh, uh nurse on the, he was prisoner, political prisoner, Polish prisoner, and he was a nurse on the prison uh infirmary.</span> <span id="s811">And he has some group, so-called camp group (ph) of Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz, but there was Austians, some French and some Poles.</span> <span id="s812">They didn't took a Jew inside, yes.</span> <span id="s813">They used the services of Jews but a Jew was not in there, yes.</span> <span id="s814">And one of these liaisons was David Shmuleski (ph).</span> <span id="s815">He was a Jew who was fighting in the Spanish, uh, against Franco ( .</span> <span id="s816">.</span> <span id="s817">civil war).</span> <span id="s818">Later he was transported when they lost, so he was in France, to Drancy, and from Drancy came on transport to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s819">And Shmuleski came with this, but he has also very many friends in this, uh, underground.</span> <span id="s820">Yes.</span> <span id="s821">They trusted him.</span> <span id="s822">And so he was a liaison between Birkenau and Auschwitz I. And when he was a roofer, yes, on the roof, you know, the tar, and on the roof is the tar, they were putting roofs and the covered with the tar, youknow, with the paper, you know with this.</span> <span id="s823">And for tar, it must be the store for tar was in Auschwitz I, in the main camp, and so from time to time he came to Auschwitz I.</span> <span id="s824">We came also from time for some material we needed, so we came to Auschwitz I, only as uh with a guarded with an SS man, but we had connections.</span> <span id="s825">And this uh Shmuleski (ph), make the connections with this main camp, and they, and so I gave this and he told, you should all observe and tell me and we will, the Polish uh prisoners have contact with the Polish government in London.</span> <span id="s826">They have contact through Armia Kraiova.</span> <span id="s827">We have note from Birkenau, but we, he told us, not names, but he, and this he, he knew much, but we knew the details, more details.</span> <span id="s828">So I told him the details and he gave it further to this uh, to this uh camp group at Auschwitz, this fighting group at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s829">And they have the contact.</span> <span id="s830">But later we knew that they are guarding only their own interests.</span> <span id="s831">For Jews, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s832">So we then, later we find some Czech-Polish, some Czech civil workers, you know, who worked, but they were Czechs, yes, and the detail how it worked we have three.</span> <span id="s833">And they came from time to time, in three months they could go travel to their families to Czechlovakia.</span> <span id="s834">And even if they were guarded, they were civil workers, as I told you, at the civil enterprise which were, so one was a carpenter, one make roofs, and one was expert for the canalization, yes for the canalization, the _____ the channels (ph), and for water pipes and so.</span> <span id="s835">We make with them connections and so were were connected, and we also, we could stole plans, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: How did you steal plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Somebody would not believe it.</span> <span id="s838">How it was possible.</span> <span id="s839">It's already, I can show you a letter from Polish museum I got now, a certification for it .</span> <span id="s840">.</span> <span id="s841">There was a so-called Baulaitung of Auschwitz, a construction office, a hugh construction office of SS, who made the planning and construction of their hugh camps and of the cremetoria, the gas chambers, yes, there was a hugh office, there were several hundred.</span> <span id="s842">But they also took some prisoners, some uh, qualified prisoners.</span> <span id="s843">So there was, for instance, an engineer, Vera Foltinf (ph).</span> <span id="s844">He was an architect, an engineer.</span> <span id="s845">So they took him to draw the plans, see, in the office.</span> <span id="s846">There was Bitterman, he was an engineer, so they took him and he was in the commando.</span> <span id="s847">He took there and in the office he drawed (ph) for the SS men.</span> <span id="s848">And so we pursuaded him he should make a small copies of the plans.</span> <span id="s849">And he smuggled it out, and we gave it later to these civil workers, and it came to Prague, and the wife of Kraus, my friend who was non-Jewish, and he was, he had contact through the Swiss consulate in Prague.</span> <span id="s850">And so the plans went to the Swiss consulate, through this.</span> <span id="s851">An original of these plans are in The Death Factory, exactly the plans, yes.</span> <span id="s852">They were later when it was this, maybe you know this, when it was revived the Holocaust when the CIA make these pictures, you know, the Americans photographed Auschwitz, (right), you know this, exactly, but they told they didn't knew.</span> <span id="s853">They never bombed.</span> <span id="s854">Yes.</span> <span id="s855">And later, after many years, they make, they published it publically, the, all these pictures.</span> <span id="s856">There were seven raids on Auschwitz, and there is also written that _____________ is make according to that factory, they ask that the plans are so exactly, when you see it from, so you see the prints, the basement prints, exactly what we stole from this, from this factory.</span> <span id="s857">So it was, and so we had luck.</span> <span id="s858">We were lucky that uh, there were many people who paid with life this activity yes.</span> <span id="s859">But, and so, that I told you, I was conscious that I can not, it was not according to the human calculation that you would survive.</span> <span id="s860">Yes.</span> <span id="s861">Especially they guarded us.</span> <span id="s862">Yes.</span> <span id="s863">So I remember once I was going, it was in '44, in autumn, I was going through the uh, the gate.</span> <span id="s864">And always there was a guard.</span> <span id="s865">And I always must tell hälfling numeral this and this number are going there and there.</span> <span id="s866">And he mark the number where I am in the camp.</span> <span id="s867">Yes.</span> <span id="s868">That is in evidence.</span> <span id="s869">I was going, always without guard, in this guarded area.</span> <span id="s870">I could go without guard when I had this permission; and I told him the number--73,000.</span> <span id="s871">And there was already 400,000 tattooed.</span> <span id="s872">"So what, 73,000, __(ph)__?</span> <span id="s873">Repeat!"</span> <span id="s874">I repeat.</span> <span id="s875">He jumped and go and look on my... "And how's that you are not dead?</span> <span id="s876">You should be dead.</span> <span id="s877">This is not possible!"</span> <span id="s878">So I told him, "Look, I have this...I am expert in this."</span> <span id="s879">"Oh, you should not be...you will not alive.</span> <span id="s880">You will not wait, Ivan.</span> <span id="s881">We have five, you will not wait alive Ivan.</span> <span id="s882">You cannot expect that, Ivan.</span> <span id="s883">We will save you, yes, the Russians, yes," he told.</span> <span id="s884">______________________.</span> <span id="s885">Five minutes before and we , we will shot you said the SS man, very, very angry, yes.</span> <span id="s886">So, such an experience.</span> <span id="s887">So nevertheless, so uh, I was uh, _______________ crematoria then when they come and</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Can't hear you.</span> <span id="s889">A little louder.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: I am...

<span id="s1066">So they give him a kick hard.</span> <span id="s1067">Yes.</span> <span id="s1068">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1069">This moment when he told I never will denounce an SS man, why all the SS men were involved in some way with the prisoners, and so when they saw, this is in all prisoners, and he, he will never, in this situation he will not denounce an SS man, so he is a good man.</span> <span id="s1070">So they kicked him out, and he came back laughing.</span> <span id="s1071">He told I was so quiet with this injection, so quiet that I didn't feel it, danger, nothing.</span> <span id="s1072">I was very quiet like comrades to the SS.</span> <span id="s1073">So, yes, also Brazovsky they let him in the ______, was in the infirmary, and also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: That's quite a tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: So, also this, such, this not the only case.</span> <span id="s1076">There were another when we have a radio, and so.</span> <span id="s1077">But this, I never will forget, this one when Kraus came back laughing after this and told this story.</span> <span id="s1078">Yes.</span> <span id="s1079">But later, they make the photographs, later.</span> <span id="s1080">There are known, these photographs, these three or four photographs, and I discovered in the bathroom they were made and the stories about them, it's not true that Shmuleski made them.</span> <span id="s1081">It's told Shmuleski told he made them but it's not true.</span> <span id="s1082">I later discovered who, why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Who made them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: It made, a Polish, a Greek officer, a young Greek officer.</span> <span id="s1085">Who later tried to escape and were killed.</span> <span id="s1086">Uh, I puzzled the place where from it was done.</span> <span id="s1087">Shmulevski told it was done from the roof, yes, and he told him but he wouldn't ________.</span> <span id="s1088">And so, but when I was in Yad Vashem working, and so I showed these photographs to a photographer who was there and he asked me how it was done.</span> <span id="s1089">I told him from the roof.</span> <span id="s1090">It is not possible, the angle is not possible from the roof, it is not possible.</span> <span id="s1091">And yes, he was true.</span> <span id="s1092">And later I know how it was from the frame, we found the frame of the gas chamber in the cremetorium number four, there from it was done.</span> <span id="s1093">Yes, so this is the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s1095">Let's go back to you, go back to Erich Kulka.</span> <span id="s1096">What happened after that camera incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: After the camera incident, nothing.</span> <span id="s1098">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1099">With this moment when he told if I ____________the SS man, it was forgotten - no medal, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s1101">What did you do, you were involved with the underground at that point and kind of with a commando, what kinds of things were you involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Look, always...every man who survived long time and held the position...look, it was the surviving.</span> <span id="s1103">It was possible to survive for eight or three, four, five percent of people to survive.</span> <span id="s1104">Who--people, prisoners--who had a luck to get the job which the SS men needed.</span> <span id="s1105">This were the doctors, the nurses, and all kinds of artisans--tilers, and so on.</span> <span id="s1106">They needed them.</span> <span id="s1107">Therefore, first they had a better possibility to move.</span> <span id="s1108">They had the possibility to eat, yes, to organize food; and they had always some connections.</span> <span id="s1109">Sometimes the connections were very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1110">The SS men shoot the people and so on.</span> <span id="s1111">When they feel they are in danger, yes.</span> <span id="s1112">So you were never very sure of this.</span> <span id="s1113">So connections, I __________ in Kanada.</span> <span id="s1114">And so, in the Kanada ...look, the Kanada...the details.</span> <span id="s1115">Kanada was very, uh very severely watched, yes; if they are organizing, if they came to the camp, they were always checked.</span> <span id="s1116">And so, in spite the SS men knew that they are organizing and in spite they always are interested that they should organize for them, yes.</span> <span id="s1117">So it was so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Be specific.</span> <span id="s1119">You are talking about bribes and the cheating...</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yes, now.</span> <span id="s1121">So look, the Kanada had this special camp.</span> <span id="s1122">It was E..</span> <span id="s1123">.</span> <span id="s1124">Camp E..</span> <span id="s1125">.</span> <span id="s1126">I forget.</span> <span id="s1127">G camp.</span> <span id="s1128">I can show you on the plan.</span> <span id="s1129">In this camp, there were about thirty barracks, like prisoner barracks.</span> <span id="s1130">And in these barracks were sorted all the belongs which the...the...which were taken off from the deportees.</span> <span id="s1131">Yes.</span> <span id="s1132">And in these barracks, when they came, they was sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s1133">The prisoners, they must go and take off all their uh _____.</span> <span id="s1134">And in another barrack, they got another uh suits, clothes.</span> <span id="s1135">So...and when they returned they must...they must make also in one barrack, and then another.</span> <span id="s1136">So they could not keep, or very hard to keep, something in their raiments.</span> <span id="s1137">The same was with the SS men, the SS men who observed; they came to the Gestapo, they came to make SS _________, shower, and in an elegant way.</span> <span id="s1138">And also must keep their...their suits.</span> <span id="s1139">They get other suits; and through the Gestapo...through the bathroom, yes.</span> <span id="s1140">So also they could keep.</span> <span id="s1141">So who could keep.</span> <span id="s1142">Sometimes they managed.</span> <span id="s1143">But the...the artisans, for instance, we were called to repair electrician, or to repair a pipe or repair something.</span> <span id="s1144">I remember an SS man asked when we should organize for him a fur, yes.</span> <span id="s1145">Organize it a fur.</span> <span id="s1146">A real fur, yes.</span> <span id="s1147">A nice fur for his wife.</span> <span id="s1148">So when we came to this, when we have some work in Kanada, we knew that we would come there.</span> <span id="s1149">So there the floor was...there was no planks, nothing.</span> <span id="s1150">It was mud, on the...such...packed.</span> <span id="s1151">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Oh, O.K. Packed dirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1154">Packed dirt, yes.</span> <span id="s1155">And so we contacted these from Kanada, the prisoners which were in a neighboring camp.</span> <span id="s1156">And he promised he will dig in in the floor something what we were interested, some ring or brilliant--something small.</span> <span id="s1157">And we had in our uh boxes, __________, water crane (ph), uh, water pipe.</span> <span id="s1158">Yes, this...what is water running, what is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: The water closets, they're for the pipes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A; For the pipes.</span> <span id="s1161">No, when the water is running?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Faucet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Faucet.</span> <span id="s1164">And in the middle of this faucet is such a hat (ph) you know, if you can dismantle it.</span> <span id="s1165">So you can in the middle of this such a hat (ph).</span> <span id="s1166">And this we operated out, and there we put this contraband, you know.</span> <span id="s1167">And we screwed it very tightly.</span> <span id="s1168">And so...we were going, so we checked this and this.</span> <span id="s1169">But he didn't find.</span> <span id="s1170">And so, I wanted to how...how they traded (ph) the SS men with us.</span> <span id="s1171">So before we came from our camp, it was the camp __________ to the camp ______, we had to pass three different guards, guard barracks, yes.</span> <span id="s1172">And so when we came from one camp, so the SS men told, "Look, what you bring?</span> <span id="s1173">I know the rings or watch or something."</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: The SS men knew about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1176">You in Kanada, so you bring this and this.</span> <span id="s1177">They knew.</span> <span id="s1178">And he found another SS man, and told, "Look, this uh blacksmiths, they will bring some valuables.</span> <span id="s1179">If you will find them, you can have it."</span> <span id="s1180">So...so we were going through this.</span> <span id="s1181">And the SS men [said], "You have something."</span> <span id="s1182">"No.</span> <span id="s1183">We have nothing."</span> <span id="s1184">So we tried and ______ and they didn't find.</span> <span id="s1185">And this SS man, when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: "So where have you...?"</span> <span id="s1186">"Uh, be patient.</span> <span id="s1187">We will bring it to you."</span> <span id="s1188">So we came to our...our maintenance barrack squad, into shop, of the squad, and the ____________.</span> <span id="s1189">And for our eyes he was a good ring or something.</span> <span id="s1190">He phoned to another SS man, before me, _____ you fool, how did you check these people.</span> <span id="s1191">They brought it.</span> <span id="s1192">Yes, so if, he asked how it's our secret.</span> <span id="s1193">So this is the way, but we were sure, if he would find this prisoners who make this organization, gold or something very valuable, he would give him slip and he would sew in pocket.</span> <span id="s1194">He would not _______.</span> <span id="s1195">But even if he would find a letter, even so innocent letter from a wife to a man at another camp, immediately he would take a notice to a Gestapo office, and they would brought you and murder you and kill you.</span> <span id="s1196">Just, even make a case, a great case of a spy.</span> <span id="s1197">And I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1198">But _______________ they never make it _____, the SS men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: They would put it in their pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yes, they were very eager to get some value from this.</span> <span id="s1201">And this I knew.</span> <span id="s1202">Yes.</span> <span id="s1203">So this was, but it was dangerous, but it happened sometimes, this.</span> <span id="s1204">So this I explain you, the Kanada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Take us down to the liberation and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Look, the liberation, so it was, you don't understand.</span> <span id="s1207">I will tell you also that my wife and my eleven-year son came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1208">They were in Theresienstadt when I was already long time in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1209">Normally, the deportees were always selected and the wives with children were put in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1210">It was normal.</span> <span id="s1211">But the first time into us, in September 1943, it came from Theresienstadt a transport of Czech prisoners.</span> <span id="s1212">And no of them were selected and all were put in a special camp, so-called a Czech "family camp."</span> <span id="s1213">In Birkenau it was a camp.</span> <span id="s1214">And nobody was allowed to go from the camp, and nobody was allowed to go in.</span> <span id="s1215">It was isolated.</span> <span id="s1216">The people were not shaved their hair.</span> <span id="s1217">They didn't work opposite...outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1218">They get the better food.</span> <span id="s1219">And there were rumors that they will be exchanged for German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1220">Yes.</span> <span id="s1221">And they believe it, believe it all.</span> <span id="s1222">They had special rights, special conditions.</span> <span id="s1223">And there was in my wife and our family, and my son also.</span> <span id="s1224">So I also...yes.</span> <span id="s1225">But we couldn't believe for the first time they took the transport to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1226">And the reason for this was that there were rumors that from Theresienstadt, who was proclaimed as special and prominent uh ghetto, yes, that the people were deported to the east and killed.</span> <span id="s1227">There were rumors.</span> <span id="s1228">So that they would uh block these rumors.</span> <span id="s1229">And these people who came to Theresienstadt from the camp, they must write every month a letter to Theresienstadt or to other.</span> <span id="s1230">And they wrote a letter and could ask for to send them a package of food; and they got the food from Portugal, from France, from Switzerland, yes.</span> <span id="s1231">And they wrote letters to Theresienstadt, where their relatives or friends were.</span> <span id="s1232">But the address to avoid any connection with Auschwitz; so they wrote the address: "Arbeitslager Birkenau."</span> <span id="s1233">This [means] "working camp Birkenau."</span> <span id="s1234">"Bei Neu Bieru_"--it's near Neu Bieru_.</span> <span id="s1235">It was about nine kilometers far.</span> <span id="s1236">There was a post office there, you could find it on the map.</span> <span id="s1237">"Lagerstrasse" and number--it is a street, a camp street; this house number, and this and this.</span> <span id="s1238">So they avoid any... And so they came to [NB: from] Theresienstadt, a new camp, a working camp it's all.</span> <span id="s1239">There were some...in the text we tried to mark it in hiding the letter that there is a camp of that, and we need some people that were already dead.</span> <span id="s1240">But they couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s1241">But after half a year, they had decided the whole camp to anihilate.</span> <span id="s1242">They put them all in the gas chambers, yes.</span> <span id="s1243">And in this camp also was my son and my wife, and also in this transport.</span> <span id="s1244">And by...it was in the records, my son at the time he was in infection block in this camp.</span> <span id="s1245">And in this infection block were already about twenty prisoners from Mengele with the twins who make these experiments, yes.</span> <span id="s1246">And my son, he was...he called a "pocket schwartze"--black pockets--you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Black lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: ...this un infection, __________, this cough, it was infection.</span> <span id="s1249">And he was put on this infection block with some others.</span> <span id="s1250">And the people, they would not believe.</span> <span id="s1251">If we knew it, or the underground, or on the seventh of September, or seventh March, we got message from family, from women's camp, there was a secretary, a prisoner, who had some phone call from an officer that they should prepare ___________.</span> <span id="s1252">Look, it means that they should prepare the killing of this whole camp from, the family camp.</span> <span id="s1253">And we warned them, they would not believe it, they told it's not possible.</span> <span id="s1254">Eichmann was there three months ago and they educated children, they had a school for children, they was interested in education.</span> <span id="s1255">They could not believe it.</span> <span id="s1256">But why believe and they ask me if we should.</span> <span id="s1257">I came there only on my occupation as a plumber, to repair these kettles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So you saw your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1260">So with this they didn't knew it, that I have the wife, the SS men, in the camp.</span> <span id="s1261">But through this...my profession, I could contact my wife and my son.</span> <span id="s1262">And I arranged, she asked me, when she believed.</span> <span id="s1263">Helga believed.</span> <span id="s1264">And there were so many tricks what the SS men made they shouldn't believe that they believe more the SS men than they did us.</span> <span id="s1265">Yes, I wrote it all, this.</span> <span id="s1266">And I suceed, managed with a doctor that he gave to my wife injection and he was as some signs of typhoid fever and they took them one, one night before the liquidation of the camp, to this block, to this infirmary, epidemic block 32.</span> <span id="s1267">And this they couldn't took.</span> <span id="s1268">Only this best, there were some _______________ so they didn't took this block.</span> <span id="s1269">So they survived.</span> <span id="s1270">Unbelievable, yes.</span> <span id="s1271">I wrote this many, many times.</span> <span id="s1272">I just wrote I will, maybe I forgot to give it to you, the first time after fifty years, thirty years, I wrote the story about my escape and survival, my son in a special about seventy pages.</span> <span id="s1273">I will send it to you.</span> <span id="s1274">So this is the family camp.</span> <span id="s1275">It was liquidated in one night.</span> <span id="s1276">It was under commmando.</span> <span id="s1277">They tried to make a ________, yes, to burn the blocks, it was straw and wood with some fuel, you know, in this lighters, in this fuel, when you have the lighters for cigarette, there is a fuels, some small fuel, ampules (ph), and this we delivered to them from Kanada, many, much, but they didn't believe and they didn't make it, an uprising.</span> <span id="s1278">So that much details.</span> <span id="s1279">So, this was the very strong thing.</span> <span id="s1280">But now, will this sonderkommando, the uprising of this sonderkommando, maybe, and then the escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Talk about you know and your escape from the train and your escape from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1283">So this sonderkommando, I give you a story.</span> <span id="s1284">The escape.</span> <span id="s1285">So now it came to the evacuation.</span> <span id="s1286">We didn't believe and once it was in January, on the second of November, the gassing was stopped.</span> <span id="s1287">I remember it very good.</span> <span id="s1288">There was a transport from Slovakia and they was, there were no, they came all to camp, none came to the selection, none came to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1289">And then, they ordered the dismantling and destroying of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1290">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: This is November 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: 1944.</span> <span id="s1293">And before, also, there were a huge transport from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1294">And it was the top of the destruction, they twenty thousand a day, during this Hungarian transport.</span> <span id="s1295">And this sonderkommando brought about nine hundred people.</span> <span id="s1296">And they liquidated two hundred and two hundred and for the liquidation.</span> <span id="s1297">They other three hundred, these sonderkommando knew it and from the despair they made uprising and they killed three SS men, they wounded twelve, but four hundred and fifty were killed and they burned as the cremetorium number four was put in fire and was put out of operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: You said four of us.</span> <span id="s1299">You were part of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: What I told for us.</span> <span id="s1301">No.</span> <span id="s1302">Look, I was not in this sonderkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: No, I didn't think you were.</span> <span id="s1304">That's why I .</span> <span id="s1305">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No.</span> <span id="s1307">We observed this, and I heard it, how, and I believed in the beginning that it was useless, the powder, this _______ this podwer for this, the crash of this when the roof collapsed, when the roof collapsed was so strong that it looked like explosion.</span> <span id="s1308">But later it turned out it was not, and it is written, this article which I will give you.</span> <span id="s1309">But now, this destruction.</span> <span id="s1310">So the cremetoria, this one cremetorium was put out of operations on the 7th of October 1944, from sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s1311">They proved that it was possible to destroy with own hands and force the killing facilities.</span> <span id="s1312">But only the destruct (ph) group at Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1313">They promise them help, and they never get help.</span> <span id="s1314">In the last moment they refused, the Polish.</span> <span id="s1315">And they told later, it was in a document, they told that we will dare to make an uprising only in the moment when we are in the such stage, endangered as the Jews.</span> <span id="s1316">Until that moment, the Polish, the non-Jews were not put to the gas chambers from the transport, only when they were ill and.</span> <span id="s1317">So later, three times they traited, they didn't keep their vow, they didn't help.</span> <span id="s1318">So, there was one cremetoria was destroyed by prisoners.</span> <span id="s1319">The two other cremetorias, the SS men, they exploded them.</span> <span id="s1320">But there still are traces in Auchwitz, yes, you have the gas chambers, and the dismantling rooms, you can see them exactly.</span> <span id="s1321">And they make a hugh dismantling commando, mainly for women, and they cleaned the bricks, one brick after another, and they put it on the wagons in a very nice manner.</span> <span id="s1322">Like the German are accustomed.</span> <span id="s1323">And we, the schlossers, the plumbers, the artists, the commando, this Steimitz, Oberscharführer who were in charge of commando, he asked that we should dismantle this ventilaters, the pieces of the furnaces (ph) and we dismantled it and it was put in conserve with vaseline and put in tight paper nice and put in the wagons.</span> <span id="s1324">And I asked this Steimitz, I asked him had Herr Oberscharführer, where did you get it.</span> <span id="s1325">I was good with him, he asked sometimes what will you bring me, so I asked him, the Jews are alredy anhilated, and war will be finished.</span> <span id="s1326">What will you do with this equipment?</span> <span id="s1327">And he told me this.</span> <span id="s1328">I will tell in German, original.</span> <span id="s1329">I never forget it.</span> <span id="s1330">________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________.</span> <span id="s1331">I will translate it for you.</span> <span id="s1332">"Look, Jew," he told me, "our Führer has a secret weapon.</span> <span id="s1333">Now it will come over Europe.</span> <span id="s1334">And then will come the downfall of the Poles and Czechs, and we will finish them quicker than the Jews."</span> <span id="s1335">So it was on the 26th of December, 1944.</span> <span id="s1336">I never will forget this moment.</span> <span id="s1337">Yes.</span> <span id="s1338">This Steimitz.</span> <span id="s1339">I later found him...when I identified an SS man, I found him in the SS hospital in Zelek (ph) in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1340">So this is the...now the escape, yes.</span> <span id="s1341">So it...one day, three or four days, it came ordered that they should burn all the documents which were in the blocks, you know--the cards, the names, the list, it was burned.</span> <span id="s1342">The officers disappeared, the SS officers.</span> <span id="s1343">There were only the surgeons, and these law officers.</span> <span id="s1344">And on the 18th of November it was ordered evacuation.</span> <span id="s1345">So there were still about in, about 50 or 60,000 prisoners in there all, the Auschwitz camps.</span> <span id="s1346">There were many...39 camps, 39.</span> <span id="s1347">And we... So I was Birkenau, was about 16,000, yes.</span> <span id="s1348">First we tried...we had...we organized a nice uh clothes, civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1349">And the prisoners want to only for them, and good boots.</span> <span id="s1350">And so we tried, we would wait when the Russian came, it was before.</span> <span id="s1351">So we digged near our workshop a hole, and we tried that we will hide, make a hidden entrance.</span> <span id="s1352">O.K., we tried; we are three or four.</span> <span id="s1353">But then when the SS men make these empty...the camps, so they came with bloodhounds there.</span> <span id="s1354">And if they found somebody they shot him on the spot.</span> <span id="s1355">So we...we... So it is not possible; so we came to this transport.</span> <span id="s1356">There was about one thousand, always one thousand prisoners, under the guard of these SS men, and we make three days march 'til we came to the station Loslau (ph).</span> <span id="s1357">And if somebody couldn't go, and was behind, so behind was a special shooting commando, they shot him.</span> <span id="s1358">And I think about half of the prisoners, still they came from our bach (ph) to Loslau to the station where they put us in open coal trucks.</span> <span id="s1359">Open coal trucks.</span> <span id="s1360">They put about more than one hundred in there.</span> <span id="s1361">We were like sardines.</span> <span id="s1362">We can only stand, yes.</span> <span id="s1363">And during the trip, the train was going to Austria, to Mauthausen, through different uh ways.</span> <span id="s1364">And uh many...there was snow.</span> <span id="s1365">It was bitter cold and with high snow.</span> <span id="s1366">And the Poles, the Polish prisoners, they jumped from the train.</span> <span id="s1367">Yes, from train.</span> <span id="s1368">It was an open train, but the SS men had a platform on the back, a platform.</span> <span id="s1369">They had the two wagons, two person wagons, on the platform from planks; and they had lights, reflectors, and they had machine guns...in curves.</span> <span id="s1370">.</span> <span id="s1371">many poles jumped in curves and so we came to Austria.</span> <span id="s1372">The train came through my native land of Czechoslovakia, in the city Ostrava--which I knew very good, coal mines and so on.</span> <span id="s1373">I known it's not far from my home.</span> <span id="s1374">So there was a situation that I, the detail I will give you brochure, there was a situation where it was possible to escape, yes The train stopped there, and they make on the sideline a train, yes, it was not free then.</span> <span id="s1375">And they make a rumor there, the Germans, that the train is bearing the Germans who were bombed from the Allies, and they are telling them they are putting them to death.</span> <span id="s1376">They would not tell that they are prisoners.</span> <span id="s1377">And in Ostrava you have, there are some over-the-train bridges, and uh, the population told that there are Germans and they mobilized some Red _______, you know, Red Cross, the charity.</span> <span id="s1378">And this charity came with two kettles of coffee or something and would help to their own countrymen as they are told that are bombed out, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1379">And when the prisoners, so these kettles, so they try to jump, and the SS men make a barrier and would not allow the contact that when these charity men, _______ and this, and so when the guard came nearer and nearer, and we also jumped with my son, he was eleven years old, from this, and once I saw there is no SS men.</span> <span id="s1380">They shrank (ph) together, but they, they prohibit, should prohibit the contact between these prisoners, they would that the prisoners should go back to the, the tracks and they should not make contact with these charity men with these kettles.</span> <span id="s1381">And when I saw there is nobody, so I run away.</span> <span id="s1382">It was midnight.</span> <span id="s1383">There was shooting and so I, I didn't care.</span> <span id="s1384">We were going, and running and running with my son and so we put off this prisoners' clothes and underneath we have a good civil organized from Kanada, and so it was night, it was curfew, and we, we saw a pit and in this pit there was this colony of miners.</span> <span id="s1385">Yes, the miner, the miners.</span> <span id="s1386">And we saw this small, small...</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: You saw what?</span> <span id="s1388">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Uh, we saw some small houses.</span> <span id="s1390">Yes, family houses of miners, and in so was a very light, a very small light...of light.</span> <span id="s1391">It was...you know.</span> <span id="s1392">And I dared to knock on the door.</span> <span id="s1393">There came, and...a woman, and I asked her if we can get some help.</span> <span id="s1394">And I spoke with the dialect of this country;
