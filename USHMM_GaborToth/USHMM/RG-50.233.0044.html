<html><body><p><span id="s1">Sabina Green January 30, l992 - Brooklyn, New York My name is Sabina Green.</span> <span id="s2">I was born March 23, l922 in Ulanow, Nab-Sanem, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Okay, can you tell me a little bit about your childhood and growing up and how many sisters you had, how many brothers and sisters, about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">The names you want me to tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">If you want to tell me the names, that's alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Yes.</span> <span id="s7">My father's name is Bernard (Barish) and my mother's Feige Low.</span> <span id="s8">This is my maiden name, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Feige?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">No, Low.</span> <span id="s11">L-O-W, and two apostrophes above the O. I had two brothers, Hirsch and Monyak, and a sister, Udel and we had living with us a young boy that my parents took in from the town of Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s12">They were a poor family; they were seven children and my parents took him in.</span> <span id="s13">So he lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Was he a Pole or was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Jewish.</span> <span id="s16">I went to public school as everyone else and afternoons we spent in Bas____(ph-Counter#18) this is the Jewish school where we learned.</span> <span id="s17">It was about 50, 60 children attending that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">What was the difference between the public school?</span> <span id="s19">What did you learn?</span> <span id="s20">Tell me a little bit about what you learned in the public school and then what you learned - Public school we learned the language, mathematics and the regular things that you learned in the public school and in the Jewish school we learned about Jewish history and to read and to write - which is wanted today, Jewish.</span> <span id="s21">And we used to make Jewish shows and it was very nice for us Jewish children to come.</span> <span id="s22">We were very happy there together.</span> <span id="s23">We used to go for trips together to other towns which I loved very much, to meet other children from other towns like ____ and ____ (ph-Counter #26) and it was very interesting for us to go to the Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Can you tell me a little bit about where you lived in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Yes.</span> <span id="s26">We lived - Ulanow is a small town - but the Jewish life was very active.</span> <span id="s27">They had a lot of Jewish organizations like Akibah and the other one where the bigger boys used to go - Betar, and they had a very large library that Ulanow was proud of in all languages, Jewish mainly, Hebrew, Polish and other languages, and everybody used to go and take their books and read.</span> <span id="s28">And the youth of Ulanow was very like - they used to make dances - it was a nice quiet life and I think back now, I think this will never - nobody will ever understand it, how it was - how happy we were with almost nothing.</span> <span id="s29">Next to nothing, and we were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Can you tell me about, can you remember any instances of anti-semitism when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Mainly I remember on Saturday - they had - public schools were open.</span> <span id="s32">We didn't have our homework and when we needed from the girls to get our homework, the parents never permitted it and I couldn't understand it, why they wouldn't let us keep our homework which was like for Monday when we go to school there.</span> <span id="s33">And anti-semitin was all over, like when we were going, Jewish children, they throw stone on us, the Polish children, and we were afraid.</span> <span id="s34">I always used to tell them, "If you do something to me, my older brother, he will catch you and he will pay you back for me".</span> <span id="s35">And, so, this was my excuse always.</span> <span id="s36">And he did.</span> <span id="s37">He never was afraid; he was young, strong man; he was only two years older from me but he was always there for me.</span> <span id="s38">I remember he used to ride on a bicycle; very few children had at that time a bicycle and he taught me how to ride a bicycle which I was very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Do you remember any other instances -you know you said something about throwing rocks - do you remember anything else about people, you know, discriminating against Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">They had leaflets not to go to Jewish stores to shop or there was a barber, a very good barber, a Jewish one, and then they brought from another town another barber, but nobody wanted to go to him because he didn't know how to cut their hair.</span> <span id="s41">So they all went back to the Jewish barber but from the beginning they didn't want to go to the Jewish one.</span> <span id="s42">But they figured now they had a Polish barber they can go to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Okay - can you tell me now a little bit about when the Germans came, when they first got to your town, when it was and - In 1939 when the Germans came in nobody was too much frightened because some people remembered the Germans from other wars, like parents and grandparents and nobody was so afraid of them, but once they came in and they start looking for Jews and catching one or catching a few and take them out of town and kill them and they took people to other towns just for work.</span> <span id="s44">So they took them and they mistreated them, beat them, so later we saw that those are not the Germans what we heard about from our grandparents, or even parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Do you remember - I know that they invaded in September of l939.</span> <span id="s46">Do you remember about what time they got to your town?</span> <span id="s47">Was it late in September or in the middle of September?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">It was the like the end of September I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">When they came into your town did they arrive all at once - did the army come all at once?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">No, no.</span> <span id="s51">They first came few and then later.</span> <span id="s52">Right after a week or so they burned our wonderful synagogue which everybody was proud of.</span> <span id="s53">It was a beautiful synagogue - painted, the ceiling was painted with all ten commandments and all the paintings, and angels.</span> <span id="s54">It was just a beautiful synagogue; so this is what they did.</span> <span id="s55">First they burned and they went around asking people who burned the synagogue?</span> <span id="s56">So of course nobody said anything; they didn't answer anything.</span> <span id="s57">They dropped in just to see how people lived and everybody was already very frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Uhm-hmn.</span> <span id="s59">Did they - when they first came, did they introduce any laws, you know, like Jews had to be off the street or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">This was like gradually.</span> <span id="s61">Until summer, like it was six o'clock, I think six o'clock the Jews were not allowed to be in the streets anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">But that didn't happen immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">No, not immediately.</span> <span id="s64">Right - a few months.</span> <span id="s65">And we used to gather, the Jewish children and young people, like the age difference was very little.</span> <span id="s66">We used to gather in backyards from other people and when the snow fell down they asked all the Jews, the boys, girls, everybody, fathers, mothers, old, young to go to shovel the snows from the road and they beat them too while they were shoveling the snow.</span> <span id="s67">And then they took them to work where the army was standing there -like the army standing there.</span> <span id="s68">So they took to chop wood and do all the housework whatever the girls had to wash the dishes so I used to go there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Now, we've been talking generally about the Germans.</span> <span id="s70">Were they all, the people who - the soldiers that were in your town, were they army soldiers or were they SS soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">SS just dropped in and caught a few, took out and killed.</span> <span id="s72">The ones who were standing there, the army, they were regulars - regular army.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Was there any difference between the way the regular army treated people and the way the SS did?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Yes, there was a difference.</span> <span id="s75">The regular army didn't go in the streets and beat people.</span> <span id="s76">When they need somebody for work they asked- they went to the ___(Counter# 100) to the town and they asked "I need ten Jews, twenty Jews for work", so they gave them .</span> <span id="s77">They called up people and they gave them and they worked there and they didn't beat them or anything else like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Can you tell me about a little what happened in the town after the Germans come in, were there lots of shortages of food, you know, that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">I didn't tell you about the nights - you know the nights - there were shortages - nobody - food.</span> <span id="s80">We didn't have what to wear, because you couldn't buy anything, whatever you had.</span> <span id="s81">So my mother gave us all her dresses, and there came a dressmaker which was from another town and she had no means of earning anything so the old dresses she was sewing for us and make them small or narrow, whatever, and shoes, we didn't have any.</span> <span id="s82">The feet were growing, but we didn't have any shoes, but with whatever we had we managed and then some other people came from other towns that had a shoe store so if they have a few pairs of shoes so they always accused me that I was lucky.</span> <span id="s83">I needed a pair of shoes somebody would just come in that day and they would say they had my size, so they all say maybe it was luck because you see I was the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s84">And nobody else.</span> <span id="s85">They always called me the lucky one.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">You said something about screams in the night.</span> <span id="s87">Can you - Yes.</span> <span id="s88">This was before the Germans came in and when the Polish army left already.</span> <span id="s89">Every night for weeks - it took from the beginning of September to the end of September, let's say - the Poles were every night going to another house, a Jewish house, and robbing whatever the people had so even they had this little so it was even less and the people screamed.</span> <span id="s90">So then was going around a joke because some children of one family they heard somebody was walking by and they say "Mommy, should we start screaming already?"</span> <span id="s91">, because they knew all we could do is scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Now this is before the war, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">No, this is right when the war started, right the beginning after the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Were these groups of Poles or just - Groups, they were groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Okay, we talked about most of l939.</span> <span id="s96">Can you tell me, was there a ghetto set up in Ulanow?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">No, no, there was no ghetto; it was too small a town.</span> <span id="s98">They couldn't divide the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">About how many people were in the town, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">In the whole town?</span> <span id="s101">They say about 6,000 but some people say even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Do you remember how many Jews were in the town?</span> <span id="s103">Generally?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Generally?</span> <span id="s105">Maybe half the town were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">So you said there was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">You talked about the Germans taking people out for work details.</span> <span id="s108">Do you know much about what happened to these work details or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Some came back - some came back, and some they took from there to concentration camps already.</span> <span id="s110">They never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Did you know some of the people who went on work details?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Did they tell you anything about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Yes.</span> <span id="s115">Those who came back, those few, they had to bring them on wagons.</span> <span id="s116">They couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s117">They didn't feed them, they didn't have shelters where to sleep.</span> <span id="s118">They looked awful.</span> <span id="s119">This is the first time when we saw a person coming back from like a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">How were these people chosen to go to work camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">They just gave to the Judenrat let's say we need 50 people, so they came at night and they took them because nobody would go volunteer.</span> <span id="s122">So they came at night with the Jewish police because they already had Jewish police there and they took them and they sent them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Did they describe what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">The people?</span> <span id="s125">They dig ditches, they dig ditches and mostly something because they like prepared themselves probably for the war with Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Now I know that when the Germans came in in '39 they split Poland with the Soviets - Yes, we were just on - about on the border there.</span> <span id="s127">Because the Russians came in to us and they were about for two weeks and then after they moved back, then the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">So the Germans came first and then the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">No, the Russians came first.</span> <span id="s130">Let me think.</span> <span id="s131">The Russians came first, yes, and then they moved out and then - the River Sanem was like at that time that you couldn't cross it.</span> <span id="s132">A Jew couldn't cross to the other side of the Sanem.</span> <span id="s133">Never again.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Was there - let me ask you - I've had other interviews where people have said that you know right when they first came in and then the Russians pulled back there was a choice of whether you would want to go to the Russian side or stay on the German side.</span> <span id="s135">Did people run to the Russian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A lot of people run with them.</span> <span id="s137">My father didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s138">My older brother Hirschel, he went.</span> <span id="s139">He did, but he came back.</span> <span id="s140">After a few months being on the Russian side the border was still not like a border.</span> <span id="s141">You could go this way or that way.</span> <span id="s142">He didn't go.</span> <span id="s143">Until today I mean I think if we would only have went maybe in Russia maybe we would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Did your father have a reason for not going?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">He just didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s146">Just a fear of "I'm going to leave my home and everything and go someplace?</span> <span id="s147">Where are we going to stay, where are we going to live?"</span> <span id="s148">Nobody thought that something terrible like this would happen - nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Did most people, especially the Jews, were they more fearful of the Russians than the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">No.</span> <span id="s151">They weren't fearful of the Russians.</span> <span id="s152">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s153">Not at all, at this point they weren't fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Why don't you go on and tell me about like from '40 on, what happened in the town and what you remember about when the Germans were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">In '41, in the beginning I think of '41, they came at night and they took my older brother away for work in a work camp.</span> <span id="s156">This was not a regular -- there was already SSpeople there and he was working like work in a work camp.</span> <span id="s157">This was in ______(Counter# 182) and I went there because in the camp they didn't give them food, very little, and they couldn't survive on that food.</span> <span id="s158">And I stayed with a family and every day I took food and bread and all different things.</span> <span id="s159">And I brought for all the Ulanow boys, for my brother and all for the other boys.</span> <span id="s160">Once they caught us.</span> <span id="s161">I was with another girl and the other girl was older than I but when she saw the Germans going - the SS - she start running.</span> <span id="s162">I hold her be the hand, she shouldn't run, but she run anyway.</span> <span id="s163">So I had to run after her and then they caught us and they brought us in that camp.</span> <span id="s164">And my brother was standing I saw he was walking forth and back and he said "Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s165">You're very lucky."</span> <span id="s166">Again I'm lucky."</span> <span id="s167">The good guard is today."</span> <span id="s168">Because there were maybe ten guards.</span> <span id="s169">"This one", he said "wouldn't harm you.</span> <span id="s170">Don't be afraid, don't."</span> <span id="s171">And one of the others came over and wanted to kick me and he hold him back.</span> <span id="s172">He didn't let him kick me.</span> <span id="s173">And they hold us for a while maybe for an hour, talked, spoke, and they let us go.</span> <span id="s174">So we were really at that time very - because they could have left us in that work camp.</span> <span id="s175">Then I saw that there is going to be no other way but it still was l941, so it still wasn't as strict as later and somebody told me that he can give me some papers that my brother works for him and I can go and give a Polish guy who worked for the Germans to give him money and he will let my brother go.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Can you tell me, did you tell me this was in Ulanow?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Ulanow, _____(Counter# 204), yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">How far from Ulanow is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Well, this is about 3 miles - well, about ten, 15 at least kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">So that's maybe 10 miles or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">No.</span> <span id="s182">Oh, maybe.</span> <span id="s183">15 kilometers at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">So you went there with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">She was the bride of one of the boys who was there.</span> <span id="s186">He was in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">So you all walked froml your home -?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">We walked from - our home - we stayed in Ulanow.</span> <span id="s189">I stayed with a family in Ulanow (Counter# 208) and every day I was just going over and just bringing them food.</span> <span id="s190">And every time somehow it - we knew at the time - we checked whether the guards were going this way, that way - we just had a second to give them food.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">So did you just pass this food through the gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Through the barbed wires, yes, through the fence - for the all boys from Ulanow who were there, not just for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">So can you tell me a little about, you said that you were able to bribe the officials?</span> <span id="s194">tell me a little about - Yes, so I went to that Judenrat in Ulanow and I asked them they should give the official the envelope with the money with the name from my brother and from the people.</span> <span id="s195">This was like Polish who could employ Jews.</span> <span id="s196">And they said "No, today is Wednesday and we were already today, this morning.</span> <span id="s197">It will take another week that we can go."</span> <span id="s198">I said "No, I am no way waiting for another week.</span> <span id="s199">I am going by myself."</span> <span id="s200">And he said "You can't go up there."</span> <span id="s201">I said "It doesn't matter; I'll manage."</span> <span id="s202">And I took my armband and I turned it around.</span> <span id="s203">I figured in case I don't know, but they shouldn't see it.</span> <span id="s204">And I ran into that building.</span> <span id="s205">Of course I ran -and then I saw somebody wants to open th door.</span> <span id="s206">I just took his hand away and I just go and I asked where and in which room is Mr. ___(Counter 229) I still remember today his name.</span> <span id="s207">And i walked in and I said "Mr. Ataisky, here is the envelope and here is the name.</span> <span id="s208">And he knew about it because the other people told him, and I ran out.</span> <span id="s209">And the next day they let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">They let him go?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Yes.</span> <span id="s212">Him and another few from our town.</span> <span id="s213">And this was Friday afternoon and I remember "How are we going to get home?"</span> <span id="s214">Because it was pretty far; we would have to walk for hours I think.It was -so I went in the market and I saw a peasant that I knew, and I walked over to him and I said "Listen, my parents will pay you money; I don't have with me any more, and take us home."</span> <span id="s215">He said "Okay, fine."</span> <span id="s216">With a few people that they let go and my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s217">So we were already about four boys and I and the peasant, he took us home.</span> <span id="s218">And I remember before we came into our town this picture I'll never forget, my uncle, who was later killed, he was standing in the door, and he saw us coming - .</span> <span id="s219">And my uncle, my mother's brother, who was later killed, while we were still home, he was bending over like, over, like he was so happy to see us that we were coming home and that I was able to get out my brother and the other boys, and my parents were so happy.</span> <span id="s220">This was like the first time that they were happy for anything during that war and the bad times.</span> <span id="s221">So we were still home.</span> <span id="s222">This was '41.</span> <span id="s223">And then the Russian-German war broke out.</span> <span id="s224">This was a few days just before they got out, that I got out my brother.</span> <span id="s225">So that day, when the war broke out they beat everybody in the camp, all the Jews, they beat them because they were so angry that the war broke out.</span> <span id="s226">And they didn't know how they were, I don't know - Now this was the camp that your brother was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Yes, yes, in Ulanow Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">So you got him out just in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Just in time, like a day or two later after that they got him out.</span> <span id="s230">Maybe it was already in the process and we were able to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Okay.</span> <span id="s232">Before we talk about when the war with the Soviet Union starts, can you tell me, you said something about turning your armband over to go to this place.</span> <span id="s233">When did they put - when did they make Jews start wearing armbands?</span> <span id="s234">Was it right after they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">No.</span> <span id="s236">Not right.</span> <span id="s237">About the beginning of '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Was that for you - I know in some other cases it was very dangerous to do that - was it very dangerous for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Of course.</span> <span id="s240">And I wasn't allowed to go into that building.</span> <span id="s241">This was like the Gestapo building.</span> <span id="s242">Only Pole worked there.</span> <span id="s243">But I figured "No, I'm not going to let another week go by.</span> <span id="s244">If I just had one, just a little ___(Counter# 266) I will succeed.</span> <span id="s245">I let that othere girl I told you I walked before it, I left her outside waiting for me and I said if I don't come out, she should know where I am.</span> <span id="s246">That she should know that I didn't come out, that they called me or whatever there, but I succeeded and this time he came home and we were home already until '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Okay, why don't you tell me about the when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s248">This would be June of '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">'41, yes.</span> <span id="s250">It was a very bad time.</span> <span id="s251">They came into town and they took our neighbor.</span> <span id="s252">He had two small children.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Now this is the SS who came into town?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Who knows?</span> <span id="s255">Whatever -they came in, they took people, took them out of the town and they killed them.</span> <span id="s256">One jumped in the river, they killed him in the river like they shoot after him.</span> <span id="s257">He jumped from the bridge.</span> <span id="s258">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">(A man's voice enters at this time.)</span> <span id="s260">I was this time - I never went out, never - 'til the end of the war - this guy what came, he was an SS man, he was a killer.</span> <span id="s261">This was - he killed for fun - he came from Ulanow with a motorbike.</span> <span id="s262">He stopped the motorbike and took out whatever he caught.</span> <span id="s263">He took them outside to the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s264">I went over there with him and I saw the grave.</span> <span id="s265">They killed him over there and he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">You see, we still didn't know they took them, but we didn't know for 100% what they did with them.</span> <span id="s267">If they come back, if they - so he, he was always very brave so he went there to see what happened to the other Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">It was very easy to dig a hole to cover this.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">So this was just one man - ?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">This was just one time this happened.</span> <span id="s271">Later we did't follow anymore; we knew.</span> <span id="s272">They took a few - One boy, he was a dentist and it was a little boat, and he jumped in the river, the San, and he was swimming, but he killed it He shot him from the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Were these people chosen, the people that they came and got?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">They just saw them in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Whoever was outside.</span> <span id="s276">When we saw Germans, I says "Come everybody, run in the house, close the door."</span> <span id="s277">And that was it.</span> <span id="s278">Oh, one time I remember one time they came and they were going down the street and they were just beating people, just beating, not killing, just beating.</span> <span id="s279">And they came into our house and when we heard they're coming, so first we saved the men.</span> <span id="s280">So my father run across the street, my brother run away the other side to a neighbor's, to a Pole's yard, just -.</span> <span id="s281">And we remain in the house.</span> <span id="s282">They came and they hit us with a rubber, you know, a truncheon, but I remembered that my brother is running away this way, so I ran a circle with them in the yard that he shouldn't run in this way where my brother ran away, he shouldn't find him.</span> <span id="s283">So there were later the girls laughing for me; they said I played Hide and Seek with them because I was running in circles that he should not go in the other side.</span> <span id="s284">Me he hit - it healed, because when you're young it heals.</span> <span id="s285">But my mother, you know that scar on the back what he gave her - as long as we were still home, for a year, it still was on there, the scar was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Okay.</span> <span id="s287">Can you just go on from there?</span> <span id="s288">What happened after the Germans go, when the war with the Soviet Union starts?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Yes.</span> <span id="s290">This started in '41.</span> <span id="s291">So this was already - after '41 this was about the same.</span> <span id="s292">People came from other towns.</span> <span id="s293">They didn't have what to eat, but we had some fields where we planted potatoes.</span> <span id="s294">So we had enough potatoes for us and even for other people.</span> <span id="s295">In our own field we couldn't go like any time to pick because we were afraid of the Poles again.</span> <span id="s296">So we went evenings or very early in the morning and the children only went.</span> <span id="s297">My parents didn't go just we - I with my younger sister mainly because the boys were still older; we were afraid.</span> <span id="s298">Just for the girls maybe.</span> <span id="s299">So we went with our hand, we just took out whatever we could and brought back home.</span> <span id="s300">So we had enough; we weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s301">As long as we were home we weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s302">And we still could help with potatoes some other people.</span> <span id="s303">And bread was very little, but somehow for some things we used to sell.</span> <span id="s304">No matter how little things you had, you still had something to sell - for flour and for other things.</span> <span id="s305">So as long as we were home we weren't really hungry.</span> <span id="s306">We - there were other people who were worse off than we were.</span> <span id="s307">Some peasants owed us some things, money, so they brought sometimes something, so we could survive.</span> <span id="s308">If they would only let us stay home, even not give us anything we still would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">You said something about other people coming into the town -</span></p> <p><span id="s310">From other towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">From nearsby?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">From nearby.</span> <span id="s313">They chased out all the Jews from the other towns.</span> <span id="s314">From _____________(Counter# 350).</span> <span id="s315">So they all came to our town and everybody found relative, acquaintance, whoever, and we all put them up.</span> <span id="s316">Everybody was living somewhere.</span> <span id="s317">Bread was very little; we didn't have enough bread, but there were were other things - milk, or some other things, we could manage.</span> <span id="s318">Yes, we had a cow and we had a very big, large cow, so my father gave it to a peasant and he said, "And you'll give me your small one", because he hoped that the smaller one who just has a little milk they would let us keep.</span> <span id="s319">So for a while they let us keep the small one, but some Pole squealed that we have a cow and for all the neighbors, all the children, whatever we had close by, relatives, neighbors, so we had milk for them.</span> <span id="s320">We almost didn't drink any, just for them, but then they came one day and they took the cow away.</span> <span id="s321">And then again, they sent me to that German to ask him he should give us the cow back.</span> <span id="s322">So my mother tried to dress me I should look like an old lady.</span> <span id="s323">I was 19 years old, she wanted to dress me - or 18 - I should look like - so she put me one kerchief, the other kerchief.</span> <span id="s324">The one thing that I wasn't afraid too much to go because this SS man lived in a Polish family's house and I knew them.</span> <span id="s325">Their girl went with me to school and I knew they were decent people.</span> <span id="s326">So I went in there and the woman from the house told me right away "Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s327">He's not going to harm you."</span> <span id="s328">So I went in and I spoke German to him, because when the war broke out my father took a German tutor and he figured we don't know what's going to be and we didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s329">After when the war broke out nobody went ever to school, so we learned German.</span> <span id="s330">And I somehow picked up easy languages so I spoke pretty good that he understood everything.</span> <span id="s331">Besides it's a little similar to Yiddish but I spoke German and I told him that so many children depend on that one cow, and it's only standing in the street for three days and nobody takes it anyplace.</span> <span id="s332">And couldn't you give us back, please.</span> <span id="s333">He didn't do harm to me but he said no, and this was the end of the milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Was this episode where the Pole yelled or told the Germans that you all had a cow, did that happen frequently?</span> <span id="s335">Did they do that to other people too?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Oh, yea.</span> <span id="s337">All over, if they knew that anybody had anything that the Germans would take, they would come.</span> <span id="s338">Once they came into our house just like that and he said to me they want something from the house, the Germans, he's organizing a house - he's like fixing up his home, the German.</span> <span id="s339">So all the pictures that we had of the wall what my mother hand-embroidered, he said he would like those pictures.</span> <span id="s340">So I said "Sure, for you everything!"</span> <span id="s341">.</span> <span id="s342">I just, I always was like outspoken and he looked at me; he said "You really mean it?"</span> <span id="s343">I didn't reply anymore; I figured let me not push my luck.</span> <span id="s344">He took down all the pictures and that - we were happy, it was finished with the pictures - that they didn't harm us, because any time that they went in a house they harmed somebody or they took him along or they beat him up or - whatever, this was the routine.</span> <span id="s345">We used to - the young people - like gather in backyards and talk.</span> <span id="s346">We talked late nights.</span> <span id="s347">"When will it finish?"</span> <span id="s348">And if anybody surviv it, and like, we talked and talked late at night, summer nights special, and everybody - nobody knew that it's going to be that bad as it later was - this was in the good times.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Tell me, at this time did anybody know about some of the camps?</span> <span id="s350">Because I know some of the camps were beginning to be established.</span> <span id="s351">Did you know about like Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">No, no.</span> <span id="s353">But we knew about _______(Counter# 415).</span> <span id="s354">Because from Rozwadow there came a family to us and they told us they took their son away, before just before they evacuated them they took their son away to ---(Counter# 419) and his sister went to Aschwinschen (ph#418) to find out where they took him.</span> <span id="s355">She didn't go to the camp but just around and then she came back and she told us that this, she wasn't allowed to travel by train at all, but she went anyway without this, she managed.</span> <span id="s356">She told us about Auschwinschen (ph# 4424) but this wasn't yet that they were gassing or things like that but just that it's a terrible camp.</span> <span id="s357">Whoever goes in doesn't come out from there.</span> <span id="s358">This much we knew about Auschwinschen.</span> <span id="s359">This was already like '42, beginning '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">(Man's voice) We can give you the name from the boy.</span> <span id="s361">Moses Band.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Moses was his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Moses.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">They were from Rozwadow.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">(Man's voice) I used to go to school with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">You see, at that time they took to Auschwinschen Jews and non-Jews for a certain reason, for they did something -what was the - They called them like political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Political prisoners, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s369">As political prisoners.</span> <span id="s370">They kept them a long time.</span> <span id="s371">They kept them a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">They never came out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">They never came out but they kept them a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Maybe a year they were in Auschwitz, still alive.</span> <span id="s376">The point was, of course, the ovens weren't ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Right.</span> <span id="s378">OKay.</span> <span id="s379">Uh, well why don't you go on and tell me about what was going on after '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Until '42, in September, Succoth, this was the second day of ___(COUnter# 450) Succoth, they came in at night three men only to ___(Counter# 453) this was the outskirt of Ulanow and they killed, in every Jewish house they killed people, together it was 33 people.</span> <span id="s381">We didn't know what happened about the killings, but somebody said that the Germans were at night in Bulke(ph #459) and they send me again of course to Bulke to find out what happpened.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">This is a nearby town?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">This is just over the River __(Counter# 462) just go over the river, this is like 10 minutes' walk.</span> <span id="s384">And I walk in, and I don't know anything that they were killed, that they were not killed.</span> <span id="s385">First I'm going to my uncle's house and I come into the house and I see Poles already gathered there in the yard, and my uncle is laying there in the yard.</span> <span id="s386">All - he was laying in the garden behind the house, he was shot several times, his chest, his stomach torn open.</span> <span id="s387">He was conscious and he told me "Everyone in the house is killed, my wife and the children, (four children he had), everyone is killed."</span> <span id="s388">And he was still talking.</span> <span id="s389">I was embarrassed for the old Poles seeing him all - with all these intestines out, and he was bloody from one side, the other side was clean, and I kissed him on that clean side and I like patted him.</span> <span id="s390">And I said we are going to go for a doctor and he said no doctor will help me.</span> <span id="s391">So I run in in the house and I figured I'll bring something to cover him.</span> <span id="s392">And I brought a pillow, a big pillow.</span> <span id="s393">When I went to take off the pillow, a child falls out, a dead child, one of my cousins falled out from the pillow.</span> <span id="s394">And then I looked around and I saw my aunt behind a big oven, like the ovens that they have in Poland to heat the house, like she tried to hide and I remember just seeing that her first two fingers were shot off.</span> <span id="s395">They were shot - she didn't have her first two fingers.</span> <span id="s396">And this I just remembered and I ran out with that pillow and I covered him, his stomach with the pillow, and I still took off his shoes and I start rubbing him, he said "My feet, my - " so I start rubbing him.</span> <span id="s397">Later somebody said that it's good that I took off the shoes because you shouldn't die with your shoes on.</span> <span id="s398">I don't know what meaning that had.</span> <span id="s399">Anyway, and he told, said to me, that I pray that God should help you should survive.</span> <span id="s400">And these words were in my mind through all of the war.</span> <span id="s401">Every time when it got tough I said, "No, my uncle told me that he will pray in his last minutes of his life that I should survive, so I surely will survive."</span> <span id="s402">All these years, I never forget it, that these words what he was saying to me.</span> <span id="s403">And during my painful years of the war I always remembered his last words and I felt that I must survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">(Man's voice) You see - what they killed the uncle, it's a possibility in my mind, of course, it was only two guys and a local policeman.</span> <span id="s405">The local policeman was a Volksdeutsch, do you know what a Volksdeutsch is?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Yes, ethnic Germans, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">This wasn't an order to do it.</span> <span id="s408">They did it for their own -</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Just for fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Do for nothing.</span> <span id="s411">SS In my opinion, of course, I lived over there; I lived across from the uncle, by.</span> <span id="s412">In my opinion, this was the same guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">We buried them on the Ulanow cemetery in one grave and we figured after the Jewish holidays, we will separate the women separate and the children separate and the men separate but we never were able to do that because Simchas Torah which came that year on October 4th, they chased us all out from house.</span> <span id="s414">And but, yes, we took them on three like wagons from peasants you know, we took three wagons with horses and we put the bodies on that wagon and we covered them with sheets and we drove them to the cemetery which was right ____(Counter# 538) just over the River __ and everybody who was alive from Ulanow, all Jews came to that funeral.</span> <span id="s415">I even spoke now lately with somebody she says "I remember how I went to the funeral where your Uncle Shleme and his wife Chanah and the four children and the other, there were two or three together".</span> <span id="s416">And after the war, this was the first step and I survived, always thought if I ever survive, that's where I go first.</span> <span id="s417">So, it was dangerous that time to come to Ulanow, there was no Jews, but I knew that one from our town came back from Russia and he was some place in Ulanow.</span> <span id="s418">So I went for him and I said you got to go with me to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s419">He said no we can't.</span> <span id="s420">I said "You have to go; if not, I go by myself."</span> <span id="s421">He said "Alright, I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s422">So he went with me and I remembered all that time there was a big mountain, like, you know, all that ground that they dig out.</span> <span id="s423">And everything was sinken in.</span> <span id="s424">It was no mountain anymore but the place and the grave, I remembered where it was, so I disappointed.</span> <span id="s425">It looked everything sinked in.</span> <span id="s426">And Ulanow cemetery by the way has a gate around and in 1985 I went back there and I went to __(Counter# 566) and this was a time when they were trying to preserve, the Poles, they had an order to preserve the cemeteries what are still there.</span> <span id="s427">So I took care of it, I helped them.</span> <span id="s428">I paid something and I asked, and I went to the priest, to the town priest, and he spoke about it that they shouldn't ruin this anymore, because right after the war when we came this is what we did, that they put a gate but it was all already torn and the Poles took the all nice ___(Counter# 577) you know.</span> <span id="s429">They took them down and used them for something - from granite - or from whatever, better ones and the other ones remained.</span> <span id="s430">So, I took pictures from there and there were - and I brought it here, I went to Borough Park to somebody who translated them so some of them were 125 years ago buried there.</span> <span id="s431">But it was such a Hebrew written not just any ordinary person could read it, but they wrote it and I make the pictures from all the graves, whatever I could.</span> <span id="s432">And now it is a gate there and there is a Jewish writing and a Hebrew writing in front of the gate.</span> <span id="s433">So it's one of the few cemeteries who are in Poland who survived.</span> <span id="s434">Now we were deported of course - And this was in October of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">4th.</span> <span id="s436">4th.</span> <span id="s437">October 4th, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Okay.</span> <span id="s439">Why don't you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Yes.</span> <span id="s441">So it came an order that everybody should go to one place, to one town.</span> <span id="s442">I forgot the name; what was the name?</span> <span id="s443">Saklikov(ph #604) to go to Saklikov, all the Jews have to go to Saklikov, by themselves, they didn't even chase us or - everybody has to leave the town and go to Saklikov.</span> <span id="s444">It was like Yom Kippur, that day, everybody not knowing what to do and where to go.</span> <span id="s445">My father start already about a month before that about to start to preparing Aryan papers for us children.</span> <span id="s446">He knew somebody in a village who was the head of the village and he had all these papers that he could do that.</span> <span id="s447">So he got - like a week later the man came - he brought over the papers for my older brother, Hirschel, for myself, and for my younger sister Ula.</span> <span id="s448">And fate wanted that my papers were good.</span> <span id="s449">The two, he made a mistake; he put the pictures from my brother on my sister's card and from my sister's on my brother's.</span> <span id="s450">And he was never was able to bring it back.</span> <span id="s451">(Side B)</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">So we couldn't move around anymore so freely in the town but they somehow later, what I found out that they still were able to get the papers, but they weren't able to go away anyplace.</span> <span id="s454">They were just in the neighborhood, the village or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">So your papers were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">My papers were good.</span> <span id="s457">It was just a paper with a picture that this--a false paper of course.</span> <span id="s458">And that day, so everybody had to leave town.</span> <span id="s459">So I knew I had already the paper and my husband now, he had his papers too, because he prepared from us, so we went away together.</span> <span id="s460">But he went - Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s461">Did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">No, we got married in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">So later.</span> <span id="s464">But you were with your husband at this time.</span> <span id="s465">Before you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Yes.</span> <span id="s467">At this time.</span> <span id="s468">At this day.</span> <span id="s469">But we still couldn't leave the town together so he left and later there was no bridge over the River San, so there was like a ferry.</span> <span id="s470">I came on the ferry and this guy, a lot of Poles, he said "Where are you going?</span> <span id="s471">You're not allowed to go on the ferry; get out!"</span> <span id="s472">So I went out, run back to town, didn't go home anymore, because there wasn't time So I figured I'm going to go to somebody who I knew, that he knew that guy.</span> <span id="s473">And so the Jewish guy went with me and we paid him whatever amount and he just took me over the river by myself.</span> <span id="s474">Now, he was already gone, my husband, so Bernard, he was already gone, and I figured I hope I still can catch him before I'll go to the next town with the train.</span> <span id="s475">In our town there was no train.</span> <span id="s476">And I ran so fast, I ran and finally from far, far, I see somebody is walking.</span> <span id="s477">I figured it must be him.</span> <span id="s478">So anyway I walked as fast as I could and I caught up, and I see him looking back if I'm coming.</span> <span id="s479">When we went there, the train was going late at night and we didn't have where to hide for that time so we walked around just in the town.</span> <span id="s480">I knew I knew a neighbor of ours moved to that town.</span> <span id="s481">I walked into them and they told me, "You know what, it would be better if you go like nearby a woods, walk around in the woods.</span> <span id="s482">Don't wait by us."</span> <span id="s483">So I knew; so we walked around [Male voice,"Polish people"] yeah, we walked around there until it was Sunday--it was Friday--no, it couldn't be Sunday--okay, so we walked around until the train was supposed to arrive and we went on the train.</span> <span id="s484">In the train ride--Bernard knew some people who went before us to Stree (Ph# 29,side B) so we took the train to Stree.</span> <span id="s485">I remember when we arrived there, no, when I was sitting in the train, he was sitting.</span> <span id="s486">We didn't sit together, because one Jew doesn't stick out so much, two--, this what was the philosophy.</span> <span id="s487">So I was sitting by myself and here was a young man sitting near me.</span> <span id="s488">Finally it was night, he falls asleep and he put his head on my shoulder accidentally.</span> <span id="s489">And I was sitting quiet; I was very happy that it should look like I'm travelling with him.</span> <span id="s490">And then he woke up; he said, he apologized, "I'm so sorry, now you put your head on my shoulder."</span> <span id="s491">I said "Good."</span> <span id="s492">So I put my head on his shoulder, I didn't sleep.</span> <span id="s493">It was even uncomfortable, but I was sitting like this until a few hours, until we came closer to Stree, which was already morning.</span> <span id="s494">Then I figured I'd better run out first before Bernard because in case they catch me here, so he should see that they caught me.</span> <span id="s495">Anyway, I run out and we went to those people that he knew.</span> <span id="s496">We stayed there for a few weeks until Bernard was able to find work already as a Pole.</span> <span id="s497">They would give us an apartment after Jews, that they took the Jews to the ghetto, because Stree was already a ghetto.</span> <span id="s498">They gave us a one-room apartment and we lived in that room.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Let me backtrack just a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Yeah, what happened to my mother, I think you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Yeah, first let me ask you, just to put on the tape; the name that you used on your false papers and also, these were German papers that were issued, right?</span> <span id="s502">They were--?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">The later one was German, kenn cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">These were the false papers that you called them Aryan papers, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Did they have a German stamp on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">First, I had just like a passport.</span> <span id="s510">Like a Polish that they gave before the war.</span> <span id="s511">This is what from home, I still had.</span> <span id="s512">Then when you had this, what we're going to have to backtrack later to how I got this German papers.</span> <span id="s513">I didn't have a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s514">Later, this is a whole different story until I had to get my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s515">Bernard went back in 1943, he went back through all this, on the German side, to get my birth certificate from a priest who somebody knew.</span> <span id="s516">The priest knew that he is giving those papers for a Jewish girl with no payment.</span> <span id="s517">He made the birth certificate, it should coordinate with my paper what I had with the photo from Polish.</span> <span id="s518">When I had this two papers, I could get a German kenn card.</span> <span id="s519">What they called, with the German stamp, with everything the German.</span> <span id="s520">Like this was legal because some people had German kenn cards false but this usually didn't work because they could find it out easy.</span> <span id="s521">Ours were real--this why also we went to Stree because in our area they gave out the kenn cards earlier.</span> <span id="s522">In Stree they didn't give out yet.</span> <span id="s523">We went in areas like this that they--that we should be able to get the real thing, not--.</span> <span id="s524">["This was a document, this was from the place what I was working."]</span> <span id="s525">Okay, Your work permit, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">["My work permit."]</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Arbit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">["______(69).</span> <span id="s529">For this, I can help in every Gestapo, everything.</span> <span id="s530">Because this was a company what they work for--you heard of what happened there.</span> <span id="s531">We were making--"] What happened--not now, let's finish our story.</span> <span id="s532">["We were making barracks for the whole Russian army, the German army.</span> <span id="s533">For the German army what was in the Eastern Front"].</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">["You see, when I got this, I went for her birth certificate.</span> <span id="s536">There was no Jews in this area, when I worked for the _____(75)."]</span> <span id="s537">So you were the only one there?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">["No.</span> <span id="s539">She wasn't there, she was in Stree."]</span> <span id="s540">Okay, so where ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">It's okay.</span> <span id="s542">I was just going to ask you--- What happened to the rest of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">After the war, I found out that my father and my older brother run away to Cs____(c.79) which is another town about eight miles from us.</span> <span id="s545">They were killed there.</span> <span id="s546">In Cs____, they came in one day and they surrounded the town.</span> <span id="s547">They didn't leave a living soul to live.</span> <span id="s548">Nobody left from there, from Cs______.</span> <span id="s549">After the war, when I came to Cs____ because I wanted to ask anybody, anybody saw him, anybody heard because during the war I was thinking, they don't know where I am and they don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s550">After the war, we get together.</span> <span id="s551">Then I see in the street, one boy wearing my brother's pants.</span> <span id="s552">I recognized.</span> <span id="s553">I walked over, he said I bought it from somebody, which is possible too.</span> <span id="s554">Not--possible that this guy killed him, but that he bought it.</span> <span id="s555">Then my mother, my mother tried to get to S______(c.87).</span> <span id="s556">This was a town where Jews were still.</span> <span id="s557">They were not yet chased out.</span> <span id="s558">She tried to get there, to S______.</span> <span id="s559">On the way, they hired a Pole.</span> <span id="s560">This was my younger sister and my younger brother, Udel and Monyak and the peasant supposed to take them to S_______.</span> <span id="s561">Later I found out, he brought them to the Germans in P__________(93) They caught them there, of course, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s562">They were buried in a mass grave in P _____.</span> <span id="s563">.</span> <span id="s564">Because In P_________, is a mass grave which is also with, you know, one of our friends ceased (?)</span> <span id="s565">with it.</span> <span id="s566">We all chipped in and we had ________(97) to take care of that cemetery.</span> <span id="s567">There is over 300 Jews who were caught in 1942, are buried in this mass grave in P_________.</span> <span id="s568">In 1985, when I went, I went on this grave too.</span> <span id="s569">I mean to pay my respects to my mother, my younger sister and my brother what I know that they are buried there.</span> <span id="s570">Only once I went back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Was it a conscious decision on your family's part to split up and go different--?</span> <span id="s572">It would be safer that way, that somebody maybe would get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Yes.</span> <span id="s574">My father was a very wise man.</span> <span id="s575">He already thought of things like before, that this would be a very good thing.</span> <span id="s576">But he didn't plan anything for himself or for my mother because they felt that they have no chance.</span> <span id="s577">But my mother would have had a chance too because she didn't look like a typical Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s578">But he didn't think in that terms, just of us.</span> <span id="s579">This was the best thing that he could of--, if not, no one would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">How old were your parents at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">My mother was 46 and my father was 52.</span> <span id="s582">Whatever money my father had, he divided among us that day when we supposed to leave.</span> <span id="s583">One man walked over to him and he knew that I'm going away on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s584">He said, give her the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">You?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Me.</span> <span id="s587">Because he knew that they have a slimmer chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s588">Later I figured that one out.</span> <span id="s589">The money that he gave me was in dollars, very few zlotys, we didn't have any zlotys.</span> <span id="s590">Later when I was in Stree, Bernard went to the ghetto, to the Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s591">It was still open, it wasn't closed, to change the money.</span> <span id="s592">We should have from the beginning, we should have to add for something to buy, or whatever we needed, something.</span> <span id="s593">So it came in handy.</span> <span id="s594">I remember he came over, he gave me another hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s595">He said because that man told him, I should give you more.</span> <span id="s596">It's little things like that---.</span> <span id="s597">I remember another thing what my father said when he gave me that money.</span> <span id="s598">Remember by Jews, they give a ________(124), when a girl gets married.</span> <span id="s599">So he said this is your _______.</span> <span id="s600">Bernard found work by the Germans because this was the best place for him to work.</span> <span id="s601">He knew how to--.</span> <span id="s602">The main thing before I tell you--.</span> <span id="s603">.</span> <span id="s604">The main thing how to survive on Aryan papers, this was your behavior and your speech.</span> <span id="s605">He kept correcting me all the--every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Practicing?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">He still corrects me now when I say something.</span> <span id="s608">I say the war is over.</span> <span id="s609">Always don't use that word, don't use ________(c.134), don't this.</span> <span id="s610">He was right about everything what he said to me, he was right.</span> <span id="s611">Then I should never go to a beauty parlor because he felt, which was right too, that they worked too close to people.</span> <span id="s612">They know people, they can feel people.</span> <span id="s613">I braid my hair and I wore braids.</span> <span id="s614">All the war I wore braids.</span> <span id="s615">Then it was '42, the winter went by.</span> <span id="s616">Neighbors start asking me why I don't go to church?</span> <span id="s617">Oh, you asked me before about my name?</span> <span id="s618">I didn't say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">That's okay, you can say it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Zofya Jamowa___(c.145).</span></p> <p><span id="s621">That's the name you used on your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">On the fake papers, yes.</span> <span id="s623">Two neighbors at one Sunday asked me, how come Vania (?)</span> <span id="s624">(135) Ja____ , you don't go to church?</span> <span id="s625">I said I don't have what to wear.</span> <span id="s626">I run away from home.</span> <span id="s627">I had two dresses, a thin dress underneath and a heavier dress on top.</span> <span id="s628">In my schoolbag, that I used to go to school.</span> <span id="s629">That's all I had in my hand.</span> <span id="s630">So I said, you see, I don't have what to wear.</span> <span id="s631">She says, for God, no matter which way you go, what you wear, is good.</span> <span id="s632">So I said, that's it, I have to go to church now.</span> <span id="s633">Bernard took me to church.</span> <span id="s634">He just took me there.</span> <span id="s635">He said go in, and he went to work.</span> <span id="s636">It was a weekday.</span> <span id="s637">I figured I'm not going to go Sunday, first time.</span> <span id="s638">Just let's get acquainted.</span> <span id="s639">This was the week before Easter, was Spring of '44.</span> <span id="s640">There were a few old ladies in the church.</span> <span id="s641">I saw they were all kneeling.</span> <span id="s642">From one holy to the other, they went on their knees.</span> <span id="s643">So I followed them, on my knees, from one holy to another.</span> <span id="s644">My knees were killing me because I wasn't used to it.</span> <span id="s645">But I figured, if I stand up, everybody will notice me.</span> <span id="s646">When I kneel, I'm a little shorter, nobody sees me.</span> <span id="s647">I went from one holy like they to the other.</span> <span id="s648">I bought a prayer book and I learned very easily, everything by heart.</span> <span id="s649">I learned the prayers, the words, the melody I didn't know but the words I learned.</span> <span id="s650">The prayer what you said everyday I learned it by heart that tonight if you wake me up, today 12 o'clock at night, tell me, say the prayer, I would say it like those years.</span> <span id="s651">Because I tried so hard to remember that it's just in me already that I--.</span> <span id="s652">Even when something like happens, in a house--let's say a glass falls down.</span> <span id="s653">A Jewish girl would say, Oy.</span> <span id="s654">A Catholic would say, Jesus or Maria or whatever.</span> <span id="s655">I tried so hard to remember this that even until today, something falls down, I still say Jesus, Maria.</span> <span id="s656">Because I didn't try so hard to forget as I tried so hard to remember.</span> <span id="s657">I went to church already one time.</span> <span id="s658">The next day I run fast that I should get to know.</span> <span id="s659">It was like--this was Palm Sunday, I went.</span> <span id="s660">This was like a first time, I went a Sunday.</span> <span id="s661">Bernard never went into church, inside.</span> <span id="s662">He always stayed like the other, you know, like people, wise guys, they always stay outside.</span> <span id="s663">This was what was him.</span> <span id="s664">He was standing always outside.</span> <span id="s665">He never went in, even once.</span> <span id="s666">But I start going from that time faithfully.</span> <span id="s667">In April, and then in May, I was already one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">This is a Catholic church, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s670">In May is the month of Holy Mary.</span> <span id="s671">You go every night and sing songs.</span> <span id="s672">I went in May, every night and all the words, the melody--.</span> <span id="s673">I love to sing so the melody came very easy to me and I was singing my heart out to my God.</span> <span id="s674">I figured you must hear me here too.</span> <span id="s675">I was singing and then one day, one of my neighbors was behind me, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s676">She heard me singing and then later she says, you was singing beautiful in church today.</span> <span id="s677">Way, was I happy that she noticed me and that she was there.</span> <span id="s678">Since that day on I was faithful going every Sunday, every--any occasion, I was in church.</span> <span id="s679">I felt safe there too and I felt already good being there.</span> <span id="s680">Because--first of all, that I'm safe and that people see me, neighbors see me and that was very important.</span> <span id="s681">Then I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s682">In Stree, I used to go to stores and to buy things what I needed.</span> <span id="s683">One time, I went into a store to buy before Christmas, it was balloons.</span> <span id="s684">Like to buy some balloons, make a little Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s685">The lady who took care of me, the minute I walked in, I knew she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s686">Somehow, you feel it.</span> <span id="s687">I bought the balloons, I come home and I unpacked the package.</span> <span id="s688">I see I have a wool kerchief there between the balloons.</span> <span id="s689">This was worth, I can't even express you, how much a kerchief like this was worth.</span> <span id="s690">First of all, you have it to wear it, and then it was a very nice one, like a warm one so she packed it for me.</span> <span id="s691">But I never went back to that store again.</span> <span id="s692">Never because you see I was afraid in case she--.</span> <span id="s693">She wanted probably to make an acquaintance to have somebody to talk to.</span> <span id="s694">This was the worst thing I hear from people later.</span> <span id="s695">That they didn't have who to talk.</span> <span id="s696">We at least, I was lucky I had Bernard, that I could talk to him.</span> <span id="s697">This was in--.</span> <span id="s698">.</span> <span id="s699">Then I used to see one with colored hair which some girls make very big mistake.</span> <span id="s700">They colored their hair and then they couldn't continue with the hair growing out.</span> <span id="s701">She was going behind a German, a real German like carrying her basket with her food behind her.</span> <span id="s702">I knew right away she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s703">I was looking, even now, when we go gatherings and I meet somebody from Stree and I ask, where did you survive?</span> <span id="s704">I figure maybe one day, I find her and I'll tell her that I saw her.</span> <span id="s705">All the time I saw her and I hoped, I say oh everything's okay, I still can see her, that she's alive.</span> <span id="s706">One time I was caught in the street, just for work.</span> <span id="s707">Germans caught me, they caught everybody, whoever, the young girls, they saw, they caught them and took them to work.</span> <span id="s708">They took us for cleaning apartments after the Jews that they took them to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s709">So we cleaned and I figured, my goodness, such an incident.</span> <span id="s710">How am I going to get out of it?</span> <span id="s711">If I would have known, that he's not going to keep me, let me go later and come back, I would say a false name.</span> <span id="s712">But I was afraid.</span> <span id="s713">I said I have no papers with me.</span> <span id="s714">He said go home and bring them.</span> <span id="s715">I could have said a false name but I didn't.</span> <span id="s716">So this was too late.</span> <span id="s717">I went home and just told my neighbors that I--that the Germans caught me and I have to go to work and work there for them.</span> <span id="s718">This was regular soldiers.</span> <span id="s719">I figured one thing towards me.</span> <span id="s720">I didn't want to say anything to them that I speak German.</span> <span id="s721">I didn't want to not speak so when I saw no Polish girls around, I did my work, cleaning and this.</span> <span id="s722">When I saw, I say Bitte (222) like a ________, like let me go and this.</span> <span id="s723">Just one word here, one word there.</span> <span id="s724">It worked.</span> <span id="s725">After the day was over, he said, come, come with me.</span> <span id="s726">He took me to the office, which one are your papers?</span> <span id="s727">He took and tore them up.</span> <span id="s728">Again lucky, you see.</span> <span id="s729">He tore up the papers.</span> <span id="s730">I wanted to take one--he said no.</span> <span id="s731">He tore them up, throw them in the basket.</span> <span id="s732">He said go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Do you remember when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">When this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">When it happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">This was '43.</span> <span id="s737">["Were no Jews.</span> <span id="s738">The Jews were liquidated from Stree"]</span></p> <p><span id="s739">In '45, '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">'43.</span> <span id="s741">We witnessed it, the destruction of the whole Jewish community in Stree.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Can you tell me about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Sure.</span> <span id="s744">They were making, they called them achtzi (234) in Stree, achtze.</span> <span id="s745">So at night, they would get all the cars and SS and whoever took care on this, they get them drunk first.</span> <span id="s746">They all were drunk.</span> <span id="s747">They came in to the ghetto and they said whoever they caught in the ghetto too.</span> <span id="s748">Even in the ghetto, you could hide some.</span> <span id="s749">They had about six achtzes like this in Stree.</span> <span id="s750">With the last one, they took everybody.</span> <span id="s751">They took them out, outside of town.</span> <span id="s752">They digged mass graves.</span> <span id="s753">After the war, we found one man who crawled out wounded from that mass grave.</span> <span id="s754">["I was working across the street when they liquidated."]</span> <span id="s755">They put up machine guns and they told them to get up--.</span> <span id="s756">["Was a grave by two hundred yards long.</span> <span id="s757">They built, they put down bushes in both ends.</span> <span id="s758">In the center, it was like a cross-up, like a bridge.</span> <span id="s759">They brought the people over there naked.</span> <span id="s760">They let them out from the truck and they closed the thing.</span> <span id="s761">The machine gun shot them down.</span> <span id="s762">One got hit in the leg but he fall down in the grave.</span> <span id="s763">When they finished with everything, I went, I finished work, I went over there across the street.</span> <span id="s764">The grave was still moving.</span> <span id="s765">You see, the dirt was still moving.</span> <span id="s766">because people were still alive.</span> <span id="s767">One person, a young guy, when he got hit, he knew was on top.</span> <span id="s768">They left.</span> <span id="s769">So he run away and somehow, he survived."]</span></p> <p><span id="s770">He survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Yes, he survived, he was wounded.</span> <span id="s772">Somebody helped him later.</span> <span id="s773">We saw once one girl, ---.</span> <span id="s774">["When they liquidated the ghetto, it was a rain."]</span> <span id="s775">This was later.</span> <span id="s776">["Was a rainy day.</span> <span id="s777">You see in the block, we were not far, we lived not far from the--.</span> <span id="s778">The rain, the water was red from the people what they got killed over there."]</span> <span id="s779">There was streams of red water just going through town.</span> <span id="s780">Before this happened, on a previous achtza, one girl, like today I see her, she jumped out from a truck and was running, running.</span> <span id="s781">Just running, running.</span> <span id="s782">The police was shooting, shooting and she run away.</span> <span id="s783">I don't know if she survived or not but she run away.</span> <span id="s784">You see after the ghetto, they already--after this when the water was running, that red water and they closed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s785">But they still kept the youngest and the strongest in barracks.</span> <span id="s786">We could see from where we lived, we saw it from our window.</span> <span id="s787">We see them all the time still working, they still work there.</span> <span id="s788">They still up there and finally they came one night--.</span> <span id="s789">["In the beginning, they were transporting these people.</span> <span id="s790">They were a closed truck.</span> <span id="s791">They put on the exhaust pipe, inside.</span> <span id="s792">But somehow, this broke down.</span> <span id="s793">They didn't do it."]</span> <span id="s794">The last few days before the Russians came into Stree, some Ukrainians gave out in one place, they were all hidden Jewish women with children.</span> <span id="s795">They killed them just about two, three days before the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s796">["It was a Polish chief from the police who had hide the Jews.</span> <span id="s797">Can you imagine that they took the all Jews and the Polish chief of the police with the family and they killed them too.</span> <span id="s798">One daughter, from the chief of the police ran away.</span> <span id="s799">She survived."]</span> <span id="s800">She was the only one who survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">The Pole, the Pole.</span> <span id="s802">You see the Polish people in Stree, in Ukrainian there, they helped more Jews than in the other parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s803">Because they were prosecuted by the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s804">The Ukrainians were killing the Poles all over there.</span> <span id="s805">They felt more for Jews so here and there, a Pole helped somebody.</span> <span id="s806">["I remember--"] Excuse me, later we used to but you can't interrupt every five minutes.</span> <span id="s807">["_The chief from the Gestapo, was a short guy with a long nose.</span> <span id="s808">He was standing on the porch.</span> <span id="s809">The first time the Russians came and bombed P________ (c.301), they killed him.</span> <span id="s810">Okay, finish."]</span> <span id="s811">In Stree where we were, in March, the Germans start March of '44, the Russians start coming close and the Germans run away.</span> <span id="s812">They came back later.</span> <span id="s813">We were afraid there would be big fighting in Stree.</span> <span id="s814">We had one neighbor, she was from a Polish village among the Ukrainian villages there, about 17 miles outside of Stree.</span> <span id="s815">They say they going there so we say, can we go with you?</span> <span id="s816">Okay, you can go with us.</span> <span id="s817">We went there with them.</span> <span id="s818">We stayed there with them.</span> <span id="s819">There was underground, a Polish underground.</span> <span id="s820">Bernard joined the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s821">He was already like--this was already another thing for us.</span> <span id="s822">He was in the underground working for them.</span> <span id="s823">They were everyday guarding the village with just like bayonets.</span> <span id="s824">Every night they had to guard there.</span> <span id="s825">But they had--actually they had grenades, the Poles.</span> <span id="s826">They had some guns, they had some--.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Oh, this is in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">This is the underground, yes.</span> <span id="s829">We were there already with them.</span> <span id="s830">Now the meetings they make in our--wherever we lived.</span> <span id="s831">We lived by the peasants, we went to work with them, we helped them and this is how we had already what to eat and we were there.</span> <span id="s832">We didn't feel like going back to Stree.</span> <span id="s833">We are already here.</span> <span id="s834">I helped them dig potatoes out in the--you know, work in the fields.</span> <span id="s835">Then one day they say they have to bring three guns from Stree.</span> <span id="s836">They chose Bernard, he should go, he's in charge to bring the three guns, big rifles, not guns, rifles.</span> <span id="s837">Three rifles from Stree.</span> <span id="s838">["They were good for nothing."]</span> <span id="s839">We went there and we have to pick up the rifles in a place.</span> <span id="s840">He went to pick up the riles from where the place with me.</span> <span id="s841">How should we carry three rifles through the town of Stree?</span> <span id="s842">So he went into a neighbor.</span> <span id="s843">He said could you lend me a quilt, like a big quilt?</span> <span id="s844">I bring it back to you.</span> <span id="s845">He said fine.</span> <span id="s846">We go and get that quilt, he packed up there the three rifles, make a big bundle.</span> <span id="s847">He gives me to carry because a woman always a little bit safer than a man.</span> <span id="s848">I carry but he is behind me.</span> <span id="s849">Like a distance but he couldn't help me in any way if the Germans would catch me with the riles but he would know at least where I am.</span> <span id="s850">I walk with the riles, I come home before him.</span> <span id="s851">One of the neighbors with a Ukrainian husband, she see me coming with such a big bundle.</span> <span id="s852">What would I be carrying?</span> <span id="s853">She figured maybe some stores they opened up and you could get some things, something worthwhile.</span> <span id="s854">She said what do you have there?</span> <span id="s855">I said none of your business what I have there.</span> <span id="s856">I figured like this, one second only to think.</span> <span id="s857">I figured if she sees what I have then that's dead, that, ten times dead.</span> <span id="s858">But if she doesn't see so I figured she comes over once more and asks me, I hit her like with all my strength like this and say get lost.</span> <span id="s859">Just leave me alone.</span> <span id="s860">I went to the basement and I locked the riles and I figure that he's going to come soon.</span> <span id="s861">He somehow will handle it.</span> <span id="s862">Now how to tell her.</span> <span id="s863">We can't tell her we have the rifles.</span> <span id="s864">This is what I had.</span> <span id="s865">We can't tell her the truth so Bernard walk--he had an idea.</span> <span id="s866">He called in that neighbor who lend him that blanket.</span> <span id="s867">He said come, come to the house, get your blanket.</span> <span id="s868">He pulls up the blanket and here the three rifles fall.</span> <span id="s869">He says my goodness, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s870">He says somebody has to do it.</span> <span id="s871">We have to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s872">She saw, she took the blanket, went back to the other neighbor.</span> <span id="s873">This is the real patriots.</span> <span id="s874">What do you think what they doing?</span> <span id="s875">She didn't have to--maybe she could have told her but we couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Nothing was ever said about--?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Nothing ever was said about it--nothing came because we are the real fighters.</span> <span id="s878">Then was a sick woman in the hospital so the sick woman, we had to take back to that village.</span> <span id="s879">We put the rifles underneath her.</span> <span id="s880">We put her on top and Germans all over, walking and doing--.</span> <span id="s881">We walked just behind that wagon, the 17 miles and we brought the rifles there.</span> <span id="s882">This gave us--also was a very good thing, prestige that if I would be, let's see, anybody would dream that I'm Jewish, would I not be afraid to go to Stree and bring rifles?</span> <span id="s883">I would be afraid even to show my face.</span> <span id="s884">This was--you had to make yourself like--all the time more secure a little bit.</span> <span id="s885">Later, when I used to go to church, I used to speak to people, I was already so sure of myself that only if somebody would come who knew me--.</span> <span id="s886">Otherwise, I was very sure.</span> <span id="s887">I tell you about one incident.</span> <span id="s888">One of the neighbors once said, when they were giving out the kenn cards which is with the pictures all the Germans--so he said, he says to me, they're giving out kenn cards.</span> <span id="s889">They give out blues to Ukrainians, Polish men get grays.</span> <span id="s890">I almost wanted to say, by us they gave out yellow.</span> <span id="s891">But a good thing, I was brought up good and I figured let him finish.</span> <span id="s892">He said, and Jews they give yellow.</span> <span id="s893">I figured this was a close one.</span> <span id="s894">Then another incident I had--one neighbor sees me drinking coffee and biting sugar, you know cubes of sugar you bite a piece, you drink a little coffee.</span> <span id="s895">Another time, I was eating sauerkraut and I sprayed sugar on it.</span> <span id="s896">Both times one or the other said, Jews eat like that.</span> <span id="s897">You see you had even to be careful what you eat and how you eat.</span> <span id="s898">I throw away the sugar and I never drink coffee since that day, even until today from biting the sugar.</span> <span id="s899">Who would ever thought of that?</span> <span id="s900">Not to eat that way because this might--.</span> <span id="s901">We had another thing too, an incident.</span> <span id="s902">We had a curtain in our window.</span> <span id="s903">The curtain was so put up, that from one side it was down.</span> <span id="s904">Before Bernard entered the house, he always looked at the window, at the curtain.</span> <span id="s905">If anything would have happened to me, let's say Gestapo comes, they take me away.</span> <span id="s906">If anything would have happened, I would have straightened out that curtain.</span> <span id="s907">Because to take off, would be something suspicious, but to straighten out, I would straighten out this curtain.</span> <span id="s908">He would know he can't come in the house anymore.</span> <span id="s909">This we had our sign.</span> <span id="s910">This was ours before we went into the house.</span> <span id="s911">So thaat you lived and to think and you had to play like on a stage.</span> <span id="s912">Not one word you should say.</span> <span id="s913">Do you know that after the war, when I met the first Jews I couldn't speak Jewish?</span> <span id="s914">I mean, the first few minutes.</span> <span id="s915">They say, they talk to me Jewish and I try to answer, I can't.</span> <span id="s916">Then it dawned on me.</span> <span id="s917">I say I probably forgot, wait a minute and I--.</span> <span id="s918">That same evening, I was speaking to them, Jewish.</span> <span id="s919">You know, sometimes I tried at night to say a Jewish word, how it sounds.</span> <span id="s920">Like I never heard saying this, it sounds so wonderful.</span> <span id="s921">I never, I never wanted to think even that way, never--.</span> <span id="s922">Any books I had, a little thing, like a Pole thinks, what would he do and what would--.</span> <span id="s923">["In the place where I was working, was working 8,000 thousand people, three shifts."]</span> <span id="s924">When they come to your story, you're not going to have what to say.</span> <span id="s925">["They were paying me $24, let's say an hour."]</span> <span id="s926">We'll get to your story in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">["I wouldn't tell you the story"].</span> <span id="s928">He wouldn't tell you, he just likes to tell when I talk.</span> <span id="s929">That's the story of his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Why don't you tell me about when the Russians come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">You mean liberated us?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Yes, is there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Yes.</span> <span id="s934">I was-- Is there something else you want to tell me, go ahead but we can move on to that if that's--.</span> <span id="s935">You said they were coming close in March '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Yes.</span> <span id="s937">I mean when I--.</span> <span id="s938">I just want to tell you that after the war when I came back to Ulanow, I came back when the Russians still were--.</span> <span id="s939">The Russians came already to that part where I was.</span> <span id="s940">There was no communication so I came with Russians trucks.</span> <span id="s941">I jus stopped them and they helped me and this and I came to Ulanow.</span> <span id="s942">I was thinking, my goodness, my heart was pounding.</span> <span id="s943">I met some Polish people but I didn't want to ask them.</span> <span id="s944">I figured as long as I don't ask, I still have hope.</span> <span id="s945">Once I ask them and they tell me nobody's there, maybe.</span> <span id="s946">So I don't want to know until I---.</span> <span id="s947">I came on the same ferry and the same guy recognized me but he took me in 1942, the other way.</span> <span id="s948">He says to me, and you're alive!</span> <span id="s949">Another one says, everybody paid one zloty.</span> <span id="s950">He said from her, you should take two zlotys.</span> <span id="s951">This was my welcome.</span> <span id="s952">Then another said, you see it's not a bag, you go in and you can't go out.</span> <span id="s953">She went in and she came out.</span> <span id="s954">Everybody was making some fun and something.</span> <span id="s955">Then finally I brought myself and I asked that man who was in charge of that ferry and I say, is anybody from my family alive in town?</span> <span id="s956">He said, not from your family and not any other Jew is alive.</span> <span id="s957">But in the next town, in Cz____ (c.461), there is one family who survived the war.</span> <span id="s958">They buried almost in a grave and they came out.</span> <span id="s959">I went to our house straight and all the children were running after me.</span> <span id="s960">A Jewish girl, a Jewish girl came back!</span> <span id="s961">Oh, it was awful.</span> <span id="s962">But I went to the house and then I went to another person what I knew.</span> <span id="s963">I asked him and a neighbor.</span> <span id="s964">They asked me if I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s965">I say no, now they ask me if I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s966">Then I went out of town, about a few miles there was one like pleasanter people, we were closer with.</span> <span id="s967">The Russians were all over.</span> <span id="s968">The army was all over and I cried bitterly.</span> <span id="s969">I couldn't tale a word.</span> <span id="s970">One Pole came over to me who was very good friends with my father, he was a rich man, he wasn't just anybody more intelligent.</span> <span id="s971">He put his hand on my shoulder, he said, my child, you have nothing to look here for.</span> <span id="s972">You get lost from here and don't ever come back here because you might be killed too.</span> <span id="s973">He said, you have nothing to look, you're not going to find anything.</span> <span id="s974">They were all killed.</span> <span id="s975">Then I went back.</span> <span id="s976">I went--it was already evening, I was going to that Cs_____(484) to find the Gersons who survived.</span> <span id="s977">I stayed with them like overnight.</span> <span id="s978">Then I went back to Stree because I just came here to see if anybody's alive to tell because Bernard was still there to say that nobody's alive.</span> <span id="s979">You asked me before how it was when the Russian came in.</span> <span id="s980">It was very unpleasant experience.</span> <span id="s981">The Russians, we see the Russians, we happy the Russians came in for another two, three days.</span> <span id="s982">The Germans were moving out.</span> <span id="s983">They even tried to take me along, I should help them, the cattle to, you know, to take with them, to hurt them.</span> <span id="s984">It was at night, I was laying in bed and they tried to--my heart was pumping like this and I figure if they kill me here, I don't go out from that bed.</span> <span id="s985">I said to him, look, look, how my heart is--I'm sick.</span> <span id="s986">I can't, even one step I can't put on the floor, I'm just sick.</span> <span id="s987">They let me and they left.</span> <span id="s988">Then three days later came the Russians.</span> <span id="s989">They came in and two Russians soldiers who had tanks, like tanks from tank divisions hide out for the few days.</span> <span id="s990">They figure the Russian going to come.</span> <span id="s991">They came out and they happy to welcome them.</span> <span id="s992">The first thing he ask them, where are your tanks?</span> <span id="s993">He killed them on the spot.</span> <span id="s994">We start running away.</span> <span id="s995">We didn't know what happened?</span> <span id="s996">He killed the two Russians--the soldiers who--he asked them what they--they couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s997">We know it that they couldn't help to save the tanks, where would they save.</span> <span id="s998">So between the business, with this, they survived.</span> <span id="s999">They come out and they are here.</span> <span id="s1000">So this was the first welcome from the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">This was in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">This was in '44, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">What did you do after the Russians came in?</span> <span id="s1004">Is that when you went back to Ulanow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Yes, after that, I went back to Ulanow.</span> <span id="s1006">Still with the war was going on, of course.</span> <span id="s1007">I was trying to find out.</span> <span id="s1008">You know, even going to Ulanow, I stopped by in some inn to buy something, milk or something.</span> <span id="s1009">The woman start to talking to me Jewish.</span> <span id="s1010">She was a Polish--she asked me something, some Jewish word, are you Jewish.</span> <span id="s1011">I said no.</span> <span id="s1012">I was still afraid.</span> <span id="s1013">I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1014">While I was going to Ulanow, what I told you, when the Russians came in, I was going a little walking, a little--.</span> <span id="s1015">One day when I walked a little, a piece of my road, there was a Jewish-Russian soldier, officer, like a high officer ranking and a plain soldier.</span> <span id="s1016">The officer was sitting on the wagon and the soldier was walking behind the wagon.</span> <span id="s1017">I figured maybe when they start going faster, maybe they'll take me along too.</span> <span id="s1018">I put my package what I have on the wagon.</span> <span id="s1019">Like starting to think ahead.</span> <span id="s1020">The soldier tells me, the Russian soldier tells me, you know, this one is a Jew, this officer.</span> <span id="s1021">See he's riding, he wouldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1022">I see the love the soldier had for that Russian officer, I figured I'm not saying anything that I'm Jewish, nothing.</span> <span id="s1023">Until I go back, I go there, I was still afraid to say.</span> <span id="s1024">Even after we came back, later after '45, we came back to Rozwadow, we lived a little while there before we emigrated.</span> <span id="s1025">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1026">Bernard meet me and he says that he registered already as a Jew, I said what did you do?</span> <span id="s1027">Like I was afraid to say even was like almost after the war.</span> <span id="s1028">["After the war, we lived in Poland for five years under false name."]</span> <span id="s1029">Yeah, we still didn't, we didn't admit to ourselves until we emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">So you lived after 1945, you lived in Poland for five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Yeah, we lived still until '56, '57. '</span> <span id="s1032">57, we emigrated.</span> <span id="s1033">Three years we were in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Three years, you emigrated to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Yes, because we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1036">We want to emigrate to United States.</span> <span id="s1037">I had here two aunts, my mother's sister and my father's sister.</span> <span id="s1038">We wanted to go to the United States but we couldn't go straight.</span> <span id="s1039">So we went through Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Then in 1960 you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">In '60 we came here, yes.</span> <span id="s1042">Since then we live here in Brooklyn, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">I think we're almost done.</span> <span id="s1044">The only thing I want to ask you--.</span> <span id="s1045">I want to go back, you said something about your father.</span> <span id="s1046">What did your father do, what was his profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">My father was like for himself in business.</span> <span id="s1048">He bought land and sold and feed to--woods, things like that.</span> <span id="s1049">We were like middle-class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">That's all the questions I have.</span> <span id="s1051">Is there anything you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">No, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
