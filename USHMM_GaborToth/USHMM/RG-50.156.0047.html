Lewin</span></p> <p><span id="s2">March 20, 1987 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: This is Rhoda Lewin interviewing Leonard Parker on March 20, 1987, for the Holocaust Oral History project of the Jewish Community Relations Council Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I wasn’t even going to come in today because I’m fighting a cold.</span> <span id="s5">I think I was 18 or 19, and I was going to school at the University of Wisconsin, and I enlisted in the army for no good reason except I thought it would be an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: It was 1943 and I was assigned to basic training and then was assigned to the Air Force and then they came out with an Army Specialized Training Program and I applied for it and was accepted and got stationed here in Minneapolis and lived at Sanford Hall, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: On the university campus.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s10">Someone told me that civil engineering and architecture had parallel programs the first two years, which isn’t true, and so when I was in Wisconsin they didn’t have an architectural program, and that’s what I was doing.</span> <span id="s11">In any event, it was an accelerated program, and in nine months, shortly before we were to graduate, they folded the program and sent us off to infantry camp and I was assigned to Camp Phillips, Kansas, to an infantry group, the 44th infantry division.</span> <span id="s12">They had just been coming off maneuvers in Louisiana.</span> <span id="s13">In any event, we shipped overseas and I was fourteen months in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: You went in in Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: No, southern France.</span> <span id="s16">The Normandy invasion was prior to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: But you weren’t down in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: No, we were in southern France and it was a very uneventful invasion, actually.</span> <span id="s19">It got much tougher later.</span> <span id="s20">I was with a rifle company, came in as a PFC and ended up as a tech sergeant in charge of a platoon.</span> <span id="s21">In any event, we came in in southern France and fought through the Vosges Mountains and the Siegfried Line and the Rhine crossing, and by the time we got to Nuremburg, there were just isolated problems, in terms of combat.</span> <span id="s22">And on this one morning, we didn’t even know there was such a place as Dachau, but my platoon was on the point, and we hadn’t had any serious fighting for three, four days -- it was skirmishes, but nothing serious -- and we came upon this little town.</span> <span id="s23">There was a sign that said “Dachau” -- it’s not too far from Munich -- and as we were approaching the town, there was a terrible odor that was emanating from the town.</span> <span id="s24">We had tank support with us and we came into the town and people were standing around with bicycles.</span> <span id="s25">They were looting the stores and so on, and no one seemed to even be paying attention that we were coming through.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: These were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yeah, the German civilians who lived there.</span> <span id="s28">There was no evidence of soldiers, or anything.</span> <span id="s29">We got to the far side of town, and as we approached, we saw these walls.</span> <span id="s30">And then we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s31">Our commanding officer stopped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What kind of walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Stone walls with piers, and then in places there was barbed wire, and metal fences and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: But you couldn’t see through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: You could see in the distance, you could see there were buildings, in the open areas where the wire was.</span> <span id="s36">And we stopped ‘cause we didn’t know what to expect, and the commanding officer sent me, with one squad of my people, to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s37">And so we approached the camp and then we saw some people dressed in prisoner clothes with prisoner caps and so on, very timidly, sort of, coming towards us.</span> <span id="s38">I didn’t tell you what the odor was.</span> <span id="s39">As we went through town, there was a railroad siding and there were flat cars, maybe twenty, thirty flat cars, just loaded with bodies.</span> <span id="s40">It turned out later that the Germans three days before had left.</span> <span id="s41">These bodies were on a side track where they were going to move them from one location to the gas chambers, and that’s what the odor was, because they had been laying out there in the sun for three days, and had deteriorated.</span> <span id="s42">And we took pictures of that.</span> <span id="s43">And Betty couldn’t stand to have them.</span> <span id="s44">I kept those pictures for a long time.</span> <span id="s45">I wish I had ‘em.</span> <span id="s46">She burned them, she didn’t want them.</span> <span id="s47">Do you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: That was your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s50">One of the guys had taken pictures and I got copies of them.</span> <span id="s51">It wasn’t very good quality but it was enough that you could see.</span> <span id="s52">(Shows pictures.)</span> <span id="s53">In any event, when they saw that we were Americans, one of the guys ran back, and the other one was talking to me in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s54">He didn’t know I was Jewish and when I started answering him in Yiddish he just went crazy and he yelled to the other guys and they were like this -- (demonstrates with pencil) -- just sticks.</span> <span id="s55">There were seven of us, and we were just surrounded by these people who were chattering, and so on -- one of my favorite songs is “Yiddishe Mama” -- and we spent about an hour talking to them and listening, and they couldn’t believe that a Jew was an officer -- they thought I was an officer -- in the American Army.</span> <span id="s56">In any event, this was for about an hour, what we did was sort of talk and entertain each other, the seven of us.</span> <span id="s57">And I left them there and went back and reported what it was.</span> <span id="s58">I asked them, “Are there any soldiers?”</span> <span id="s59">No, there was nobody around, they said.</span> <span id="s60">The Germans had left three days ago, and they thought it was a trick and they weren’t going to leave.</span> <span id="s61">They were mostly Jews, and there were some Poles, and some Russians, but most of the people that came out to us were Jews.</span> <span id="s62">So then, I went back and reported what was going on to our battalion commander, and then he phoned in to the general, but then we put together a contingent of seven people who went through with the regimental commander from our regiment.</span> <span id="s63">And I saw the furnaces.</span> <span id="s64">You wouldn’t believe what went on in that place.</span> <span id="s65">And we went through barracks, with people who were too sick and too weak to get up.</span> <span id="s66">They were just laying there, you know, like dying.</span> <span id="s67">Incredible filth.</span> <span id="s68">That same evening, then, the Red Cross came in, and they wouldn’t allow anybody else in.</span> <span id="s69">We went back into town and billeted for the night.</span> <span id="s70">There’s a lot more in terms of detail that I just can’t recall.</span> <span id="s71">And a lot of this is recorded in this letter I wrote.</span> <span id="s72">I felt so upset.</span> <span id="s73">Incidentally, they found a whole contingent of medical people who had been conducting experiments there, who thought because they were medical, they didn’t have to run.</span> <span id="s74">That’s a big place, Dachau.</span> <span id="s75">It’s a big camp.</span> <span id="s76">And they found them there -- they had been hiding -- and questioned them.</span> <span id="s77">I wasn’t involved in any of that, but we got word later.</span> <span id="s78">I had my squad billeted in a house in the city of Dachau.</span> <span id="s79">And the lady who owns the house, “Didn’t you know this was going on?”</span> <span id="s80">-- we could speak a little bit of German -- “Oh no.”</span> <span id="s81">“How could you not know?”</span> <span id="s82">The insistence that they didn’t know what was going on!</span> <span id="s83">They suspected something, but they didn’t know what was going on!</span> <span id="s84">Which was a lie.</span> <span id="s85">I think they knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s86">Whether they approved or not, they felt helpless to do something about it, or didn’t want to do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Can you go back and try to describe a little more about how these people looked?</span> <span id="s88">How weak, how strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Without exception, they were skeletons.</span> <span id="s90">There was a young man, he was maybe 14 years old, who attached himself to us, a young guy.</span> <span id="s91">And he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s92">He stayed with our group all the way to Munich, and then I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s93">But all of them were emaciated.</span> <span id="s94">It was just terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: This 14-year-old.</span> <span id="s96">Did he tell you anything about himself?</span> <span id="s97">When you talked, what did he talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Of his whole family, he was the only one surviving.</span> <span id="s99">His mother and father, four brothers and one sister all had been gassed.</span> <span id="s100">He was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s101">He had lived -- this was the sixth year that they had been taken, so he first got into this situation when he was 6, 7, 8 years old.</span> <span id="s102">Here again, I hadn’t thought or talked about this in so long….</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And you said, it was a very big place.</span> <span id="s104">You’re an architect.</span> <span id="s105">Can you remember what it was like physically?</span> <span id="s106">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It was a permanent installation.</span> <span id="s108">It was like one of our military camps here.</span> <span id="s109">The buildings were solidly built.</span> <span id="s110">Now outside of this -- evidently they got overcrowded --they built a billet that was surrounded by two layers of fence and barbed wire and in there all they had was just barracks and guard houses stationed around it, and before we came to the main camp, we came upon this and we didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s111">We bypassed it, but it turns out the extraordinarily weak and sick ones ended up just being put there, evidently to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: These were some wooden buildings, then, and some brick and stone buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: This looked like a permanent installation that they had put up.</span> <span id="s114">Brick and stone, and the guard houses around.</span> <span id="s115">And a hospital.</span> <span id="s116">It was a complete set-up, within the lager.</span> <span id="s117">It was like a military camp.</span> <span id="s118">And paved streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Paved streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yeah, in parts of it.</span> <span id="s121">Evidently, as they started doing more and more work in there, they had to expand more and more, and it began to look more and more temporary.</span> <span id="s122">But what looked to me like the permanent part of the camp was very solidly built.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And you didn’t go inside any of the other buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: We went through the hospital set-up.</span> <span id="s125">We went through where they gassed people, the furnaces and so on.</span> <span id="s126">We saw that.</span> <span id="s127">As a matter of fact, I had pictures of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Can you remember enough to describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: What can you remember, you don’t remember enough.</span> <span id="s130">It’s like a furnace room.</span> <span id="s131">Except huge, I mean big.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And there were people there who had worked in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, when we went through, it was unattended.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Now, a number of people have said that they read about the liberation of some of the labor camps in Stars &amp; Stripes.</span> <span id="s135">And so they had some idea of what they were coming to.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I had no idea.</span> <span id="s137">As a matter of fact, I remember writing in this letter.</span> <span id="s138">Being in the infantry is really bad.</span> <span id="s139">You only fight about ten or fifteen percent of the time, but the living conditions are so bad.</span> <span id="s140">You live in holes in the ground, you don’t get enough to eat, you’re always afraid.</span> <span id="s141">So, it’s really terrible.</span> <span id="s142">And there were often times at night, I’d be standing guard in a foxhole, and I’d say, “ What the hell am I doing here, I’m fighting this whole war by myself!”</span> <span id="s143">and I couldn’t understand why this whole thing was necessary.</span> <span id="s144">And I remember writing in this letter that it was necessary, and I felt for the first time, after the Dachau thing, that whatever I went through was absolutely useful and necessary, that this war had a purpose.</span> <span id="s145">It wasn’t just a stupid kind of thing.</span> <span id="s146">It had a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Now, when you have thought about it since then, do you have the feeling that it really made any change in you, in your outlook on life, people?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: That’s hard to measure.</span> <span id="s149">You know, I had a real nice Jewish upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Where was this, incidentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: In Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So you were born in Milwaukee.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, I was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s154">My parents were immigrating from Odessa, Russia to the United States and I was born en route.</span> <span id="s155">So I came here when I was two months old.</span> <span id="s156">I was born in a barn.</span> <span id="s157">Some nice Polish farmers let my mother and father and grandmother -- I had an older brother, two years old, at that time -- so that’s where I was born, but I grew up in Milwaukee, and until I went into the service, that’s where we lived.</span> <span id="s158">It’s hard to measure that, and I’ve never consciously thought about what kind of effect it did have on me.</span> <span id="s159">But I’m sure it had some.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: If nothing else it made you grateful that your parents left Russia and came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I really didn’t think of that.</span> <span id="s162">But now that you mention it, that’s probably right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: When did you come to Minnesota then?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: When I came into the Army Specialized Training I went to the University.</span> <span id="s165">I ended up going to school here because there was a young man whose home was in North Branch MN, named John Larson, and he and I became very close friends when we were both attending Army Specialized Training here, and when they folded the program we both were assigned to this infantry company, and we ended up bunking together, and then when we went overseas, we ended up being foxhole buddies.</span> <span id="s166">John was a tall, good-looking, all-state basketball player.</span> <span id="s167">A really neat guy.</span> <span id="s168">And we were both on the boxing team.</span> <span id="s169">And before we went into combat he asked me if I would go see his mother if anything happened to him.</span> <span id="s170">I said I would if he would go see mine.</span> <span id="s171">He said he would.</span> <span id="s172">On December 15, I think it was ’44, we had been working on a task force with tanks through the Vosges mountains, and hadn’t hit any resistance the whole day, and when it started getting dark, we stopped to set up a perimeter on the down slope of a hill, in a heavy pine forest.</span> <span id="s173">And it had been raining.</span> <span id="s174">This was in December, that’s their wet season, I think.</span> <span id="s175">And the ground was real wet, so when we dug a hole we couldn’t go very deep, because we hit water.</span> <span id="s176">And you gotta stand guard -- one man asleep, one man guard -- but because we hadn’t hit anything, we made arrangements at the next hole, the four of us, so we’d get three hours sleep, and one hour guard.</span> <span id="s177">So this was between ten and eleven at night.</span> <span id="s178">John and I were both in our hole, because the other hole was guarding, and I was lying on my back in his stomach, you know, getting some sleep, when the Germans started to shell the hill.</span> <span id="s179">A tree-burst hit, touch-sensitive shells, one of them hit the tree above and showered down on us, and it ripped his whole stomach up, tore the back of my jacket and tore his whole stomach open.</span> <span id="s180">And it was a dark, sort of drizzly night, and myself and another guy -- Minor, I remember his name, the other guy -- we helped John down to battalion aid through the shelling and everything, because he wanted to get out of there.</span> <span id="s181">He said, “ I’ve got a million dollar wound, and I’m going.</span> <span id="s182">Come on, help me.”</span> <span id="s183">So we got him down, and I left him there and he died on Christmas Day, December 25.</span> <span id="s184">So after the war, when I came home, I went to see his mother.</span> <span id="s185">I took a train to Minneapolis, and then a bus to North Branch, and I spent three days with his mother and his brother, and then when I came back here I thought I’d look up some of my army buddies who had been in school here -- a guy named Amos Sanford, who was from Alabama -- and we went out drinking.</span> <span id="s186">We used to have a lot of fun; we were here for that nine months and it was just an incredible time.</span> <span id="s187">I had already enrolled at the University of Illinois Architecture School, and he said, “What are you going to school there for?”</span> <span id="s188">He said, “ Hey, little buddy, let’s come here, and we’ll have good old times like we used to have,” and I said, “ Well I didn’t even know they had a School of Architecture.”</span> <span id="s189">He was in engineering.</span> <span id="s190">He said they had a good school of architecture.</span> <span id="s191">So the next morning I went down and registered to go to school here.</span> <span id="s192">And then I met Betty, that was here, and we married, and except for the times I spent working and going to school away, this is where I’ve been.</span> <span id="s193">And that’s that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: The last question I usually ask people when I’m interviewing them is what did I forget to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: You know I have an overview of this whole thing and the horror of it struck me.</span> <span id="s196">As a matter of fact, there’s an incident that I don’t even like to talk about.</span> <span id="s197">The following day, when we had to go through the town to make sure that it was cleared, we came across -- it was like a castle on the edge of town, it was a big house, not a castle, but a palace, like -- and as we approached, we started to get some gunfire from it.</span> <span id="s198">So right away we stopped and we called up more.</span> <span id="s199">It turns out, to make a long story short, that there were somewhere between forty and fifty SS troops that had holed up there.</span> <span id="s200">They were left at the end to sort of clean things up, and then when they saw we were approaching, they went to hide.</span> <span id="s201">And evidently figured out they didn’t have much chance anyhow, and they might as well fight.</span> <span id="s202">Well after a short skirmish, they gave up, and our people were so infuriated by this whole thing, I was maybe the only Jew in our outfit, but everybody was so infuriated by what they saw that they were abusing civilians, and whomever.</span> <span id="s203">Well when my platoon got to these guys, they butted them with rifles and I stood by and watched.</span> <span id="s204">I was angry too, until they brought them back and they were prisoners, and they got interrogated, and we had nothing more to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Who did the interrogating?</span> <span id="s206">What did you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: We’d take people back to battalion, and they’d have the intelligence arm.</span> <span id="s208">We’d take them back there and I never had anything to do with that, but once we turned people over, I assume that in some cases the interrogation takes place at battalion level, and sometimes there at regimental, and sometimes it goes all the way, if it’s important enough, so I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s209">This happened a lot, incidentally, when we’d take prisoners.</span> <span id="s210">There was always this kind of interrogation to find out who was in front of them, so they’d try to get some intelligence about what to expect.</span> <span id="s211">In this case, it was more trying to find out about what went on in the concentration camps, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s212">But when we’d turn them over to battalions, prisoners, they’d take it from there, and I never was involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And you said that these medical personnel who were captured -- you didn’t actually have any contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, we saw them.</span> <span id="s215">The Red Cross really took over.</span> <span id="s216">Once the camp was secured, the Red Cross took over.</span> <span id="s217">They were concerned about disease, and a whole bunch of issues, and we were barred from it after the first day.</span> <span id="s218">We couldn’t get close to it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: When you first contacted prisoners, were you giving them your food, or did you have anything with you to give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, we had cigarettes and just our normal mess.</span> <span id="s221">We didn’t come prepared to give them anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: K-rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: K-Rations and some C-Rations All the people in our platoon were giving them whatever they had.</span> <span id="s224">I think back, and there must have been forty or fifty of them and they’re all surrounding me with their terrible odors, and they just can’t believe that finally they might be free, and doing, whatever, and they’re all talking at once and asking questions at once, and they’re just amazed that we can carry on a conversation in Yiddish, and then they all quiet down; I start to sing for them “My Yiddishe Mama,” and they’re all crying.</span> <span id="s225">And I’m crying.</span> <span id="s226">And that image stays in my mind.</span> <span id="s227">And the other part is, the horror of seeing the furnaces.</span> <span id="s228">For some reason, that was worse than anything else, because there were still pieces and things and ash.</span> <span id="s229">And they had been very careful to clean them, incidentally, before they left, or at least that’s the way it appeared to me.</span> <span id="s230">The image of the furnace in my mind is important.</span> <span id="s231">And then there were a whole range of other things that I may have in this letter referred to, which sort of all blur together.</span> <span id="s232">It’s these few dramatic images that stay with me, and all the other stuff is vague.</span> <span id="s233">It really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">I cannot, I cannot understand how -- this was a whole army of people that were involved in this -- how they persuaded themselves that what they were doing was somehow right or useful or, how they could live with themselves to do something like that.</span> <span id="s235">It’s just incredible.</span> <span id="s236">I mean, if you treated animals that way, a herd of animals, I think most feeling people would have some compunction about what they were doing, and challenge it, and refuse at some point.</span> <span id="s237">And here they were taking human beings, and treating them like a hill of ants.</span> <span id="s238">The horror of that, I still can’t get over it.</span> <span id="s239">It’s the one thing that I can’t understand, how people could do something like that, how so many people -- you know you see some crazies -- but how so many seemingly normal people could justify that whole act, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Another thing I thought to ask: these SS men who were holed up in this building outside of town that you captured, were these young soldier types?</span> <span id="s241">Were these older people?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Most of them were young.</span> <span id="s243">There were a few that I would guess maybe were in their thirties.</span> <span id="s244">But most of them were young people.</span> <span id="s245">They were indoctrinated -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s246">And their assignment was the Dachau camp.</span> <span id="s247">That was their assignment.</span> <span id="s248">They were not combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And they were probably grateful they didn’t have to be out in front, in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s251">They were not combat troops.</span> <span id="s252">They were assigned to monitoring, and guarding, and doing whatever the hell they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">(See copy of letter,
