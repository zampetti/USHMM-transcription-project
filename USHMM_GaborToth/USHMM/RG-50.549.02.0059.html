side A.</span> <span id="s16">So I did mention your name already, but it would be nice if you could give us one more time, your full name, and also say when you were born, and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: I’m Estelle Klipp, born Estella Guitla Feingarten, in Lodz, Poland, in 1922.</span> <span id="s18">So I actually am, if you want to know, I am 77 and a half years young.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And we are both sitting on the floor here.</span> <span id="s20">That’s nice.</span> <span id="s21">So, I should say that you survived the ghetto in Lodz.</span> <span id="s22">You were transported to Auschwitz, where you stayed for just a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Then you went to a camp -- a working ca -- a concentration working camp in --</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: First --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: -- in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And what was it called again?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: First I was in Hamburg, and then I was in Zazel.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Oh, Hamburg, and then Zazel, Germany for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And then you went to Bergen-Belsen death camp, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: And I would like to ask you, around the time -- and you were liberated from -- from Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Speak a little bit about the time just before liberation.</span> <span id="s37">What was it like for you, what state of mind were you in?</span> <span id="s38">What was your -- your health at that time?</span> <span id="s39">Where were you?</span> <span id="s40">And then, when liberation happened, what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s42">Actually, when the liberation happened, I didn’t feel any ela-elation, because I was still in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s43">I was still lying on the floor of something which looked like a very big barn.</span> <span id="s44">There were still mountains of skeletons around me, and the skeletons were actually people, who were once human being.</span> <span id="s45">And then, also, you could see people with diarrhea, with typhus, running aimlessly to the latrine and back.</span> <span id="s46">So, nothing changed, in a way, and so what I did, I was lying on this floor.</span> <span id="s47">Somehow I got pencil and paper, and I did writing, and writing, and writing.</span> <span id="s48">I wish I kept those papers, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s49">Anyhow, we would --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: How did it -- how did it happen though?</span> <span id="s51">You were in a barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a barrack, and they were saying that the English army is approaching, and they -- we should not go to the gate too early, because we might be shot.</span> <span id="s53">So we -- but -- and they opened the gates, and -- and came in.</span> <span id="s54">Probably, when you have been incarcerated for such a long time, you cannot switch.</span> <span id="s55">Anyhow, in my case, besides that -- at that moment, actually -- maybe not exactly that moment, I realized that I’ll never see my parents again, because there was no way for them to survive these horrors.</span> <span id="s56">So, in a way, I started thinking about my family, and I started thinking about all these people who perished, and this writing probably was a way to put my feelings into papers.</span> <span id="s57">Now, I was, all this time, in the -- actually, the ghetto too, but we didn’t have much of a -- we didn’t see each other quite often, but I was with my cousin, René Berlinska.</span> <span id="s58">We met at the place where we were supposed to board the trains for Auschwitz, and we stayed -- we were in Auschwitz together, and we were in the camps together.</span> <span id="s59">And we survived together.</span> <span id="s60">So I actually, when they took us and -- from Zazel, I had a feeling that we are going to a camp where we won’t come out alive, so I jumped out of the train, but fortunately they did -- they picked me up, and I was expecting afterwards that I will be punished, but I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s61">Probably, among this Nazi girls, there was already awareness that the war is being lost.</span> <span id="s62">So, that -- not always stopped them, and I’ll tell you later, for instance, with my husband, who was -- who was liberated in Aren, close to Hanover, the SS loaded them on a truck, and brought them someplace where they asked the Wehrmarkt to shoot them.</span> <span id="s63">However, the Wehrmarkt say, “We are soldiers, we don’t shoot people.”</span> <span id="s64">And this way, 19 people were saved.</span> <span id="s65">Now we -- so we were moved to some quarters which -- my cousin believes they were army barracks, in Bergen-Belsen, and the -- we had a room, with eight other girls, and they were wonderful girls.</span> <span id="s66">We are -- we always have been friends with them.</span> <span id="s67">Now, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was that after -- was that already liberation, or was that still before liberation [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, all what I’m saying now, they -- the Germans wouldn’t have moved us.</span> <span id="s70">They -- I mean, they wanted to finish us off, you know.</span> <span id="s71">But after the liberation, we have been transferred, so probably the very sick ones were, I assume, transferred to some ar -- to some -- something which was a hospital -- maybe a makeshift hospital, but a hospital.</span> <span id="s72">Unfortunately, in their goodness, the soldiers gave us food like chocolate, which we were not able to digest.</span> <span id="s73">I probably -- I don’t know why -- they did not consume any of this, and they -- so it didn’t affect me, but as tragic as it is, some people who already had problems, got very, very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Who liberated you though?</span> <span id="s75">We haven’t said that yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the English army.</span> <span id="s77">And the -- so, I mean, as I said again, they wanted to -- they knew that we are starving.</span> <span id="s78">Now, they realized it pretty fast, that the food which we’ll be able to digest is a different food than -- then they fed us the right food.</span> <span id="s79">Now, when I was in this room with the girls, which -- it’s amazing when I think about it, it seems that they were actually very comfortable quarters, because in comparison what was before, but my energy was coming back, and so I decided to go and get clothes, and I found out that there is some distribution point in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s80">So I went to Hamburg, and when I came back, I had a beautiful blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I also brought some clothes for the girls with whom I was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How did you -- how did -- how were you able to go to -- to get to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I think it was a train.</span> <span id="s83">You know, I tried to -- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when I came back, I was -- it was so impressive to some people, they -- there was a younger man who wanted to marry me right away, and the -- my resourcefulness was coming back to me.</span> <span id="s84">So I didn’t -- I f -- I was fortunate in a way that one day when I looked out, I saw somebody approaching, and who was it?</span> <span id="s85">It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted out, “Panya Klipp, Panya Klipp,” Panya is mister in Polish, and here he was.</span> <span id="s86">He used to be the -- the boss of the food supply in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s87">He was very respected, and he -- he was not only the head of the office, but also the head of other departments, and -- however, I remember one thing, which we -- I shouldn’t maybe say, that I had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s88">So I went to him, and wanted some rice.</span> <span id="s89">And he somehow refused to give it to me.</span> <span id="s90">And what was happening, he was an -- he was an unusual person with in -- impeccable integrity, and so he was allowed to have additional rations of food.</span> <span id="s91">He didn’t accept that til his -- til his wife’s sister -- no, it was his own sister, his own sister, was sick.</span> <span id="s92">So, of course, I was very happy to see him, it’s just like seeing somebody from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from Camp Arlen, as I mentioned before, and he was living in Hanover.</span> <span id="s93">I actually was hoping that my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom we called Lolec, survived.</span> <span id="s94">He was only one and a half year older than I, and he was extremely capable, and if he would have survived, he would have been a famous engineer, because as a child, he took apart our grandfather’s clock, and put it together, and since he was missing a part, he used a string, and that fa -- gar -- grandfather’s clock was working.</span> <span id="s95">Now, I also was hoping that Aroush, our adopted cousin, when he -- he was in the ghetto with his parents -- now, first his father was departed, then his mother was deported, and then we did adopt him, and my mother [indecipherable] from a skin disease, and my father got the skin disease, I must have mentioned it on my other tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: That was in the ghetto, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: That was in the ghetto, right.</span> <span id="s98">Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found my brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in Buchenwald, and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation.</span> <span id="s99">However, I looked for him, and I couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s100">Neither did I find Aroush.</span> <span id="s101">And Aroush -- I remember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s102">We were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated.</span> <span id="s103">Now we -- I mentioned that Dave was in Hamburg when I was in my quest to look for Lolec and Aroush, I went to Hanover.</span> <span id="s104">In Hanover, I worked afterwards in a -- in a dep -- in a place where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W-A, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food.</span> <span id="s105">So I worked there for a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia.</span> <span id="s106">He was working for UNRRA, and he was visiting the distribution centers, so I have a picture of him, and -- and when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the unbelief in his face.</span> <span id="s107">He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very unpleasantly impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So, he had only limited information of what -- what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face that he just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s110">I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he has to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so many people.</span> <span id="s111">And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend.</span> <span id="s112">Now, as the time passes by, to tell you the truth, it’s much more for me to comprehend how all this was possible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let’s say, of Auschwitz, they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind.</span> <span id="s113">And now, when I was making that tape, I didn’t mention that a person whom I approach to ask for my mother, going on my side of the line, which meant work, I didn’t realize then that it meant life, it was Mengele, and the -- in my husband’s ta -- tape, it’s mentioned that it was Mengele.</span> <span id="s114">Now, we are in Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Wh-Why was it -- why was it that you went in your search for your family to Hanover, because there are -- were more resources to find -- wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet.</span> <span id="s117">You know, it was just by talking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really up, but it -- all the search which I made, was in vain.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What -- what time was that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: That was still 1945, because we were liberated in -- I believe it was April.</span> <span id="s120">It was still 19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just started the search right -- right after.</span> <span id="s121">Now, in Hanover, Dave, shortly after, I don’t know the exact date, Dave realized that the refugees are just lost, and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities where we can get food rations, where they -- we can get housing, when the -- when we can get directions.</span> <span id="s122">And he was quite successful, thanks to his mastery of the German language, he was -- til the last minish he was able to write a letter in German, really beautifully, and without mistakes, I was always very impressed with it.</span> <span id="s123">And he also had a businessman’s background.</span> <span id="s124">So, he organized that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and it was an enormous help.</span> <span id="s125">So, I was living -- you know, it was much nicer living in Hanover.</span> <span id="s126">There were also many refugees there, many survivors, and they -- of course there was Dave, who was only 17 years older than I was.</span> <span id="s127">However, with his energy, and his equanimity, and his wonderful attitude towards people, chronologically there was a difference, but in energy level, and in zest of life, we -- actually was none.</span> <span id="s128">So, we did get married, and we got married on March 16, 1946.</span> <span id="s129">Most of the survivors in Hanover were -- I would say, were at the wedding, and who officiated over that ceremony was an elderly man who was from German origin, and -- and he was really qualified to -- to conduct the ceremony.</span> <span id="s130">And the -- I have, of course, pictures.</span> <span id="s131">I have the pictures of the other survivors who attended the wedding.</span> <span id="s132">Now what -- of course, we wanted to -- to leave Germany, and the destination was very easy for us to decide, because Dave’s -- Dave knew that he has a sister in New York, but Dave was liberated by the Americans, and one of the American army personnel promised him to get in touch with his sister, which he did, and we started even receiving letters from her, and of course our destination, because of that, was to go and join his sister, her husband, and they had a -- a son who was going to college, studying accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Can I ask you two -- two -- two question?</span> <span id="s134">What was -- what were the conditions in Germany at that time, in -- in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually did not expect much, considering our past.</span> <span id="s136">Now we were giving food through the UNRRA, then, of course, is a -- many people were living on Oberstrasser.</span> <span id="s137">Oberstrasser was the seat of -- before the war, that was the Yiddish geminda, which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: The consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No, n-not the consulate, the council.</span> <span id="s140">Stat --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The council, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: The council.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda, and the -- well, these quarters were available to the refugees.</span> <span id="s145">And then once these facilities were establish, which my husband was happy to establish, then we also were able to get housing with some German families.</span> <span id="s146">And we also were able to get food rations, and the -- so life became more livable.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Was it difficult though, to live with German people, so shortly after --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: See, that is a very interesting question.</span> <span id="s149">We didn’t want to stay in Germany, because we didn’t know who, of the people in Germany, was instrumental in this horrors.</span> <span id="s150">However, the German people have a way of being very hospitable.</span> <span id="s151">And you would never believe that this people were able to do what they did, or being bystanders, and not relac -- react.</span> <span id="s152">So i --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So, they were quite nice to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Oh, some, some.</span> <span id="s155">But we never knew when we spoke to them, or have been with them, what their background is.</span> <span id="s156">So, of course, most of the people -- for instance there was Pater Dana, who was a German, and became a great friend of my husband’s, and he -- and there were other people who became friends of my husband.</span> <span id="s157">I mean, he -- David Klipp had a fantastic personality, and just -- people just loved him.</span> <span id="s158">Everybody who -- whom he touched, loved him and respected him.</span> <span id="s159">So, there were some German people who -- who even used to come later on, when we had a better living he -- headquarters that they are -- actually came to our house.</span> <span id="s160">Now to -- to answer your question, that’s -- that’s why never occurred to ask to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s161">And in -- where are we actually?</span> <span id="s162">We are -- okay, so Dave is -- was working, he was very busy in the place, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What did you -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I was also busy, I was working from yo -- in the other place, and also in the -- our first child, Philip Klipp was born in 19 four -- wait a second, we bus -- he was born in 1947, oh yeah, that’s right, 1947, June eight.</span> <span id="s165">And that was absolutely the greatest joy, because it was, in a way, a miracle, because we were suspecting that we were getting something in the food which will prevent us from being able to bear children.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah, is -- i-in the Auschwitz, or maybe -- probably it would have been in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s168">S-So we -- now, about the -- we wanted to, of course, emigrate.</span> <span id="s169">Now, I used to have in the ghetto, I had pleurisy, which is water -- water on the lungs, and when I went to Auschwitz, actually, I had still water on the lungs, I had swollen legs, and I had a blood infection.</span> <span id="s170">And, believe it or not, that after we spent the first night in Auschwitz on the ground, I awoke and I didn’t have the blood infection.</span> <span id="s171">I still have the -- had the swollen legs, which was a big handicap when we were in Hamburg, and I had to climb up on the wagon which took us to work.</span> <span id="s172">The girls had to help me, and the pleurisy also lasted awhile.</span> <span id="s173">Now, what actually helped -- I moved, did I disturb anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: That’s fine, don’t worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: From Auschwitz, we went to Hamburg, it’s in my tapes, and then from Hamburg, we went to Zazel.</span> <span id="s176">Zazel was not far from Hamburg, but it was located in woods.</span> <span id="s177">Somehow, being able to breathe the good air, to which I am very, very sensitive, helped me to get over the pleurisy, and also my swelling of my legs disappeared.</span> <span id="s178">Now, I have to add, which is also in my tape, that I was fortunate, I spoke to the doctor who was taking care of the health problem of the soo -- of the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s179">She was from Czechoslovakia if I am not mistaken, and I mentioned to her my qualifications, and that I finished high school, and had my graduation papers, and what my background is, that I could be helpful to her, and she accepted that, and for awhile I was working there, and I was, of course, cleaning and washing the floor from the wrong end.</span> <span id="s180">And when the people coming from the camp, I was interviewing either na -- interviewing them, helping the doctor, and keeping the books.</span> <span id="s181">Eventually I did -- I did go to work outside, and we were building -- we were digging foundations for -- for some buildings.</span> <span id="s182">Now, maybe here I will inject something why I survived.</span> <span id="s183">Now, if anybody in my family would have been asked who is the least likely to survive, I would be the first candidate.</span> <span id="s184">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Why?</span> <span id="s187">I used to be -- I use s -- I -- I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s188">I actually didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s189">I was giving my -- my lunch to a beggar, I had my own beggar.</span> <span id="s190">I didn’t eat any breakfast.</span> <span id="s191">I had some dinner, and my mother was very concerned.</span> <span id="s192">She used to come to school sometimes when I was a s-smaller, and -- to feed me.</span> <span id="s193">That could have also helped me to survive, because I wasn’t as hungry, and my body did not demand as much food as other -- I -- was demanding from other people, who had a good diet.</span> <span id="s194">Also, I -- it is -- it was a face, it was the spirit.</span> <span id="s195">I believed that we will survive.</span> <span id="s196">And on this way going back to -- to this camp in Zazel, where we were once marching back from work to -- to the camp, we saw houses, lit, with people living their normal life.</span> <span id="s197">Usually they kept us away from the population, and my cousin asked me, “Will we ever live like that?”</span> <span id="s198">And I said, “Rania, I am sure we will.”</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: I’m -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s200">We have to change the cassette.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s203">But we will pick up on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: This is a continuation -- well, this was a car coming by, but this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s207">This is tape number one, side B. And we have been just interrupted in speaking about why you think you have survived, that had in part to do with not needing as much food as -- as -- as others, but also with a certain kind of spirit, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Somehow, even in the ghetto, the mother of Aroush, which I mentioned before, we were not really doing a lot of visiting, there was no time for that, and there was -- it wasn’t an atmosphere where you just go visiting.</span> <span id="s209">But whenever I came to her house, she was so happy, because I was full of hope.</span> <span id="s210">When I went to the krippo -- it’s kriminalpoisi, where many people didn’t come out alive, I went in, I remember.</span> <span id="s211">My mother was there already, my father was there already, and my brother was there already.</span> <span id="s212">But when I walked in and there was Souter, who was the head of the ghetto -- of the kriminalpoisi, sorry -- I left.</span> <span id="s213">I was laughing.</span> <span id="s214">And he says, “Das laken vilderkil hafher gaya.”</span> <span id="s215">And I really did.</span> <span id="s216">However, there was something about it -- also, when in the -- still in Lodz, after the nateez -- Nazis came to Lodz, which they named Litzmanshtadt afterwards, we were supposed to wear a yellow star, and I had a girlfriend, Gernia Finkelstein from school, and she didn’t want to go out.</span> <span id="s217">I said, “Gernia, look.</span> <span id="s218">We have nothing to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s219">Let the people who do it to us, let them be ashamed of it.”</span> <span id="s220">I somehow -- I was also praying.</span> <span id="s221">I usually pray in my own words, and as a child, I used to get up in bed -- well, I figured that I shouldn’t do it in lying position, and I prayed.</span> <span id="s222">And I remember in Hamburg, where we were in that camp in Hamburg, we had to get up very early, the stars were still on the firmament, and I looked at the stars.</span> <span id="s223">We had to line up so that we were chosen to go to work, and where to go to work, and I was standing there, and looking at the heavens, and I was praying for myself, for my mother, my father, and my whole family.</span> <span id="s224">And now, it’s likely that prayer is very powerful, and it influences the body.</span> <span id="s225">So that was -- my spirituality was also a reason, probably, which helped me to survive.</span> <span id="s226">Also, once, when I was in Camp Zazel, I brought some food from the place where we were working, and when I came back, I was being punished.</span> <span id="s227">And the punishment was that I was supposed to clean the latrines.</span> <span id="s228">And somehow, as -- in my recollection, I didn’t mind it a bit.</span> <span id="s229">Probably I was happy that I didn’t get a much, much more severe punishment.</span> <span id="s230">So, i-it -- it was the spirit, also I never, during the whole ordeal, felt inferior.</span> <span id="s231">I always felt that they are doing it to us, but that we are not inferior.</span> <span id="s232">I -- maybe should we talk now a little bit about anti-Semitism, or that’s not -- I’m actually very tolerant.</span> <span id="s233">I feel that different expressions of religion, art, language -- are actually very beneficial to the culture of a country.</span> <span id="s234">And teeb -- you f -- you sometimes find people saying that Jews cause anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s235">I -- but even among Jews you sometimes hear such a statement.</span> <span id="s236">It’s the -- in my mind, it is definitely, but definitely not the truth.</span> <span id="s237">Anti-Semitism is caused by other people.</span> <span id="s238">Now, it is in the human nature that it’s easy to blame somebody, and it makes it easier to handle certain things, and sometimes even governments, in order to put the blame, either for some economical disasters or shortcomings, or other shortcomings, needed somebody to blame, and someone who is not protected, or whose rights can be taken away at will, is a -- is a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s239">Because, when we look actually at what the Jewish people contribute to the countries where they were living, they s -- I would say that there is a reason to be anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s240">Also, which is quite interesting, there is now anti-Semitism in countries where there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s241">In Poland, there are actually no Jews to be talked about, and they are very anti-Semitic, in spite of Pol -- of the Pope’s powel -- efforts to change it.</span> <span id="s242">So, you -- we talk about the state of Israel, which historically, and when you look at the archaeology, and when you read the history, it is as -- it is the land of the Jews.</span> <span id="s243">And only having a place where we will be protected, and there will be an action if there is anti-Semitism in whatever form, which has been before, like pogroms, like Auschwitz, then there is somebody, we are not unprotected.</span> <span id="s244">And by the same token, we might not be so -- such easy targets.</span> <span id="s245">And besides that, there's the only place in the world where there is a law of rittem, and people can actually, if they are Jewish -- some who are not Jewish also, can come in, whether it is from Ethiopia, which used to be Abyssinia.</span> <span id="s246">Whether it is from Iran, whether it is from an-any country where -- where the conditions are fertile for anti-Semitism, there is a place to go.</span> <span id="s247">A-Also, I mean, of course, it’s not only si -- some people wish to go there for other reasons, of course the gates are also open.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Let’s -- let’s talk about that a little bit later.</span> <span id="s249">I would like to go back to Hanover one more time before we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And there are two sort of private questions, if you will.</span> <span id="s252">Was it helpful -- was it easier for you to have a survivor as a partner at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s254">Def -- I mean, the question is whether it was easier for me to have a partner, a survivor.</span> <span id="s255">There are two things.</span> <span id="s256">Definitely, because people have so much in common.</span> <span id="s257">I mean, we were -- our make-up was not exactly the same.</span> <span id="s258">He was very much a extrovert.</span> <span id="s259">I am partially extrovert, but partially a introvert.</span> <span id="s260">However, having the background, we could understand what’s happening in our life.</span> <span id="s261">We could understand how we think.</span> <span id="s262">And actually, many, many -- I would say, the majority of survivors married either survivors, or people who were in Russia, and came back, and I have one friend who married a survivor, but unfortunately he passed away, Simaja, and afterwards, she married American man, a teacher.</span> <span id="s263">Now everything is working out fine, so it might have worked -- and I know some other people who married not a survivor and it is working out alright, but I feel -- I feel so much con -- so much more connected.</span> <span id="s264">And then I remembered Mr. Klipp from the ghetto, he was my boss there, and when I was in -- and when my mother was in Krippo, he one time was helpful that we got a little bit more food.</span> <span id="s265">And besides that, he was a wonderful man, a man of integrity, a man of energy, a man of -- unusual man who, as I mentioned before, anybody whom he touched, or who touched him, loved him and respected.</span> <span id="s266">So he actually -- when I think abou -- about my accomplishments, one of the -- I feel the greatest accomplishment was to keep him healthy.</span> <span id="s267">So, he was not -- he -- you couldn’t call him a man who is of poor health, however, he was very sick in Germany, he had appendectomy.</span> <span id="s268">Later he had the phlebitis, and then he had the emboli.</span> <span id="s269">But he survived.</span> <span id="s270">Then, in the United States -- maybe I’ll come to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Yeah, let’s wait a little bit, because I have a -- another question with regard to your family.</span> <span id="s272">What kind of hopes and -- and wishes, and plans did you have for your children?</span> <span id="s273">You wanted children, you -- you had a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Two, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: In -- in -- in ’47, you had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So what was -- what was that like?</span> <span id="s278">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s280">To answer your question what I s -- want for my children.</span> <span id="s281">In the Jewish tradition, anyhow the tradition in Poland before the war, which I remember, the most important things was education.</span> <span id="s282">You could hear us saying, they can take everything away from you, but they cannot take away your education.</span> <span id="s283">And this really became true, because even in my case, whatever I learned, I could keep, all else was taken away.</span> <span id="s284">So of course, I guess the tradition is quite a long tradition, because even before children in the r -- I mean, many years ago, when there were no public schools for -- available, a child who was three years old, a Jewish child, was going to hadahadel, and he had to learn Hebrew letters, and -- s-so there was education even at the times when other schools were not available.</span> <span id="s285">And [indecipherable] really like to learn more about the Torah, about the Mishnah, about the other books, because there must be a certain wisdom in it, because there was one survivor, he survived in Italy, a Dr. Noyhaus, who told us that when he was in the -- he was on Aryan papers, that when he s -- when he went to the university, what he learned from these books was very helpful, even the medical aspects of that knowledge were very helpful.</span> <span id="s286">So we -- the question which I am answering now, is?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Oh, what -- what plans and hopes you had for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yeah, so the -- the -- the most important, the priority was that they should be educated, and my sons, both sons, are well educated.</span> <span id="s289">They have Masters degree.</span> <span id="s290">Philip was a very good student in college.</span> <span id="s291">In Fairfax High a very -- a -- a -- high school was very famous [indecipherable] camp is one of them.</span> <span id="s292">And he was so bright, that in the last year of col -- of high school, he was chosen to attend UCLA.</span> <span id="s293">So he attended each simultaneously.</span> <span id="s294">He was also very interested in linguistic, so he switched to computers later on, and he got him Masters in the Boise University.</span> <span id="s295">Now, my younger son, Charles Klipp, who was born in 1951, on my birthday, he was also -- we were very lucky, he was also very bright, and a very good student, and learning came to him [indecipherable] extremely easy, which he was very much envied by other students who had to study hard.</span> <span id="s296">He also got his Masters in business administration.</span> <span id="s297">And so they both have very good education.</span> <span id="s298">They also had violin lessons, and Charlie was playing as a -- in junior high he was playing in the Madame Bloom Orchestra.</span> <span id="s299">And we had the good fortune that this orchestra and Charlie playing the violin, was playing at the opening of the music center in Los Angeles a day before Christmas, and of course, all our friends, and our family, went to listen to it.</span> <span id="s300">I was very much interested, and I was with anticipation looking to opening of the music center there in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So we are already in America now, but let’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: But we have to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: -- we have to -- we have to -- we have to go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: We have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: -- to come here again.</span> <span id="s306">So when your s -- your second son was born already in America, 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So when did it finally happen, when could you go to America, and how did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s310">What -- now, in order to get to America, we had to go to a medical examination, and they were especially concerned that we should not have tuberculosis, which I can understand, and since I had pleurisy in ghetto, and later also in the camp, there is a scar, which mimics actually a scar of the tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s311">So it took many, many exam -- medical examination t -- til they decided that it’s not anything which should prevent me of getting a permit to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s312">And this happened i -- the permit we received in 1950.</span> <span id="s313">And we went to New York with the ship, Captain Macrae, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I moved, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Oh, you have a picture, you have a photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I have a picture what I wanted to show to Regina.</span> <span id="s318">Also, my husband, sh -- who was very organized, wrote that we left Bremenhaven on April the 12th, and we arrived in Halifax on April the 21st, and then we arrived in New York, on April 24th.</span> <span id="s319">We also wrote who of the survivors were on our ship, but I don’t know whether I should mention that.</span> <span id="s320">Should I mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: If you want to, yes.</span> <span id="s322">[indecipherable] be nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah, there was -- you know, down, it was Mr. Berstin -- Sander Berstin, Abram Hoover, Aaron Dunst, D-u-n-s-t, Samuel Showser, Shlama Zife, and Mort Kazai.</span> <span id="s324">This time, they didn’t seem to have been married, or maybe he just mentioned the men, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s325">And we arrived in New York, and the -- our brother-in-law Simon was waiting for us, and he fell in love with Philip.</span> <span id="s326">Philip had beautiful, blonde, curly hair.</span> <span id="s327">And the -- they brought us to their house, and they were very, very hospitable.</span> <span id="s328">They gave us their ba -- be -- bedroom, and all the family, mostly of course, the family of Simon, because Helen’s -- Helen, who was the sister of my husband, lost all her family in Europe during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s329">And so Simon’s family came over, and they’re very friendly, and made us feel good, and I heard some comments that, “How is it that Dave has such a beautiful, young wife?”</span> <span id="s330">Of course, if they would know Dave better, they would not be so surprised.</span> <span id="s331">And now, New York has the advantage that we have family there, however, since Dave was so sick, which I mentioned, in Germany, the climate affected his health, and he wasn’t feeling well.</span> <span id="s332">In the meantime, we received letters from Los Angeles, from people who survived, and telling us about the wonderful climate, and the wonderful possibilities.</span> <span id="s333">Now, the decision wasn’t easy, but we hoped that Helen and her family will follow us.</span> <span id="s334">So, remember, it wasn’t a easy decision, as I mentioned before, but we decided to go.</span> <span id="s335">Now Helen was afraid of planes, so we took the train, and on our -- on our way to arrive in the unite -- to arrive in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s336">Now, I learned some English in Germany, which was very fortunate, and I thought I knew more than I really knew, but it was really helpful to get through on the train, and arrived here.</span> <span id="s337">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s339">I would like to stop for just one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Okay, we are going again.</span> <span id="s342">I just wanted to ask you whether, at this point, there was anything that you had noticed about America, or that you had seen on the train, for instance, that was different, and -- or interesting, or even disturbing.</span> <span id="s343">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: No, I actually -- I enjoyed the train ride.</span> <span id="s345">I enjoyed being alive.</span> <span id="s346">I really enjoy.</span> <span id="s347">As much as the moment I was liberated, I didn’t feel any elation, later on, I was -- I had some elation.</span> <span id="s348">I was happy that I am alive.</span> <span id="s349">And I remember that once, walking someplace, and I said -- and looking at the sky, and seeing all the beauty of nature, I was really happy to be alive.</span> <span id="s350">S -- and the -- some people felt guilty -- that -- I heard that saying, I never met somebody who really -- from whom I heard it.</span> <span id="s351">They felt -- they felt guilty that they survived.</span> <span id="s352">But, because we survive, we bear witness.</span> <span id="s353">Because we survive, there is a continuation of -- of the people who lost their lives.</span> <span id="s354">Because we survive, we have children, we have grandchildren, we have a second generation who already is a little bit active in trying to remember what happens.</span> <span id="s355">And the memory is important for two reasons.</span> <span id="s356">Once, we owe it to the people who perished, and then, it is quite a lesson for history, which hopefully, hopefully, will be taken in consideration.</span> <span id="s357">What can happen -- what actually can happen when the rights are being taken away, and how important democratic governments are, and how important that people can have their say.</span> <span id="s358">That there is a difference of opinion that’s fine, and hopefully -- so, that’s why it’s good that a -- we survive.</span> <span id="s359">If we wouldn’t sur-survive, it -- if it would happen, what Hitler planned, the Final Solution, they would have murdered us all.</span> <span id="s360">And even today there are the deniers of the Holocaust, which seem to -- they be -- are becoming a little bit quieter.</span> <span id="s361">Imagine if we wouldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So, when you arrived in Los Angeles, what was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Okay, so I -- I -- oh, we arrived in Los Angeles, and the weather was good, and the -- our family was expecting us.</span> <span id="s364">So, it was really -- it was different, it was different.</span> <span id="s365">Now, we didn’t have a place to live, really.</span> <span id="s366">I mean, we li -- we were living with our -- were -- my sister-in-law, and we got along splendidly, and also with my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s367">However, because they didn’t feel good, we thought not to start our life in New York, since it affected his health, that we should go to Los Angeles, and it was a good idea.</span> <span id="s368">We only regret that Helen and Simon, and their son Arnold did not follow us, though they did come to visit, and they liked Los Angeles very much.</span> <span id="s369">And so we are --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So how -- how did you establish a life then?</span> <span id="s371">So you -- you lived with your sister-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: For awhile?</span> <span id="s374">And then what -- did you follow education, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, we were not there very long, we were only three weeks.</span> <span id="s376">All -- all we were there was three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: So -- because we had to make the decision fast la -- because you know, you have to make a living.</span> <span id="s379">You have to make a living.</span> <span id="s380">So we came to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s381">And we were picked up at the station, and then we stayed by cousin René, whom I mentioned before, was here living already with her husband, and she was going to school to learn accounting, and we stayed with them for awhile, and also there was that Siteling family who -- who were very hospitable to us, and everybody, of course, adored Phil.</span> <span id="s382">And then we started looking for a place to live, and we found it, we found the right place in of course, in Bull Heights, where most of the survivors lived, and we found a lovely place, and the school was across the street, and the semi-free medical facilities were down the street, it was Breed Street.</span> <span id="s383">And the elementary school was across the street.</span> <span id="s384">So -- and -- and I could see the sky, which I -- I wa -- we -- I was ela -- elated, and it was a very good move.</span> <span id="s385">Now, Dave, before the war, in about ‘32, he started a business, and he was very successful, that was in Lodz.</span> <span id="s386">And then he was -- then the war broke out, of course, and they took everything away, and he was also ready [indecipherable] it in a way, very respected in -- even in Germany.</span> <span id="s387">And all the survivors didn’t called him by his first name, they usually said, Panya Klipp.</span> <span id="s388">And -- because they respected him so much.</span> <span id="s389">And we came here, and he worked in the warehouse, and on the weekend he was selling shoes.</span> <span id="s390">And he never, but never complained.</span> <span id="s391">And s -- now, we lived there, and we had -- we were very fortunate, we had Mexican-American neighbors on one side, and the children were watching television there, we didn’t have a tel -- TV, and they was really helpful.</span> <span id="s392">One time, the father of this couple, who didn’t speak -- I don’t know how we communicated.</span> <span id="s393">Anyhow, he took me with the car -- I didn’t drive, I didn’t have a car.</span> <span id="s394">And he took me to see the doctor, which was living on f -- which was -- had his office moved to Fairfax approximately.</span> <span id="s395">And it was so natural to do it, but people in this doctor’s office were really surprised.</span> <span id="s396">And then, on the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Why were they surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: They were surprised that he would take me all the way, and wait for me, and take me back.</span> <span id="s399">They were really surprised.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, we were so used to, because our friends, you know, who were also survivors, we were always ready to help one another.</span> <span id="s401">So then the -- on the other side, the family moved in, also with children, the Gailses, and they were survive -- they were actually sur-survivors, but they survived in England.</span> <span id="s402">And -- so our -- we also became friends, and exchanged babysitting.</span> <span id="s403">And they -- this girls were appro -- this girls and our boys played together, and then we become very friendly with the Lazar family, whose daughters were also the same age as Philip and Charlie, and this was really our extended family, and we used to visit one another on a weekend, and when Sofie had surgery, the girls stayed with us, and we loved it, and they were so thankful for it, but it was really a privilege of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s405">I think this would be a good time to stop again.</span> <span id="s406">This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Estelle Klipp.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s410">This is tape number two, side A. So, you had a -- a nice support system of -- of friends here in the city, and your husband had work, and you were bringing up children.</span> <span id="s411">Did -- di-did you speak to -- to non-Jewish Americans about your experience at all?</span> <span id="s412">Did they want to know, or was there not a sensitivity to it, or is it something that you didn’t talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s414">Now, I failed to mention that in Bull Heights, we lived together in the same little house with Basha and Max Birnbaum, other survivors.</span> <span id="s415">It was really nice, because when they went to school in the evening, and we prepared something, and they came back, and they had refreshments, and it was so -- Max couldn’t stand much noise, however, we got along splendidly, and it was lovely.</span> <span id="s416">And I remember when I -- Basha was sitting on the stairs, on the day I -- I was supposed to go to the hospital because I had Caesarian with Charlie, first I took Philip to this medical facility for a check-up.</span> <span id="s417">And she said -- and she just was so -- s -- she was really very surprised that I could do that, and then go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s418">And the -- who took me to the hospital was Jerry Sitelin, who lives in Los Angeles, and whose family was instrumental in convincing us to come to Los Angeles, and he was going to drive me.</span> <span id="s419">He was also a survivor from the same camp as my -- as my husband.</span> <span id="s420">And here his father’s -- he and his father were in the camp, and he was young, he was one of the youngest one.</span> <span id="s421">So he was to -- going to the army, and he brought me to the hospital to give birth to Charles.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Do you know whether it was difficult for him to go to the army?</span> <span id="s424">I mean, he just survived a war, and now he had to go to the army, did you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I talked to him a few days ago, and he was telling me about it.</span> <span id="s426">And he took it as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s427">I mean, he did not -- he actually did not complain, or anything.</span> <span id="s428">He was fortunate, they sent him to Germany, and he’s -- Germany’s really good, because he was there for awhile.</span> <span id="s429">And he -- a marvelous son.</span> <span id="s430">He was such a devoted son, I think his father survives thanks -- thanks to him, and he survives thanks to his father, because he has a goal, to keep his father alive.</span> <span id="s431">I think that -- that’s also -- was helpful, you -- we have a goal, and then we can take much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: I did ask you, however, did you speak about your war time experience to -- to non-survivors, to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Okay, at that time, it was not the thing to do.</span> <span id="s434">It’s very interesting the progression of when talking about the Holocaust became proper.</span> <span id="s435">There was here a family o -- which, she was a survivor, and he married Eva, a lovely woman, and she was so nice to us.</span> <span id="s436">She took us -- she was an American.</span> <span id="s437">She took us out to Knottsberry Farm, and of course paid for it, and took us places, and invited us to her beautiful house, and -- but I don’t think that we really talked about it.</span> <span id="s438">It was too grim, it was too -- i-i-it was bel -- beyond belief, and people were not ready to talk, and people were not even more, ready to listen.</span> <span id="s439">They also went through a war where they, you know, where they’ve lost some loved ones.</span> <span id="s440">They were not ready to listen.</span> <span id="s441">The change occurred with some -- with some program on television, I think, and slowly it -- people started talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Do you mean perhaps the NBC series “Holocaust,” in 1978, I believe?</span> <span id="s443">That was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Possible, possible.</span> <span id="s445">Possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Don’t you think that was -- there was a distinct change [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, there was a d-distinct change was when it was just brought up on television then, and people somehow were ready to talk about it, or to -- or to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Was it difficult for you not to talk about it, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, I will tell you what, we were just busy living.</span> <span id="s450">Making a living, bringing up the children, thinking of the future.</span> <span id="s451">So, the 1939 Club, organization of the survivors, mostly from Poland, was organized quite early, which wa -- I was active for awhile there, and I have a picture, I will show it to you, where I’m being given a-award for that work.</span> <span id="s452">Now, my husband, I will tell you later, was their treasurer for 17 years, and that was very helpful for the survivors, because in the beginning they were meeting in people’s houses.</span> <span id="s453">Then, when the financial situation of the survivors was better, we were able to meet in a rented hall, and finally there were many occasions, and we also had orchestra, and for awhile the Jewish Federation in Los Angeles did not actually accept anybody from us as a member, which ch -- which changed completely right now, and we are very much respected, and they come to our affairs, and the -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: What -- why did they not accept anybody as a member?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: It takes time for people to accept.</span> <span id="s456">It takes time, and you have to work for it, you have to show what you can do, you have to show what positions you have.</span> <span id="s457">You have to show how educated your children are, and many of us, you know, like Mr. Sam Goetz, became -- you know, was educated and finished USC, and was active there.</span> <span id="s458">His wife has a Masters in German, and there are other people who are librarians, and they were quite -- were highly educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: But just -- just to clarify that, that’s -- that’s important, I think.</span> <span id="s460">So, there was a certain perception of survivors, if I understand you correctly then, even among the -- even with the Jewish Federation?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So what was -- there was some kind of prejudice, some kind of let’s say perception -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I remember the saying that we would like to be on the board, and it took a long time, but the switch is absolutely amazing, because we -- now we are -- they are always representative of the Jewish Federation coming to our affairs.</span> <span id="s464">We are donating to their causes, and things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: But what was the perception?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I could not tell.</span> <span id="s467">I could not tell.</span> <span id="s468">I don’t actually blame them.</span> <span id="s469">I think -- I think now, the attitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course, they were not in the concentration camps, they were not in Auschwitz, is already different, and they are -- the willingness to -- to help, is also greater, because now, since we are established, and since we are -- most of us anyhow, are doing well, and want to contribute both financially, and with our work, to our -- the Jewish community, and all the others, not Jewish causes, we are respected.</span> <span id="s470">You have to earn it, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So tell me a little bit more about this club.</span> <span id="s472">Do you roughly know when it was -- and it was sort of in the begin -- it was a social club, o-or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh, there is --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: It started, actually, a social club, and there is a whole book about it, about the 1939 Club.</span> <span id="s476">Now, maybe I should tell you now about -- what year was it, let me see.</span> <span id="s477">Anyhow, my husband started working for the 1939 Club as a treasurer, when, under the guidance and ideas of Dr. Sam Goetz, the chair of Holocaust studies was established at UCLA.</span> <span id="s478">When you are on the UCLA campus, close to Ralbunch building, you will see on a column, a plaque with great names, and among them is the name of David and Estelle Klipp, and others, all, if I’m not mistaken, members of the 1939 Club, who contributed financially and otherwise, to the establishment of this chair.</span> <span id="s479">Now, Dr. Sam Goetz is really to be commended very, very highly for his idea, which seemed strange for some people who could not understand the significance of establishing such a chair.</span> <span id="s480">Now -- this chair now, actually from the very beginning, had very good professors, some who came from Israel, and then Professor Friedlander, who was just recently awarded the genius re -- genius award, and who wrote -- who’s writing many books, and he was teaching in Switzerland, and after awhile -- that was a great accomplishment that he consented to be head of this chair in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s481">But there were previously, also, very, very famous professors, and the attendance in this classes was absolutely great.</span> <span id="s482">One time there were 300 students.</span> <span id="s483">And I don’t know exact number now, and also now there are graduates from this chair, who teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s484">And th -- I think, as an -- out of this example, there is now a chair of Holocaust studies at Yale, and many other universities.</span> <span id="s485">So my husband realized the importance of it, and he was a very busy man, working, head of a office, a large office, and he consented to be the treasurer, because they needed somebody who can handle it, and my husband had the accounting background, and he -- and he was in this position for 17 years.</span> <span id="s486">Each year they had to change the -- the laws, allowing him to become treasurer for another year.</span> <span id="s487">And the -- the 1939 Club is -- I think was a very wonderful idea.</span> <span id="s488">And there is a book about it, and it’s very -- our minutes are being sent to some archives, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So, what -- when -- when, about, was the as -- when was that chair established, that was in the -- in the 70’s, or in the 80’s, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Let me see.</span> <span id="s491">If -- if we -- my husband was there 17 years.</span> <span id="s492">I’ll tell you what, I will know, I will think about it.</span> <span id="s493">Let’s continue right now, but I will think about it.</span> <span id="s494">It’s quite awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Because he was -- okay, he was there -- he was 17 years, then when he felt that he cannot do it any more, because of -- I mean, he -- he knew something about himself, which I didn’t even noticed.</span> <span id="s497">He said he has to -- and that he has to give it up, and the -- because then, the treasurer, who was another man maybe for two years, and three years, so we were five, six years.</span> <span id="s498">Six and 17 would be 21, or something like that.</span> <span id="s499">Maybe more.</span> <span id="s500">I have a book, I could look it up, and tell you exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Did you stay in that neighborhood for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s503">I wish we did, but Philip was -- I mean, the neighborhood was changing, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s504">But the most important thing was that the schools, which Philip, my older son, was supposed to enter was much to be desired.</span> <span id="s505">An in -- there was -- it was not a school which I would be happy that he goes to, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s506">And I am not prejudiced, I really -- I mean, I’m normal, but the -- I respect everybody.</span> <span id="s507">Now, so we had to move.</span> <span id="s508">So we moved to a four units, and we lived in one.</span> <span id="s509">We bought that place, and then I -- I was managing it, Dave was, of course, very busy in his office.</span> <span id="s510">I never mentioned about his office, but I will.</span> <span id="s511">And I was doing everything there, and it -- I had many responsibilities, and life was really not easy, but -- but that there was -- it was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Let’s talk about that a little bit more, about the office, and what the kind of work was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Dave did?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Yeah, a-a-and --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, th -- not yet, not yet.</span> <span id="s516">He’s not yet in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: He’s not yet in the office.</span> <span id="s519">Now there, I decided that I want to become a nutritionist.</span> <span id="s520">I have always -- I have always been interested in nutrition.</span> <span id="s521">It started actually -- see my -- my father had diabetes, and had a kidney stone, and -- in the -- in the ghetto, he didn’t have neither diabetes, nor the kidney stone.</span> <span id="s522">And that happened to other people.</span> <span id="s523">However, we had pathologic -- these were pathological diseases.</span> <span id="s524">The other diseases, of course, are typhus, edema of the legs or the whole body, due to malnutrition, epidemiological diseases were rampant, but these diseases were not.</span> <span id="s525">So, after the lib -- not right after the liberation, but approximately -- yeah, I was actually conscious of it even when we lived in Bull Heights, because I wanted Philip to eat vegetables, and if he didn’t eat the vegetables, I would awf -- awfully upset.</span> <span id="s526">And he -- but he -- while we were living on Kenmore, I decided that I want to go to college, and I went to Los Angeles City College to become a nutritionist, and I actually enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s527">And Charlie remembers waiting for me on the campus, and watching the trains turn around.</span> <span id="s528">And the -- tho -- we had classes in anatomy, which were very helpful to me, and I -- there were many students from the nursing department, and I was really able sometimes even to help them.</span> <span id="s529">However, in 1960, there was a change.</span> <span id="s530">Dave had a massive, very serious heart attack, and I gave up college.</span> <span id="s531">It was so serious, that the doctors were trying to convince me that he will never survive.</span> <span id="s532">But with my optimistic outlook, and knowing Dave, who can overcome a lot, I -- I told them that they don’t dare telling me that.</span> <span id="s533">And this -- this was the same year as President Eisenhower had his heart attack.</span> <span id="s534">And Dr. Griffiths, a famous cardiologist, was also in -- invited to see Dave.</span> <span id="s535">When he looked at his file, he was very grim.</span> <span id="s536">But when he walked in and saw Dave, he changed his mind, and he told the other doctors there is a 50 - 50 cha -- chance.</span> <span id="s537">Now that was very important, because the attitude of the doctors is important.</span> <span id="s538">Now, Dave recovered.</span> <span id="s539">I -- maybe it is not what is being usually done today when children are concerned, however, I tried to keep up their violin lessons, and I was waiting to tell them, and to bring them to Dave, when Dave was able to wear a robe, and be in the waiting room.</span> <span id="s540">My feeling, in my case, the children were young, the father was a big support to them, and I was very much concerned that that will -- it will affect them.</span> <span id="s541">So, all the friends knew that they don’t dare tell anything.</span> <span id="s542">And it worked.</span> <span id="s543">Anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: It worked so that Dave got better?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Dave recovered.</span> <span id="s546">It was the -- what was happening actually, he needed a pacemaker, but the pacemaker wasn’t in -- was not yet invented.</span> <span id="s547">So, there was a certain medication which just came out, which he was getting, but he was able to work with pulse of 40, and sometimes even 35.</span> <span id="s548">I don’t know how this guy did it.</span> <span id="s549">I used to feed him vitamin E, which our friend, Dr. Horoby gave me permission to do so.</span> <span id="s550">Anyhow, when he recovered, he was still working in the same establishment, but now he was the head of the office.</span> <span id="s551">He had the mastery of the English language, and knowing -- and he ex -- it was explained to the administration what his background is, and believe me, he was working there for 17 years.</span> <span id="s552">He was admired, and he was respected by -- by the see -- the chairman of the board became his friends, and other directors became his friends, and the people who work for him loved him.</span> <span id="s553">So he was very demanding, much of himself, and much for others.</span> <span id="s554">Now, later on -- first it was a Carr shoe store, then there was HRT, and on top of this duties in the office, he also became the director of imports.</span> <span id="s555">And -- but he -- when this possibility of becoming treasurer for the 1939 Club came upon, he gladly accepted it, and he was working long hours, and really enjoyed doing it, because he believed in that good cause.</span> <span id="s556">So we are now -- now we have to move again, because Philip has to enter -- I mean, the junior high was fine, it was vigil, and it was alright, and he was doing quite well there, but there was a very good school called Fairfax High School, and we wanted him to go to Fairfax, and we needed to be in the district.</span> <span id="s557">So now -- by the way, after Dave’s heart attack, I decided that I better have a profession, so I went to a real estate school, passed the examination and got a real estate license.</span> <span id="s558">And I was able to find a place where we are now, a 16 unit, quite nice building, and the down payment was low, and I figured out that if I had to finance -- we finance the four units and -- and I’ll be able to buy it.</span> <span id="s559">And I remember when Dave asked me, “How will you buy it?”</span> <span id="s560">I said, “Dave, I will have the money.”</span> <span id="s561">And I came here, looked at it, and Dave only had five minutes time.</span> <span id="s562">He came from work, and left.</span> <span id="s563">Just -- he introduced himself to the previous owner, and I made the decision very quickly, and we bought the building.</span> <span id="s564">Now, we -- people were asking me, “Weren’t you afraid?”</span> <span id="s565">There was -- at times, there were many vacancies.</span> <span id="s566">I said, “I’m not afraid of hard work, and I am afraid, however, of having financials problems,” but of hard work -- and I worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s567">I -- there are still the -- many kitchens there is linoleum, I put -- I was putting up squares.</span> <span id="s568">In many places they still -- they’re wallpaper, which I put on.</span> <span id="s569">I learned to change washers.</span> <span id="s570">I -- even today, I -- when garbage disposal is blocked, I can unblock it very well.</span> <span id="s571">And I still do many things, not as many things as I did before.</span> <span id="s572">Now, Dave -- I was doing everything, and -- and when I had a vacancy, I didn’t even tell Dave.</span> <span id="s573">He was just too busy, and I didn’t want to bother him.</span> <span id="s574">However, he did the paperwork, which was very helpful.</span> <span id="s575">Well, when Dave passed -- about half a year before he passed away, I started doing the accounting, the paperwork, and Dave was so impressed that I can do it, and believe me, it was a big relief to him, because he was always worried, how will I be able to do it, and I think that was much easier than to take care of his health.</span> <span id="s576">Anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Estelle, let’s put -- let’s go back just a little bit, because I do want to ask you, when did you s -- did you ever talk to your children about both your war experiences, and if you did, when did you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: This is a very good question, and it’s easier now to answer it, because I talked to Philip just recently, and I told him certain things from the camps, and he says, “Do you know you never talked to me about it?”</span> <span id="s579">And -- But Dave did.</span> <span id="s580">I think maybe he talked to -- I -- I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s581">But, it depends -- the reaction of children is different.</span> <span id="s582">Now, Philip knew already everything from Dave, and he --</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: By what age, sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Young.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Young.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: He was -- he was fairly young.</span> <span id="s587">They used to take walks, they had a marvelous relationship.</span> <span id="s588">Both boys had very good relationship with Dave.</span> <span id="s589">And the -- so, he knew everything, and -- and he was angry about it.</span> <span id="s590">And he -- it influenced him, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Why -- why angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: That it happened, and also that God permitted it to happen.</span> <span id="s593">See, I never blamed God.</span> <span id="s594">Somehow I never blamed God.</span> <span id="s595">Maybe my philosophy about God is different.</span> <span id="s596">Maybe I really believe that we get a certain energy, or we get influence, or we get guidance, but in my philosophy about God was -- is such, probably, that I never blamed God for what happened.</span> <span id="s597">But anyhow -- but was -- Charlie was different.</span> <span id="s598">Charlie figured that if we could survive it, he can survive everything.</span> <span id="s599">So, he depends on the personality.</span> <span id="s600">Now, I might have talked to Charlie more.</span> <span id="s601">I have to check it with him, but he -- not really -- I was so busy about that they eat right, and that they do their homework, and that of course, was the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s602">It wasn’t the lack of time.</span> <span id="s603">I would have found the time to talk to them, but probably I didn’t feel like talking, and since my husband did all the talking, then -- then I -- I was surprised when my -- when Philip just recently told me that I -- when I talked to him about it, that I never talked to him about it.</span> <span id="s604">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you -- did you ever go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s607">I -- I couldn’t, I couldn’t see what happened in Poland.</span> <span id="s608">I was going to a school where all national holidays were celebrated, and the -- but we knew about an -- anti-Semitism, specially in the -- in the year before the outbreak of the war, it was also the influence of that folksdeutschen.</span> <span id="s609">I mean the German who were living in Poland, and cus --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Ethnic Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Ethnic Germans.</span> <span id="s612">And the -- but that -- that -- that would not be the -- th-that wouldn’t have influenced me so much.</span> <span id="s613">I speak Polish very well, and I finish high school in Poland, and I loved hearing music of Chopin, and the -- we were good citizen, I’m sure we were good citizen.</span> <span id="s614">Now, what influenced me?</span> <span id="s615">When the Germans -- it’s unbelievable -- when the Nazis came into Poland, and the Nazis were actually the -- the invaders, the Nazis could not really differentiate on a street, who is Jewish, and who is not.</span> <span id="s616">But there were Polish children, and Polish youngsters, who are pointing out to their invaders who is a Jew.</span> <span id="s617">Now, this is something which I really -- which is very bothersome to me.</span> <span id="s618">And you know there was -- there was one occurrence that when survivors came back, they were killed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s619">I would still be tolerant of them, because we all make mistakes, however, there is anti-Semitism now in Poland.</span> <span id="s620">Now, of course, we left everything.</span> <span id="s621">I have property in Poland, and some is actually I think in -- in -- in my name now, but people who tried to -- to become owners of their property have big difficulties, big difficulty.</span> <span id="s622">And -- okay, we left them everything.</span> <span id="s623">We left them the family jewel, we left them -- the store was taking away by the Germans.</span> <span id="s624">One day, they came to my father, we had like a department store, not as big --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Estelle, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s626">I think we should probably stop here.</span> <span id="s627">This is the end of tape two, side A, interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s628">I’ll just switch it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s632">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s633">So we were just talking about why you did not want to go back to Poland, and maybe you can say a little bit more about that, but also then say how you feel about Polish people in Poland today.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s635">Believe it or not, that I actually like when I have opportunity to speak Polish.</span> <span id="s636">And recently I needed to write a letter to someone, and it was amazing, I wrote it very well, and the trick is actually to think in Polish, not to think English, and really I was amazed how well I did, autographically, and otherwise.</span> <span id="s637">Now, I don’t have any hate in my heart, amazing as it is, and I wish that Polish people well.</span> <span id="s638">I wish that they develop a good economy, that they have a democratic government.</span> <span id="s639">However, I just wish very, very much, that they understand that being anti-Semitic actually doesn’t make sense, and that there is no reason to hate us.</span> <span id="s640">And it is not helpful to them at all.</span> <span id="s641">Now, I wish they followed the teaching of the present Pope, Pole, who went to the synagogue in Rome, and who claims, rightly so, that actually the Jews contributed a lot to Christianity.</span> <span id="s642">That they gave Jesus, who was, of course, Jewish, to -- to the Christians.</span> <span id="s643">Now, let’s be optimistic again, and let’s hope that the time will come, that maybe if their economic situation improves, that they will start thinking in these terms, so the tradition of anti-Semitism is so long, and so much imbedded in their -- a-actually even the fathers in chur -- in the churches, that it will take some great influence to change their minds, but hopefully -- hopefully they will, and I really wish them well.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So, you don’t have hate in your heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, I don’t have hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: But it would have been too difficult for you psychologically, and emotionally, to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: It would be like taking a wound, and opening it, and maybe even putting -- putting acid over it.</span> <span id="s648">I mean, I just always see the pictures, especially the picture where we arrived -- arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s649">We were lucky there was -- my whole family was there.</span> <span id="s650">I -- I see other pictures.</span> <span id="s651">I know what happened.</span> <span id="s652">I just hope -- which I mentioned in my tape, that the deaths of my parents wasn’t pa -- was not painful.</span> <span id="s653">I -- I just couldn’t go there, I just could not go there.</span> <span id="s654">And ti -- unless, of course, let’s say my children would insist, I might have changed my mind.</span> <span id="s655">But for myself, it will be devastating, and I really need my health.</span> <span id="s656">I needed my health to take care of my husband, I needed the health to -- to be the manager here, I need my health for myself.</span> <span id="s657">And it won’t be really constructive, because if I would know that I am achieving something, then it might influence me.</span> <span id="s658">But I would not achieve absolutely anything.</span> <span id="s659">The property which we have there, I will try to do something about it, but the likelihood is not very great that I would be compensated in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Did you ever go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Oh, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s662">We -- I am very much concerned about Israel.</span> <span id="s663">I -- we have the Jerusalem Post, and I -- when I get the Jerusalem Post, I read it from the first page to the last.</span> <span id="s664">So sometimes they were already in the paper, which I’m getting every day, the Los Angeles Times, there are also some information.</span> <span id="s665">I am -- I’m very concerned about Israel, and the -- very, very concerned, and -- however, and sometimes really I wish, specially now, to be able to visit, but I have now -- now somebody who does it for me, and it is my granddaughter Rachel, and she’s -- right now she is hiking in the desert, saw Angetti, saw the Wailing Wall, and when she saw the Wailing Wall, the girl started crying, from emotions.</span> <span id="s666">So, when she will come back, she will give me some impression of her own.</span> <span id="s667">Both my sons were in Israel, and visited it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Was there a special reason why you didn’t go?</span> <span id="s669">Why you never went, the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: That’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s671">Dave was really very concerned about Israel, and -- however, Dave, when the pa -- first pacemaker came out, Dr. Griffiths made the decision that it’s time for Dave to have it, because his heart was very large, and the first surgery was actually open heart surgery, and thanks to my vigilance, I notice after a few months, quite a short time, that he’s not well.</span> <span id="s672">And I -- I had a very hard time impressing it abou -- upon the people who had -- in the hospital, which was Dr. Kaper from the surgery, and it was the Saint Vincent Hospital, Dr. Kay was away, there was remodeling going on.</span> <span id="s673">And finally, when I told them that if Dr. Kay comes back, how will they be able to face him if they don’t check on Dave?</span> <span id="s674">Finally they did.</span> <span id="s675">So I and Charlie went with Dave there, and the minute they saw him, they took him to the operating room, and at this time, they inserted a -- the pacemakers which are -- which are being inserted now, which don’t -- don’t require open heart surgery, but it’s done through the arm.</span> <span id="s676">Now, Dave had the misfortune that anything which can go wrong with the pacemaker, including a runaway pacemaker, where the pulse was over 200, happened to him.</span> <span id="s677">Now, he had about 10 surgeries to change the pacemaker, so I have to compliment the medical profession because the last 12 years, the pacemaker lasts like eight years or more.</span> <span id="s678">Anyhow, considered all of this, I felt that it’s not safe for us to go on a journey.</span> <span id="s679">First, we were always afraid the pacemaker will fail, and that’s why we did not go to see Israel, so I really wish, for my husband, and also for myself, but where I am concerned, there is always possibilit -- a possibility that I still can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Did you, either one of you, ever testify in front of turbunal -- tribunal?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, Dave.</span> <span id="s682">It is in his tape.</span> <span id="s683">He was testi -- his testimony was there -- they took the testimony here, and yeah, he testified.</span> <span id="s684">And he did -- testimony was taken here and sent to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: But you nev -- you were never asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, I was never asked to testify.</span> <span id="s687">He -- you know, when he testified, they ask him whether he’s a lawyer, the way he testified, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Would you have done it?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Had you -- had you ever been asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: If I -- what -- see, he had a tremendous memory, Dave.</span> <span id="s692">Of course, if I would s -- if I would know of some people whom I know what crimes have penetrated, and if I would have, I definitely would testify, this my duty.</span> <span id="s693">Just as I feel about this interview, that it is my duty to bear witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I only ask -- I only ask that because I bil -- I seem to remember from your videotape that you said that you would have had butterflies doing it, and especially testifying about the ghetto, and I just meant to ask you what that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I am very so -- you know, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s696">I am -- you know, I am following a lot of alternative medicine.</span> <span id="s697">So I really am grateful, and I appreciate the regular medicine because -- and I want to maybe here have the opportunity to say thanks to Dr. Horlumby, who was our friend and doctor, and helped Dave enormously.</span> <span id="s698">And to Dr. Griffiths, and to Dr. Shakman, who helped Dave really to live a long life.</span> <span id="s699">However, I also added, to this medical approach, a -- the alternative medicine approach, like homeopathy, and herbs, and also a certain treatment by a chiropractor, which was very helpful -- which was very helpful to David, and also to me.</span> <span id="s700">Now, Regina told me that I mentioned in my tape that I would have butterflies in my stomach, probably, if I would have to testify.</span> <span id="s701">Now, I became stronger through this treatment, and I just wanted to mention here that I realize -- and I also go to a regular doctor, and I realize their contribution to medicine.</span> <span id="s702">It’s only a-at -- a -- addition to my regular -- to my regular medical treatment.</span> <span id="s703">So, fortunately, I am pretty good health.</span> <span id="s704">Now, this treatment which I am receiving, made me stronger emotionally.</span> <span id="s705">And if this question would have been asked from me today, I would have said I would gladly face them, and I would gladly testify.</span> <span id="s706">It is my duty to do so.</span> <span id="s707">So, we grow.</span> <span id="s708">We never stop growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Well, you also just learned Spanish, I heard, so you definitely don’t stop --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes, yes, that’s true, you know, where we’re talking about the tradition, about learning.</span> <span id="s711">I just recently learned Spanish, and I can communicate, and it’s a big help to me, and I -- I enjoy and probably I’ll still learn another language, in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Estelle, let me ask you something -- well, I’m asking you something all the time, but it’s just when you mentioned that your granddaughter had a very special experience, emotional experience in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: I want to ask you first of all, how many grandchildren you have, their names, when they were born, and then I take it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s716">I’m very fortunate.</span> <span id="s717">I -- Philip, my older son, and Ellen, his lovely wife, have a daughter, Roneet, of course Klipp, and she’s quite a girl.</span> <span id="s718">She just finish -- she just finish, and got her Masters in Tessle, which teaching English to people with other languages.</span> <span id="s719">Right now she’s in Guatemala to improve her Spanish, and also she was teaching English.</span> <span id="s720">I will meet her on July 29th, when she’s coming back from there, and she needs to go to Seattle.</span> <span id="s721">So, she’s quite, quite a girl.</span> <span id="s722">Now, her brother, Dan Klipp, I -- is also an amazing guy.</span> <span id="s723">First, he just loves books, and he’s a vivid reader, just like his father.</span> <span id="s724">And he is lost in the bookstore.</span> <span id="s725">One time he called me, “Grandma, I’m so sorry I’m so late, but I didn’t see the time, because I was reading.”</span> <span id="s726">Now he’s -- he also is graduated from college, Evergreen College.</span> <span id="s727">He’s -- he masters the language of Spanish, o-of French.</span> <span id="s728">He speaks that -- one of the Chinese languages, and he -- he keeps learning, and he loves to travel.</span> <span id="s729">So he was already in Africa, and climbed the Mount Kilimanjaro, not r -- naturally, not from the bottom.</span> <span id="s730">He was in Asia, he was teaching English in Korea.</span> <span id="s731">He was in Morocco, he was in Spain, and the -- he’s still traveling, and -- but he also realizes the importance of education, and he keeps learning, and he -- in many places where he visit, he -- he either teaches English, or finds other ways to -- to pay for his travels.</span> <span id="s732">And I -- I have very optimistic -- I’m very optimistic about his -- his future, and of course he wants to have a family, he told me, which -- which I am very happy about.</span> <span id="s733">Now there is Rachel, whom I already introduced to you, because she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s734">She’s a wonderful girl.</span> <span id="s735">She takes singing lessons, and she’s -- in school she was the stage manager for plays.</span> <span id="s736">And she probably, anyhow, from what she shared with me, she would like to go in that direction, and -- when she enters college.</span> <span id="s737">There is another guy, wonderful Benjamin, and he’s extremely smart, and I have great hopes for his good future, specially since his parents are such absolutely wonderful parents, and he -- her mo -- his mother and my son also, really have a special ability to deal with children, and oh well, we mention my daughter-in-law now, Margo, she also uses alternative medicine, o-o-of course, when necessary, also the medical approach, and she was -- in her search, which she is very good at, she found a doctor who is the MD, but he also uses alternative medicine.</span> <span id="s738">So, when we get together, we have much to talk about, and she was actually very helpful in finding some homeopathic doctor in Los Angeles for me.</span> <span id="s739">Now, there are all the four, and I don’t expect there’ll be more.</span> <span id="s740">Maybe the next generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Let’s -- let’s talk about -- I don’t want to make it a question, I’ll just say let’s talk -- talk a little bit about your Jewish identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s743">I would like to also say something about -- let’s say, I don’t consider it such a big accomplishment, but this -- what -- I can talk first by -- about my Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s744">Now I, my family was actually Orthodox, so my father was great in mathematics, and he also spoke some French and German.</span> <span id="s745">But it was a rather Orthodox house, so I was going to a secular school, a private gymnasium.</span> <span id="s746">The gymnasium named after the owner, which was Mrs. Hockstein, and we had only some Hebrew instruction, not too much of it, unfortunately, and all the girls in school were Jewish.</span> <span id="s747">Now, my experience with Judaism was very positive.</span> <span id="s748">In the -- in our home, I was told -- and I heard it quite frequently that not only it’s important to give, but it’s important how you give, not to make the oth -- the receiver uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s749">Every Friday night, from the house of prayer, my hus -- my father -- my father was bringing what was called the orech, which means a guest, and the guest was really treated like a guest.</span> <span id="s750">And he wasn’t asked any questions about his whereabouts, he was just -- there was a lot hospitality about how we treated him.</span> <span id="s751">And a bag with food was prepared at the time when he was leaving.</span> <span id="s752">And that was done every single Friday night, and also for holidays.</span> <span id="s753">So, I knew about sedaka.</span> <span id="s754">Also, when there was a family which was less fortunate that we were, I know that they were supported.</span> <span id="s755">Then I saw a great respect for my grandparents.</span> <span id="s756">My parents respected the grandparents.</span> <span id="s757">Also, the brothers of my mother not only respected them, but really, well, just extremely, extremely generous.</span> <span id="s758">So my -- this experience was very positive where Judaism is concerned.</span> <span id="s759">Then my father studied on Saturday, he used the time to study the Talmud, and the -- and then other books.</span> <span id="s760">And so I heard [indecipherable] many expression, I heard about Rushy, which I would like to know more about right now.</span> <span id="s761">Then, in the ghetto, it was very interesting, because, for instance, for a time we were allowed to do some planting in the backyard, it wasn’t a big backyard, but everything was helpful.</span> <span id="s762">And no one, but no one stole somebody’s else’s tomatoes, or whatever was growing.</span> <span id="s763">Then, when my brother was so sick in the ghetto, I -- I was sometimes spending the night at the neighbors.</span> <span id="s764">There was another neighbor who -- who told us about Dr. Yawkish, and she was extremely helpful.</span> <span id="s765">So, all my experiences, living among Jews, were very positive.</span> <span id="s766">So, also I am -- of course I observe holidays, and for an -- for the high holidays and Yom Kippur, I am in the temple.</span> <span id="s767">I pray in my own way, in general, and so I know that the tradition is very important, let’s say when my grandchildren come, because that’s how, actually, religion is being introduced to children, and it’s very, very important.</span> <span id="s768">So, not being really observant, I am still very Jewish, and I -- I’m happy that I’m Jewish, in spi -- in spite of what I had to suffer because of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Was it different with your husband, or did you -- did you agree on those -- on those --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: My husband was -- he -- I -- I -- I read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s771">For instance, when I am at temple, I can follow.</span> <span id="s772">I don’t understand most of it, but I can follow.</span> <span id="s773">My husband knew prayers by heart.</span> <span id="s774">Even when he was very, very sick, and we had Passover in our house, we were all amazed, he remembered by heart, so many prayers.</span> <span id="s775">So he’s -- he really -- and he remembered so many melodies, and so many prayers.</span> <span id="s776">But he was a man of the -- you know, of the wide world.</span> <span id="s777">And him -- I wish, actually -- so, for instance, for easker, which is a prayer for the dead, he was always in the temple, he always was going to the temple.</span> <span id="s778">So, actually, we were able, with our -- I-I -- maybe he would have liked even a little more observance, because like, I like havdallah, which is -- which is said at the end of Shabbat, to make a -- a distinction between the beginning of the week, and the ending of Shabbat.</span> <span id="s779">So, I guess if I would have asked him very much, he would have done it.</span> <span id="s780">But otherwise, we -- we did not have any problems about observance.</span> <span id="s781">And it’s -- definitely was a Jewish home, when the children were small, there was -- we st -- sta -- stuck to that observance more than I do right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: It sounds as you have had a good marriage.</span> <span id="s783">That you have nice children and grandchildren, everything.</span> <span id="s784">And a comfortable living.</span> <span id="s785">However, are there still memories that haunted you and your husband?</span> <span id="s786">Was it not always that easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: It’s still not easy.</span> <span id="s788">I just -- see, my husband passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: August second, 1997.</span> <span id="s791">I will go back -- he was 92, and this, I believe that he lived so long, considering that he had this massive heart attack in 1960, and that he was working so hard, and so many hours, which he enjoyed, I feel that I have a certain contri -- that I made a contribution to his health.</span> <span id="s792">So, it wasn’t so easy in the beginning to convince him, but after awhile, he admitted to my son that he follows my instructions, especially when food is concerned, he does feel better.</span> <span id="s793">So he changed his way of eating.</span> <span id="s794">Then, I used herbs, which he -- then I juiced celery and other vegetables, because he would not otherwise eat them.</span> <span id="s795">I was very, very -- how can -- inventive in making certain things out of vegetables, which he didn’t realize they are vegetables.</span> <span id="s796">And also, we were using a chiropractor who was extremely good, and thanks to that, he -- he had water on the lungs for awhile, but thanks to this treatment, he actually did not have it any more.</span> <span id="s797">He did not have -- the water subsided.</span> <span id="s798">And so he had 10 surgeries for his pacemaker, and he has other surgeries, each time he bounced back, with his iron will, and his equanimity, and went back to work, and -- and was doing a great job, so I, of course, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: I was -- I was asking about memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: So, the reason I answer it this way, was that I was so busy doing something which had -- see, he’s the father of my children, he is my husband.</span> <span id="s803">He is himself.</span> <span id="s804">And if I can prolong his wi -- life, and I can keep him healthy, I thought this would be my greatest achievement, and it was really, really the -- the aim of my life.</span> <span id="s805">I have a friend, she used to always say, “Okay, David, but where is Estelle?”</span> <span id="s806">I just -- just -- even un -- didn’t understand what she said.</span> <span id="s807">Now, on top of it, I -- I am -- I was taking care of the 16 units.</span> <span id="s808">When I had a vacancy, I didn’t even tell him.</span> <span id="s809">Now, since he passed away, I am the owner, I am the manager, I clean up a little bit.</span> <span id="s810">I do all the paperwork, I prepare the taxes.</span> <span id="s811">So, I am actually very busy.</span> <span id="s812">And I was even -- I was just as busy before, to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s813">And i -- so to tell you the truth, right now, I -- the memories haunt me more than before.</span> <span id="s814">Before, I was even busier, probably.</span> <span id="s815">I have some memories.</span> <span id="s816">Sometimes I dream that why I’m not going to our store, I would be very good at it.</span> <span id="s817">And I -- I -- one time I had a very destructive dream, but I don’t have them too frequently.</span> <span id="s818">This picture of -- of the day in August, where we came out of the trains, and had to leave everything, and suddenly we were separated.</span> <span id="s819">So I didn’t know for a long time what actually happened.</span> <span id="s820">This -- this scene just lives with me.</span> <span id="s821">I live with this scene.</span> <span id="s822">I -- this -- na -- it -- it really never parts.</span> <span id="s823">Also, what haunts me was when they took my father, and specially my mother to the krippo, because I -- it’s in my tapes, when she tame -- came back, she was just emotionally destroyed, and I was happy when they took me also, so -- not that I was big help, but -- so this -- this was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s824">My --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s826">We have to stop now, and use another tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: This is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Estelle Klipp.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s832">This is tape number three, side A. And you were just talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No, you don’t want to talk to the microphone?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: It’s -- it’s all right, I can -- I’m -- I’m -- I can hear myself, I’m -- I’m fine on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Now, I just want to say, you just talked about two memories, or two images that -- that haunt you, and I was just wondering whether you had -- whether you want to conclude this with another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it’s mentioned the tape, we had a cellar in our room, and [indecipherable] in the ghetto, and we were hiding there whenever there was deportation, pretty successfully, and very often I think, maybe if we wouldn’t have gone to Auschwitz, maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would we get food?</span> <span id="s838">And of course, we didn’t know, because there were actually graves prepared for the people who were designated to clean the ghetto.</span> <span id="s839">So, we didn’t know that the Russian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon.</span> <span id="s840">Lodz, which was Litzmanshtadt, so even the Rukoski went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s841">They were so deceiving, the Nazis, that they were able to convince us that we are going to a better place.</span> <span id="s842">Anyhow, that haunts me so very often, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we would been able to -- to survive.</span> <span id="s843">Then, I often see the picture of my brother.</span> <span id="s844">He became rather -- rather religious.</span> <span id="s845">And in the ghetto he used to lay the tefillin, which they something you put on your head, and you wrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome.</span> <span id="s846">And, so it’s a great pain that he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s847">Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman, never complained either.</span> <span id="s848">And -- and w-which other memories?</span> <span id="s849">Course I remember, yeah, there was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes, and the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to stop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs. Cohen.</span> <span id="s850">She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me.</span> <span id="s851">She was very often whipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection even with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I can stretch better, really, as time progresses.</span> <span id="s852">I became stronger, emotionally.</span> <span id="s853">So, when these memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because there is still so much I have to do right now.</span> <span id="s854">And the -- for instance, I learned yoga actually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from India.</span> <span id="s855">And then for about 20 years, I couldn’t do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which didn’t nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain.</span> <span id="s856">Now, when my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back.</span> <span id="s857">Then she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein from New York, which was called networking, which is actually they just touch certain points, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but I’ll tell you anyhow about it.</span> <span id="s858">One time, short -- maybe two weeks after she was practicing it with me -- on me, my arm started -- started moving in yoga positions.</span> <span id="s859">And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it’s getting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started doing yoga.</span> <span id="s860">And actually my yoga is improving as I -- I don’t know whether I mentioned it before.</span> <span id="s861">And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me awfully good feeling.</span> <span id="s862">Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which stretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions.</span> <span id="s863">And I guess also the nutrition which I practice.</span> <span id="s864">Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio -- hemiopathy -- homeopathy.</span> <span id="s865">And it was actually discovered in Germany, about more than 200 years ago.</span> <span id="s866">And these remedies are also very helpful.</span> <span id="s867">Now, in order to know which vitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by chiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing.</span> <span id="s868">The people who do it are kinesthiologists.</span> <span id="s869">That’s how they call themself.</span> <span id="s870">Now, one chiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I’m trying to teach others, but I don’t know why, I am not successful.</span> <span id="s871">I only was able to teach my grandson.</span> <span id="s872">He just was so impressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such.</span> <span id="s873">If we put into our bodies, whether it’s a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is good for us, it strengthens our muscles.</span> <span id="s874">And the opposite if it’s not good for us, it weakens our muscles.</span> <span id="s875">So, the method is, after the certain, let’s say food or vitamin, is put on the body, usually close to the simus, which is on the chest, and one checks the arm by having the arm extended, and trying to push it down.</span> <span id="s876">If the remedy is not good for the body, the arm will go down.</span> <span id="s877">If it’s good for the body, it won’t go.</span> <span id="s878">And the same can be used with the fingers, which I -- which I use, and I’m pretty accurate at it.</span> <span id="s879">Now this was helping me very much with my husband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it’s a great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it.</span> <span id="s880">Now, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and he -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a machine which he uses, but where I went to him one time, and I show him that I can do muscle testing, he says, “You don’t need to come to me any more.”</span> <span id="s881">And I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So you are still trying to, or you are still growing, all the time?</span> <span id="s883">Not just stretching, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yes, and so -- that was extremely helpful because it was very important to help my husband in all ways -- I mean, in all possibly ways, so that he could live long.</span> <span id="s885">And the -- I -- it just -- I spoke to my cousin, he’s in Australia, I mean, actually his son, he says, do you know -- and that was maybe in ’85 or so, “Do you remember -- now he’s doing so well, and do you remember how it was in -- in 1970 when I talked to you, how worried you were about him?”</span> <span id="s886">So I’m very -- so he’s not here, but he had a good life, and we keeped him healthy, and the -- I don’t want to give myself more credit than I deserve, but I hear from all kinds of quarters, friends, doctors and others, that I was quite helpful in keeping him healthy.</span> <span id="s887">Now, what would you like me to a -- what would you like to ask me?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: I would -- you could see in my face I have another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Well, something slightly different.</span> <span id="s891">We did talk about your Jewish identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Do you remember when you began to feel comfortable with an identity as an American?</span> <span id="s896">Assuming that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yes, yes, yes, I feel very --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: -- and what -- and what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: -- okay, I will tell you what -- I will tell you what.</span> <span id="s900">That I first -- I’m really very grateful to the United States for giving me the opportunity, and giving me my citizenship, and I think it’s an absolutely great country.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, great country.</span> <span id="s902">And I am very much interested in politics.</span> <span id="s903">When the children were small, and Adlai Stevenson was running for president, I took them to the Roosevelt Hotel, and to the rally, and we were cheering him up.</span> <span id="s904">Then, I have a picture, I will show it to you, with Senator Scoop Jackson, and the -- which wa -- it was my husband and myself, and I’m very proud of it, and I’m very, very sorry that he passed away so soon, and so unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s905">I wish -- I shouldn’t say it, but I wish I instructed him in healthy living, but I didn’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s906">And -- and he put -- he put -- on his ice cream, he put cream.</span> <span id="s907">Of course, many people do it, and live a long life, but I really wish he lived longer.</span> <span id="s908">An absolutely marvelous senator, a marvelous man.</span> <span id="s909">I vote all the -- I don’t miss any possibility of voting, I always vote.</span> <span id="s910">Of course, I follow what’s happening with great interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Do you -- are more inclined to one party than another?</span> <span id="s912">You mentioned Stevenson, so I gather --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s916">However, I also admired Goldwater -- Goldwasser, because I thought there was a lot of integrity, and there are some Republicans which I really admire, so you never know.</span> <span id="s917">It depends who the candidate will be, because I actually would vote according o-of the qualities of the candidate as I see them.</span> <span id="s918">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Now you -- so you have said that you’re very grateful and proud to be here, and that you do --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: -- feel American.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I feel American, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: What -- what does that mean?</span> <span id="s924">C-Can you say the --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: What I -- what does it mean?</span> <span id="s926">Considering that they opened the gates for us, considering all the laws -- laws.</span> <span id="s927">Considering that people -- I mean, I went to Washington, of course, I went to -- I saw the -- the House of Representative.</span> <span id="s928">I -- I talked to my senators.</span> <span id="s929">We also -- we -- we visited the Pentagon, I mean from the outside, and it was a wonderful experience, I wouldn’t miss it for -- not for -- I wouldn’t miss it, that’s all.</span> <span id="s930">And the -- I’m concerned about our elected officials.</span> <span id="s931">You just -- I respect the president no matter whether he’s a Republican, or whether he’s a Democrat, when he’s our president, he’s our president.</span> <span id="s932">I feel comfortable here, but I also realize that -- that -- that Democracy is something which has to be constantly watched.</span> <span id="s933">And I remember the time of melcar -- McCarthy’s.</span> <span id="s934">So I realized at that time that -- that it’s a witch hunt.</span> <span id="s935">I did realize at that time, and I was very happy when it was over.</span> <span id="s936">I worry when there is a war, of course.</span> <span id="s937">I worry about the soldiers, I respect the veterans.</span> <span id="s938">Oh, it’s a great country to live in, and God bless America.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Now it’s almost heresy to ask you whether there is something that you find worrisome, or did you see something that you find difficult?</span> <span id="s940">You mentioned McCarthy, that was -- the McCarthy era, that was -- you -- you were critical when you saw that.</span> <span id="s941">Were there other incidents, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: There is always -- there is always room to improvement.</span> <span id="s943">Even to just take care of the family, there are many problems, which you have to overcome.</span> <span id="s944">Now, if you have a business, there are many problems.</span> <span id="s945">There are different people you have to deal with, whom you have to instruct, or who do better, or do worse.</span> <span id="s946">Now imagine a country of the size of the United States of America.</span> <span id="s947">Of course there are problems.</span> <span id="s948">Of course, but y -- there being wor-worked at.</span> <span id="s949">I am concerned about education.</span> <span id="s950">I was -- I wasn’t happy when arts have been taken away from schools, and now it’s a tendency to put them back into schools, which I am very happy about.</span> <span id="s951">I am concerned about the environment.</span> <span id="s952">And the -- it’s a fine line between business and environment.</span> <span id="s953">I am very happy to see what the difference in the -- in the attitude towards tobacco, when in the beginning all the actresses were smoking, and -- to be able, I’ll tell you, it’s such a great achievement, to be able to come to the point now where there is no advertising on television, and all the advertising used to be for tobacco, for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s954">I think that is enormous achievement.</span> <span id="s955">There are many enormous achievements.</span> <span id="s956">And even in the race relations.</span> <span id="s957">So it’s not perfect, but the achievements are absolutely great.</span> <span id="s958">So I have great hopes that the -- the country will flourish in all respects, and I think the education will also improve, because they are now.</span> <span id="s959">And if I can help in any way, I’ll be very great to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: That’s a positive outlook again.</span> <span id="s961">Is there -- do you speak often -- do you give interviews or public talks about -- about where you come from often, or is it an -- a rare thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: On the Bar Mitzvah of my granddaughter, I had to get up and thank people for something, and they told me that I am pretty good public speaker.</span> <span id="s963">I mean, I didn’t have to say too mu -- and I probably, if I have to get up and talk, I would be able to.</span> <span id="s964">However, I didn’t do much of it.</span> <span id="s965">I have a friend, Celine Drack, who goes to schools, who speaks, and receives many letters, she is very goo -- letters.</span> <span id="s966">She is very good at it.</span> <span id="s967">She also went to prison and talked to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s968">And she’s also involved in Anti-Defamation League, and in the club, and so on, and I admire her for it, and it’s a very worthwhile endeavor.</span> <span id="s969">I was never -- there are many -- she also is the head of a teacher’s group.</span> <span id="s970">She teaches teachers how to teach Holocaust in schools.</span> <span id="s971">I have a better opinion about myself now than I used to, I think.</span> <span id="s972">And -- and if there would be really a need for me to speak -- I would do some studying, of course, because it’s nice to -- you know, it’s nice to be able to answer many questions which the students have.</span> <span id="s973">But it’s a very worthwhile endeavor, because if you meet a survivor, and you hear him talk, it has a good influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: You know, I was just about to ask you, h-h-how do you think the impact of survivor testimony has been on -- on -- in understanding of the Holocaust, in general?</span> <span id="s975">Tell me, do you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: We are very fortunate, very fortunate, that after the hiatus of time, when people didn’t dare -- people didn’t want to know, and there were so many deniers of the Holocaust, that after this time, thanks to the TV, and thanks to the movies, we became -- it became public.</span> <span id="s977">Not everybody s-still knows about it, but many people do, and it’s a big relief for the survivors.</span> <span id="s978">Anyhow, I feel this way, because you know, in our home, was a saying that the worst curse actually in our home was mishamime visacrone.</span> <span id="s979">And I didn’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s980">It means erase from memory.</span> <span id="s981">So being erased from memory, even you know, there were no many -- many curses in my ho-home, where -- with my parents, but even about Hitler, they say -- they say he should be erased from memory.</span> <span id="s982">So this points how important it is, that the people who perished should be remembered.</span> <span id="s983">I mean, it’s mindboggling, it’s -- because if you say six million, you cannot imagine it, but if you talk about a few, like Anne Frank, or others, then you could realize it.</span> <span id="s984">Now, I very grateful for -- for it being now recognized, and taught, that’s why I really commend Dr. S-Sam Goetz for establishing this chair of Holocaust studies, and I hope -- and I have a feeling that the deniers of the ho -- of the Holocaust, are quieting down, cause we don’t hear so much about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: I’m just curious [indecipherable] are you following sort, of some of the controversies around Holocaust studies?</span> <span id="s986">I mean some people would say that the discussion there has become very, very academic, and is taking away from the -- from the human experience in that way.</span> <span id="s987">Or that too much emphasis is being put on -- on -- on -- on the Holocaust, as over against other aspects of Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s988">How do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: They say if you forget history, it repeats itself.</span> <span id="s990">So, a base of this, it’s very important not to forget.</span> <span id="s991">I don’t think it’s too much, I do not think it’s too much, because it’s -- it’s like Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says, you have to talk about it.</span> <span id="s992">I mean, because otherwise it will repeat itself.</span> <span id="s993">It’s not only for the Jewish people, it’s for -- for the world.</span> <span id="s994">In order that something like that can happen.</span> <span id="s995">So, it didn’t happen overnight, the signs were there.</span> <span id="s996">But we have to learn to watch for the signs, and to do ab -- something about it before it becomes a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s997">So, it’s not egoistic in any way, to talk about it.</span> <span id="s998">And there will be different aspect of the Holocaust, but all aspects should be as -- should be talked about it, because we are dying out.</span> <span id="s999">There will be no -- I mean, I can see among our friends, I looked at the telephone book, and it’s amazing how many people already passed away.</span> <span id="s1000">Now, once we passed away, if we don’t leave the legacy, because as much as you talk, you don’t cover everything.</span> <span id="s1001">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1002">So, for the benefit of mankind, not only of the Jewish people, it’s important to study it, and to know what it happen, because I don’t think there were prog -- pogroms, other people were persecuted, but the dimension of this persecution, and the planning of the Final Solution, is actually, in a way unique.</span> <span id="s1003">I wish it isn’t -- it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Do you think the world is learning from what can be learned from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: You know, when I think about Kosovo, this is the first time -- I mean, nothing is perfect, but considering what Milosevitch was doing to these people, he was burying them, he was murdering them.</span> <span id="s1006">And I -- and it’s fortunate that NATO, with the baking of -- backing of the United State, had the guts to do something about it, and I am not qualified to say it, but there is likely a likelihood, that the Holocaust of the -- of the people during World War Two, had some influence of -- of this engagement.</span> <span id="s1007">So we won’t eradicate hatred, but we might work towards eradication of hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: You did say just a -- just about two minutes ago, that Holocaust survivors are passing away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: That’s true, but on the phone when we talked before I came here, you also said that you -- you referred to a spirit of the survivors, when you go to gatherings --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Maybe you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Meanin -- well, the question is why certain people survived.</span> <span id="s1014">May -- maybe some of the answer is to see them gathered together.</span> <span id="s1015">We have this 1939 Club, who does a lot of charitable work, but we also gather together, and we combine some worthwhile endeavors with a dance.</span> <span id="s1016">And I actually -- it boggles my mind to see the e-enthusiasm, and the way these people dance.</span> <span id="s1017">Everybody dances.</span> <span id="s1018">People who don’t feel good, dance.</span> <span id="s1019">Everybody dances, and I never saw anything like it, even between much younger people.</span> <span id="s1020">So there is something special about the spirit of the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: When y-you also said a little earlier that you don’t speak publicly, you’re not the kind to talk publicly very much.</span> <span id="s1022">But, you -- you thought it was very important to do this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1024">I said once that I’m -- I didn’t feel guilty that I survive.</span> <span id="s1025">But I would feel very guilty if I would not make the video when I had a chance.</span> <span id="s1026">I would feel very guilty if I would not make this interview.</span> <span id="s1027">So I thought maybe other people have more to say, but even if other people have more to say, what I have to say could be -- it’s also history.</span> <span id="s1028">So, I have the obligation, and I’m going to -- I have some pictures of my family which were saved by somebody who came from Russia, and I’m going to go to the Holocaust office, which is in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1029">I had it all prepared.</span> <span id="s1030">And I’m going to get a little bit more involved, too, so that the memory of -- of the people like -- the photos which I have, what I know about it, and maybe I could mention here I appreciate the opportunity about my husband’s brother, because that was something which he was so hurt and sad about.</span> <span id="s1031">He was -- he went to Kovno, his brother Solomon, and -- in the hope to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1032">And in Kovno, what was happening, it was under the Russian occupation, and then under -- under German occupation.</span> <span id="s1033">Finally, when the Nazis won, they just murdered him.</span> <span id="s1034">I mean, not only him, there was a Mr. Frumkin, who was, I understand, also murdered.</span> <span id="s1035">And this Solomon had such potentials.</span> <span id="s1036">He spoke a beautiful English, and there was a English club, and when the speaker didn’t come, he spoke.</span> <span id="s1037">And there was such a pain for David, my husband, his whole life, that his brother didn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: This is the end of tape three, side A, interview with Estelle Klipp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s1041">This is tape number three, side B. And I think I would just like you to speak a little bit more about your family.</span> <span id="s1042">Whatever it is that you would like to add.</span> <span id="s1043">Your children, your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Now, you also asked me, when I look back at all this years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: That’s the -- that’s the next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Ah, can we reverse it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: [indecipherable] you can reverse it.</span> <span id="s1048">So, the question would be when -- I do what you tell me to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: How nice, thank you very much, Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: You never wait for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: You are a very lovely interpre -- interviewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Okay, well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1053">I-I’m blushing.</span> <span id="s1054">But let me get -- let me get to the question.</span> <span id="s1055">So the question would be then, when you look back at your life, of -- of 55 years, of the last 55 years, your life here in America, what -- how would you t -- how would you speak about it?</span> <span id="s1056">How would you -- how would you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: It’s a very interesting question, and a few days ago I said, you know, since liberation, there’s actually -- it was 1945, so are -- 55 years, right?</span> <span id="s1058">So there are 55 years.</span> <span id="s1059">I have to talk about 55 years.</span> <span id="s1060">And -- but it doesn’t seem so lo -- it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s1061">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s1062">Now, the reason -- one of the reason it wasn’t easy was that my husband so -- he was always active, and had a lot of energy.</span> <span id="s1063">His mind was fantastic, even nearly to the very last minute, so he was at home.</span> <span id="s1064">And I am very proud and happy about it, that I kept him at home til the last minute.</span> <span id="s1065">And I was present at his death, and I could tell that there was a -- his body was like a shell, but he still was there.</span> <span id="s1066">And then, since we lived so long in this apartment, I just feel his presence, and I told him about this interview, and I -- believe it or not, I still pray for him, that wherever he is, he’s -- he’s at peace, and that everything is alright.</span> <span id="s1067">So there was always a feeling, even when I was at home, there was always a feeling of responsibility.</span> <span id="s1068">And so the life was not easy.</span> <span id="s1069">However, it helped me -- oh, especially in -- in the later years, it helped me.</span> <span id="s1070">Yoga, nutrition, homeopathy, herbs, all these helped me to feel healthy, be healthy, and being able to function in spite of the memories, and in spite of whatever difficulties I have to face.</span> <span id="s1071">However, it wa -- a big aspect -- I was very fortunate with the children.</span> <span id="s1072">They were good students, they didn’t give me any trouble.</span> <span id="s1073">I don’t -- when I didn’t have a car, we used to go with the bus, everywhere, and I didn’t have any problems.</span> <span id="s1074">I understand they were fighting very frequently in the house, but that’s -- that’s normal.</span> <span id="s1075">Now, for instance, Philip is very bright.</span> <span id="s1076">I mentioned, I guess before, that he went to UCLA while still at Fairfax High.</span> <span id="s1077">And he is the avid reader, he always learns.</span> <span id="s1078">He speaks perfect Hebrew, and perfect Spanish, and he also speaks man -- not speaks, but he knows many computer languages.</span> <span id="s1079">And he’s also very good at composing software.</span> <span id="s1080">That’s something which is very much sought after, and the -- and he happens to be extremely good at it.</span> <span id="s1081">Now, I was also fortunate in -- he just, this year, he was celebrating his 30th weddings anniversary.</span> <span id="s1082">He has a very lovely wife.</span> <span id="s1083">She has teacher’s credentials.</span> <span id="s1084">She’s extremely talented.</span> <span id="s1085">There is a picture here, I will show it to Regina, which she painted.</span> <span id="s1086">It was a desk at -- at UCLA, dormitory of my son, with all his books, and she printed the Hebrew text, which is -- you can see when you look at the picture.</span> <span id="s1087">She also can work with wood, she can do gardening.</span> <span id="s1088">I don’t know whether there is anything this girl cannot do.</span> <span id="s1089">And then, in nine -- then, I told you about the birth of Charlie in 1951, and ha -- he has very much my husband’s personality, and when I -- it was -- I’m really grateful, these two boys is like a great gift to me, and their wives also.</span> <span id="s1090">And Charlie was celebrating his 20th weddings anniversary, and the -- during the Olympics, he was associated with ABC, and he was the directors of systems, and he, with others, devised a systems for the payroll, and other things, and his name was on the credits, on television, after the Olym -- when the credits were shown.</span> <span id="s1091">He -- he also has this personality that people like to work for him, and the people who are working for him -- and it was very strenuous work, told him that whenever he wants to, they will always work for him.</span> <span id="s1092">His wife has also teacher’s credentials, and also, as I mentioned before, she also is interested in alternative medicine.</span> <span id="s1093">I mentioned that, and she is a wonderful mother, and so I have actually two sons, and two very wonderful girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: I -- I forgot whether I asked you that before, but in the case I haven’t, I just want to know, what about Jewish tradition, and Jewish faith, is that perpetuated in them, in both families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1096">Charlie, Friday night, there is time to be at home, and there are no other arrangements being made, and there is -- there’s Shabbat dinner with the challah, and with candles being lit, and with the prayers, and all the children know the prayers, and they go to the synagogue, they [indecipherable] they live in Sebastapal, in northern California.</span> <span id="s1097">They used to live in Los Angeles, but they found there a very good place for the children to go to religious school, and they are practicing -- they are definitely practicing Judaism, and the -- Rachel was very anxious to go to Israel, she went to Israel in a group called Young Judea, which is under the auspices of the Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1098">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Did you talk to your grandchildren about -- do they know about your experience [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yes, they definitely know.</span> <span id="s1101">They -- they know, and they -- I have a little tag, it’s actually a tin tag with a number, there’s two or three -- I’ll have to look for the other numbers.</span> <span id="s1102">And when my granddaughter saw this tag, she says, “Please don’t give it to anybody, I want to have it.”</span> <span id="s1103">And what was happening, they had a play of Anne Frank in her school.</span> <span id="s1104">And that reminds me, I was being asked by Regina whether I ever spoke.</span> <span id="s1105">I did speak.</span> <span id="s1106">What happened, I was visiting Sebastapal, and the -- my granddaughter Rachel asked me whether I would talk to the cast.</span> <span id="s1107">And I s -- I was hesitating, but she says she knows there is another grandfather, but his English is not good, so I said, “Okay, I will speak.”</span> <span id="s1108">You should see the letters I got from that cast.</span> <span id="s1109">It changed their complete attitude.</span> <span id="s1110">They -- they was -- it inspired them to play better, or maybe little bit different.</span> <span id="s1111">I spoke for quite awhile, and I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: What did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: About my experiences, and also, you see, I have a uncle in Poland, who perished.</span> <span id="s1114">He was taken from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, and strangely enough, my mother had at that time a dream, that she is meeting him in a awful place.</span> <span id="s1115">And so I told them about my uncle, who came from the same time -- from the same town as Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s1116">And I kept talking, and they listened, and you know what they did?</span> <span id="s1117">The program had -- had a line that they are -- that -- in my honor -- the program is in my honor.</span> <span id="s1118">And then, when I was there, when the play, at the last act, I was called to the stage, and I was given flowers.</span> <span id="s1119">And I embraced, of course, everyone in the cast.</span> <span id="s1120">So I did talk, and it was -- it was very, very easy for me to talk, now, because I -- cause I had a wonderful audience, and I could make the connection between -- you know, between Anne Frank, and my -- and my uncle in Amsterdam, and also I told them about, that even the father of Anne Frank, after the war, he married.</span> <span id="s1121">See, they were young people, you have to give them hope.</span> <span id="s1122">You cannot -- you cannot devastate them.</span> <span id="s1123">So I told them that I’m no hating anybody, which is true, I wouldn’t have said it otherwise.</span> <span id="s1124">But I also told them that Anne Frank’s father married again, and has a family.</span> <span id="s1125">So, I think was important for me to tell them that.</span> <span id="s1126">So -- but this play could have been played on Broadway.</span> <span id="s1127">It was done so wonderful, and I -- I will show you later, I had letters and letters thanking me for talking to them.</span> <span id="s1128">Because then they understood what -- what the play is all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You had tears in your eyes when you s -- when you talked about it, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Because it was very touching.</span> <span id="s1131">It’s difficult to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1132">It’s difficult to talk about it, but I see all these young people sitting in front of me, and attentively listening to me.</span> <span id="s1133">I -- what a gift to me, that -- that I could talk about it, and they were -- they were so impressed, and they were so, so, so grateful.</span> <span id="s1134">And so, I did talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Well, I have asked you pretty much everything that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Oh, you asked me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: -- wanted for -- what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: -- the second question was, when I look back at my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: I’m gra -- I am grateful to be alive.</span> <span id="s1141">I try always to find something to be grateful for.</span> <span id="s1142">So, I am grateful that we were able to bring up the boys so well, that we gave them music lessons, that we -- maybe we were fortunate also that they did so well, and are doing so well.</span> <span id="s1143">And my greatest achievement is that Dave lived to be 95, and quite happy.</span> <span id="s1144">Happy with what he was doing, happy with his family.</span> <span id="s1145">And so i-it wasn’t an easy life for my, you know, because I remember that when others went to swimming pool -- to the swimming pool, or on a weekend, I was watering the -- the patio, so -- to cool it off.</span> <span id="s1146">I always had the responsibilities, there were always some kind of a problems which I had to solve, but I really -- so it wasn’t easy, but I didn’t mind it, because I -- I always felt that I rather work hard, than have problems which I wouldn’t be able to solve.</span> <span id="s1147">So, thank you very much for interviewing me.</span> <span id="s1148">It was a real gift to me, and a gift to my family who perished.</span> <span id="s1149">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Thank you very much, Estelle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: It was a privilege to -- to do the interview with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Well thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1155">And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp.</span> <span id="s1156">This is tape three, side B. Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: How good that I remembered that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00 PAGE 2 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 PAGE 27</span></p></body></html>
