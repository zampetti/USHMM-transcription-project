Barker.</span> <span id="s3">I reside at 1275 Winburn Drive, East Point, Georgia.</span> <span id="s4">My date of birth is 6/24/13.</span> <span id="s5">At the time I went into the service, I was age 29.</span> <span id="s6">When I left the service, October 5, 1945, my profession at that time was a truck driver.</span> <span id="s7">After leaving the service, I went into the trucking business for a number of years.</span> <span id="s8">I am now retired.</span> <span id="s9">Before retirement, though, I was with the United Family Life Insurance Company for a number of years.</span> <span id="s10">Also, my military unit was the 685th Ordnance Ammunition Company and I performed the duty of a truck driver for them.</span> <span id="s11">I was rated as a corporal or T-5 when I was released from the service.</span> <span id="s12">I was stationed at Ft. Benning and sent to Ft. McPherson, where I enlisted in 1942.</span> <span id="s13">I received my discharge from Ft. McPherson, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And which prisoner camp were you associated with?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: The only thing I was associated with was Dachau prison and that was after it had been liberated, but the prisoners were still held in the camp a couple of days after liberation.</span> <span id="s16">I did see the ones who were able to walk and carry the prisoners that were dead.</span> <span id="s17">I did see them taken and put into a pit with burning material in there.</span> <span id="s18">There were box cars out there with some bodies in them and also the ground was covered with a number of bodies.</span> <span id="s19">It seems the ones that were able to walk and all were nothing but skin and bones due to starvation and mistreatment, I imagine.</span> <span id="s20">It was a terrible sight to lay eyes on and, of course, at that time, you don't really get involved because we did not get involved with the forces that had them under control.</span> <span id="s21">We only went to the fence to look through.</span> <span id="s22">My colonel and I paid a visit there.</span> <span id="s23">We did find one Storm Trooper with his head cut off.</span> <span id="s24">One of the prisoners had been able to get a knife and relieve him of his head.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: How did you first hear about the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My Colonel heard about it and as I had been transferred out of my outfit into the headquarters outfit, the Colonel wanted to go over there and see what was happening and he was the one that told me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What did he say about it?</span> <span id="s28">What was his description?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: He wanted to go and see what had happened.</span> <span id="s30">He might have had orders to go over there because he had another officer with him and myself.</span> <span id="s31">We did view the camp entirely and then we left and went into an area where they had the Polish soldiers lined up on the airfield with new jet MIGs, I believe they were.</span> <span id="s32">But they did not have any fuel to fly them with, so they came out and lined up in formation as we went through to review their troops.</span> <span id="s33">And the irony of it all is, as a corporal, I was saluted and the officers were not.</span> <span id="s34">So, that's my experience at Dachau and I do have several pictures showing some of the scenes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What were your personal feelings when you were going to this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Did you have any idea what you were going to run into?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I think I did have some idea because of the hearsay I had heard from others.</span> <span id="s38">I heard that it was a very bad situation and I knew that they were mistreating the prisoners of other faiths that were in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Do you remember any more sights or smells or sounds that you heard about the camp besides what you have said?</span> <span id="s40">Did it smell bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes, you had an odor there, but you'd been around a lot of soldiers that were dead in the field and things like that so you really didn't pay too much attention to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Could you hear the prisoners crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: No, they were past their crying stage.</span> <span id="s44">They were a beaten race and they knew it; a beaten bunch of people and probably some of them didn't even realize what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did the prisoners say anything to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No.</span> <span id="s47">We didn’t get that close to them because, as I say, we only went to the fence and looked through the barbed wire at the prisoners and the conditions around there.</span> <span id="s48">One of the officers had said that the people across the street didn't know what was going on over there, but I understand they had some lampshades in their house made from human skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Did you decide not to go in there for any particular reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No.</span> <span id="s51">There was another outfit that had charge of it and we didn't interfere with their business there.</span> <span id="s52">I really didn't want to go in there and neither did our officers because of the disease and the filth and the lice that is possible to get on you so we just didn't go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What did you think about these poor prisoners when you saw them?</span> <span id="s54">A: It’s hard to describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you feel compassion for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s57">I think they were human beings in body only.</span> <span id="s58">I don't think their minds even knew what they were, but it was disgrace to see a human being in that condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did you see any more guards other than the one that got his head cut off?</span> <span id="s60">A: No, not the German guards because our men had taken over there then.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">They took their officers prisoners which were living and disposed of them or carried them back to a camp or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you ever hear any stories or see any evidence or anything about the way these guards were treated, other than the one you told me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Not to my recollection, no.</span> <span id="s64">When they started surrendering in 1945, you could see thousands of them coming in and laying down their rifles and giving up.</span> <span id="s65">They were raggedy, bedraggled, hungry, frozen, and everything else just about.</span> <span id="s66">That's the thing that I did see that impressed me, that many soldiers supposed to be the elite troops of Germany could come in in that condition.</span> <span id="s67">When they found out the war was over, they really wanted to come in and give up.</span> <span id="s68">They were all hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you see any German civilians around Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span> <span id="s71">We were stationed in a headquarters outfit in Augsburg, Germany at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: How far was that from...?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I couldn't tell you in mileage or kilometers.</span> <span id="s74">I know we went up and back in one day.</span> <span id="s75">I cannot tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s76">I don't have my maps with me or anything.</span> <span id="s77">They wouldn't show Dachau on a map anyway.</span> <span id="s78">They wouldn't want to let anyone else know about what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: When you were going up, were there civi lians around the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No.</span> <span id="s81">The officers and the men that were in charge of that camp had taken over.</span> <span id="s82">I'm sure they kept all the civilians and everybody else away because this was a serious situation there.</span> <span id="s83">But their Intelligence probably went around to the homes and all and straightened them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: If you had to go through this experience again, would you ask not to go or did it bother you that much?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: After being over there two years, you get kind of used to everything and it didn't bother me too much at the time, but a little later I thought a lot about it and I'm thankful I have the pictures that I have of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you see those bodies in the railroad cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s88">You could see from a distance there.</span> <span id="s89">I didn't go up to them because I didn't want to get involved with the smell or anything else.</span> <span id="s90">You could see a few cars sitting there with some bodies in there.</span> <span id="s91">I know they were bodies because you could see they were dead and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What about the ones that were stacked up?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I did not see any stacked up, maybe three or four high just piled in the box cars.</span> <span id="s94">These out in the area were just laying around.</span> <span id="s95">They were not stacked in any order.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did they have clothes on?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: They had a pajama-like outfit on, white with black, vertical-runni ng stripes.</span> <span id="s98">They were all ragged.</span> <span id="s99">I guess they had taken them off the dead ones and put them on the living ones.</span> <span id="s100">I don't see how they survived as long as they did in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you have any particular strong reaction toward this experience?</span> <span id="s102">Did you feel bitter toward the Germans because of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Knowing some of the German people, I didn't feel the bitterness toward the Germans as a whole.</span> <span id="s104">It was the war.</span> <span id="s105">Naturally, I had a bitterness towards the people that were in the war fighting us.</span> <span id="s106">As far as the German people go, after they found out we were occupying their area, they tried to look out for us in every way possible as far as food or anything else they could get for us.</span> <span id="s107">But, war is just hell, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Do you have any or did you have any anti-Semitic feelings?</span> <span id="s109">A: Bitterness?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Towards them?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Towards Jews, before or afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s114">I knew they were our enemies and I was ready to go to bat for my country.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I mean about the Jews, though.</span> <span id="s116">Did you have any feelings toward the</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s119">Some of my best friends are Jewish people and I had some Jewish boys in the first outfit I was with.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Do you feel like these concentration camps were set up for an anti-Jewish extermination?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, not altogether.</span> <span id="s122">I think they had some Russians in there, Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s123">I didn’t see any of our American prisoners in there and I understand there were not any at Dachau.</span> <span id="s124">I think there were Russians and Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did you talk to anybody about this experience?</span> <span id="s126">A: No.</span> <span id="s127">No more than the officers that were with me.</span> <span id="s128">Q: How did they react?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: They felt about like I did, I think.</span> <span id="s130">It was just another job.</span> <span id="s131">Q: Disgusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Disgusting, sickening thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you think it was important for your wife to know about this?</span> <span id="s134">Your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: I told them a little bit about it, but it's in the past.</span> <span id="s136">They were not there.</span> <span id="s137">Q: If you're not involved, it's not as important?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s139">War is hell.</span> <span id="s140">That's about the answer you'd get from anybody who had not been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Do you think that this should be exposed more to the public?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s143">I think everything should be exposed to the public so we won't have any more of this stuff.</span> <span id="s144">I could go on and on about war.</span> <span id="s145">I lost a nephew in Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s146">Of course, I had a bitterness about that, but I don't have any ill feelings toward the people because they are humans just like we are.</span> <span id="s147">But when there is an organization that's against my country, I'm ready to do something about it.</span> <span id="s148">Even at my age now I would, if possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you have any nightmares or anything about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No more than usual.</span> <span id="s151">I mean, we all have nightmares of this stuff sometimes.</span> <span id="s152">In fact, the other night, my wife said I woke her up hollering "Ellen."</span> <span id="s153">And I'm trying to think of some girl by the name of Ellen.</span> <span id="s154">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you see the TV movie, Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, I don't care about seeing it.</span> <span id="s157">I mean it might be good but I just don't want to get involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: At the time you were at Dachau, would you have considered yourself a religious person?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I had a belief.</span> <span id="s160">I'll put it this way, and that has never changed.</span> <span id="s161">I know there is a Supreme Being.</span> <span id="s162">I did not belong to a church.</span> <span id="s163">I'm of Protestant faith, and I'd never taken the time before I went into the service to really go to church.</span> <span id="s164">In fact, after I got out, it was quite a while before I joined the First Baptist Church in Atlanta in 1948.</span> <span id="s165">But, I did know there was a Supreme Being and he helped me through in a lot of ways in a lot of places.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: When you saw this camp, did you have any thoughts about God or how God could allow this to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, I don't question Him.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you have any thoughts about man's inhumanity to man or how cruel man could be to let people like this starve to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes, you have thoughts about it, but war is war.</span> <span id="s170">There’s been a lot of stories that I cannot verify, but if you've got a prisoner and you don't have time to take him back to camp, what do you do?</span> <span id="s171">Shoot him or he shoots you.</span> <span id="s172">I never did see any of this actually happen, but it has happened I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did this experience have any effect on you in your religion, your attitude toward becoming more religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Some of it, yes.</span> <span id="s175">But, it's just a thing in the past there and I have my own feelings about religion.</span> <span id="s176">I know it starts in your heart first and that's where it's going to be.</span> <span id="s177">It's what you do here now that counts.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: If you had been a prisoner in the same circumstances as these people, do you think you could have kept your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s180">It would have been rough, but I think I would have.</span> <span id="s181">Yes, because that’s all you've got.</span> <span id="s182">I mean they didn't have anything else and I'm sure that some of them kept their faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Can you forgive the Germans, the Nazis, for what they did to these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: The Nazis?</span> <span id="s185">No.</span> <span id="s186">But I can the German people because they were forced to do things, I'm sure, to support the Nazi cause.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Does your religion have any influence on your attitude toward these people now?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: It's the way I was brought up, in a way.</span> <span id="s189">Sure, I would forgive the German people, but not these Nazis.</span> <span id="s190">Why forgive them?</span> <span id="s191">They did their job.</span> <span id="s192">They're all gone or just about, and they are going to pay their dues just like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did this experience have any influence on your attitude toward civil rights or the rights of human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, that experience didn't.</span> <span id="s195">Being a Southern boy and the way I am and the way this country’s going now, I imagine 99% of the people are changing their thinking about things.</span> <span id="s196">But, as far as my religion, I'm going to keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What about the Viet Nam war?</span> <span id="s198">What did you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I think it was a sickening shame that we had to go over there and get involved in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Why should we have gotten involved in Germany and not in Viet Nam?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: They were our allies and all, but they were stomping on them.</span> <span id="s202">To my way of thinking, if it had not been for the Americans, it would have been a different story now from what it was.</span> <span id="s203">If we had left the Germans alone, the Russians wouldn't be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: What about what is going on in the Middle East?</span> <span id="s205">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Yes, the Arabs and the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I think they are holding us up to tell you the truth about it.</span> <span id="s208">They sell us oil then take the money and come back and buy our banks and our property.</span> <span id="s209">So what's the end going to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: What do you think about the executions in Cambodia?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: I'm not familiar with a lot of this stuff.</span> <span id="s212">I stay away from it because the only thing that bears in my mind is my nephew who was lost on a hill there in Viet Nam in 1967.</span> <span id="s213">He was only 19 years old and had three more weeks before coming back home and he got it.</span> <span id="s214">But, I’ll say one thing here and now.</span> <span id="s215">We'll never have another president like Richard Nixon, because he did get those guys back home out of prison where to the others it was just another thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What would be your reaction if your son came to you and said he was going to be a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Of course, I can't control him now, but I would try do everything I could to keep him from turning into one and I don't think he would anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did seeing these prisoners in this camp who were mostly Jews change your attitude to Jews in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No.</span> <span id="s220">As far as my feeling to the Jewish people, I liked them and never had any problems with them.</span> <span id="s221">They were humans just like anybody else, and if I saw them burning, or if I saw you burning, or some of my buddies burning, I would have gone in there.</span> <span id="s222">But, here was a case where it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Nothing you could do about it.</span> <span id="s224">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Do you feel something needs to be done today to keep something like this from ever happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s227">I think there should be lots done today and we should publicize a lot of the things that happened in the past.</span> <span id="s228">Maybe it will wake some people up.</span> <span id="s229">Here we are indifferent now.</span> <span id="s230">Everyone does his own thing and you don't know what he'll do.</span> <span id="s231">He's liable to turn Communist tomorrow or join the Nazis; he's liable to stay and try to be otherwise, but you just don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Grady, I surely do appreciate your helping us with this and I'm sure you'll be hearing from them somewhere along the line.</span> <span id="s233">There's not any way I can thank you enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It's just a pleasure to help you out any way I can and, in the future, if you need me, call on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: All right.</span></p></body></html>
