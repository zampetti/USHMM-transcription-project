id="s297">A: And I have a very nice picture of their house, and it – on the first floor they had a saloon.</span> <span id="s298">On the second they had their apartment, and they had three rooms like m-m – hotel, you know.</span> <span id="s299">So that was their business.</span> <span id="s300">And on one picture it is shown advertisement that doctor, dentist Finkelena(ph), because they came later a little, came, and their – her address.</span> <span id="s301">She – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: It’s on the photo.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah, that is on a photo [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: So that is her – where her dentist office is?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yeah, denti –</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Turgaus aikštė.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Turgaus aikštė, market square.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah, market square.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Market square, yeah.</span> <span id="s311">So, how large was Serei?</span> <span id="s312">Was it a town, was it a village?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: They write like a village very often.</span> <span id="s314">It was, you know, I am now a little surprised, because I have two monuments.</span> <span id="s315">One monument was done very soon after the end of the war, and all the years what we were knowing from Moscow to Vilnius, and then to Serei to this place, once a year definitely, in the summer, there was a monument.</span> <span id="s316">I have this monument and it was written that in this place was killed – were killed 100,900 people; men, women and children.</span> <span id="s317">They say by Nazis and the other collaborators.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Local collaborators.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yeah, local.</span> <span id="s320">And then they changed this monument.</span> <span id="s321">I didn’t see the new one because we already couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s322">And another lady, two ladies went from Vilnius, they are now in Israel, and they sent me the picture.</span> <span id="s323">But I never could read what is written.</span> <span id="s324">And somewhere I found, because I have materials of Chana(ph) Slovatitsky(ph).</span> <span id="s325">She went – she came to America about – she was maybe 11 years old, because she had here a Uncle [indecipherable], Dr. [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s326">And he had to help her, she was – she had such a –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Hunchback, or she wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah, she couldn’t straighten out, and he helped her.</span> <span id="s329">And finally, I tried to see her.</span> <span id="s330">And I was in Chicago, because she lived in Chicago, but I saw in Chicago another Serei woman, a woman from Serei, and she was out of town, and I don’t know why, maybe because she left very young, I was dreaming to see her, because she was my friend, despite the differences –</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Age.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes, I was older.</span> <span id="s333">But she didn’t try, so I didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s334">But she went to Serei later, and I have everything about her visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: And there is a lot of new things, and there I saw what is written now.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What is written now?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Now is written, first of all, not thousand, not 900, but 953, if I remember right.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: And it says that that were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Rather than just –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Jewish rather than the – maybe there was right, the first one, may there were some other people, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I can’t understand, and I even don’t know who to ask why.</span> <span id="s345">Before we were going very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: I can see whether we can find out for you, as far as th-the – the research that’s been done for that part, for Serei and the surrounding regions.</span> <span id="s347">Usually by now there has been some sort of investigation to find out more detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: The real numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: The real numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Maybe something changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I mean, there’s 900 – 953, if I remember right, approximately, but at least two times less.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s354">But my question is, how large was the community before the war, the Jewish community in Serei?</span> <span id="s355">Was it a thousand people, was it several hundred?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, they were writing that it was 1900.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: No, no, no, I’m not talking about those who were murdered, I’m talking about the town before World War II, or the village before World War II, about how large was it?</span> <span id="s358">Was it a big village, was it a small village?</span> <span id="s359">Were there hundreds of people, were there thousands of people who lived in it?</span> <span id="s360">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Th-Th – I – I don’t remember simple I didn’t come, but I have – I have materials where it shows that it was exactly, because everybody was murdered.</span> <span id="s362">Only seven people survived from Serei, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I am in this number in Serei.</span> <span id="s365">My cousin Etta, that is also Etta, who is my father’s brother’s daughter –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: – she was in Vilnius, and she survived.</span> <span id="s368">And then a few more, they were not in Serei, and only one who was this morning, the 22nd of June morning, because Nazis were in Serei in the morning of 22.</span> <span id="s369">And in Alytaus they were about two, three o’clock, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: In the afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: The afternoon, yes.</span></p> <p><span

id="s376">A: I saw him one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So what you’re explaining to me is that you’re not sure about how many people there were – Jews there were in Serei.</span> <span id="s378">There could have been a 1,900 some, or it could have been this 900 figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah, now it changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Yeah, it could be one, it could be the other, but you know that only seven survived – survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Seven survived, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Were there – was the cha – was the town mostly, or the village mostly Jewish, or were there Gentiles living there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: The Gentiles lived mostly in the suburbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: In the surrounding area.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah, and Serei had a long – the name even was long [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Long –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: – street.</span> <span id="s390">It went from the upper, and it went to the very, very end, to the post office, and to the –

id="s394">N-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s395">I was there.</span> <span id="s396">Maybe we will find.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: And then the – the marketplace, and then small, small streets, where it was a synagogue and close.</span> <span id="s399">It is a place if ni – 10 people are there, they can also pray.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Cloise(ph), we say.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: A cloister?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Cloise(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: A cloister.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, in Yiddish it is cloise(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Cloise(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: But the synagogue I remember very well.</span> <span id="s408">My father had a special place over there.</span> <span id="s409">But he was so interested in the – his patient, that sometimes he was going.</span> <span id="s410">He was not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Well that was going to be one of my questions.</span> <span id="s412">Was yours – was your family a particularly religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, it was not a religious family, my father was not religious.</span> <span id="s414">My mother kept traditions, and she light on the candles Shabbat.</span> <span id="s415">But my father even didn’t – no, he didn’t eat matzoh at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: At Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: – at Passover, yeah, because he didn’t believe in a – no.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Was he believe –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: But he decided that he has to go, so he went for new year, and Yom Kippur, he went to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Then what I do now?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Would you say that they were more assimilated into a – a larger society that’s not just Jewish, or would you say –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No, not the Jewish’s because these people were close.</span> <span id="s424">The pharmacists, you know, they were close.</span> <span id="s425">But they had the Jewish friends, sometimes playing cards, and my father liked very much music, and sometimes they were going to Kaunas, to opera.</span> <span id="s426">Kipras Petrauskas was very famous there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And one time they took me, and that was Verta(ph).</span> <span

this, and when I was going home, they knew that I will be in the bus, and where I will be sitting, and somebody was coming a little earlier and putting some materials above my seat.</span> <span id="s527">And I had to give it to a boy in Serei who was a schuster(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Who was a – a shoemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Shoemaker, yes, a young, young man.</span> <span id="s530">And it was very difficult, because if somebody would see that, the doctor’s daughter stops and does something with him, that wa – I at – my parents didn’t know.</span> <span id="s531">They never talked to us politics.</span> <span id="s532">So, I did it, I came home, I put it that nobody sees it, and then I went to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s533">And there were two organizations, Maccabee, I was Maccabee, and HaPoel.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Mm-hm, what is HaPoel?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: HaPoel is also a organization, but for people who are – they were going, talking a lot about Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Mm-hm, so it was more Zionist, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s538">And then I saw him in the hall of this, and I told him that I have to give him something.</span> <span id="s539">And we decided that he will come to our house, and our house had a arc(ph).</span> <span id="s540">He will come to the arc(ph).</span> <span id="s541">I-If nobody is around, I will go down and give him this material.</span> <span id="s542">So that was a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: And I got a commu – [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Certificate?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Certificate.</span> <span id="s547">And

border between Lithuania and Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Union.</span> <span id="s551">This helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: It helped for all our 15 people on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So I will – we’ll come to this point, but right now I’m still trying to get a sense, before the war, of what kind of community you were ab – in, what were your relations to your parents, what – what are your memories of the place.</span> <span id="s554">This is what I’m trying to learn more about at this stage.</span> <span id="s555">And we will come to these other events you’re talking to.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s557">The relations to my parents were very good.</span> <span id="s558">My father was such a – he was sensitive.</span> <span id="s559">As an example I can tell you I was in Kaunas and they cut out my – you know, very often, children have to have an operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Tonsils.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s562">And my voice changed.</span> <span id="s563">And when I came home, he put me – an-and I started crying because my voice was different, you know.</span> <span id="s564">More than my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s566">So he hugged you and he tried to comfort you.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yeah to comfort me.</span> <span id="s568">And a second time I had paratif(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: I don’t know what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Paratif(ph), that is [indecipherable], you don’t know the –</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: It’s a bad, bad sickness, and I came home and he was sending tests to Kaunas, because not everything he could do.</span> <span id="s573">So when he was waiting for the answer, he was staying at the, you know, warm –</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Mm-hm, at the – at the oven, at the sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Oven, and I was in bed, very close.</span> <span id="s576">I lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s577">And he was s – so that was he was crying.</span> <span id="s578">And then we found out that everything fine, but I lost a lot of – and I have to – had to learn to walk after this sickness, because I lost a lot of weight, and I was

<p><span id="s685">A: Return Vilnius.</span> <span id="s686">And this was so for me also.</span> <span id="s687">I wanted so much to get Vilnius that the day when it was by [indecipherable], I was in a very high spirit.</span> <span id="s688">But when I came to the gymnasium, I saw that we were six girls, Jewish girls, that they are sitting – I saw something is going on.</span> <span id="s689">And it turned out that some of the Lithuanian girls, especially one was there, were saying that you are – you don’t have your own – no, you – you don’t have your own country, and you are l-like cosmopolitan, you know, and you – you are not happy like we are happy.</span> <span id="s690">Despite what to say about myself, for me it was a very nice day, but when I came and I saw it, everything turned out different.</span> <span id="s691">And it ended that this woman put – she went on the table, and she said again that you are – you are – you don’t have your own, you are not patriotic, you are not happy, and you have to be killed.</span> <span id="s692">You and you and you and you, and she showed all six.</span> <span id="s693">That was the first day – yeah, I tell you this because it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: That was the first day, and what is interesting, I forgot, when I was in the group, I had to do something in the

[indecipherable] and [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: And we tried – and I had a friend, Halla(ph), we both worked on it.</span> <span id="s701">We talked to them, and everything looked fine and they wanted – but when it came to a – t-to go to a –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: A meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: – meeting at night, they came and they say, we will always be – we will never in our life tell anybody.</span> <span id="s704">We will always be with these –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: – ideas.</span> <span id="s707">But, we cannot.</span> <span id="s708">So, we understood that they are not ready, and they were – they didn’t participate in this all, and many girls didn’t participate, because there was among them a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s709">And a – a small part – but when – when our teacher Magnitskas(ph) found out about it, he was very, very angry, and he talked about.</span> <span id="s710">He explained what – that it’s un – impossible to say such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Impossible to say what kind of things?</span> <span id="s712">I’m confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: It seems that you have to be killed, you, you and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: – to this lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: And that was the first day –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Well, I can imagine –</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: –

to go back though, because we’ve – in some ways I’m not understanding at what point things took place; that is, within the larger context.</span> <span id="s726">When you – when you were growing up in Serei, in general, it seemed to be a normal situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: By the time you were in gymnasium, though, in – in Alytaus, was Lithuania still an independent country, or was it already not?</span> <span id="s729">Was th – had there already been a Soviet occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Soviet occupation was one

want to ask is, do you have a memor –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: That was the time close to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: And we even had such, you know, we – we thought that maybe some of our guys were maybe connected a little bit, maybe they knew something.</span> <span id="s746">Because the 21st June, we came to the gymnasium to get

id="s1238">But there was a group, and I was participating in the group that was for Russians that didn’t finish the 10 years –</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span

was all done, she said, oh, you two – two sisters of Russian girls, who finished nine classes of the 10 year course, they made more mistakes than Frida Finkelita(ph).</span> <span id="s1246">I was Finkelita(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: You were Finkelita(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Even in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: In

question that may sound very, very naïve, but it’s coming from what I’m trying to gather from your story.</span> <span id="s1253">The war will happen.</span> <span id="s1254">Your parents are frightened for you because you belong to the Komsomol and you could be shot in the first days, clearly.</span> <span id="s1255">But did they fear something for themselves?</span> <span id="s1256">Did they fear that there would be some – do you think that they were afraid that something would happen to them?</span> <span id="s1257">They certainly may not have liked the Nazis, but did they think there was some danger for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I am sure they thinked it was danger.</span> <span id="s1259">She knew what was going on another, it was not the first – they knew what is going on in Poland, they knew what is going on in the other places, but at the same time, unfortunately, I was not in touch, I couldn’t find out anything.</span> <span id="s1260">But I dot – didn’t believe, so maybe they had hope.</span> <span id="s1261">But very soon, you know, when they were already put to death, September ’41, 10 and 11.</span> <span id="s1262">The 10th were the men, and the 11th, women and children.</span> <span id="s1263">September.</span> <span id="s1264">So it was only 22nd June, July, August, September, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Yeah, and they were all put in a school, but it is not a school, it is a school to become – to have a specialty.</span> <span id="s1267">And in this school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: A vocational school, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: You know, you could become a – work in a amatų mokykla.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Yeah, so oh amatų maku(ph) – amatų maku(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Oh my God, I’m forgetting that I can say Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: – fa – Lithuanian, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1273">Amatų, it’s vocational school, vocational school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: My – yeah, my father was there the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: He was taking care of the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: And then it became the place where they were holding them for a few days, and after this, they marched – and the amatų mokykla was in the – at the end of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: – town.</span> <span id="s1281">So they had to march along all the town and about two, three miles more to the forest.</span> <span id="s1282">And here, I have said how my father was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: They were killed over there, but how he looked when he marched with this column, he was in a bloody, scared and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: I wanted to ask, when you were in Saratov, and then you were in Nowosibirsk, clearly you must have been thinking of what’s going back on – back in – home in Serei.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Were you trying to get in touch with your parents, with your family, or was there no way –</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: No way, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Absolutely no way.</span> <span id="s1291">The only one thing, I believed that the humans cannot do such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Well, were you hearing already things about what was going on there, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: No, I didn’t hear anything about Serei, especially because Serei is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: – small place.</span> <span id="s1296">But I was hearing that they are killing.</span> <span id="s1297">Killing and there were camps, and there were the – you know, I have a friend who was in Vilnius ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1299">But this is – I’m still trying to get a sense of what you knew at the time.</span> <span id="s1300">Not what one could find out later, but what, for example, did the radio say?</span> <span id="s1301">What did the newspapers write?</span> <span id="s1302">Did you ha – was there any news of what was going on then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I – I was reading, but I – I am saying again I couldn’t believe, but it became a very difficult time for me, you know what?</span> <span id="s1304">I was going, for example, the time when it is already close, to find out when it goes to the end.</span> <span id="s1305">I was going – let’s say my – my aunt, I lived with my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Mm-hm, in Nowosibirsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Oh, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: – that time I already came to Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: I’m confused.</span> <span id="s1311">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yeah, in Nowosibirsk I got of work at the komatata(ph).</span> <span id="s1313">You know what is komotata(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: No?</span> <span id="s1316">Komotata(ph), that is I have to – at night I was going – we were in the basement, and are living there about seven, eight students.</span> <span id="s1317">And the place was divided with – with white [speaks Lithuanian] divided with material things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Was like a white curtain, or a white –</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Curtain –</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: – curtain, whatever they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Some sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: – some sort of divider</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: So, we were three people here, and four people there, and four more.</span> <span id="s1326">And among the four was one mother, because there was a lady with a mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: And we were very hungry, hungry.</span> <span id="s1329">We didn’t have to eat enough, and we decided that there was the professor, they had a garden.</span> <span id="s1330">And we decided that if we take one kopūstai, kopūstai –</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Oh, cabbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Cabbage, one cabbage one night, even not every day, nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s1333">So we were taking this and having the cabbage.</span> <span id="s1334">And then we were trying to get a little bit of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1335">E-Everywhere was potatoes owners, and we decided that one, only one time to take from each house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Mm-hm, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1338">So we were theft.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: You were thieves, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Thieves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: But you were – but you were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: We were hungry.</span> <span id="s1343">And then in the morning, we were sending one of us, we didn’t have wood, we were cold over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Many times I had here you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Blue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Mm-hm, on your cheeks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: We were sending somebody to the – we had a special place to eat, because we had a cart.</span> <span id="s1350">But it was – the soup was water, so we were sending one, giving all the clothes, warm clothes, and we were bringing a big buck –</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Bucket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: – bucket with soup, and because it is big, so in the – it was a little bit.</span> <span id="s1353">And then we were eating this, and taking the – from the professor’s a little bit, and by some way, we survived.</span> <span id="s1354">And then there was in – in Nowosibirsk, a – lithua – Lithuania had a person who was taking care of Lithuanian evacuees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: But that was Nowosibirsk.</span> <span id="s1357">I got in touch with him and he made me like his secretary, but only I was far away.</span> <span id="s1358">And I had to talk to other people, and he gave me, not shoes, but you know, for winter –</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Boots?</span> <span id="s1360">Some sort of boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Some sort of boot, but they are from material, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: I know what you mean, they were this felt kind of – how is it said in Russian, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: [indecipherable] so far away I-I don’t remember how [indecipherable] says.</span> <span id="s1364">But it’s not

much, it’s helped me very much.</span> <span id="s1368">And I was in touch with others evacuees, asking what they need.</span> <span id="s1369">I worked a little bit.</span> <span id="s1370">But it’s a pity I forgot his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: It happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Because then when I came back to Moscow and he was in Moscow, was the Lithuanian

saw him a few times.</span> <span id="s1376">He made a lot good things for me.</span> <span id="s1377">[indecipherable] I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s1378">So – and then it came a time when the institute started to think about coming back to Moscow.</span> <span id="s1379">And I went with the institute back to Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: And then you met your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: And then I met my aunt, and I lived with my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: And she had no news of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: No, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: And I’m going back and repeating my question.</span> <span id="s1385">You were saying you did not believe what was written in the newspapers, so that means something was written in the newspapers during the war about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yeah, and by radio all the time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: And by

mind game with yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: If you catch the tram, it means your parents are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A:

Father and Mother and Etta to live with them, but it was not a long time, very soon they were taken.</span> <span id="s1583">So I have the house where they lived a tre – few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Ah, so they were – so, in other words there was no ghetto really in – in Serei?</span> <span id="s1585">People – the place was bombed, and your parents had no place to live, so

and it was only – it was on the 10th and 11th September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Did you remember what you were doing on the 10th or 11th of September?</span> <span id="s1592">Did you go back in your mind and try and figure out where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: No, oh, I – I – I know that very often, what Hanna(ph) Slovatitsky(ph) writes in her – that she cannot remember what she did this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: I cannot say that I – I – I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: What did they – what were some of the things that they told you about your parents during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: The wife of Salvoukas(ph) said she tried, because they couldn’t go out, and they couldn’t buy something, so she tried to – by some way, she was telling us, she was buying eggs and bringing them to this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: – place, and trying to help with – but it was also dangerous, but she did.</span> <span id="s1600">She told me this and she cried, because she couldn’t imagine – a lot of good people, you know, a lot of good people.</span> <span id="s1601">And when I read now about the woman who says she will never forget how she saw my father in the beginning of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Column.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: – column, yes, in – with – with blood, and she could see that he was beaten.</span> <span id="s1604">She says it.</span> <span id="s1605">And I got this paper.</span> <span id="s1606">Unfortunately, it’s in Russian written, but this piece I translated.</span> <span id="s1607">So, I can give it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: When you got it, did you – did someone recognize it and send you that article, knowing it was about your father, or did you open the paper one day and there you read it yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: No, no, my [indecipherable] my uncle’s daughter, she read it, because we didn’t pay a lot of attention to Russian papers, because we had to – we worked, and we had to read English, to know better English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: You’re talking about now here, you’re in the United States, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah, in the United States.</span> <span id="s1612">And she sent me this paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: And so this is th – she sent you this paper –</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: And she called my husband, and she read it to him, and he says, the first time he says, don’t tell it to Frida.</span> <span id="s1615">But she was very surprised, that what I had to know.</span> <span id="s1616">And she called me, and I found out, and I was very upset that Arkady told her let – let – let not tell Frida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1618">Well, he probably wanted to protect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Mm, he wanted to protect –</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: To protect, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: – yeah, but it’s not the case.</span> <span id="s1622">I have to know.</span> <span id="s1623">I am watching everything, all Holocaust movies.</span> <span id="s1624">I am always watching them, and I – because I have to – at least I have to feel a little.</span> <span id="s1625">I have very often, as older I become, as more I have the feeling of guiltiness that I was not with them, and I didn’t have to go through this all.</span> <span id="s1626">It’s very difficult to imagine my sister, my father, my mother, how they were – how it was all – and I was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: But I am sure that for your father and for your mother and your sister, it was easier for them, knowing that you were not there, and that maybe you survived.</span> <span id="s1628">That – that for them it would have been harder to see both of their children in that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1630">It would be good to be a very believing, and believe that we will see someday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Are you a believer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Are you a believer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: I don’t know, after what is going on all these years.</span> <span id="s1635">After the Holocaust and it is still so bad everywhere, with the hating of Jews, I don’t know why, because I know where – I know bad people.</span> <span id="s1636">For me the nice thing is a p – a person has to be good from bad.</span> <span id="s1637">And now in Europe and everywhere.</span> <span id="s1638">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: That I – at that point you mentioned – you mentioned your – Salvoukas’s(ph) wife, and that she was a good person and that she cared.</span> <span id="s1640">But I want to bring up the other person you told me about earlier, who was the organist’s son, who you said participated.</span> <span id="s1641">What did you find out about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: He – oh, I – I don’t know if he was – I – I will ask, maybe Mira(ph) knows.</span> <span id="s1643">But at least he couldn’t come back and he had to – to pay for this.</span> <span id="s1644">But how it came out, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: So, but what did he do?</span> <span id="s1646">What do you know that he – what were you told that he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: What he did, he helped to kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1649">Were there others in the town –</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: They di – yeah, there were, who helped to kill.</span> <span id="s1651">They came to Salvoukas(ph).</span> <span id="s1652">They asked everybody, but Salvoukas(ph) refused.</span> <span id="s1653">And he said, the only – but he was also afraid, you know, the only thing what I can give you is my – no, the pferd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Oh, the horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: The horse, right, pferd, pferd is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Pferd is the German word for horse, and so probably also the Yiddish word for horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Yeah, a pferd.</span> <span id="s1658">The horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: And so, did you find out whether they were – in Serei, was it Germans who shot, or was it Lithuanians who shot?</span> <span id="s1660">Do you know who it was, did anybody tell you?</span> <span id="s1661">In Lithuan – in Serei.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: – when everybody was shot, did anybody tell you who did the killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Who did the killing, they – everywhere they write collaborators, Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s1665">But I didn’t know who, exactly.</span> <span id="s1666">What I remember is the son what I told you, and others I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1667">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: What – you know, who live there, it was very difficult to come to this place, and nobody came back to live, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: And there the cemetery –</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: How often were you there, to Serei?</span> <span id="s1673">You said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Once a year, in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: From that first time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: – from that first time it was once a year until you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Every year until I left, then in ’88, we went to Moscow and from Moscow we went to Vilnius, and from Vilnius we went to Serei.</span> <span id="s1679">And since then I haven’t been there, because – I wanted very much, very much, but unfortunately, my medical –</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Situation doesn’t – I cannot now go.</span> <span id="s1682">That’s a pity, but – you know, I would like very much to show you, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: That’s – let’s see some of those things that you wanted to show me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Yeah, funny – funny things, this is another, absolutely nothing to do with it, but I would like to show you how we were – with that I – I liked to
