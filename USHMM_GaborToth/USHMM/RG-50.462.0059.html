where you were born, and when, and a little about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">BF: I was born in Zutphen, Holland, a small place.</span> <span id="s4">There were only about 20,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s5">And there was a Jewish kehillah from about 600 people, 150 families.</span> <span id="s6">It was a very active kehillah, and I got a rich, real Jewish education.</span> <span id="s7">And see, the whole life was around the synagogue and around the Jewish festivals.</span> <span id="s8">My parents had a butcher shop, and all kinds of business related to sheep, the wool of the sheep, and they made what do you call it for the violins, this, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s9">SB: The bows?</span> <span id="s10">The strings?</span> <span id="s11">Strings.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">BF: The bows, the strings from the bows.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SB: For the violins.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">BF: They were made from sheep, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">SB: Guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">BF: Guts.</span> <span id="s17">They had also a business in this.</span> <span id="s18">And we were only a small family, two children.</span> <span id="s19">When I was small my grandmother lived with us, a very, have, remember her very good.</span> <span id="s20">She was always with me together.</span> <span id="s21">My mother was always in the business and I was with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s22">And it was a nice, a nice, nothing, everything was all right.</span> <span id="s23">Nothing was, missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">SB: And what was your life like before the German invasion.</span> <span id="s25">Do you remember the exact time of the German invasion; then how your life changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">BF: Oh yes, it was the 10th of May, 1940.</span> <span id="s27">I was yet at school, at high school.</span> <span id="s28">My brother finished already high school.</span> <span id="s29">And I think he had already the call-up for the army, for the Dutch army.</span> <span id="s30">In '39 he was 19 years, 18?</span> <span id="s31">And that, he, he did not, did not get in the army before, the, the Germans came in before.</span> <span id="s32">So our place, our little town, little city, was before the, the rivers.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">BF: In Holland they, this part of Holland, behind the rivers they did not defend.</span> <span id="s35">So the Germans already at four o’clock in the morning we heard the Germans coming in with motorcycles and they went straight to the places where the, the real strategic places, to the bridge, where the, they, they managed to blow up the bridge.</span> <span id="s36">The Dutch blew up the bridge, and they got behind the bridge.</span> <span id="s37">So there was no bridge, just, this, our, our town was the first front line.</span> <span id="s38">So it was really fighting.</span> <span id="s39">It was very frightening.</span> <span id="s40">We were, we all got down in the lower floor.</span> <span id="s41">We lay on the floors.</span> <span id="s42">It only took one day until it was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">SB: Tell me, how was your relationship with the non-Jews in the town, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">BF: Oh, it was very good.</span> <span id="s45">I really, I grew up between non-Jews.</span> <span id="s46">It was, there, there were, I, we went to school in a non-Jewish school, and so in, mostly the Jewish children went to spe-, to the special school where, it was a good school, and Jews got the children in, in this school.</span> <span id="s47">So in our, in my class, I think we were six or seven Jewish children.</span> <span id="s48">It was very special.</span> <span id="s49">I have really some photographs from the whole classroom.</span> <span id="s50">And the Jewish children are in the middle together [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s51">SB: All together.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">BF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">SB: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s54">How did the Dutch people react to the invasion by the Germans, and how did they react in relation to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">BF: In the beginning, the Germans did nothing to the Jews.</span> <span id="s56">They did as if they, nothing would happen to the Dutch people and they, they made themselves nice people, nothing would happen.</span> <span id="s57">So we were, of course we were very afraid and before the Germans came, we had all the, the, the emigrants, people who fled from Germany, the Jewish people, and because we were a town near the border.</span> <span id="s58">So I remember very good from when I was a small child from '35, '36, German, the Jews came over the border, and my parents helped them, my mother helped them a lot always.</span> <span id="s59">But also the Dutch did not let the German Jews stay in Holland.</span> <span id="s60">They had to go, to go on, and it was very difficult to get a permit to stay in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">BF: I remember a family, they were in our town...</span></p> <p><span id="s63">SB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">BF: And they had already a flat, and they worked, but they couldn't get a permit.</span> <span id="s65">And my father was, he was born in the same city and his parents and his parents, and he knew everybody.</span> <span id="s66">So he went everywhere to get a permit for them.</span> <span id="s67">He didn't get it.</span> <span id="s68">And one day they had to go, they were ordered across the border...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SB: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">BF: To go out!</span> <span id="s71">No, this doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s72">Go out of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">BF: So the only thing my father did manage to get for them, that they will bring them to the, the police, that they will bring it to the Belgian border, not to the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">BF: But that's the only thing he could do for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">SB: I see, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s78">BF: And he went with them until they were over the Ger-, over the Belgian border that the Germans wouldn't get them.</span> <span id="s79">It was only '38 or '39.</span> <span id="s80">This is one of the things I remember very good.</span> <span id="s81">People got, they had to go out.</span> <span id="s82">They came to our house with their suitcases, and they were very sad.</span> <span id="s83">And they didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s84">And I still remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">SB: Well, were the...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">BF: It was the Dutch authorities that did not allow them to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SB: And do you, have you any idea how many German Jews were, had come into your town and had to leave...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">BF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">SB: You don't have any idea about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">BF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">SB: And, tell me, was your family affected at all by the anti-Jewish laws of '38, '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">BF: Of course, they, I, I was at school.</span> <span id="s93">At '40, I was at school yet.</span> <span id="s94">I was in the fifth grade or the sixth grade, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s95">So, then, then, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s96">You could stay at school.</span> <span id="s97">But they started from, eh, I don't know exactly all the days they started.</span> <span id="s98">One day we could not go.</span> <span id="s99">We even had to close the business.</span> <span id="s100">And then you have to clo-, you could not go outside.</span> <span id="s101">And then you would have to report, to give your bicycles.</span> <span id="s102">And then you have to give your gold.</span> <span id="s103">And then, they did it step by step.</span> <span id="s104">[Dates are questionable, probably meant High School.]</span> <span id="s105">That's something, I don't know it by heart how they did it.</span> <span id="s106">I managed '4-, until '48, [probably ‘39] in December '48 [?]</span> <span id="s107">I had my matriculation.</span> <span id="s108">I could do it, was the last one, last time, and then, but, but then all schools were closed for Jews.</span> <span id="s109">So the children who were at schools who had to, they made a small Jewish school in this town, and all the children went to that Jewish school.</span> <span id="s110">But I finished already.</span> <span id="s111">But I could not, could not continue my studies.</span> <span id="s112">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s113">But you could not, could do nothing.</span> <span id="s114">And then also housemaids were not allowed [any]more to work with Jews.</span> <span id="s115">So, all the Jew, the young girls, I myself too, we went to work with families, to do something, to earn something, or to do something.</span> <span id="s116">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">SB: And, were the Jewish businesses affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">BF: Yes, they closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SB: They closed all the Jewish businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">BF: They closed the Jewish business.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">SB: And then, when did they begin to round up the Jews in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">BF: The worst thing was that they, one day that came ordination, an order, you should, all the Jews must re-gist [register] themselves as Jews.</span> <span id="s123">How many Jewish grandparents they have.</span> <span id="s124">So, and this was our death, death, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s125">SB: Sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">BF: Sentence.</span> <span id="s127">And we didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s128">You know, I'm, certainly I'm Jew.</span> <span id="s129">Oh, I'm proud about it.</span> <span id="s130">That so, we, registered ourselves as Jews.</span> <span id="s131">And from this registration they took all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">SB: So when did they begin to round up and take the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">BF: I think it was '41.</span> <span id="s134">It was June, '41 we registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">BF: And they started to round up the first Razzias [raids] in Amsterdam were I think in February, this Febr-, the, when there was the big strike in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s137">I think it was January, '41...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">BF: Was the first time they made Razzia in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s140">They took boys from the street.</span> <span id="s141">And then, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">SB: They took the, all, any Dutch, or just the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">BF: Jews!</span> <span id="s144">Jews.</span> <span id="s145">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SB: They took the Jewish boys...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">BF: The Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">SB: Boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">BF: The Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">SB: Just off the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">BF: Then they concentrated also the Jews from certain, you could not go, you had to, you have to be a permit to travel.</span> <span id="s152">You could not travel if you wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">BF: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SB: And what did they do with these boys whom they rounded up?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">BF: These boys whom they rounded up, they went straight to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s157">They killed them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">SB: Killed them all?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">BF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">SB: And then what happened further to...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">BF: They killed them all, and they sent back the letters that they were killed, and the people could get their ashes.</span> <span id="s162">That they did by purpose, to make panic...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">SB: Terror</span></p> <p><span id="s164">BF: To make panic terror, yes.</span> <span id="s165">And then they [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">SB: This is the first time I've heard about this.</span> <span id="s167">Please talk about that again.</span> <span id="s168">You got a letter?</span> <span id="s169">I mean, all the...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">BF: We did not get it...</span></p> <p><span id="s171">SB: Jew, I mean the Jews, the, the parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">BF: The parents...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">SB: Of the Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">BF: Whose Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">SB: Who, the Jewish boys...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">BF: My, my, yes, there was

Ausch-, to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s246">And from Mauthausen we got this letter that he was killed on a, when he tried to fled away, to flee.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">SB: And you got a letter from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">BF: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">SB: That he tried to flee?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">BF: Yes, “Auf der Flucht erschossen” [shot while

I mean, you can read in Lochamei Haghetaot [The Ghetto Fighters House] what happened in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s256">Yes.</span> <span id="s257">Then what happened to you and the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">BF: So, we stayed, my mother and my brother and I. And my brother was in, in this time he was a Palestine pioneer, pioneer.</span> <span id="s259">He went to the, to the, to a farmer to learn the trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">SB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">BF: He wanted to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">BF: But he could not study.</span> <span id="s264">Also, he could not study anymore, so, he was Zionist and he was, work with a farmer.</span> <span id="s265">Then they started to round up the Jew, the young, the younger boys.</span> <span id="s266">They always thought that only the younger, the young boys, the young men they will, they didn't, nobody thought they will take the whole families.</span> <span id="s267">They will take the young, the men, and the younger boys to a working camp, to work, and, they started to round them up.</span> <span id="s268">And then, mostly, in the night–he didn't sleep at home any more–so the younger men they stayed out of, out of the house.</span> <span id="s269">So a few times he managed, they did not, get him.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother and I stayed at home.</span> <span id="s271">And then, then, a few, a time he, he was in hiding and then it was just very difficult for him there.</span> <span id="s272">I, I, after the war, I spoke to people he was with them.</span> <span id="s273">They, he could not sit in the house the whole day.</span> <span id="s274">He, it was impossible for him.</span> <span id="s275">He could not do it.</span> <span id="s276">He had to stay in the house in a small room.</span> <span id="s277">He could not do it.</span> <span id="s278">So then he came back and I want, we were looking for a place to hide, all of us.</span> <span id="s279">But we did not find.</span> <span id="s280">And in the meantime they came to our house.</span> <span id="s281">Already before most of the, a lot of families were already taken, but we stayed because my father was not, was not at home.</span> <span id="s282">They took always the families from the man, they took to work camps.</span> <span id="s283">But my father was not at home, so they did not take us.</span> <span id="s284">So, but then, at last they took all the, all the families, so they came also to our home.</span> <span id="s285">There came two Dutch police officers, no Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">SB: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">BF: And they, I knew the people.</span> <span id="s288">I grew up with them.</span> <span id="s289">They, they were friends of my father, and they came to our house and my mother fainted.</span> <span id="s290">We were at home.</span> <span id="s291">My mother fainted.</span> <span id="s292">On the floor.</span> <span id="s293">And it was, it was theater.</span> <span id="s294">She did by purpose.</span> <span id="s295">I didn't, I..</span> <span id="s296">.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">SB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">BF: Until today I didn't, don't understand how they did it.</span> <span id="s299">And they said to my aunt, "Can’t take her.</span> <span id="s300">She is ill.</span> <span id="s301">[unclear] nothing [unclear].</span> <span id="s302">We will take her to, we will make a small Jewish hospital near the synagogue.</span> <span id="s303">There is a big house from the Jews, kehillah, and all the sick people will stay there.</span> <span id="s304">And you must go with us."</span> <span id="s305">You know, my brother and I must go.</span> <span id="s306">And then I said, "But if there is a hospital," I says, "I am a nurse there.</span> <span id="s307">They need people to work there.</span> <span id="s308">How can there be left sick people without nursing?</span> <span id="s309">Without younger peo-?"</span> <span id="s310">He said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s311">You are not on the list."</span> <span id="s312">Maybe, so, I am not on the list.</span> <span id="s313">"I am on the list," I told him.</span> <span id="s314">I did not know anything about it.</span> <span id="s315">And so one of, of the officers stayed with us, and the other one went to the, to the office.</span> <span id="s316">And after a time he came back, "Yeah, you are on the list."</span> <span id="s317">I, until today I don't know who put me on it, if it was true or not, I don't

industry, and there was a leather industry.</span> <span id="s546">And a Philips started also.</span> <span id="s547">And, I believed the Philips.</span> <span id="s548">Everybody said, "No, you shouldn't go to work for Philips.</span> <span id="s549">Then they will take you to Germany."</span> <span id="s550">I don't know why I believed in Philips.</span> <span id="s551">So, I got myself, I was free, and you had to do an examination.</span> <span id="s552">If you had your fingers, you were in good working, and if you had good eyes.</span> <span id="s553">And I passed the examination.</span> <span id="s554">I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s555">And always I said when there was some transport, always this Philips Kommando stayed apart.</span> <span id="s556">So, I'm, I'm believed in Philips.</span> <span id="s557">So I, I, but this was already after my mother went away.</span> <span id="s558">My mother was sent away with the last of the big children transport.</span> <span id="s559">There was a big children, they took all the children and then my mother was on the, she was not so old, but she was not young either, and she had to go too.</span>

dark mantle, a dark coat.</span> <span id="s570">I say, "I go with you!</span> <span id="s571">I go with you!"</span> <span id="s572">And she put me and she throw me back, "You stay here.</span> <span id="s573">You will, don't go.</span> <span id="s574">Where I go there will be God also."</span> <span id="s575">That was her word.</span> <span id="s576">That was her word.</span> <span id="s577">[weepy voice]</span></p> <p><span id="s578">SB: So you never saw her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">BF: No, this was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">SB: And then you went to

Philips.</span> <span id="s583">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">BF: At Philips then, gradually all the people who didn't work for Philips, all these other Kommandos, they were liquidated.</span> <span id="s585">They were sent to the East to go to, to, to, it was one big transport.</span> <span id="s586">It was always moving.</span> <span id="s587">They were always transport.</span> <span id="s588">You never knew what would happen.</span> <span id="s589">You never, you was not, never sure if you got up in the morning where you will be in the evening or where you will, you never know.</span> <span id="s590">That's one of the things the most, and you can't tell that, that it's only, I always tell if you, if you tell what the Germans did, these are not the big things, the big things, but every day, the every minute, the everyday things, they, they did with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">SB: They did the psychological things...</span></p> <p><span id="s592">BF: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">SB: To make you suffer and to make you always in fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">BF: And I want, if some people say there's another Germany and they should speak with Germans and somebody, Germans connect.</span> <span id="s595">I can't give them a hand.</span> <span id="s596">I never give anything to German.</span> <span id="s597">They say, "Come give him hand."</span> <span id="s598">And I have to think that one minute of, of what they did, and then it's enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">SB: That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">BF: I can't think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">SB: I agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">BF: So they...</span></p> <p><span id="s603">SB: So then you worked at Philips...</span></p> <p><span id="s604">BF: So the, the last, at least, at last only the Philips group stayed.</span> <span id="s605">This was about 400 me-, women, and 100 men.</span> <span id="s606">So we lived in the compound of the women.</span> <span id="s607">They lived, and then there were also already in this women compound non-Jewish women were there also–They were illegal workers and communists and all these things.</span> <span id="s608">And, though, we had a, we, we slept in it...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">SB: There were Jewish women separated from the

care that there was no German in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s617">There was all the, this was a kind of, we had a kind of system for warning system in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">BF: You, always [unclear] people stood on the outlook [lookout], and when there came a German, you had to, they said, "Deutsche."</span> <span id="s620">So you know that you have to take care, or, that kind of, other words when you, you did all kinds of things...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s622">So then–You said that they brought in others...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">BF: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s624">SB: In Philips there were non-Jewish workers.</span> <span id="s625">And how long...</span></p> <p><span id="s626">BF: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s627">SB: Did this continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">BF: And, so you worked at Philips you had contact with non-Jews,

<p><span id="s648">BF: So they came to all the camps.</span> <span id="s649">The same story as they did in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s650">And once they came with this Himmler beast, came to visit us.</span> <span id="s651">And then he asked that, he saw that we worked with this, with a special, eh, that's what your husband does...</span></p> <p><span id="s652">SB: Welding?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">BF: Welding, but, these small things.</span> <span id="s654">This is a very special work.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">BF: And they said that they, they, the, the chil-, the girls, you must take care of them that their, their hands will not suffer.</span> <span id="s657">They should not, nothing, not do other work.</span> <span id="s658">And they should li-, lie in the sun when, when it's sun day.</span> <span id="s659">And they should be healthy, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SB: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s661">So you worked there until...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">BF: So that, we worked until, June '44.</span> <span id="s663">But in the meantime, there was, again, the Wehrmacht wanted to have us for their Kriegseinsatz [war workers].</span> <span id="s664">They wanted us to work, Krieg [war] work.</span> <span id="s665">There was always a certain amount of clash between the S.S. and the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s666">The S.S. wanted to, Eichmann wanted to, Hitler [unclear] to, to send us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s667">And the, other Germans they were part of the, of the German, administration or what you call it.</span> <span id="s668">They wanted to, to use this, the work-power of the Jews, and to keep us there.</span> <span id="s669">So, in the meantime, once, they sent us twice away to, to send us away to, to Westerbork or to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s670">And twice the Philips people got us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">SB: Hmm!</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s684">BF: And the third time...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">SB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">BF: They tell always, the second time, there was this Kommandant...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">SB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">BF: The, somebody from the Philips direction got a permit from Berlin to keep us there.</span> <span id="s689">But the Kommandant had to sign it.</span> <span id="s690">But they did not find him.</span> <span id="s691">So they found him in some brothel in the town.</span> <span id="s692">They, but they got him out.</span> <span id="s693">He got a shikel [unclear] and he signed, there they took us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">BF: That's why the, why, they could not find him.</span> <span id="s696">That's why the men were already sent to Westerbork and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s698">So you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">BF: We came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">SB: So you came back.</span> <span id="s701">And you continued working until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">BF: Until the third time, this was in June '44...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">SB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">BF: Then they did in mi-, in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">SB: They...</span></p> <p><span id="s706">BF: And the people, Philips didn't know.</span> <span id="s707">They did not know.</span> <span id="s708">They, they, they managed to send us away.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">SB: And you went, where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">BF: And then we, we didn't go to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s711">Westerbork was the, was the big camp near Holland for many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s713">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">BF: They sent us right away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s715">And I, I saw it, and, I, I stood in, in, in the, in, the freight cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">SB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">BF: And I knew the geography of Holland.</span> <span id="s718">So I knew that they went through my hometown.</span> <span id="s719">And we stood there a few hours on the, on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s720">SB: On the platform.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">BF: On the platform.</span> <span id="s722">And I threw out a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">SB: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">BF: They found it, yes.</span> <span id="s725">They gave it to my, to my neighbors.</span> <span id="s726">They found it.</span> <span id="s727">They [unclear] it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">BF: And then I said, "Now, if you go this, this track, we go straight to Germany.</span> <span id="s730">If we go that track, we go to Westerbork."</span> <span id="s731">And we got this track to Germany.</span> <span id="s732">I said, "We go to Germany."</span> <span id="s733">And the people, "No!</span> <span id="s734">No!</span> <span id="s735">We're going to Westerbork."</span> <span id="s736">And we got straight to Germany.</span> <span id="s737">I said, "I know the track."</span> <span id="s738">I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s739">SB: But you already knew about Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s740">You had heard...</span></p> <p><span id="s741">BF: Then, this time, we knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s742">In the meantime we had contact with the non-Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s743">And there were a lot of people who had, had been in Germany and the non-Jewish prisoners they sent back and forth from one concentration camp to another.</span> <span id="s744">They were prisoners.</span> <span id="s745">They were not sent to death–which, they died too, of course, from illness, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s746">But they were not sent to the gas.</span> <span id="s747">And the people who were sentenced to death, they shot them.</span> <span id="s748">But the people who were prisoners, they were sent back and forth.</span> <span id="s749">So there were people who were already in Dachau and Buchenwald, and they told us, "You stay here.</span> <span id="s750">All things you can do to stay here, and when they will send you to Poland, Auschwitz, finished.”</span> <span id="s751">They told us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s753">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s754">BF: The people did not believe.</span> <span id="s755">People did not believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">SB: People didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">BF: People did not believe.</span> <span id="s758">They did not believe.</span> <span id="s759">So, oh, sometimes there were people...</span></p> <p><span id="s760">SB: What was their thinking, that they didn't believe that they would...</span></p> <p><span id="s761">BF: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">SB: They couldn't believe that people could be so inhuman as to...</span></p> <p><span id="s763">BF: Yes, you could not, you could not believe it.</span> <span id="s764">I, I know, we came to, we were four days on the road...</span></p> <p><span id="s765">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">BF: And it was a, it was a big train.</span> <span id="s767">And it was so big.</span> <span id="s768">We were about 500 people.</span> <span id="s769">I think they got us to another train in the meantime.</span> <span id="s770">We always standing a lot of time or, or, on the place where, how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">SB: On the platform.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">BF: Platform, and, through Germany and the western [unclear] in between.</span> <span id="s773">And then we, in the meantime there were people from our transport.</span> <span id="s774">One time we stood outside.</span> <span id="s775">We could stand, we were allowed to go a little bit outside to our, our, and then somebody, there was one doctor, was, he wrote, he wrote a piece, a doctor, he came through to the woman.</span> <span id="s776">He said, "You're saying, always in Auschwitz you are Philips Facharbeiter.</span> <span id="s777">There is no doctor.</span> <span id="s778">There is no nurse.</span> <span id="s779">There is no teacher.</span> <span id="s780">You are–Philips Facharbeiter.”</span></p> <p><span id="s781">SB: [unclear] working.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">BF: “All Philips Facharbeiters [skilled worker]."</span> <span id="s783">This is what, what the Philips director told me.</span> <span id="s784">They will try to get us out.</span> <span id="s785">Philips Facharbeiter.</span> <span id="s786">Philips Facharbeiter.</span> <span id="s787">And there was one woman from, in, in the Philips group that was a group they were originally working at Velid, Philips.</span> <span id="s788">This is a whole story in itself.</span> <span id="s789">It's too long to tell it.</span> <span id="s790">And they were real Philips employees.</span> <span id="s791">And one of the women was a engineer.</span> <span id="s792">She was originally from Germany.</span> <span id="s793">She was so proud and she worked formerly at Telefunken.</span> <span id="s794">And I think they had some innovation on her name.</span> <span id="s795">So, so, she was also with us.</span> <span id="s796">She was originally German.</span> <span id="s797">So we got to Auschwitz and after a few days in Auschwitz, this whole story how we got to Auschwitz and what happened, there, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s798">SB: How did you get...</span></p> <p><span id="s799">BF: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s800">SB: Well tell us, how did you get to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">BF: On this train...</span></p> <p><span id="s802">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">BF: And when we, the last track of Auschwitz there were near the tracks there were all kind of people from the whole of Europe working, telling us, a Frenchman and, not Jewish people who they took workers.</span> <span id="s804">And they shouted, "Invasion, invasion."</span> <span id="s805">It was the 6th, 6th of June, '44, D-day.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s807">Yes.</span> <span id="s808">Yes.</span> <span id="s809">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">BF: The 2nd of June they took us away and we arrived in Auschwitz the 6th.</span> <span id="s811">So the last track before Auschwitz, these last before Beuthen, the last 50 km.</span> <span id="s812">they were shouting.</span> <span id="s813">You know, "Invasion, invasion."</span> <span id="s814">And as if that were to help us.</span> <span id="s815">We're going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s816">We knew already we'd go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s817">So, we, and, and I had a whole part, almost the whole trip, the whole, I stood near, near a, a little, it was a window, it was not the window, a little opening.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">SB: An opening in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">BF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s820">And I knew always where we, I looked where, where are we, and how do we go, and, and then I saw we go to this direction, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s821">And then, one moment we stood still, and we saw, we saw a big camp, big, big camp.</span> <span id="s822">And behind it, at the back of the camp we saw big fires.</span> <span id="s823">Big fires.</span> <span id="s824">Big, big, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SB: Smoke.</span> <span id="s826">Chimneys with smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">BF: Chimneys with fires.</span> <span id="s828">Then they said, "Look, they have, heavy industry here."</span> <span id="s829">I said, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s830">You know what it is?"</span> <span id="s831">It, it was–in Vught there was also a crematorium.</span> <span id="s832">They did not murder.</span> <span id="s833">They did also murder in Vught.</span> <span id="s834">But people were dying and people were shot dead, and they burned their bodies in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s835">So in Vught there was a big pile.</span> <span id="s836">Now sometimes there was also smoke and this, this, this smell.</span> <span id="s837">In Vught they always said, the only, only, the only, no how, how, the very fit [?]</span> <span id="s838">the only, how do we get out here, only through the pipe.</span> <span id="s839">You can't get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">SB: Only escape, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">BF: So I said, "Are you crazy?"</span> <span id="s842">And I said, "That's a crematoria!"</span> <span id="s843">[unclear] They, they tore me down from my [unclear] little, little [unclear].</span> <span id="s844">"You are always pessimistic.</span> <span id="s845">What do you say?</span> <span id="s846">We will work here."</span> <span id="s847">On this moment they didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">SB: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">BF: They did not believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">SB: So you arrived in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">BF: We arrived in Auschwitz, we [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s852">SB: And what happened on your arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">BF: And we got in this, in the, on this [unclear].</span> <span id="s854">You heard it already from people, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">SB: Yeah, but I want to hear it from you.</span> <span id="s856">Tell me about what happened to you as you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">BF: And we were without, we had only schmatas on us.</span> <span id="s858">In Vught, the last months in Vught we had these striped dresses, but they were good dresses.</span> <span id="s859">They were warm and they were good, they were new.</span> <span id="s860">And we had shoes and we had all, we had, we don’t get new, all these things.</span> <span id="s861">We had some things from yourself, not much, but you had a jacket, I think.</span> <span id="s862">And, so, but, when we got to, when they sent us to Auschwitz, they took all the good things they took away from us.</span> <span id="s863">I see, they brought us a big heap of old clothes, so you're, and the old wooden, wooden, broken shoes.</span> <span id="s864">And tachtunim [shroud], torn tachtunim...</span></p> <p><span id="s865">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">BF: Torn, torn, panties.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s882">They will show these people.</span> <span id="s883">For us it was nothing new.</span> <span id="s884">Then we came from Vught.</span> <span id="s885">With stripes, the men in stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">SB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">BF: Shoots, and the Germans.</span> <span id="s888">We were used to it already.</span> <span id="s889">But really, we were afraid what will happen.</span> <span id="s890">So they got us out, and not so, not so nice, what, the shouting and, and, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">SB: Beating?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">BF: Beating.</span> <span id="s893">And then they started to shout, Kein Gepäck abnehmen.</span> <span id="s894">"Don't take the luggage."</span> <span id="s895">And we started to laugh.</span> <span id="s896">We didn't have any Gepäck!</span> <span id="s897">Sondertransport, the special transport, that were we.</span> <span id="s898">So we didn't know what will happen.</span> <span id="s899">We were very afraid.</span> <span id="s900">And we were already, we were already used to it.</span> <span id="s901">You have to stand five, five, five.</span> <span id="s902">Then we stand five, five, five.</span> <span id="s903">Oh, you, you took where you will, you're together with your friends.</span> <span id="s904">And it's, very, very afraid, very afraid.</span> <span id="s905">Maybe shall be separated from the men.</span> <span id="s906">And you saw this was, it was dark, and there was this fire from the, from the, behind you, and the smell, and it was really like you, you thought this is the end.</span> <span id="s907">This is the end.</span> <span id="s908">You did not know what will happen to you.</span> <span id="s909">It was shock.</span> <span id="s910">Really shock.</span> <span id="s911">Really shock.</span> <span id="s912">And then they started to bring us to the, in Auschwitz, I, if you said Auschwitz, I see only mud.</span> <span id="s913">Brown mud.</span> <span id="s914">If you see sometimes a film from Auschwitz, there were some...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">SB: Just all mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">BF: It's all mud.</span> <span id="s917">But sometimes you see Auschwitz with green and with grass.</span> <span id="s918">There was no grass.</span> <span id="s919">It was all mud.</span> <span id="s920">It was nothing.</span> <span id="s921">And then they brought us to here this big, big barbed wire everywhere and these big towers.</span> <span id="s922">It was really with the, with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s923">SB: Lights...</span></p> <p><span id="s924">BF: Lights on, and with lights, yeah.</span> <span id="s925">You didn't know what will happen to you.</span> <span id="s926">So they brought us to this, they brought us in this camp where we were to be, and the worst thing wa-, also, even used to this aufsayden [unclear] where we used also, but these were really Hexen [witches],

one of the women started to shout, they take it from the children.</span> <span id="s1189">They beat her up.</span> <span id="s1190">So, they, because these children, from the seventeen children, nine stayed alive, came through Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">SB: And the other...</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">BF: They did not gas us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">SB: I see.</span></p>

<p><span id="s1203">BF: Of our group, no one was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">SB: Because you were Philips workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">BF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1206">People died

eyes.</span> <span id="s1222">I don't want to catch their eyes.</span> <span id="s1223">I didn't want them to catch my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">SB: Of course.</span> <span id="s1225">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">BF: So I don't know.</span> <span id="s1227">I remember.</span> <span id="s1228">I see a officer with a cap and with, with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">SB: With a uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">BF: With a whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">SB: A rifle and a whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">BF: It, but I don't

<span id="s1243">They will get us out, and then we were, we saw we were a Sondertransport , and we knew then people, we met people there and they said, “There are no children here.</span> <span id="s1244">Everybody goes to the gas.”</span> <span id="s1245">People really, we spoke with people who were there a longer time.</span> <span id="s1246">And then they brought us again to this sauna

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">BF: So they brought us to another concentration camp in the nearby, Lanowice, [unclear].</span> <span id="s1384">But what was a special thing, in the same, in the same village [unclear], in the same village where they had the, they brought the men from Philips, also from Auschwitz, in another factory in the same village they were.</span> <span id="s1385">But, and they were in this concentration camp nearby, about one hour walking.</span> <span id="s1386">And we were in the little camp near the factory.</span> <span id="s1387">But there were also other men that lived in this, in this concentration camp between working in our factory.</span> <span id="s1388">So we had contact between our, with the men.</span> <span id="s1389">My, my friend was married.</span> <span id="s1390">I don't know how ever he did it.</span> <span id="s1391">He was there in this concentration camp, in the second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">SB: And he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">BF: He died.</span> <span id="s1394">And we had contact with, I, I said, because I had very good eyes and I made these things, I sat on the, on a special bed, – special part of the factory.</span> <span id="s1395">And nearby all the people came near this, where I sat.</span> <span id="s1396">I sat between these two other friends.</span> <span id="s1397">We had control.</span> <span id="s1398">We had very good eyes.</span> <span id="s1399">We had to control the work from these things.</span> <span id="s1400">And we sat between civilians–German civilians–German girls from Berlin [unclear].</span> <span id="s1401">And near this, there was the corridor.</span> <span id="s1402">All the people came in, came on this corridor.</span> <span id="s1403">And we saw always the men coming in.</span> <span id="s1404">Until today, I don't know how somebody always said goodbye to me–one of the men.</span> <span id="s1405">I don't know his name, but how he, did he know, he once called me, there was a place we got to the WC, the water place.</span> <span id="s1406">We had to ask permission to go out or if you go to WC.</span> <span id="s1407">And there was a worker table there.</span> <span id="s1408">The men could come too.</span> <span id="s1409">And that was the place we changed, could exchange a few words, and that's all.</span> <span id="s1410">And so, and once he made me a sign.</span> <span id="s1411">I don't know how you did understand it.</span> <span id="s1412">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1413">So, I got out too, and I met him, and he gave me a paper, a little letter for my friend.</span> <span id="s1414">Until today I, he gave me a letter somebody who is asking to some, some of the woman [unclear].</span> <span id="s1415">It was my friend, it was by chance.</span> <span id="s1416">And so we had contact.</span> <span id="s1417">We could, we could, understand him, we sometimes, I don't know how, we, we had a, one of our Lagerältester [camp elder] she was a, she came from Holland.</span> <span id="s1418">It just happened that she was a German woman.</span> <span id="s1419">She was very clever.</span> <span id="s1420">And she got it that they brought us coats and warmer clothes.</span> <span id="s1421">So we had some textile there.</span> <span id="s1422">We managed something.</span> <span id="s1423">So we made tooks [?]</span> <span id="s1424">for the men and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1425">And the, and we sent sometimes little bit bread here and little bit more.</span> <span id="s1426">So one time I saw him so coming, and I had a, had the letter from my friend with me, all these years here and there and where, and I took it out and put it in somewhere, and I went out, and I got it to him.</span> <span id="s1427">I came back in the factory hall, "Out.</span> <span id="s1428">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s1429">Where did you put it?</span> <span id="s1430">Where did you put?</span> <span id="s1431">What did you do?"</span> <span id="s1432">"Nothing."</span> <span id="s1433">And the, and my friend was in another hall, but could hear.</span> <span id="s1434">Another friend sort of in the middle of this hall, and her letter was also in this package I gave.</span> <span id="s1435">And I looked at her, with my eyes, and she looked at me.</span> <span id="s1436">And I see, see, she got up, and up to go outside, with another German woman, German Aufscherin [inspector] to out, outside.</span> <span id="s1437">And in the meantime, they, they asked me.</span> <span id="s1438">And she comes back, and she looks at me, "Shhh."</span> <span id="s1439">Again.</span> <span id="s1440">And I look at her.</span> <span id="s1441">And I know she got it.</span> <span id="s1442">She got the, the, they will not find it.</span> <span id="s1443">She got it away.</span> <span id="s1444">So I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1445">I did nothing.</span> <span id="s1446">I want, I didn't want her to tell...</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">SB: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">BF: No, what she got it.</span> <span id="s1449">And then they took me in and beat me up, I think, you've seen Mickey Mouse with all these stars.</span> <span id="s1450">But I always, I don't know how, how I had the strength.</span> <span id="s1451">I never was with my head down.</span> <span id="s1452">Always stayed, I mean.</span> <span id="s1453">And I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1454">[unclear] but I mean, I wasn't afraid [unclear] me in.</span> <span id="s1455">And then they, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">SB: So this was this woman beat you up, or the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">BF: The woman, the Aufscherin beat me up, and then they let me stand there.</span> <span id="s1458">And then, I was a good worker.</span> <span id="s1459">And there was a civilian, German civilian, the master from the factory, and I saw he went to her and he came to fetch me back to my table.</span> <span id="s1460">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">SB: So, this work continued until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">BF: This work continued until we got bombed out, and then they brought us to this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">SB: Concentration...</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">BF: Concentration camp, and then we were there.</span> <span id="s1465">In the middle of the night we got there, and we didn't see anything.</span> <span id="s1466">They got us in a barrack, and there were all these people in it, and there were no beds, and I don't know how we managed.</span> <span id="s1467">And there the Hungarian women were there.</span> <span id="s1468">And you could not, if you wanted to go outside, you had to do pee pee, but it was very cold, and this time was a high snow, in January in the east of Germany.</span> <span id="s1469">And so people had the little, if they could manage it, a little pot, [unclear] box, eh, tin, and I saw there a tin and I had to do, and I did not know, I didn't know where I was.</span> <span id="s1470">I came in the dark in this camp.</span> <span id="s1471">I mean, you did not know.</span> <span id="s1472">I was afraid to go outside and poo poo, so I did it in this thing.</span> <span id="s1473">I, [laughing] it isn't really

this was full of lice.</span> <span id="s1809">And we tried to put it down, but they beat us.</span> <span id="s1810">We had to take it with us.</span> <span id="s1811">And then, again, in, in the, in the train car, and I mean, we threw it out.</span> <span id="s1812">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1813">There was no place!</span> <span id="s1814">And then from this time we were full of lice.</span> <span id="s1815">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1816">You could not, you couldn't get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1817">And then there from this train, we went back and forth between the, the front.</span> <span id="s1818">Then everyone was shooting and bombarding and we, then, then they got us to Lüneburger Heide.</span> <span id="s1819">You know where's the Lüneburger
