<p><span id="s8">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: June 1, 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: And where were you born?</span> <span id="s11">A: In the city of Kiel, K-i-e-l, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Now let’s talk a little bit about your family, your parents, your grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Okay, in order to understand my history, I have to begin with my paternal grandfather.</span> <span id="s14">He was the first, on my paternal side immigrant from Galicia to the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s15">He then helped to bring the rest of his family.</span> <span id="s16">He and my grandmother Mirel, M-i-r-e-l had seven children.</span> <span id="s17">My father was the sixth child of that family.</span> <span id="s18">And my father’s name is Simche, S-i-m-c-h-e Weber.</span> <span id="s19">They changed his name also to Lakritz.</span> <span id="s20">He was also known as Simon Weber, or Simon Lakritz.</span> <span id="s21">My mother’s name is Marjem, M-a-r-j-e-m, also known as Mary, in the United States.</span> <span id="s22">She was born Fass, F-a-s-s.</span> <span id="s23">She a-and my father were both born in Galicia.</span> <span id="s24">They both immigrated to Germany and a-arrived and lived in different city, my father in Kiel, my mother in Cologne.</span> <span id="s25">I was the first of three children born of my parents.</span> <span id="s26">I was born, as I said, on June 1, 1934 in Kiel.</span> <span id="s27">After th -- me was my sister Rosa, R-o-s-a Weber, and her name also was subsequently changed to Lakritz.</span> <span id="s28">She was born on July 28, 1935 in Kiel, and she died I think the first or second day of her -- her first day of her life.</span> <span id="s29">She is the only member of the family who is buried in Kiel, who has in fact a burial place, other than my mother in the United States.</span> <span id="s30">My brother then followed and he was born on September the second 1936 and he was born also in the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s31">That is the extent of my immediate family.</span> <span id="s32">I will go into the extended family when I’m asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s34">Tell me a little bit about your parents.</span> <span id="s35">What did your father do, what kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My father worked for his father.</span> <span id="s37">My grandfather, Artur, otherwise known as Arthur Weber, had established a business in the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s38">From what I understand -- I don’t really know the whole nature of it but at -- at -- after the f -- end of the first World War, when he arrived -- whenever he arrived in -- in Kiel, I’m not sure when, he established a -- a wholesale business, and I believe initially it was of material after the war.</span> <span id="s39">In any event, he then changed that business to basically a business of collecting during the -- th-the beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting items that the German economy needed; raw material, reusable material.</span> <span id="s40">And so he became a wholesaler of schmatter and of all types of metal and all kinds o-of things that they could recycle.</span> <span id="s41">And he, during the time when Jews couldn’t find employment, he employed many, many Jews of Kiel in this business, and they would go through the streets of Kiel with a handcart and call out something.</span> <span id="s42">And I’m -- I’m relating basically what I -- what I understand.</span> <span id="s43">And these people would buy the used material that was recyclable, that Germany needed and then they would sell it to my grandfather, my grandfather was their employer and I guess he was the contributor to the livelihood of many, many Jews who also came from Galicia and -- like he had.</span> <span id="s44">And they formed a community in Kiel, which is important to understand, I mean the history of my family, which is recorded in Kiel and in books and in theses.</span> <span id="s45">His relationship to the other Jews, and to his own kind of Jews who immigrated to Germany is important.</span> <span id="s46">He was a very devout Jew.</span> <span id="s47">A Hassidic Jew, and -- as I think most of them were when they moved to Galicia, from Galicia to Germany.</span> <span id="s48">And he was a member of the one synagogue in -- in -- in -- in Kiel.</span> <span id="s49">And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also, he belonged to that synagogue.</span> <span id="s50">But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews, and my gr-grandfather kind of Jews, clashed.</span> <span id="s51">And they clashed culturally, they clashed religiously in their dress, in their manner, in their form of employment, economically, in -- in -- in all the other way.</span> <span id="s52">So those two groups in Kiel, separated.</span> <span id="s53">And my grandfather, having a compound property an-and -- and a -- and a big warehouse, and it was a big business, anyway, he created his own synagogue, and I take pride in the father -- in the fact that my grandfather, whenever I’ve told that story, is the only person that I know who had his own synagogue and his own congregation.</span> <span id="s54">And that synagogue, and the photograph of his synagogue is reproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was born and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the photograph of that particular synagogue is repeated over and over, even in the museum of -- of Kiel and -- which is outside the -- Kiel.</span> <span id="s55">And it is a example, I suppose of that there were Jews, and that there was an existence.</span> <span id="s56">Anyway, tha -- I want to lead up to why this is significant in my family, because I come from these people.</span> <span id="s57">They are ordinary people, they are very religious people, they are very good people.</span> <span id="s58">They are very honest people, hardworking people, family people, loving people.</span> <span id="s59">And all of these people were killed during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s60">Thirty-one members of my father immediate -- im-immediate I’m -- I’m speaking now, members of my father’s family were killed in the co -- various concentration camps of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s61">All of that is verified by documents that I have collected.</span> <span id="s62">And I’m talking now of my paternal grandfather, my paternal grandmother, all seven of their children, all seven, if any ha -- were married, and all of them but one were married -- all of them had children and of all of those children in the -- in this compilation that I made of the records of my family, I have the whole family tree.</span> <span id="s63">I have all of their names and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but -- seven of those children, survived.</span> <span id="s64">Seven children of this large family survived the war.</span> <span id="s65">And one of the survivor had been interned in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s66">He -- he is the only one who survived the concentration camp of -- of all of my immediate cousins.</span> <span id="s67">All of my cousins otherwise, but the other -- my brother and I and I think four, survived.</span> <span id="s68">And the survival of these other cousins is interesting.</span> <span id="s69">Two or three of them went from Kiel o-or Cologne, or wherever they were living, right now I don’t recall, and they went on the Kindertransport to England, okay?</span> <span id="s70">Of those, one, Max Wiedman, who is my -- also my first cousin, served in the British army and then in the Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of Germany.</span> <span id="s71">He served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after -- before the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s72">Two of them were in England, one then emigrated to the United States and that’s where we stayed when we first came.</span> <span id="s73">Anyway, the one who survived Auschwitz then married another survivor of the concentration camp and they were shipped out to then Palestine, and he established a sausage store or whatever in -- in -- in -- probably in Haifa if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s74">And he died, and one of -- and one of his child -- his son is the -- a -- a vice president or some position like that in the Weizmann Institute in Belgium.</span> <span id="s75">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Weizmann Institute in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah, that institute, but they have offices in -- in Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: -- and Europe and he is the vice president of one of them.</span> <span id="s80">I think it’s the vice president of that, in Belgium.</span> <span id="s81">Now, one of my cousins grew up in Cologne, and she was sent by her parents to Palestine in 1937.</span> <span id="s82">She -- I think her name is Ruth, right now.</span> <span id="s83">She became one of the early kibbutzim in then Palestine.</span> <span id="s84">She became a labor leader.</span> <span id="s85">She was extremely active in -- in politics in -- in -- in -- and in the kibbutz movement in -- in Palestine.</span> <span id="s86">And she, like the son of the Auschwitz survivor, and Max Weidman who was in England, us four were the surviving children of this family, other than my brother.</span> <span id="s87">But those four reunited in Kiel when we invited by the city of Kiel and by the state of where -- which we were born, to return.</span> <span id="s88">So those four, okay.</span> <span id="s89">The only one of the surviving children who were born in Kiel who were not killed, was my brother Herbert and he chose not to accept the invitation and not to go to Germany, to our birthplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Tell me why -- let’s get back to your immediate family.</span> <span id="s91">Why did your family choose to come to Kiel?</span> <span id="s92">Was there something about that city particularly that attracted them?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Okay, well, my grandfather, as I said, had his wife and -- and -- and six children, seven children at the -- you know, okay, in Galicia in this little town on the [indecipherable] I -- I can’t pronounce it.</span> <span id="s94">Anyway, I have the record, however it’s spelled.</span> <span id="s95">And for some reason his family sent him in advance to go to -- away from Galicia.</span> <span id="s96">Apparently the lines of the Jews in Galicia at that time was becoming too overwhelming, too threatening, too whatever it is and he, because he was the most intelligent or the best, or what -- I don’t know, whatever skills they gave him -- and he was, obviously, a great man -- he was sent to Germany -- I mean, not to Germany, he was going to Denmark.</span> <span id="s97">So, on his way to Denmark he stopped in the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s98">And Kiel, he fell in love with that city.</span> <span id="s99">It’s a beautiful city, a university city on the -- on the Atlantic, on I think it was on the Baltic Sea --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Baltic --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: -- [indecipherable] Baltic Sea, okay.</span> <span id="s102">He just fell in love with the city.</span> <span id="s103">And so rather than going to Denmark, which was a little bit further up, he stopped in Kiel --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Kiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: -- and he establish in Kiel and he did -- I mean, he did fairly well, you know, for an immigrant, you know, particularly one with the long beard, the real Jewish tradition, a very Jewish looking man.</span> <span id="s106">Incidentally, his photo and that of th-the seventh child, my uncle, is also reproduced in the books of Kiel, over and over in th -- in the history books and it’s the only picture I have of him with his long beard.</span> <span id="s107">I have the picture of my other grandparents, my maternal grandfather and grandmother and they also were of the same breed.</span> <span id="s108">Very religious.</span> <span id="s109">In fact, my maternal grandmother -- I mean the father, was a -- a man who studied the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the books, I’m not sure which one right now that he studied, but anyway, he studied them on a daily basis, was v -- extremely religious.</span> <span id="s110">And my mother lived in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in Kiel -- I mean, in Cologne.</span> <span id="s111">Now there’s a time when my mother and her family lived in Holland, in -- I’ve forgotten now where.</span> <span id="s112">Now, when that happened, I don’t know, but I assume it was during the first World War.</span> <span id="s113">And why they then moved to Cologne, I don’t know, I didn’t ask, I’m afraid, and -- but she lived in Holland, then she moved as a child to Cologne.</span> <span id="s114">She remained there until she met my father and they were engaged and they were married there.</span> <span id="s115">And then she moved, of course, with her husband to Kiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s117">We’re -- so then they got married and you were their first child?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I’m the oldest one, yes, I’m the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And -- right.</span> <span id="s120">And what do you know about their beginning of their married life --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: -- in Kiel and where they lived and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: All right.</span> <span id="s124">I believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: We know you were -- you were an infant, and obviously this is what you’ve been told.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah, but I -- I -- I -- I can tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: -- whatever I -- I know --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: -- or recall.</span> <span id="s131">I believe that they were introduced through a -- what was a tradition --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes, and I believe that’s how they were introduced.</span> <span id="s134">And I believe that the -- of the s -- a few surviving pictures that I have of my family, immediate family and of my father and mother, I believe I have two things.</span> <span id="s135">I have their pictures that maybe were exchanged, possibly.</span> <span id="s136">Maybe that’s -- would explain those pictures.</span> <span id="s137">And I have, in the picture of my father and my mother, both taken alone, right, obviously by an official photographer --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What -- what year did they get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: They got married in 1933, in April.</span> <span id="s140">In their announcement -- I even have their little teeny announcement of their engagement, and the name that she has in the in -- is Marjem Willener, W-i-l-l-e-n-e-r , and that is her father’s real name, Willener.</span> <span id="s141">And I have a copy of his business -- I -- I don’t know, since I don’t read German, but I have their wedding picture, I have their ketubah, and I had it translated.</span> <span id="s142">I have their wedding picture and I have their announcement.</span> <span id="s143">And the announcement of their -- their engagement was in January 1933 and they were married on the 11th day of August 1933, and in th -- Cologne.</span> <span id="s144">And it -- it says that he is the son of Artur -- Artur Weber and she is the son of -- I mean, she is the daughter Miriam, right, an-and Marjem is Miriam, daughter of Israel and according to the law of Moses and so forth, and that’s when they were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Now, I don’t know what you asked me any more, but what -- you asked me --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Well, let’s -- so now you are born.</span> <span id="s148">What is your first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Okay, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What is your very first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: All right.</span> <span id="s152">Now, you were asking me about my -- the type of people that they were, okay.</span> <span id="s153">They were engaged, I believe in that fashion, they got married.</span> <span id="s154">I believe absolutely completely that my parents were totally, completely in love with one another.</span> <span id="s155">Tough part is coming.</span> <span id="s156">One of the things that hurts I think the most about what happened to my family, and I’m sure many families, is that they were totally, completely innocent, because they were totally good people.</span> <span id="s157">And the injustice of what happens to my family, as it is to thousands and maybe millions of others, who were just as innocent, just as good, just as nice, is what makes, in my view, the Holocaust such a monstrous crime.</span> <span id="s158">Now, my parents as I said, right, my father worked directly for his father.</span> <span id="s159">A good son, a loving son.</span> <span id="s160">His parents, my grandparents were wonderful, loving, religious, good people.</span> <span id="s161">My father and mother were tremendously good people.</span> <span id="s162">And they didn’t do anything -- and I have to say this at the beginning -- anything to deserve anything of what happened to them.</span> <span id="s163">And so in this context let me tell you what I remember.</span> <span id="s164">I remember pushing my brother’s baby carriage and walking with my mother in the streets of Kiel, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What language did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: German.</span> <span id="s167">And -- both of us did.</span> <span id="s168">And I remember getting lost with a girl in the streets of Kiel, and some good people -- and we went towards the harbor, cause where I live was only three or four blocks from the -- from the harbor.</span> <span id="s169">And we got lost and -- and with the neighbor girl, and she was about my age, I suppose -- anyway, and then we -- they were -- some kind people found us and -- and -- and brought us back or restored us to our parents.</span> <span id="s170">Then my memory in-involves a time when my parents went out on an evening and -- and they left us without a babysitter and I remember that I -- I totally obviously panicked, and I turned on all the lights.</span> <span id="s171">And maybe that was the time also that my brother and I were playing and I was jumping on the bed and I fell and hit my head against an end table in their bedroom and I have a little mark on my forehead because of that.</span> <span id="s172">Now, I also remember a living room.</span> <span id="s173">In a -- in the living room we had a tapestry in the wall and there was a -- a deer and the main -- that was the main attribute of this tapestry, and I was fascinated that he kept looking at me.</span> <span id="s174">Wherever I moved, back and forth, this guy, this deer, he kept looking at me.</span> <span id="s175">That was fascinating.</span> <span id="s176">The next thing that I remember is having Pesach on the floor of our living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Were you in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, i -- i -- i -- okay, my grandfather’s property, a-as I recall involved, I believe, three buildings or four buildings.</span> <span id="s179">But anyway, from my memory, there is the front building, you know the address of 25 Cuba -- kooba -- koober, forgot anyway, its name, little something.</span> <span id="s180">Anyway, so we lived in the front building on the second floor.</span> <span id="s181">Underneath that was the family of my cousins, uncle and aunt, they’re called Weidman, right, they had several children.</span> <span id="s182">They lived there, we lived above.</span> <span id="s183">Okay.</span> <span id="s184">My grandfather lived over here, right, the entrance to the -- to the compound was over here, and in the back was this warehouse, his big building.</span> <span id="s185">All right.</span> <span id="s186">Now, I remember being in that apartment, right?</span> <span id="s187">And it was, it was an upstairs apartment.</span> <span id="s188">And in the living room an -- we had one of the nights of Seder.</span> <span id="s189">And my father was all dressed in white and we were on the floor, we had pillows, and we had -- okay, I remember that.</span> <span id="s190">Now, the next thing I remember is an event that was very, very traumatic to me.</span> <span id="s191">My mother was hanging up new drapes that she had made for our apartment and she fell.</span> <span id="s192">And I rememb -- I remember the ambulance to take her away.</span> <span id="s193">And of course, I was three or f-four years old at the most.</span> <span id="s194">And I thought for sure they would take my mother away.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And it’s interesting how children perceive different thing and understand, obviously a limited amount, and that’s what I was afraid of, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: -- the next event that I remember I believe was on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s199">And on Kristallnacht, which I believe occurred in October --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: November.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: -- 1938, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: November.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Right.</span> <span id="s204">The Nazis came to destroy as much as they could of the synagogue of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s205">And I remember looking out the window with my father, you know, [indecipherable] down and they were burning things in front of the entrance to this compound, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s206">And I am sure that that was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s207">Then I remember, and there may have been a separate day or was the same day, again my father and I were crouched down the window so we wouldn’t been seen, you know, and there were all kinds of soldiers lined up in front of our street there.</span> <span id="s208">Now, that may have been a different time and there may have been parades that they were doing, but in any event, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Was that a frightening experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, both experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Well, the burning yes, but the -- just th -- seeing the soldiers marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes, that was frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And then the next memory that I have is us being arrested to be shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s214">And this followed, I understand from history, the Kristallnacht deportation where the Nazis tried to ship the refugee Jews in Germany to Poland.</span> <span id="s215">And so i -- I remember the soldiers coming to our house with their gun, ordering my mother to pack, and she went an-and packed her wet clothes that were on th -- hanging on the roof, and she put them in a big bag or -- a duffle bag, I remember that.</span> <span id="s216">I remember the soldier with his gun, you know, standing there and I was so fascinated by the soldier and the gun and th -- tha -- and I remember that.</span> <span id="s217">And then I remember in -- in this state of arrest by the German, whether they were soldier, Gestapo, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s218">Then we were transported -- were arrest -- I -- I believe that we spent maybe a night in prison, I’m not sure, but I know what I remember.</span> <span id="s219">I remember being on the train, right, with these German Jews that they were shipping out of Germany, and I remember the men -- I was with the men what -- I remember.</span> <span id="s220">They were praying, they had their tallis, they were crying and we were shipped to Poland and then Poland closed its border that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s223">This is tape number one, side B, and you were talking about when you were arrested and then taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s225">Okay, on this train ride, I remember getting off the train with my mother, so that I could make, okay, on the side of the -- siding on the plane -- I mean, of the train.</span> <span id="s226">And I remember doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: To relieve yourself, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I remember also that at some stop, some people brought candy, ca -- chocolate and so forth to -- to be distributed and I remember that, and I’m sure it was distributed to the German.</span> <span id="s231">Okay, at that time of course, I was with my father and mother and my brother Herbert.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And you are a little over four year --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I am a little over four years old, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: -- over four, you’re about -- four, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah, this is just a little over four.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What -- what did you take with you?</span> <span id="s237">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s238">Did you take anything special with you --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: -- as a four year old child?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I am -- yes, I am telling you, I -- what I am telling you, I remember.</span> <span id="s242">I absolutely remember.</span> <span id="s243">God has given me the gift, right, to be able to remember so that I can testify to what I saw and experienced, what happened to of -- my family, of course, and others.</span> <span id="s244">On the train, as I explained to you, I remember this tremendous impact to me, of seeing men praying -- which of course I had seen, you know, I saw my father pray every day, I went to the synagogue of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t know how many times, but I went there.</span> <span id="s246">I’m sure [indecipherable] in the company of my mother.</span> <span id="s247">But here was something that really struck me as a four year old child, here were these men standing with their tallis and their hats and their yarmulkes praying and crying.</span> <span id="s248">They all understood that the German government, the German rulers had decided to -- because they came and arrested all these people, right, and said all you can do is take whatever, yo-you know, you can carry it in hand.</span> <span id="s249">You’re leaving everything behind, right?</span> <span id="s250">You’re abandoning everything, we’re transporting you, we’re shipping you back to where you belong in Poland.</span> <span id="s251">And they were crying.</span> <span id="s252">And to a four year old child, right, the sight of men, right, that obviously a child only understands, you know, the strength and the absolute of parents, here were these men crying.</span> <span id="s253">And I’m sure maybe my father was crying.</span> <span id="s254">And I -- this was a real shock to me, yes.</span> <span id="s255">And later I-I was told -- of course I didn’t understand anything that was going on -- later on I was told by my mother -- not then, of course, years later, that that day Poland had had it.</span> <span id="s256">It did not want to accept any more Jews being transported or expelled, you know, from Germany into their country for whatever reasons they decided to do that.</span> <span id="s257">And our train, as far as my mother is concerned, our train was the train that was not allowed into Germany and it was sent back.</span> <span id="s258">So we were sent back to Kiel.</span> <span id="s259">Now, the second phase, right, of -- of my story has to do with how long, right, and this -- the legal system, both in Germany, then in Belgium, then in France, came and played a part on how Jews were treated.</span> <span id="s260">And so I understand, right.</span> <span id="s261">When I was born the Aryan laws were established, right, okay, with all its limitation and so forth.</span> <span id="s262">But I also wi -- and I believe, I’m informed that after Kristallnacht further laws were imposed and restrictions on Jews, you know, which limited their employment, their op-opportunity to survive, you know, everything was done obviously, to make it as difficult, you know, for them in hardship.</span> <span id="s263">Okay, so in my family, what happened is, I believe that early in this ballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against others, and I will tell you why.</span> <span id="s264">For some reason my mother became very concern about their -- the future.</span> <span id="s265">For herself and for her children and for her husband.</span> <span id="s266">So she wrote -- I had a great heeha -- a great-uncle, her uncle, Uncle Max Fass, who lived in Oakland, California.</span> <span id="s267">And he had become a very successful businessman.</span> <span id="s268">And she wrote to him, and I have one of her letters that she wrote to him, asking him to sponsor us to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s269">His application was approved, visas and -- and our permission to enter the United States was approved in 1935.</span> <span id="s270">He had paid for the transportation with the Hamburg America line.</span> <span id="s271">We had everything.</span> <span id="s272">The only thing we didn’t have is the final stamp of the exit from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: This is for the three of you, your mother, your father and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes, in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: That’s before my brother was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: And the little bit that I’m told over the years, the story is something like this.</span> <span id="s279">My parents, of course, lived in Kiel.</span> <span id="s280">They had to go to Hamburg to get these exit visas stamped and approved.</span> <span id="s281">I believe that the story is this, is that my father, being a religious Jew did not on the Shabbas or on this [indecipherable] holiday, carry any money.</span> <span id="s282">And so he didn’t know, as smart as he was he did not know that they would require some payment for the exit permit.</span> <span id="s283">That’s what I understand.</span> <span id="s284">He did not have it.</span> <span id="s285">So he asked them when he found out, I’ll come back tomorrow when I can bring money.</span> <span id="s286">I have money.</span> <span id="s287">They had everything, okay, including the Hamburg line, you know, confirmation, you know, wh-which I have a copy of.</span> <span id="s288">Okay.</span> <span id="s289">The Nazi said no.</span> <span id="s290">Okay, now you have to understand, I was born in the city that I believe was one of the ultra-nationalistic Nazi cities, that’s what I believe.</span> <span id="s291">That was where all the you -- the German si -- U-boats, submarines were located.</span> <span id="s292">That’s where German armament ships an-an-and submarines were manufactured, I believe that by slave labor, right, who were gathered from wherever.</span> <span id="s293">I believe that was owned by Krup, okay, I am not certain, but I am.</span> <span id="s294">Okay.</span> <span id="s295">In -- if I spoke and read German I could tell you better, you know, than what I believe.</span> <span id="s296">But among the books that were given to me by the city of Kiel -- you know, they proudly displayed, you know, their pre-World War II history, their World War II history and the post-World War history.</span> <span id="s297">And my family is there in the pre-war, my -- my cousins, you know, in the -- in the Hebrew schools are all over, you know, in their book.</span> <span id="s298">Their pictures are all over, hanging in the museum of Kiel, which is outside the city, you know, gigantic photographs of members of my family.</span> <span id="s299">In fact, Max Weidman, when we were going touring that -- that -- that museum, he said to me, see, that’s my picture, that’s me.</span> <span id="s300">He says, how could it be that I’m in a museum?</span> <span id="s301">We’re looking at my face on the wall?</span> <span id="s302">That is abnormal.</span> <span id="s303">Anyway, but seven of my cousins are in these photographs in the Jewish schools of Kiel.</span> <span id="s304">Okay, that’s -- all right, now let’s see, where was I?</span> <span id="s305">Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Can you -- can we just -- can you just take a diversion now and tell me why the names are different?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yeah, my name --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: -- okay, yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s310">I was telling you what I believe, right, was a -- a concentrated effort by the Nazis, you know, to intimidate, to humiliate, to debase, to deprive Jews in the city of Kiel, you know, of -- of a normal living and so forth.</span> <span id="s311">And that had started, and that’s where it was at.</span> <span id="s312">It started early in the ballgame, because our denial of exiting Germany in 1935, when we had everything approved by the United States an-and e-e-everything, right, was denied because he was in the -- an observant Jew and he did not carry money.</span> <span id="s313">And they didn’t give him the opportunity even to come back the next day when he would bring it, okay.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t know of any indecency, you know, that’s greater than to deny somebody even their right to religious observance.</span> <span id="s315">And that’s what that is.</span> <span id="s316">Okay, now the next story is a story that is also very personal to me, and it is part of this pattern.</span> <span id="s317">I believe that it became part of the -- our request to immigrate in -- in 1935 in -- I believe.</span> <span id="s318">I am not a hundred percent certain, but I am 95 minimum certain that the Germans demanded, as part of the exit permits and identi -- they demanded a copy of the birth certificate of my father a-and since he was born in Galicia, a -- what I understand is that these people who -- who -- these Jews who lived in Galicia in these small little hamlets or villages or whatever it is, that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Shetls?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: -- y-yeah, that the only marriage that they had was a religious marriage.</span> <span id="s321">They were all religious, okay, and the record of their marriages and birth were recorded in the synagogues, but not -- they didn’t marry civilly in that area.</span> <span id="s322">Now, in Germany the requirement is that you marry civilly and religiously, but that the only marriage which is valid and recorded and recognized is the civil marriage.</span> <span id="s323">Well, I’m giving credit to the bastards, okay?</span> <span id="s324">No, no, I have better words for them, but I am giving this much as a lawyer, right?</span> <span id="s325">A little bit of credit that -- th-that they used the law to then follow up and do the following monstrosity.</span> <span id="s326">They demanded, I believe, this evidence, the evidence that my -- my father’s birth certificate.</span> <span id="s327">Now, I don’t know that he had any kind of evidence, so they -- he didn’t have it, let’s assume, okay, because obviously he wasn’t civilly registered at his birth.</span> <span id="s328">So then they demanded proof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently.</span> <span id="s329">So what they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and I have a copy of it.</span> <span id="s330">I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it.</span> <span id="s331">And in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I understand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that my father was his bastard child.</span> <span id="s332">Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and himself, right?</span> <span id="s333">This is a devout, you know, couple.</span> <span id="s334">My -- my grandmother didn’t even have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of wearing, you know, a wig.</span> <span id="s335">I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know, other than -- to debase human being, right.</span> <span id="s336">And this affidavit that I have a copy of, right, attests to the fact that his son Simche, right, is his bastard child.</span> <span id="s337">So now, what they did is they forced a -- a -- a family name change of my father, my mother, myself and my brother.</span> <span id="s338">No, not my brother.</span> <span id="s339">No, he wasn’t born then.</span> <span id="s340">This was in 1935.</span> <span id="s341">So my pursuit and obsession is, to some degree it is to know who we were, what we were, where we come from, you know, wh-why -- who were we.</span> <span id="s342">Who were these people who were killed in this unjustified manner?</span> <span id="s343">So I, in 1988 went to the consulate of Germany in Los Angeles and I was received by -- and I explained to them on the telephone -- and I explained to whoever I-I spoke to, and I suppose it was the legal officer on the -- of the consulate, what I was after.</span> <span id="s344">And what I was after in 19 dia -- ’88 is the beginning of my pursuit to try to prove what happened to my family, so that I could understand, so that I could know, but also so that I could tell my wife, my children and my grandchildren and so on, whatever future we have in this earth, of what happened to their fore-parents and how wrong this was and how this should never happen again, to anybody.</span> <span id="s345">So I went to the consulate, I was received with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul.</span> <span id="s346">Both were extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was, an-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in Los Angeles, they were extremely professionally connected to me.</span> <span id="s347">They were connected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you know, people, as I was.</span> <span id="s348">And so our discussions were very frank.</span> <span id="s349">And so they asked me a little bit of my history and I told them, you know, where I come from, where my family comes from, you know, and what happened.</span> <span id="s350">And so they se -- I told them, what I want to do is to establi -- I want a copy of my original birth certificate.</span> <span id="s351">I want to know why my name was changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: From --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: From Weber, which was the name of my father, right.</span> <span id="s354">His father, right, originally was born by the name of Weizner.</span> <span id="s355">He, when he went to Germany changed it to Weber.</span> <span id="s356">Now, I-I will tell you how horrible this is.</span> <span id="s357">In the documents that I later obtained from the city of Kiel, the records of the city of Kiel, when he bought his different parcels, different l-land ac-acquisition to build this compound, the record -- the record, you know, is there, you know, of his name, of his changed name and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: From Weber to Lakritz?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: From -- no, from my grandfather, from Weizner to Weber.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Oh, Weizner to Weber, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Right, okay, but from then on he is referred always, you know, from 1914, 19 whatever it is, you know, in those records throughout, he’s always referred to as Artur Weber.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Weber.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Always, always.</span> <span id="s364">Never was his name changed, never.</span> <span id="s365">So when I ask that my -- I wanted a inquiry and obtain the -- the -- my birth certificate, and why was my name changed?</span> <span id="s366">So the German consulate, what they did -- and I couldn’t speak German, I couldn’t write German and I didn't know what to write.</span> <span id="s367">So they were absolutely wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s368">They handwrote the letters, and they, you know, o-of -- of who I should write to.</span> <span id="s369">So then I brought it to my secretary and she didn’t speak German any more than me.</span> <span id="s370">Anyway, we pounded away, you know, the letter and we mailed it to Kiel with the proper money that they told me I should send, and I did send it.</span> <span id="s371">Then -- and they -- they said to me, those two guys, they said, you know, the German nation, the German people did many horrible things to the Jews, but that it didn’t do.</span> <span id="s372">And I said, okay, I want to find out if they did or didn’t do.</span> <span id="s373">So I sent for the information and I received information back.</span> <span id="s374">And the information I received back from Kiel is my new birth certificate and two judgments of two courts in Kiel, Germany.</span> <span id="s375">One of them is a police court, and one is a -- another kind of court, a civil court, and both of them are judgments ordering the name change of my parents and myself from the last name of Weber, which was our name, to Lakritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So you were -- o-on your original birth certificate it said Weber?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: And then they changed it to Lakritz --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: To Lakritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: -- okay.</span> <span id="s382">And I will tell you in a second why, but anyway, these two judgments not only ordered the name change, but they also named the judgments in order that my parents were forbidden to use the name of Weber under penalty of imprisonment and imprison -- and -- and fines, something li -- to that effect, okay, and again I have limited -- I have no understanding or knowledge of the German language, so I -- but I have the documents.</span> <span id="s383">So once I had the judgments, I called the legal officer and I had a second meeting with them and I showed them.</span> <span id="s384">And they couldn’t believe it, that now I had the judgments of the two German courts, right, where I was born, right?</span> <span id="s385">My father was raised in Kiel, educated in Kiel.</span> <span id="s386">They were living there and my grandfather had property there and my God, they were about as honest a people as they obviously could be, compared to their comparative and their contemporaries.</span> <span id="s387">And they said they couldn’t believe it, that this had officially been done.</span> <span id="s388">And they said well, you know, I mean, there’s nothing to it, you know, just change your name back.</span> <span id="s389">And so I said, I don’t know if I can do it, and I don’t know that I’m allowed to do it.</span> <span id="s390">I don’t know that my brother will agree to do it.</span> <span id="s391">I don’t know what I can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Where did the name Lakritz come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: All right.</span> <span id="s394">Now, the name of Lakritz is my paternal grandmother’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: In other words, what these bastards did is they refused to recognize the validity of the marriage between my grandfather and my grandmother and they said, okay, you’re the bastard son of this Artur Weber --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: [indecipherable] mother’s name --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: -- do you understand?</span> <span id="s399">Now -- then, your legitimate name --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Is your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: -- is your grandmother’s name, Lakritz.</span> <span id="s402">Okay, Lakritz, incidentally, in German means licorice, you know, which is a favorite candy in Germany, particularly in the northern part and also in Denmark and Sweden.</span> <span id="s403">And I had a story to tell about that, but anyway -- but Lakritz is the family name, okay.</span> <span id="s404">And my brother, when I had the evidence and I asked him in front of his children and my children, come on, we can change our name.</span> <span id="s405">And he says, it’s too late.</span> <span id="s406">By then, of course, we were grown men with our own children and -- and -- and he says, you know, our name and our history is fixed, you know.</span> <span id="s407">So we didn’t, and I haven’t.</span> <span id="s408">But this is something I carry with tremendous resentment.</span> <span id="s409">I have resented that they changed my name.</span> <span id="s410">I resent it today, I si -- resent it every day.</span> <span id="s411">This is one of the burning things that burns to me.</span> <span id="s412">So th-the fact that they denied employment, that they denied exit, that they denied my name, that they imprison us and wanted to deport us with anything and that ultimately the only thing left was for us to escape, which they did -- we did, of course i-illegally from Germany into Belgium.</span> <span id="s413">These were the beginning of part of the picture, I believe, that affected of course, many, many Jews, right, many ordinary Jews.</span> <span id="s414">We were ordinary people, right.</span> <span id="s415">And this is the beginning of my life.</span> <span id="s416">And it is something that I have to say, that I am sure has marked my personality and my attitudes and maybe my choice of profession and my relationship to wife and children and others, because I believe that a child who is treated in this way, and in what follows, including the two years of being hidden in France and thinking we had been -- we had no longer had any parents, I believe that this is one of the most monstrous of crimes that’s committed.</span> <span id="s417">The rapes and the killing that is done and was done, and is done today, right, against i-innocent people, you know, in different parts of the world I won’t name now, but -- but we’ve had several genocides and one or two are going on right now.</span> <span id="s418">The aftereffect of what this has to those people who are the victim is something that unfortunately is not understood, maybe rightfully so, and is not, I think, shared.</span> <span id="s419">And I don’t think it’s gi -- ging -- giving credit to these poor people.</span> <span id="s420">So it’s not just because it happened to me, but I am speaking, you understand that, for them, you know.</span> <span id="s421">It was real for me, it is real for me now and it will be real for them, you know, whether they are over there in Africa, you know, or in Asia where it happened, or in other places.</span> <span id="s422">So we should not and cannot think of the Holocaust or the other genocides that have occurred simply in the numbers, right.</span> <span id="s423">This has to be measured by the effect on people, and that effect is for a lifetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Mm, yeah.</span> <span id="s425">Let’s get back to your particular story now.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yes, but that’s part of -- of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: No, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: -- aftereffect of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Yeah, I know, I-I do understand.</span> <span id="s430">So you returned to Kiel, you said?</span> <span id="s431">A: Right, so we return --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Did you go back to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yes, because they couldn’t -- a-according to German law, obviously they could not just take it, right?</span> <span id="s434">I mean, the original decree of expulsion, you know, with -- following the Kristallnacht, you know, arrested us and shipped us, but that failed.</span> <span id="s435">So since that wa -- that failed, we -- obviously we had a right to our property, okay?</span> <span id="s436">And yeah, we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You went back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Right.</span> <span id="s439">But from that point on, all right, my mother, who is a very strong woman, I’m sure, told my father this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Right.</span> <span id="s442">And there’s no more, you know, we’re not staying here, no matter what.</span> <span id="s443">And then, in some ways, they arranged for our exit, our escape from Germany into Belgium, and that I remember also.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Do you know how they did it?</span> <span id="s445">They ever fi --</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No.</span> <span id="s447">No, no, I mean, th-they -- we were smuggled at nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: In -- in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s452">Exactly when, I am not sure, but it was in 1939 that we were smuggle.</span> <span id="s453">I remember going under barbed wire, I remember that.</span> <span id="s454">I remember the -- the -- the big cloud in the sky that I thought it was God.</span> <span id="s455">That’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s456">And I remember then we landed in Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: In -- in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: And that’s where we landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s462">Wha -- wha -- and -- and we will, of course, get to that.</span> <span id="s463">What did it mean to you as a young four or five year old child with all this happening to you?</span> <span id="s464">I mean, you’re on a train, then your parents tell you you’re going back home again.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: That --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you have any idea of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No.</span> <span id="s468">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: -- no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: It was just a --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: That --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: -- family happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No, tha -- I had no comprehension.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: -- hension, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Did you, at that point ever hear of somebody named Hitler?</span> <span id="s478">A: You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: I know you were very -- obviously you were four or five --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: -- I was very young and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: -- of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: -- no, and -- and I -- you know, I-I believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So at that point you hadn’t heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Did you sense danger at that point, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Well, I’d -- I tell you when I sense danger, that I know of, right?</span> <span id="s487">Obviously --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: At that -- at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes, I’m talking about that point.</span> <span id="s490">Look, when the soldier came -- you know, the soldiers that I remember, the soldier --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: To the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: -- to the house, and ordered my mother, you know, to pack her --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: -- her -- her clothes, our clothes that we had to leave, you know, that -- you know, that was a -- a -- a grand thing, to watch the burning of the Torahs, and the prayer books and the prayer shawls and so forth, you know, that I witnessed.</span> <span id="s495">I’m sure that was -- the fact that my father [indecipherable] you know, was -- okay.</span> <span id="s496">But I also believe that my parents, being good parents like so many and most good parents, right, kept, you know, what was going on, an-and I don’t know that I could understand.</span> <span id="s497">But I did understand that we were going through some rather a-a-abnormal, you know, obviously, I mean, I had a very calm, quiet, you know, loving family, you know?</span> <span id="s498">What was happening was not something I could understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum collec -- volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s501">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s502">You are now back in your house again, in Kiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s504">Incidentally, I did not spell my bother -- my -- my father’s birthplace.</span> <span id="s505">If you want I can spell that, if it’s important.</span> <span id="s506">Anyway -- oh, we’re back --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: -- in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: -- you were supposed to be going to Poland, but then you -- you did not, you came back to Kiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, they -- they -- they -- wen -- they -- we weren’t going to Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: -- we were forcibly arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: -- forcibly attempted to be deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: -- ported.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: -- and were not deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: -- because the Poles --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: -- closed their border that day to our train.</span> <span id="s521">So, a miracle happened, as several others happened to those who survived.</span> <span id="s522">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s524">But then you said your mother knew that it was time to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Time to leave, yes.</span> <span id="s526">And so she, I’m sure, was very instrumental to convince my father, you know, look, a-as difficult as it is to leave our family and -- and our -- and y-y-you know, our place in Kiel, you know, with family, we have to protect ourselves, we have to protect our children, we have to leave this hellhole.</span> <span id="s527">Because life obviously, in Germany had become a hell for these remaining Jews.</span> <span id="s528">And the future, you know, offered to my parents obviously, nothing but bad and despair.</span> <span id="s529">So my father, who obviously was a very loving father -- I mean son to his father, you know, I’m sure with great pain, you know, this time, left.</span> <span id="s530">And this time without the -- the dream to go to the -- to the dreamland of California and its golden paved streets.</span> <span id="s531">I’m not saying he believed that, but I’m just saying that that was the -- the rosy image I’m sure, that must have prevailed at the time.</span> <span id="s532">Anyway, I mean, something convinced my mother to a-ask my -- her uncle for the visa to exit Germany and obviously my father consented.</span> <span id="s533">And so i -- i -- you know, obviously in 1935, life and its future for a young couple was such that they had decided that they had to uproot.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: But now we’re at 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: So now there is a totally different set mind or -- or -- or mindset, forgive me, of my parents.</span> <span id="s538">Now it’s simply, purely not a matter of choice or -- between degrees, right.</span> <span id="s539">Now it’s a matter of life and death, and they understood that.</span> <span id="s540">So, to protect their children, right, they smuggled -- they paid for being smuggled out of Germany.</span> <span id="s541">They left property behind, their parents, his parents, family, everybody behind to do that.</span> <span id="s542">Now, this is important to demonstrate the character of my parents.</span> <span id="s543">At that time they did everything they could to save their children and they left to protect and to save their children, not to save themselves.</span> <span id="s544">And again we see the same repetition of their actions in August of 1942, and the title of the movie, one movie was, “Into the Arms of Strangers”, they are the absolute example of sending their children into the arms of stranger, of an unknown, to save them.</span> <span id="s545">And if they had not done that we would all have perished in August 1942 when they were arrested and put in concentration camp in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Okay, we-we’ll get to that, let’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Now, I unde-understand, but the things have to tie if they do tie.</span> <span id="s548">And the type of people that my parents were, as other people’s parents were, who attempted to save their children, even at the peril of their own lives is one of the recorded evidence of what happened to people.</span> <span id="s549">At some point some people actually had a choice, and the choice was made to save the children.</span> <span id="s550">And I am one of those.</span> <span id="s551">I am an -- a survivor solely because of that, only because of that.</span> <span id="s552">Only because my parents, right, knew they were helpless, I -- without means to have any other choice.</span> <span id="s553">They knew that others had more choice than they.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And so here are two connect, right, between the events of us smuggle -- smuggling into Belgium to the one that will follow when we’re in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Okay, so you left your house in Kiel?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Right, and we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: And do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: -- smuggled --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: -- do you remember then?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s565">And where did you go in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: We were in the city of Antwerp.</span> <span id="s567">We lived in the city of Antwerp, again in an apartment.</span> <span id="s568">I have vivid mem -- very vivid memory of Antwerp.</span> <span id="s569">I have a memory of my father lecturing me on how I was not learning Hebrew well enough in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s570">I remember that.</span> <span id="s571">I remember he --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: And this was September 1939 that you went to Belgium?</span> <span id="s573">A: I -- I’m not --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s575">Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I can’t -- I can’t say that it was September.</span> <span id="s577">I know that we live in Antwerp for at least six months, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I know that we were forcibly -- had to leave, along with thousands and thousands of other Belg to flee the German bombing.</span> <span id="s580">That was at the beginning of May --</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: -- 1940.</span> <span id="s583">So the only estimation that I -- I -- I -- I have is that I know that my mother said to me, you know, we were in Antwerp about six months.</span> <span id="s584">That’s what I recall, and I could be very wrong.</span> <span id="s585">It --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Did you go to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yeah, I went to -- to -- to Jewish kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yeah, yeah, I did.</span> <span id="s590">And according to my father I wasn’t learning fast enough or well enough.</span> <span id="s591">Oh yeah, yeah, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Do you remember that, him telling you, or not?</span> <span id="s593">A: I -- yeah, oh, I remember him telling me, oh, for sure.</span> <span id="s594">I remember him telling me, scolding me, you know, in whatever way he did it.</span> <span id="s595">I remember more than that, of course.</span> <span id="s596">I remember the songs.</span> <span id="s597">We were learning Jewish songs and I don’t know, whatever it is, I wasn’t learning the alphabet well enough, I wasn’t learning the songs well enough, I -- there was something I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Can you sing one or two lines of a song?</span> <span id="s599">A: No, I -- right now -- it’s something about around -- being around the fireplace or the fire.</span> <span id="s600">It was something around the fire --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: -- or fireplace.</span> <span id="s603">I don’t remember it now [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s604">But anyway that was one [indecipherable] I mean, God, th-there were many others, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s605">In any event, if you want to know my recollection that I have of Antwerp, the -- they’re interesting too.</span> <span id="s606">I remember going to a synagogue with my mother, upstairs right, we were there, I remember that.</span> <span id="s607">I remember one time seeing a funeral in Antwerp and I had never seen such a thing.</span> <span id="s608">And here was this horse draped in black and the whole hearse was black and people were following this hearse in black and I, for some reason, was walking on the street by myself and I saw this, I was fascinated and I remember watching it.</span> <span id="s609">I remember that.</span> <span id="s610">I also remember that we lived upstairs in this apartment in Antwerp and there was one time I was with my father and going downstairs and he didn’t really want me to look at what was there.</span> <span id="s611">There was blood on the walls, and I was curious, I say what di -- what di -- what -- you know, why is there blood in the hall?</span> <span id="s612">And my father, he -- he -- he was fumbling, I think to explain to me that a man living in the building had an accident and he fell down the stairs and you know, obviously he had a bad scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: But anyway, so the struggle of my father trying to protect his son, you know, from a horrible scene, you know, again it underscores, you know, the tremendous humanity, you know, of people even in the worst of circumstances.</span> <span id="s615">Anyway, I remember my mother’s sister, who also had fled from Cologne, she -- they had fled in Mathus and Anver.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Did your -- did your mother ever tell you later why they went to Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: You -- so you don’t know -- was it the resistance that got them out to Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Yo-You don’t know why --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: All right.</span> <span id="s624">All I know is that we were smuggle into Germany -- I mean to Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: -- and that’s what I mean, and we ended up in Anver.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I also know that my mother’s sister and her husband and two of her sons --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: -- they were there in Anver, as well as us.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: And I remember them, ma -- my aunt and uncle and her two sons who were very tall in my eyes, visiting us.</span> <span id="s633">I remember sitting on the lap of my uncle and that I had a real good time with him and that he --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So you were not afraid dur -- as a little boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: -- at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: -- it was just an adventure or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: -- no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s640">My father had become nervous and easy for him to get upset and I remember him scolding me about the way that I was making too much noise eating.</span> <span id="s641">So I -- th-there’s no question that my father was a changed person, in that the events which follow, you know, created more of a change in him, but not towards my mother, not towards his children, but the way he behaved and -- and he would get angry easily, something that -- that was totally strange to me, and so this is part of th-th-the whole episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: When you were in school in Antwerp with the other little Jewish children --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: -- they were just -- you were just playing like little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yeah, nothing to indicate what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Nothing, no, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay, now it’s May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Okay, now, before it -- yeah, it’s May 1940, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: -- and I remember the following.</span> <span id="s652">I remember my aunt and uncle coming to say goodbye to us, okay, and I-I don’t remember if they came upstairs, cause they probably did, but I -- you know, I assume that.</span> <span id="s653">But anyway, I remember them specifically looking down, you know, from the second story, third story of this building that we lived in and looking at them and saying goodbye.</span> <span id="s654">Of course -- I shouldn’t say of course, but that the last that we ever saw of them, the four of them.</span> <span id="s655">And they were leaving and we shortly were also leaving Antwerp, so were others.</span> <span id="s656">And I assume, but I’m not certain that the city had already been bombed, that the bombing had started by the German Air Force.</span> <span id="s657">But in any event I know from later, these people, my aunt and uncle had a young daughter, n -- and not to depart, but at least to -- and that daughter was left with a couple in Holland.</span> <span id="s658">Why -- I don’t know all the circumstances.</span> <span id="s659">My cousin, her name is Adele Mendelssohn, and she is alive, and she is in -- she’s older than me but not by that much.</span> <span id="s660">And she was hidden by this family in Holland, a Christian family in -- who had another girl, right, a daughter, you know.</span> <span id="s661">And they, throughout the war saved my cousin Adele, s-saying publicly that this was th-their second child, you understand, and they raised er -- er -- you know, both children.</span> <span id="s662">She survived the war.</span> <span id="s663">After the war my uncle, Michael Fass, who went in our place when we couldn’t go in 1935 to Oakland to emigrate, then my great-uncle sponsored my -- her brother, my mother’s brother, my Uncle Fass, and they, the whole family emigrated, went to Oakland in our place.</span> <span id="s664">And -- so after the war, when Adele was left er -- as total -- as an orph -- orphan, they -- Uncle Mike sponsored her and they got her to emigrate to Oakland and she lived with them until she married, and -- which I witnessed, and she still lives in Oakland.</span> <span id="s665">Anyway, so she survive in that manner.</span> <span id="s666">And how and why she was separated from her family, I don’t know, I-I only know that she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: And I know that she was raised and saved by this Christian couple in Holland, whom she has honored in many, many ways, including designating them as the righteous -- as Righteous Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Which they deserve.</span> <span id="s671">Anyway, where was I?</span> <span id="s672">Oh yeah, we’re leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Where -- you’re leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Okay, we’re leaving Antwerp, okay.</span> <span id="s675">What I remember is being on the train and I remember hearing bombing, all right, that I didn’t understand, right, but I remember distinctly, you know, as a child.</span> <span id="s676">I am now five and three quarters --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: -- years of age, right, and I remember hearing the bombing.</span> <span id="s679">Then the next thing that I know is we land in the city called Marmande, M-a-r-m-a-n-d-e, we li -- end up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: This is in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: In France.</span> <span id="s682">It’s in the department of Lot-et-Garonne.</span> <span id="s683">It is very close to the Dordogne, to Bergerac.</span> <span id="s684">It is very close to Bordeaux and the wine country, and there’s a very agricultural, beautiful part of France and that I love greatly.</span> <span id="s685">And we end up in a big warehouse, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s686">And I remember we were sleeping on straw, and hundreds --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: This is the four of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yeah, the four of us.</span> <span id="s689">The four of us lan -- and we, among other other other -- maybe a few hundred people who fled with us from Belgium were housed in this warehouse, and sleep there and provided some food, you know, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s690">And by God’s choice, later on, after the war, my mother is able to rent an apartment which is right across the street from this warehouse.</span> <span id="s691">And there’s another coincidence of significance in my history that also happens --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Did you know what was happening as this almost six year old child, what -- what was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Again that sense of danger, that sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: A-And that -- let me tell you, the only thing I can remember, all right, and what follows has significant emotional feelings.</span> <span id="s696">I knew things were wrong.</span> <span id="s697">I knew things were not right.</span> <span id="s698">I knew things that whatever stability was born into this world, and I was, I was in a very stable family and environment, and I thank God -- this was no longer stable.</span> <span id="s699">Of course I didn’t understand the circumstance --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: -- I didn’t understand the enormity of what was happening to us.</span> <span id="s702">But in the bottom line of what was happening to us, must be recorded.</span> <span id="s703">We, along with thousands and thousands of Belg, fled Belgium because of the invasion of the German armies into Holland, into Belgium, and Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s704">They ultimately went back home to their homes and to their businesses and their jobs and so forth and families.</span> <span id="s705">We remained.</span> <span id="s706">We were total and absolute refugees.</span> <span id="s707">We were total stateless people.</span> <span id="s708">We had totally no rights.</span> <span id="s709">We had no property, we had no money, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s710">We had no rights.</span> <span id="s711">And we were able to remain in France only by police authority and permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.</span> <span id="s712">We were living the life of people who have no rights to be, to live, to aspire, to hope, anything.</span> <span id="s713">We were returned to a state where you are now totally dependent on the whim, the laws, the rudity, the -- the -- the anti whatever is, you know, whether -- that existed at France at that time.</span> <span id="s714">Obviously I didn’t understand all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Obviously I didn’t know the history of France, I had no knowledge of why we were even there.</span> <span id="s717">I didn’t understand anything.</span> <span id="s718">But what follows is I began to understand that we were not very stable, that we were not -- and yet, I was stable.</span> <span id="s719">I had a mother and father who were the marvel -- marvel of the world.</span> <span id="s720">And I had a brother, and of course we were the boys and we lived in -- as boys do.</span> <span id="s721">I have two beautiful, magnificent grandsons and I see them growing up and I was no different, you know, in terms of fighting and playing with each other, you know -- you know.</span> <span id="s722">And my brother and I were magnificent as -- as brothers.</span> <span id="s723">So the fact that we had each other and I wasn’t an only child was very important.</span> <span id="s724">The fact that we had such loving, caring and responsible and protective parents was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s725">But the truth of our lives were really terrible.</span> <span id="s726">And so from this warehouse, living on straws, the others left, and I experienced this abandonment again and again in my life.</span> <span id="s727">We remained.</span> <span id="s728">And I don’t know how, but anyway, they allowed us to have an apartment and my father went as a laborer to work for the city of Marmande.</span> <span id="s729">And he was a healthy guy and he was strong and he was able, and -- not that he was very big, he -- I’m sure he was a little bit shorter than me, but about the same height.</span> <span id="s730">And I remember one of the things that he worked on.</span> <span id="s731">And he worked on setting up the -- the -- in the -- in the plaza, a big plaza in -- in Oakland, called the Plaza de Marie, where we later on lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: In Oakland?</span> <span id="s733">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s734">A: No, I mean, not in Oakland.</span> <span id="s735">Did I say Oakland?</span> <span id="s736">No, no, this is in Marmande --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Marmande</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Marmande -- ma -- no, no, this is Marmande, okay.</span> <span id="s739">And he helped to erect, you know, the -- the -- the -- the walls that was -- that were to surround this celebration.</span> <span id="s740">And this celebration was one of the games of the German and the Vichy government.</span> <span id="s741">In this little city of 15,000 people, thereabouts, there was to be a nationalistic event to celebrate how France, right, had a future and France survived and France was in honor in f -- in spite of its defeat, in f -- in spite of its -- that they had cut th-the country in God knows what, the portion.</span> <span id="s742">The Vichy government was, of course, the southern parts of -- of France.</span> <span id="s743">I was then in the Vichy government section of France and Germany had taken say two-thirds a-as far as their dependent state.</span> <span id="s744">And that Vichy government supposedly was an independent part of France, okay.</span> <span id="s745">Under the Vichy government, Vichy is simply because that’s where the -- the government of Marshal Petain was allowed to -- to be.</span> <span id="s746">There’s two parts to this story, neither one of them good, about France.</span> <span id="s747">This prefect, or this government employee came to this city for this national celebration, and what was the purpose of it?</span> <span id="s748">The purpose was to invigorate the people, that their lot, being a defeated people, conquered people now, under the boot of the Germans, whom they hated, right, whom they had fought in two wars, in the 1870 wars and the 1914-18 wars.</span> <span id="s749">France -- French people did not like the Germans, the boche they called them, that’s the hated term, right, equal to the pigs.</span> <span id="s750">Now, the pigs, the boche now were in charge of France, and they had taken two-thirds of France.</span> <span id="s751">They had taken, you know, the big city, Paris in the north and then all the industrial wealth and the coal, and all of the -- the -- in the east, Normandy and -- and -- and -- and th-the glory.</span> <span id="s752">And they left a little southern part, which was agricultural, you know, and wine country and then the Côte d’Azur and then the access to Spain.</span> <span id="s753">Basically a region without power, without economy, other than agricultural, and you know, where th-there was not th-th-the great population, you know, that you have in Paris, and with Lyon and so forth, so forth.</span> <span id="s754">Okay, now, this guy came for one purpose and that purpose was to reinvigorate these people out of the sense of defeat and so forth, and they had this big celebration.</span> <span id="s755">So my father was one of those employed to set this party up, okay.</span> <span id="s756">What followed either preceded this or followed this is the imposition now of French laws, which equaled and in some ca -- exceeded the anti-Semitism of the German laws.</span> <span id="s757">Now, as a lawyer, you know, throughout my history, and the purpose of my giving this testimony is not merely to relate, you know, pain and suffering and death and numbers.</span> <span id="s758">It is to relate the context.</span> <span id="s759">The context, what happened, right, to the Jews of -- of my family, is the persecution, the anti-Semitism, the hate, right, the monstrosity, right, that they created.</span> <span id="s760">The Germans created, right -- these guys fantasized and invented a system of super race and super -- you know the history, you don’t want me to talk, but it is important in my part of the story that now French laws follows and equates, right, in its anti-Semitism and a -- and its limitation on -- on -- on the rights of Jews, and certainly absolutely on the rights of immigrant Jews.</span> <span id="s761">And in France, with a history of anti-Semitism, of Catholicism, of teaching of the hatred of the Jewish people, right.</span> <span id="s762">We were the damned people, the condemned people, even though we were the -- the creators of their religion and supposedly, you know, ours was the-the-their chosen God, you know.</span> <span id="s763">Anyway, the French, not just in the Dreyfus Affair, but had a history of anti-sem -- Semitism and that history, even though it was not, you know, on the surface, it existed in reality.</span> <span id="s764">And I became now a part of that history.</span> <span id="s765">And my history is how these people dealt with all of these formulas, all of these factors that were facing them, the Christian, right, French.</span> <span id="s766">And I now am in this milieu, in this -- and how these people deal with the world as it’s evolving out of their control, and the minimal amount of their choice, or the choices that they make either actively or passively, with regard to people like me, is part of the reflection of their religious education, their family education, right, and their laws.</span> <span id="s767">And the laws of France, to the shame of France, right, went to adopt German anti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to the Germans the right to dictate to the Vichy government what the French police, the French states and the French functionary would do to the Jews, particularly the refugee -- refugee Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s770">This is tape two, side B, and you were telling about after May 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: -- in Marmande --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: -- okay, now --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: -- France.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: -- what I remember is I said is my father working to set up this fête, they call it --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: -- in France.</span> <span id="s778">And I also remember a little thing like I remember walking and smelling the roses.</span> <span id="s779">I remember being fascinated by snails after the rain.</span> <span id="s780">And I remember one lady telling me to go collect snails for her and I did, and so she gave me some money.</span> <span id="s781">And again, an act of kindness that again I wa -- re-repeated later.</span> <span id="s782">Anyway, that’s what I remember basically of Marmande and I remember where that apartment was.</span> <span id="s783">Again it was an upstairs apartment.</span> <span id="s784">I know that it was close to the tomato -- tomato factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Marmande is a city that is famous for its tomato, and the Marmande tomato was very, very famous in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: In fact, on the -- on the streets of Paris where they sell the produce, my brother said that he found, you know, stands that said Marmande tomato, and later on I found out that in the recent years they change the tomato, an -- and anyway -- to accommodate machinery.</span> <span id="s789">But in any event -- yeah -- but anyway, that’s what I remember about Marmande.</span> <span id="s790">But then comes a change.</span> <span id="s791">We are no longer allowed to live in Marmande.</span> <span id="s792">We are now forced to take up residence in the little hamlet outside of Marmande, seven or eight kilometers from Marmande.</span> <span id="s793">And this little hamlet is called Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil.</span> <span id="s794">Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil now is of important development in my memory because then I really understand.</span> <span id="s795">My eyes are open, I really remember, I really see.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: How old are you now?</span> <span id="s797">This is when?</span> <span id="s798">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: This is sometime in the 1940, I mean, or ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: I believe it’s in the 40’s.</span> <span id="s802">I -- I don’t think that we live in Marmande very long, because the city, the police, would not allow us to stay there longer.</span> <span id="s803">I don’t know, but I suspect that because -- and I suspect this because of the fact that I learned when I visited Saint-Pardoux again -- and I’ve done that several times after the war, I learned then that there were several Jewish families in -- that lived around or in the hamlet, around the hamlet.</span> <span id="s804">And I suspect that there was probably a good French choice in that.</span> <span id="s805">I believe that they kicked us out of Marmande to put us in an area where collectively we were separated, but we were separated from the city, but we were easy picking for when they wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: So it was the French that determined where you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: The French.</span> <span id="s810">The French police, the French city hall.</span> <span id="s811">A -- they made --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Ordered you to go to this next --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: -- y -- oh yeah, yeah, and they -- and -- okay.</span> <span id="s814">Now, I forgot one incident in Marmande which is very important in my life, and I have to go back to just this one point.</span> <span id="s815">I remember my father conducting the high holiday services in Marmande.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: So this is fall of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s818">And I remember my father also blowing the Shofar during the service, and I remember the room, th-the -- the -- the -- some parts of the ceremony, you know, that I remember.</span> <span id="s819">He, of course, was a very religious Jew, and a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s820">Anyway, so he conducted the service.</span> <span id="s821">Well, as God would have it, when we were reunited with my mother in November 1944, the city of Marmande allocated to her that apartment, and we lived in that apartment in -- it was i-i-in -- that building was a historic building, it is a historic building and street.</span> <span id="s822">It is a magnificent building, which comes from the Middle Ages, right, and it stands t-today, and it -- it’s beautiful, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: What is the address?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: The address is on a little street that I cannot remember the name of, but it is -- I mean, it’s probably, I think probably the only really historical street of Marmande, right, and I’m sure those buildings were available because they were historical document to the city -- I mean, buildings to the city.</span> <span id="s825">And we lived again on the second story, seemed to live in second story.</span> <span id="s826">And we were given that building.</span> <span id="s827">And that building, I don’t know that it had electricity, and it had dark staircases and entry hall.</span> <span id="s828">The building was made up of mud and wood, you know, an-and -- and wheat -- I mean, and -- and a -- you know, the remains of -- of -- of wheat.</span> <span id="s829">I-In other words, this was the construction.</span> <span id="s830">But it’s beautiful, you know, it’s very authentic, you know, and -- and there are other buildings like that down this little narrow street of Oakland, which they preserved, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Of Marmande.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Of Marmande.</span> <span id="s833">Of Marmande.</span> <span id="s834">It is Marmande, I am not talking about Oakland, I haven’t gotten to Oakland.</span> <span id="s835">But anyway -- and I remember we living in that apartment after.</span> <span id="s836">But anyway -- so, before we go to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, this is what I remember, my father conducting the religious services, and I probably -- it would be a guess, but I would bet you that everybody there is dead, that died, arrested by the French police, turned over to the Nazis all [indecipherable] which raises the other question, the question which is, you know, how can God have abandoned all his people?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: If we were in fact the chosen people, this is what we were chosen for?</span> <span id="s839">So there is legitimate religious dialog which is another of the [indecipherable] in my history.</span> <span id="s840">My -- law is on one s -- hand, family and love and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and the sense of obligation and commitment and protection to the children, of your children, to preserve them.</span> <span id="s841">And now comes this other question of, you know, where is God in all of this?</span> <span id="s842">Where is God we’re in the trenches, right?</span> <span id="s843">Where is God, you know?</span> <span id="s844">What have we done, God, to deserve this ultimate punishment?</span> <span id="s845">We are damned, condemned, hated, despised, you know, abandoned in every sense of the word.</span> <span id="s846">We have no rights, we have no property, everything is taken from us.</span> <span id="s847">God, why?</span> <span id="s848">You chose us according to our religion to be the chosen people.</span> <span id="s849">Did you also choose us to be this ultimate suffer -- and if we have been chosen, right, for that, then my story is the testament that I want to leave to my children, grandchildren an-and generations forever, because if there is a truth here, then there is an equal truth here.</span> <span id="s850">But if there is a lie here, then there is another one, right?</span> <span id="s851">In other words, if there is no God, if there is no religion, obviously then there’s no commitment, there is no covenant, there is no obligation, right, and religion is a farce.</span> <span id="s852">But if there is, why did this happen to us, you know?</span> <span id="s853">And so this is a dialog, a philosophical question which has to be posed, right, and maybe it has no answer, and that’s okay.</span> <span id="s854">Nor is there proof that there is a God.</span> <span id="s855">But the point is, all of these things intersect, intellectually, morally, religiously, philosophically, in my life.</span> <span id="s856">And then what happens?</span> <span id="s857">Okay, anyway, we end up in this village of Saint-Pardoux.</span> <span id="s858">It’s not a village, it’s a hamlet.</span> <span id="s859">The people there are magnificent people.</span> <span id="s860">We are given a habitat and that habitat, and I will call it that, is a mud floor, it is a chicken coop and on the other side there’s the -- the cows, and -- and that’s there whatever it is, I’ve forgotten now.</span> <span id="s861">Okay, and we live in this chicken coop, two rooms, mud, no electricity, of course.</span> <span id="s862">And it had the little well and the little area for a garden that later my father creates.</span> <span id="s863">And this was given to us by the Marshal Feron.</span> <span id="s864">The Marshal Feron lived across the street, this is his property, the -- the property is of his mother across the street, but the cows are hers, right.</span> <span id="s865">And this Marshal Feron is a very devout Catholic.</span> <span id="s866">One of his sons is in the seminary at the time to become a -- a -- a monk.</span> <span id="s867">And we’re given -- we’re loan -- we’re given this place, without, of course, charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Are you speaking French now?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s870">Now, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Are your parents -- are your parents speaking French?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: My parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Unfortunately my father long ago left us.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: No, no, no, I meant at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yes, they are learning French, oh, oh -- oh yeah, at the time.</span> <span id="s877">I’m going to tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: That’s all right --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: -- that’s the -- raises an interesting question.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: -- you’re -- you’re speaking French at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s882">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: To each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No.</span> <span id="s885">My parents speak German to us.</span> <span id="s886">Okay, well, I will tell you about this.</span> <span id="s887">This is another of these anomalies or -- you know.</span> <span id="s888">First, this man and his wife are very, very religious Catholics.</span> <span id="s889">They give us this place to live.</span> <span id="s890">This was the same place they gave to people who escaped Spain in the Spanish war.</span> <span id="s891">And people -- those people fled from there to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil.</span> <span id="s892">Why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s893">They occupied the same place and they left later on back to Spain.</span> <span id="s894">Well now comes, right, this part of history, right, which is connected to the other history, right, to the -- this, and now they’re refugees again.</span> <span id="s895">And so these people again, with their good hearts and their good attitude and their good intention, they lend it to us and they help.</span> <span id="s896">N -- this is part of the Berny, B-e-r-n-y family, and these people, the little street up to -- little bit of a hill from where we lived to where they -- their homes and his -- his -- his shop where he makes the metal horses and the metal -- I mean, the -- the shoe for the horses and he makes hoes and he makes hammers and he makes all these things, this wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s897">And up the street is the school.</span> <span id="s898">And in -- the two room school, and I go to school.</span> <span id="s899">And I -- my first el -- schooling -- wait a minute, hold on a minute.</span> <span id="s900">I also went to school in Marmande for a short time.</span> <span id="s901">I started school in Marmande, yes, the very, very first grade, whatever it is, right, that I am -- I am six years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: -- so the first grade.</span> <span id="s904">Yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s905">Ah -- yeah.</span> <span id="s906">My first day in school was in Marmande, okay?</span> <span id="s907">So we still there October, November, okay, maybe December, but anyway -- but I’m in the school.</span> <span id="s908">And I remember raising my hand in the class to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s909">I needed to go to the bathroom and the teacher didn’t see me, so I pissed in my pants, okay.</span> <span id="s910">I ri -- and maybe she didn’t understand because I didn’t understand, but I remember raising my hand, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s911">I also remember that we were learning a French poem, with -- a very famous poem from La Fountain, I think or -- about the hare and the rabbit, and I remember that in that class.</span> <span id="s912">That’s all I remember in that class.</span> <span id="s913">But anyway, then we go back to my story in the hamlet, in -- in that par -- Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil.</span> <span id="s914">Okay, now, this is a very, very, very interesting and traumatic episode in my life.</span> <span id="s915">The Berny family owned a lot, an empty lot across from the schoolhouse.</span> <span id="s916">And they gave my father the task, the job to raise a garden for them in this lot.</span> <span id="s917">And I remember going up to him and bringing him lunch, and I remember him kissing me.</span> <span id="s918">He was all sweaty and had beard and all of that.</span> <span id="s919">Oh, that re -- that reminds me.</span> <span id="s920">I remember also the city of Marmande had given us a garden.</span> <span id="s921">A place where we co -- where each family could have its own little garden and cultivate their own vegetable.</span> <span id="s922">I remember that now.</span> <span id="s923">So maybe we were in Marmande maybe a little bit longer, you know.</span> <span id="s924">But anyway, I remember that and there is a connect to that one.</span> <span id="s925">Gee, I didn’t remember that in awhile.</span> <span id="s926">Okay, anyway, he was there.</span> <span id="s927">Okay, now I went to that school, and I remember learning to count with sticks, and so we had sticks, packs of 10, right, and we had a rubber band around them an-and that -- we learned to count there.</span> <span id="s928">Okay, I remember that, but I also remember something else that was not so nice.</span> <span id="s929">I remember the other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the fence and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or whatever it is, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it in her book, and I am sure this happened.</span> <span id="s930">That’s why she reported it in her book.</span> <span id="s931">That in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of attitudes of people.</span> <span id="s932">Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to survive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they did.</span> <span id="s933">And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to me, target me as a Christ killer.</span> <span id="s934">And obviously they didn’t come up on this on their own.</span> <span id="s935">Obviously this was taught to them.</span> <span id="s936">Obviously this underlines what was happening and the crimes of the Catholic church are now descended on me.</span> <span id="s937">And they descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French police, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying around that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn’t exercise it to save my father’s life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief of police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right?</span> <span id="s938">Gerard Guyaux, a man of extremely great kindness and character.</span> <span id="s939">This man, at -- one of the times I went back to France, and this time to reward him for what he did for my mother, my father’s memory and for us.</span> <span id="s940">I gave him a plaque as I gave to others.</span> <span id="s941">And this man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there’s nothing they can do to me any more, I’m too old, but I could have saved your father’s life.</span> <span id="s942">And if you blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don’t think -- among the many, many shocks that I’ve had in life, this was one.</span> <span id="s943">And he -- and he explained to me why.</span> <span id="s944">He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in the arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of Marmande, and Saint-Pardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the space -- the jurisdictional surrounding of Marmande, under its jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s945">He said, I could have saved him, but I didn’t know that the police, the chief of police, was of the same mind as I, that we didn’t want this killing of innocent Jews.</span> <span id="s946">We didn’t want to make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews.</span> <span id="s947">But I didn’t know that, and he didn’t know I could trust him, and I didn’t know I could trust him.</span> <span id="s948">And so when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested, obviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of Kiel and of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Kiel?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I mean of -- of -- of Marmande.</span> <span id="s951">I am sure that the things that he did for my mother after the war and for my brother and I was to repent and to atone for what he had done.</span> <span id="s952">I’m telling you, my father’s name stands on the war memorial of -- of Marmande.</span> <span id="s953">My father’s name also is in another memorial farther in France, I don’t know where [indecipherable], course he is in there and the memorial to the Jews that were deported from France, which is in Paris, that they have built in recent years.</span> <span id="s954">But the one in Marmande is the one that means something.</span> <span id="s955">He became the major of the city of Marmande.</span> <span id="s956">He became the representative from that region to the assem -- French assembly.</span> <span id="s957">He was a -- a man of tremendous personality and character, and again, a very religious man, a very French man.</span> <span id="s958">And again, they -- this interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what they feel, what they do, and what they -- and who they are, all right?</span> <span id="s959">It -- it plays into this whole -- you know?</span> <span id="s960">And what follows again is this conflict, between others who are obeying orders, others who are willingly passive, others who are willingly complicit and others who are morally -- a-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel impotent to do anything.</span> <span id="s961">And so all of these people, I meet all of them.</span> <span id="s962">So, when I’m in school I’m treated well by the teacher and a -- you know, I’m allowed in school, and I’m just a normal kid.</span> <span id="s963">But the kids in the playground, I’m not the normal kid, I’m a Jew, dirty Jew, right?</span> <span id="s964">The Berny family, one of their son is the guy who is the vicar to the church.</span> <span id="s965">The church is -- in this hamlet there is a very prominent church, a very beautiful church [indecipherable] in the Marshal Feron, right, and the rest of it are farms, and this is a very, you know, beautiful, other than the school.</span> <span id="s966">Anyway, I remember many things.</span> <span id="s967">And one time I went back and the son of Berny, right, who had quit the monastery, you know, when I met him, I did -- you know, when the -- you know.</span> <span id="s968">So he didn’t become a full fledged priest or monk, or you know.</span> <span id="s969">He chose not to.</span> <span id="s970">So when we revisited one time, my wife and I, the first time we went there, I took my children, and I couldn’t enter the building, that chicken coop, it was locked and there was nobody around, you know.</span> <span id="s971">But another time we came back and they were there, the Bernys.</span> <span id="s972">And so they -- he took me around.</span> <span id="s973">And he said to me, you were an extraordinary child.</span> <span id="s974">He says, you learned the patois, which is the local French.</span> <span id="s975">You learned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody.</span> <span id="s976">And he says, you used to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know.</span> <span id="s977">He says, I was amazed that you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I understood my parents who spoke German.</span> <span id="s978">And they were learning, you know, French too.</span> <span id="s979">And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of people, you know, a-as a child that I was liked.</span> <span id="s980">But above all, my brother was liked more.</span> <span id="s981">You know, he was a very loving and the second child in family, or the second boy in the family, they’re always innocent, they’re always sweet, right?</span> <span id="s982">And so he was.</span> <span id="s983">Now, for some reason my mother, to help us in our survival, got a sewing machine and she started to sew.</span> <span id="s984">And because of the hard work of my father, you know, toiling in -- in other people’s jardin -- gardens, my mother started to do seamstress work.</span> <span id="s985">And because of that she was able to survive, through that skill.</span> <span id="s986">Now, the life for us in -- in Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil is a very interesting -- it’s very pastoral, it’s very country, it’s a little hamlet.</span> <span id="s987">Everything -- you walk.</span> <span id="s988">If there is any transportation it is by either camp -- two cows pulling a wagon, or one horse pulling a wagon.</span> <span id="s989">I remember many men many times -- my mother would send me to this farm to buy some milk or to send me someplace to get bread and you had to go there, walk there.</span> <span id="s990">And once in awhile, you know, people would give me rides, you know, on these wagon.</span> <span id="s991">I remember everybody was so nice, they would give you a ride, you know.</span> <span id="s992">And I remember walking on this little street and they grew watercress, and that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s993">I remember.</span> <span id="s994">But anyway -- and my father cultivated a garden and -- in our -- in our -- in the side yard.</span> <span id="s995">And I remember that he used human excrement as part of the fertilizer, and we were together.</span> <span id="s996">And a lot of it was happy, and some of it -- I remember my father getting mad at me and yelling at me, and my mother protecting me and I was running around my mother’s skirts, and holding onto her skirt when he was yelling at me and my mother was yelling back at my father to shut up and whatever.</span> <span id="s997">Anyway, here comes June, July, 1942.</span> <span id="s998">I am just eight years old, and I am now condemned to become an adult.</span> <span id="s999">My parents decide, through some Jewish agency, whatever, to send us to a summer camp.</span> <span id="s1000">And we leave Marmande, Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil.</span> <span id="s1001">I remember the railroad station, my parents bringing us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1002">I remember the last look I had of my father ever, there waiting on the quay, or the -- what we call -- what do we call?</span> <span id="s1003">Well, whatever we call now, with my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: The platform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: -- wa -- platform, right, waving us goodbye and I remember waving them goodbye, of course never thinking that anything was in the offing.</span> <span id="s1006">But that’s the last time we ever saw our father.</span> <span id="s1007">I was just eight years old, my brother was less than six years old.</span> <span id="s1008">And on this train we went, and I believe we went to a summer camp in the Creuse.</span> <span id="s1009">The Creuse is the C-r-e-u-s-e of southwest France.</span> <span id="s1010">And we are in this summer camp, operated by some Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1011">It could be the OSE, okay, I am not certain, but I believe that it -- it is them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s1014">This is tape number three, side A, and you were talking about going to the summer camp in the s -- 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1016">Now, we’re in this camp with Jewish children, run by Jewish adult leaders and -- and everything is wonderful and normal and so forth, as far as a child is concerned.</span> <span id="s1017">It’s play, it’s hiking, it’s -- it’s everything, it’s games.</span> <span id="s1018">Suddenly there is a day that I can never forget.</span> <span id="s1019">I’m brought in with my brother to the office of Mr. Kohn.</span> <span id="s1020">I only know his name by the fact that I have four of the letters of my father of what prompted that particular meeting.</span> <span id="s1021">And this Mr. Kohn says to me and my brother that our parents want us to stay with them.</span> <span id="s1022">And I then develop terror.</span> <span id="s1023">I don’t think there is any other word to describe what I felt then.</span> <span id="s1024">I saw out of the window that other children were leaving with their baggage, whatever th-they ha -- they had and here is me and my brother in this dark office and this man at this desk telling me that my parents don’t want us to go home, that they want us to stay.</span> <span id="s1025">And I have a brother who is not even six years old.</span> <span id="s1026">I am just eight years old, and I am now put in a position that I have to understand, or cope and deal with the idea that somehow our parents don’t want us to come home, but other children are going home to their parents.</span> <span id="s1027">I am not going.</span> <span id="s1028">That’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1029">There is no way you can explain my absolute connect.</span> <span id="s1030">This is the first time I’d ever left my parents, ever, and they -- they send me on the summer camp with other children, to play and have fun.</span> <span id="s1031">That’s -- okay?</span> <span id="s1032">Other children were there to play and to f -- have fun, too.</span> <span id="s1033">But that they should go home to their parent, and I -- they want us to stay?</span> <span id="s1034">That is a moment of absolute terror.</span> <span id="s1035">Total incomprehension.</span> <span id="s1036">Th-There is nothing that can describe it, nothing that can describe my feeling at that moment.</span> <span id="s1037">I am paralyzed, I am horrified, I am scared, I cannot comprehend.</span> <span id="s1038">This is one moment in my life where nothing makes any sense.</span> <span id="s1039">And believe me, that has impacted my life forever.</span> <span id="s1040">That moment.</span> <span id="s1041">That revelation.</span> <span id="s1042">And of course I had no understanding what, why, but the total incomprehension.</span> <span id="s1043">I mean how could my parents, you understand, make this judgment?</span> <span id="s1044">They -- it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1045">Anyway, I remember being there, and from that moment, for the next two and a half years, I became the guardian of my brother.</span> <span id="s1046">And I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment, because I was afraid of what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1047">If he was separated they may take him away from me, an-and no way.</span> <span id="s1048">So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a period of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but that became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they suggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should be separated from me.</span> <span id="s1049">So these other children went home, and a few children stayed.</span> <span id="s1050">And we stayed with these, some of the Jewish -- for lack of another term, I mean they were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this camp.</span> <span id="s1051">Now, they then proceeded on a plan, and the plan I can only describe is a plan of survival of our people.</span> <span id="s1052">They put us through the ritual of every holiday, we had to observe them absolutely.</span> <span id="s1053">We had to put handkerchiefs on our wrist on Shabbas, we had to observe every holiday religiously.</span> <span id="s1054">I remember the last one we observed was Sukkoth.</span> <span id="s1055">I -- i-i-in that place in -- in -- in -- one of them had drawn a map of -- of Israel -- Palestine on -- on a -- a thing with a light bulb behind it, and this was in blue, th-the -- the whole region.</span> <span id="s1056">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s1057">I remember games being played, you know, then they would toss us in -- in blankets, you understand, I mean, we were little kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: How many children were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I don’t remember, but there were very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Very few?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: And you’re still in the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: It’s not a camp in the sense -- I -- it’s fenced.</span> <span id="s1064">It’s on a little, you know, a little country house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: -- you know, it’s a country house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Okay, and I have pictures after the fact, a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: But in this camp I have the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of impending doom.</span> <span id="s1071">That they were teaching us only about Judaism, only about our religion, only about the Promised Land, only about the -- I remember that.</span> <span id="s1072">And I have the absolute conviction that these people were trying to preserve our religion and our people in th -- whatever means they had, and that -- in the hope that some of us would survive.</span> <span id="s1073">Now, I remember several incidents, but let me tell you one.</span> <span id="s1074">And this incident is recalled by another child, not necessarily in the same place, but the same event happened to him.</span> <span id="s1075">And of course I don’t know him, and I didn't know, but in the French book that was written by this French historian of the Jews, what happened, the Jews in the Lot-et-Garonne of France that she researched, among the many people she interviewed, she interviewed another survivor who told her the very same story.</span> <span id="s1076">And I don’t know him, he doesn’t know me.</span> <span id="s1077">But the story basically is this.</span> <span id="s1078">I remember that those people change our names.</span> <span id="s1079">And so my name was changed from Lakritz to LaCroix.</span> <span id="s1080">LaCroix means the cross.</span> <span id="s1081">It’s a very French name.</span> <span id="s1082">And one day they told me, and the other children too, we’re going to have these people visiting and they’re going to ask you some questions, and when they do, when they ask for your name, make sure, don’t forget, give them your new name of LaCroix.</span> <span id="s1083">So now I am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are people coming to interrogate us.</span> <span id="s1084">And so sure enough these people came.</span> <span id="s1085">I remember a woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I remember the woman, she talked to me.</span> <span id="s1086">And I told this story to the French historian, among many stories that I told her -- not many, but anyway -- and she reported that story in her book, right.</span> <span id="s1087">And she gives credit to someone else telling her the same story, some guy who now lives in -- in San Diego, and who also had the same kind of -- the same people.</span> <span id="s1088">Well, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Quaker, where they tried to save some of the children from France and to ship them to England or America, and I remember that afterwards, you understand, we understood that these people were there to try to save us an-and ship us by -- by ship, but that became too dangerous and we could not leave.</span> <span id="s1089">But I also remember that by that time I was a bed wetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me to stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn’t allow me to change my bed, and so every night I had to sleep in a bed that was full of, to put it in plain vernacular, piss, right.</span> <span id="s1090">Smelled like hell.</span> <span id="s1091">A-And that was my punishment, my sort of -- they’re trying to teach me not to do it.</span> <span id="s1092">Now, I’m sure e-everybody that has any education about children understand what I didn’t know, is that I was so traumatized, I was so terrorized, I was in such pain, right, that that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s1093">And obviously no child should be treated this way.</span> <span id="s1094">But of course it was not their doing, obviously they were saving us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive and -- and continue our people.</span> <span id="s1095">To that extent, they succeeded.</span> <span id="s1096">These were heroes.</span> <span id="s1097">I owe them everything.</span> <span id="s1098">Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me also, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my life wouldn’t be what it is or could have been if it wasn’t for my parents, and if it wasn’t for them and if it wasn’t for Christians that [indecipherable] follow my story.</span> <span id="s1099">Numerous human beings who behaved at the risk of their lives and their liberties.</span> <span id="s1100">And this is no speech, this is a fact.</span> <span id="s1101">Anyway, from the Creuse, from that -- we went to another place and when I saw a few years ago a movie called, “The Children of Chabanne”, I said, I remember that place.</span> <span id="s1102">I was there.</span> <span id="s1103">I was one of the children that was sheltered in that chateau of the French journalist and these two, also all Christian teachers who sheltered Jewish children, orphan children, who had to fight off, you know, th-the -- the police who wanted or were curious, who -- wh-what are you doing with these children?</span> <span id="s1104">What did -- where’d they come from?</span> <span id="s1105">And of course if they were Jewish children they were to be arrested and turned over to the French police who would then turn them over to the -- to the Nazi.</span> <span id="s1106">And I remember one night we were told that we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1107">This --</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Now up to that point, did you have any correspondence with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: All right, let me just tell you this.</span> <span id="s1110">This photo that I have of my brother and I with beret and wooden shoes, I believe was taken while I was at Chabanne.</span> <span id="s1111">I know I was -- I had a problem with the dentist, I had pain and so I was taken to a dentist.</span> <span id="s1112">I know this photograph was taken.</span> <span id="s1113">This photograph was mailed to my mother, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Yeah, but did you get any letters from your parents while you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, not that I’m aware of, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Y-You never -- you never heard anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: None, no, I never -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: -- once you went away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: -- I never heard anything, but my mother did hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: And she -- this picture of this little boy was shipped to her.</span> <span id="s1122">This picture of both of her boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Yeah, this is an audio tape, so it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yeah, yeah, but I -- I understand, but I mean, I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: I intend to leave this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: You have pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: -- I intend to leave this particular book that I created --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: -- so far, all right, in the documents of this museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: And she got these photographs.</span> <span id="s1133">And so there were one, two, three, four photographs that were mailed to her by this Jewish organization --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: -- I believe it’s OSE, of the different camps where we were hidden --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: -- from place to place.</span> <span id="s1138">They weren’t camps, they were homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Okay, and they were -- so one place was the Chabanne, and I absolutely believe that, and these other places were again in the Creuse and then later were in the [indecipherable] and then we shipped then to the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s1141">So from the Switz -- the border with Switzerland there -- they -- they sent us there in an attempt to get -- to smuggle us into Switzerland and that didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1142">And then they shipped us down to Lourdes where thousands and thousands of French war orphans were there, and that’s located near the border with Spain and so they sent us there for sure, to put us among this great mass of orphan children that we would be saved in that process.</span> <span id="s1143">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Now how of -- y-you obviously went by train all -- to all these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">So the time -- I left off a moment ago was, we’re in Chabanne okay, it’s a night and they suddenly now get the notion they have to evacuate the children, and that’s part of the movie, you understand.</span> <span id="s1147">Well finally they goi -- the police is going to arrest everybody and we are smuggled out, right, into -- I go to a train and God knows where is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: With your brother.</span> <span id="s1149">You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: With my brother, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: You were always with your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: -- hysterical with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1155">And we go to another place, right, again with Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1156">And among these pictures that I have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: -- right, are pictures of other children and it’s a matter of judging from picture to picture which w -- you know, how old I am.</span> <span id="s1159">But in one picture, my brother and I are -- are the youngest.</span> <span id="s1160">In another picture we are also the group of youngest --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: -- children there and then the oldest are older children.</span> <span id="s1163">And again we are -- right.</span> <span id="s1164">And we then spend two and a half years moving from place to place with other Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1165">Of course, i-i-in a -- a house in -- however strange that may be, we don’t go to school, we don’t do anything, we just play.</span> <span id="s1166">And people are watching us, feeding us, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Are you with the same group of children all the way through, or do you meet new children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No, I’m sure that we -- we are basically with some of the same children, yeah.</span> <span id="s1169">And -- because I absolutely remember when I look at the picture, I remember some of these people, and I remember them, they are in this picture, and they are in this picture.</span> <span id="s1170">So, it’s the same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1172">Were these children also from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I-I don’t know where they’re from.</span> <span id="s1174">I mean, they could be -- you know, th -- in France at that time, from what I understand of the research that’s done, I mean, you had refugees from all over --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: -- you know, I mean Czechoslovakia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: -- and Italy -- I mean, not -- no Italy, but Germany, Austria and so forth, Russia even, you know.</span> <span id="s1179">I -- I don’t know whats -- I mean, I’m a child, they are all children, right, they all speak French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Do you remember talking to them about your ex-experience and missing your parents?</span> <span id="s1181">Was -- did you sit around and talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1183">No, we -- we talked about playing, we had different forms of play, we had no toys, we had no education, we had no teaching of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Could you read and write by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, no, absolutely not, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I-I didn’t have any schooling other than what I briefly described, you know, a very short time -- very, very short time in Marmande when I was in first grade, then the f-first grade and beginning of second grade, or the second grade --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: -- you know in th -- in that little schoolhouse in Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, and then no education --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: -- until I am returned to Marmande, you know, and then I enter school, and I -- I don’t have very much schooling after that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1194">Now, I don’t know what you exactly want, but let -- let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Well, you said you were -- you moved around for two years, two -- two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Two and a half years, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Two and a half years.</span> <span id="s1198">Nineteen -- summer of ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: From the summer of ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: -- to the summer -- fall of ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: As to -- no, no, no, to the -- to the -- probably November 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: ’44, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1204">Okay.</span> <span id="s1205">Now, let me now say for the record why my parents abandoned us into the arms of strangers.</span> <span id="s1206">I have four letters, signed by my mother and father, which were saved by my Great-Uncle Max in Oakland and his daughter gave them to me when she learned that I was collecting whatever I could collect about my history, my family, my -- now these four letters are written by my father.</span> <span id="s1207">Two of them I think written to the director of the camp, and one of them is dated August 30, 1942, it’s written in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: So I don’t know every word, or everything he said, okay.</span> <span id="s1210">These, among other documents, and I have many of them, will have to be translated.</span> <span id="s1211">I have not had them translated, but they basically describe, in this letter to Mr. Kohn about us, my brother and I, about my uncle in Oakland.</span> <span id="s1212">My father sends this camp director 50 francs for our care.</span> <span id="s1213">Obviously he asks them to save us.</span> <span id="s1214">I don’t know if he says why, I don’t know what he says, cause I don’t know, it’s all German.</span> <span id="s1215">But I know what I didn’t know, and I know now what I didn’t know 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s1216">And what I know is the following; that the French government on orders of Vichy had established under French law, certain conditions for arrest of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: With a preference of arrest of refugee Jews.</span> <span id="s1219">And they made various choices, some totally idiotic, you know, doesn’t make any sense, but -- so some people were allowed to keep children, and others were -- the children were to be arrested with their parents and sent to this camp in Casanuri.</span> <span id="s1220">Casanuri was in the department of Lot-et-Garonne.</span> <span id="s1221">And shortly after my father and mother sent these letters to the camp director and to my uncle, great-uncle in Oakland, they were arrested by the French police, the both of them were put in this camp at Casanuri.</span> <span id="s1222">And among the idiosyncrasies of the French, one of the exceptions that they made for th-the incarcerated Jews was that if a woman was pregnant, they would release the couple.</span> <span id="s1223">So my mother, in her usual good sense and courage, told them she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1224">So she was examined by the doctor and the nurses and the doctor and nurses said she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1225">The book researched by this wonderful Christian writer of the history of the Jews -- and I came at the tail end of her research.</span> <span id="s1226">I came just before the publication.</span> <span id="s1227">So obviously she didn't record this from my say-so.</span> <span id="s1228">She had recorded all of this.</span> <span id="s1229">Her name is Marie-Juliette Vielcazat Petitcol.</span> <span id="s1230">Her book is, Terre de -- d’Exile, Terre d’Asile.</span> <span id="s1231">It was pe -- published in 2006 and she -- she was telling me she was finishing and the books was going to get printed.</span> <span id="s1232">Among the many things that she had discovered, well before me, was where my parents were incarcerated in a ca -- I didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s1233">And when I told her I don’t know where they were, she said, but I know.</span> <span id="s1234">And I said, this is what I know happened in the camp, cause my mother told me.</span> <span id="s1235">You know, she feigned to be pregnant and that th-the doctor of the camp and the nurse said the -- they confirmed that, even though she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1236">And as a result, my parents were allowed out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1237">I’m going to tell you a historical fact, that if we had been with my parents in Casanuri at the time they were arrested, we would all be dead, because the French categorization of who is going to be shipped in to Drancy and then to -- to Auschwitz, at the time, in 1942, and then th-the enormous amount of Jews who were, and were shipped, th-they were all wiped out.</span> <span id="s1238">They were all killed in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1239">The only thing that saved us was these two events.</span> <span id="s1240">The fact that my parents, right, decided that we should not come home, and that strangers had a better chance to save us than they did, cause they were helpless.</span> <span id="s1241">And then comes this other story, that my mother, you know, tells this story to the doctor, and the doctor says, yes, you are pregnant, confirmed that.</span> <span id="s1242">And this fine human being with these fine nurses -- they are named in here, in this book.</span> <span id="s1243">And you know, if I said it privately to you before the start, or I said it otherwise, I think I have come to a time where almost every important event in the history of the persecution of my family, and I’m talking about my immediate family, that I have gotten the evidence.</span> <span id="s1244">And you will hear, as we go along that that history goes to today.</span> <span id="s1245">That there is a memorial now in Kiel, Germany, where there was no memorial, only because of me.</span> <span id="s1246">Because when I visited Germany, I asked them, you know, I -- the only memorial that you have that remains, of the presence, and the persecution of Jews in Kiel is a little marker on the side of the curb of the street where the synagogue was burned, the main synagogue of Kiel.</span> <span id="s1247">Other than that they had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the -- the whole Holocaust, nothing.</span> <span id="s1248">So when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it.</span> <span id="s1249">I will pay, you know, if you make a memorial.</span> <span id="s1250">And what that memorial should consist of -- I understood the environment -- I said, it is a plaque like you did for the Temple, except with the plaque, plant a living tree.</span> <span id="s1251">And I want you to know that the governor of the state wrote to me in 2005 -- I went there in 2000 -- and they have such a memorial and a living tree.</span> <span id="s1252">And two of my cousins were invited to come to the inauguration, and the one who is the vice president of the Weizmann Institute, the son of the Eichmann survivor, is the one who spoke, right.</span> <span id="s1253">And again, in the -- in the -- in the stories that were published, again it’s of my family, right, and all of it tracing to the -- my grandfather and th-the -- the photos of the ceremony, of the monument on the back of -- of the -- one of the buildings, the synagogue of my grandfather, and here is also in one of the other newspapers, several of them, you know, were sent to me, is this Christian couple.</span> <span id="s1254">And this Christian couple is the reasons we were invited to Kiel.</span> <span id="s1255">They are the ones who sa -- researched the documents for me in Kiel, other than what I obtained on my own.</span> <span id="s1256">They are another evidence of the -- th-the -- the goodness and -- and the fact that people do care, and they care immensely, because they -- they suggested to the city that they should honor those Jews who survived and who were born in the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s1257">So they invited my surviving cousins -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s1259">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1260">When you were ch -- those two and a ha -- two years, two and a half years you were with your brother, alone with him, did you talk about your parents a lot?</span> <span id="s1261">You said you had no communication in the beginning even, from your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Okay, there are many things I remember about that period.</span> <span id="s1263">It’s difficult for me to recall any particular conversation I had with my brother.</span> <span id="s1264">It is not difficult for me to recall a number of events that I remember very specifically.</span> <span id="s1265">The one thing I expressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession and fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me.</span> <span id="s1266">I mean, this was an absolute fear.</span> <span id="s1267">And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and explained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right, without any comprehension or explanation by anybody.</span> <span id="s1268">So now what happens in this episode to my brother and I for two and a half years is that we are in the company of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries.</span> <span id="s1269">Some are older, right, many years older, cause we’re very little, and some of them are about our age, and we play and -- and -- and do things like little children.</span> <span id="s1270">One of the frightful memories that I remember is my wife and I went for two weeks to a place in -- in the south -- I mean in the west -- I mean the east part of France call -- a city called Anisy.</span> <span id="s1271">We went there to attend a French school provided to foreigners and we thought that would be really fun for her and I to go to French school, and she would learn a little French.</span> <span id="s1272">In the meantime we have two weeks of vacation.</span> <span id="s1273">And during that two week period, one day -- I mean, every weekend I would take her and we would go around.</span> <span id="s1274">And one of the points that I tried to find, I tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in the upper plateau of a big city called Evian, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake Geneva.</span> <span id="s1275">And so one of them was this big house in -- in -- which is in one of the pictures, and I wanted to find this place.</span> <span id="s1276">Now anyway, so one of those weekends we went someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find lodging, we had no reservation, so she offered us a room in -- in her big house, whatever it was, a hostel and so on.</span> <span id="s1277">And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this place and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant of the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that occurred there and the -- the Jews.</span> <span id="s1278">And so we went to her place, and she showed us the room, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1279">Anyway, so we didn’t want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1280">But as we walked out, there was a queue -- a line of little children going to dinner, I guess, or coming from dinner, I don’t remember exactly, my wife will remember.</span> <span id="s1281">And I was absolutely thrown back to that time when this reminded me about me, about me and the other children, that this is how we were, we went on line, everything, everything we did was in part of the others and that we had little pajamas in this little house and I guess they were going to bed.</span> <span id="s1282">I guess that’s where they were.</span> <span id="s1283">And I -- it was one of those moments where you’re taken back to this memory.</span> <span id="s1284">Anyway, these were times where we had the company of other children.</span> <span id="s1285">Other children who were in the same boat as we were, and we knew we were in danger.</span> <span id="s1286">We knew that we weren’t allowed to go out and play, we were not allowed to do anything in the exterior, everything was done in the interior.</span> <span id="s1287">In the Ault Sevoir we did something on the exterior, there yes.</span> <span id="s1288">We went on hikes like in this one picture.</span> <span id="s1289">I remember going in forests, I loved hiking, I loved forests, I loved nature.</span> <span id="s1290">I remember those things.</span> <span id="s1291">Then they sent us to Lourdes.</span> <span id="s1292">Lourdes is, of course, the home of the historic religious event of Bernadette and there at first we were all together, placed in the pensionne and next to this pensionne were lodged these German Luftwaffe pilots.</span> <span id="s1293">And we knew they were our enemy.</span> <span id="s1294">And so I remember one day we had a snowball fight with these pilots.</span> <span id="s1295">And I remember putting rocks, and the other boys did too, rocks in the middle of our snowball and sending them, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">We knew these were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1299">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Had you heard of a man by the name of Hitler by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: You still hadn’t heard?</span> <span id="s1303">A: No, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1304">I don’t know what I heard, okay.</span> <span id="s1305">All I know is that these Germans were our enemies, the German -- now in -- in the town of Lourdes, it was easy, okay, it was very easy.</span> <span id="s1306">In the town of Lourdes the Germans were in total control of the town, okay.</span> <span id="s1307">You couldn't walk, you understand, they had barriers, barbed wire with guards, you know, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1308">Crisscrossed so that nobody, you know, bicycle, on foot or anything could not -- you couldn’t go walk straight, I mean, you know, you had to go through their security, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Is your name still Alfred LaCroix?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No -- yeah, oh then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1313">Oh, oh, oh, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: You’re still Alfred LaCroix?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Oh, I’m Alfred LaCroix, my brother is Herbert LaCroix --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Herbert LaCroix.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: -- oh yeah, yeah, oh that -- yes.</span> <span id="s1318">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Did he talk -- did your brother talk about your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: I -- I tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: -- at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: -- ve-very honestly, you know …you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: I know you both were very young.</span> <span id="s1324">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: It -- it is not just that we were very young, it’s that …I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1326">I am not sure how we supported one another.</span> <span id="s1327">I don’t know how we survived.</span> <span id="s1328">I don’t know how we coped.</span> <span id="s1329">I don’t have any idea really, to understand, you know.</span> <span id="s1330">The only thing that allowed us to survive is the fact that there were other children around who were in similar circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Similar circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: -- as us.</span> <span id="s1333">And -- and so in that sense, you know, the will to survive is very strong, obviously in everybody.</span> <span id="s1334">Also to be normal children, to play like -- I mean, we were looking for the four leaf clover, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1335">We -- we played all kinds of game with the -- with the string --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: -- on our finger.</span> <span id="s1338">That was our toy, you know, I mean this was a toy that we used every day, cause that’s the only toys we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Did the same staff people stay with you at the different places, or were there different staffs at different places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: In other words, the adult world changed at each new place?</span> <span id="s1342">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1345">The children remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Yeah, but the adult --</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: In the main, the children remained.</span> <span id="s1348">In the main.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: And -- but some of the older children also remained, and -- and some of them, I mean I -- I see their faces --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- in these photographs, okay.</span> <span id="s1353">But some of the others absolutely did not stay with us, or we with them.</span> <span id="s1354">What happened to them I -- I have absolutely no knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1356">Well, now you’re in Lourdes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Now I’m in Lourdes.</span> <span id="s1358">So I know that first we were in this ma -- in this pensionne, right next to the Luftwaffe office.</span> <span id="s1359">So then we are moved into a hotel.</span> <span id="s1360">The hotel is built around th -- tourism, and all their hotels everywhere.</span> <span id="s1361">By the hundreds of thousands they have rooms, you know.</span> <span id="s1362">Th-They all cater to the -- to the Catholic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: -- you know, who come to pray for cures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: The Pope, John Paul the second, he went there for a cure.</span> <span id="s1367">And so have there -- by -- for over 150 years have they gone there, for sure.</span> <span id="s1368">Now after, in the hotel -- up to then we’re together, and then they move my brother.</span> <span id="s1369">So now I -- I [indecipherable] okay, I cry, I scream, I -- God knows what I did.</span> <span id="s1370">Anyway, but they assure me that I will see him and I will be with him and that I shouldn’t worry, that he is going to be fine and I’m going to be fine, but they have to separate us.</span> <span id="s1371">And I am certain that they separated us because there was a danger, because our French maybe wasn’t perfect, and he was younger, and he was innocent and he could speak up and give his real name and identity and then be discovered, then we both die.</span> <span id="s1372">So I think they separated us there.</span> <span id="s1373">In other place before that we were all with Jewish children, so it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1374">But there it matter, because we were hidden with all of these orphan Christian children, by the thousands, you understand.</span> <span id="s1375">And I’m sure that it was an act of preservation, to protect us.</span> <span id="s1376">So they put him in this place and they put me in the convent, and I was in the convent on the grounds of the Basilica of Lourdes.</span> <span id="s1377">The [indecipherable] magnifique and I was, I believe, the only child that was hid -- Jewish child hidden by these nuns on that -- in that convent.</span> <span id="s1378">Now, it’s really not a convent.</span> <span id="s1379">What it really is, is a hospice.</span> <span id="s1380">And it is the place where this order of nun take care of the medically invalid visitors to the city of Lourdes and they come there and these nuns are nurses and they nurse these people during their stay, right, which is provided for free, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1381">And now comes the war, there’s no travel, right, nobody can move, and now they have nothing to do and these children are being brought in, you know, by the government.</span> <span id="s1382">Rounded up from France and -- and brought into the city cause it’s -- they’ve got the road, they got the hotels unoccupied.</span> <span id="s1383">The state takes over all of those hotels, and they offered, obviously, to shelter some children.</span> <span id="s1384">Incidentally, I want to go back to tell you one part of the story.</span> <span id="s1385">Among -- and I haven’t -- I haven’t come to the further development of what happened to my mother and father, but one thing has to be said, is that my parents were totally, completely trapped.</span> <span id="s1386">They had no means, no right, no power to move.</span> <span id="s1387">They had no papers, and police, French police would stop people, you know, for identification and you know, identity card, you know, with photograph.</span> <span id="s1388">I mean, there’s no way you could move.</span> <span id="s1389">So my mother one time told me about that they had to go somewhere, all right, even at the risk of their lives, but it was that important.</span> <span id="s1390">What it was, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1391">And so she described to me the -- the -- the -- the episode for my father and I.</span> <span id="s1392">They would walk at night on the road and if they saw two lights, they knew they were policemens with their bicycle lights, and so they would jump into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Ditch?</span> <span id="s1394">A ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: -- the ditch next to the road to hide.</span> <span id="s1396">And that’s how they travel, right, to wherever they were going, I don’t know where, but anyway, the point that I’m making is that when they were shipped from Marmande, they were not allowed to live there any more, and we were in this little hamlet.</span> <span id="s1397">I said earlier that in my understanding of it, they were put there for easy picking, all right, by the French police.</span> <span id="s1398">And the whole system was geared around keeping them there, locked in, with no escape and no means of escape.</span> <span id="s1399">So now you can understand this couple, right.</span> <span id="s1400">Now they say, oh my God, we have sent our children away and they’re going to come arrest us.</span> <span id="s1401">Now, okay, then comes the second judgment, well better they stay there in the protection of this organization then, cause we are trapped.</span> <span id="s1402">We cannot escape, right.</span> <span id="s1403">So they are like animals in the cage and the French are inhospitable.</span> <span id="s1404">The police is absolutely their enemy, right, and hunt -- their hunter, right, and they know it.</span> <span id="s1405">They’re going to be arrested at the whim of -- of the police.</span> <span id="s1406">They have no power whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1407">So the total abandonment, you know, of these people, the total fact that they’re totally left with no escape --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: -- right, explains how bad things were to them.</span> <span id="s1410">Okay, now back to my -- I’m in Lourdes, I’m in this convent.</span> <span id="s1411">I’m the only child there and I have experiences there that are very life long.</span> <span id="s1412">I remember on the ground of the basilica by myself, I would go and visit the grotto.</span> <span id="s1413">I was alone and I remember praying there.</span> <span id="s1414">What I prayed for was for my parents.</span> <span id="s1415">So the question you asked me about my parents, there I know.</span> <span id="s1416">I know what I prayed for.</span> <span id="s1417">That’s what I prayed for.</span> <span id="s1418">And so I never lost hope.</span> <span id="s1419">I never give up, no.</span> <span id="s1420">There I went to pray, and not once, but quite a few times.</span> <span id="s1421">And today when I revisited Lourdes in the year 2000, of course there are hundreds, thousands of people with candles an-and the whole paraphernalia.</span> <span id="s1422">But here’s a grotto, I was the only occupant.</span> <span id="s1423">It was just me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: So you were there -- you said you were the only child sheltered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Ye -- I was -- I was -- no.</span> <span id="s1426">There were -- there were other children sheltered in the convent, maybe 30 - 40 or whatever they sheltered, but not many more than that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Did any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Maybe fewer than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Did the non-Jewish boys tease you about being so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No, I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s1431">Nobody knew I was Jewish, but -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Do they -- but do they tease you for being circumcised, or they didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Okay, so -- but that wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: I mean, there’s no question -- there’s no question that I was circumcised, there’s no question that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: That’s what I’m saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: -- they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: -- that the non-Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: But I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1442">Okay, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1443">I do remember that this convent had a priest and he was a young priest.</span> <span id="s1444">And I remember one day walking with him, the grounds of this long basilica, this long walkway, and I told him that I resented that I had to go to -- to church every Sunday morning and that I was not allowed to kneel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Did he know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Oh yeah, oh.</span> <span id="s1447">No question.</span> <span id="s1448">And he said to me in retort, and I remember it, never, never, never will forget.</span> <span id="s1449">He was the nicest guy, he really loved me.</span> <span id="s1450">And he says, well at least I don’t make you go to catechism.</span> <span id="s1451">So now, the way he said it, catechism was absolutely something terrible.</span> <span id="s1452">Going to church, kneeling, may not be allowed in my religion, but I had to go for my survival, and he told me this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1454">Right, right.</span> <span id="s1455">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: That I had to go, that I could not be made an exception --</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: -- right, I had to go.</span> <span id="s1459">The other children, you know, have to go, you have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: And it is for your survival.</span> <span id="s1462">Okay, so I understood all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: But why didn't you kneel?</span> <span id="s1464">To show that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Well, I went and I did kneel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Oh, you did kneel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: I did not want to kneel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Oh, oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: That i -- I knew it was forbidden in our religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1471">But you did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Okay, the only time that I ever saw kneeling was in New York when my brother and I went in 1950 and we ended up in the [indecipherable] and we were there in the high holidays --</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Holidays, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: -- and we were welcome into a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: -- a -- a -- a -- a synagogue, one of the small cons -- strict Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1477">And all of a sudden I see them kneeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Kneeling, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: I had never seen Jews kneeling before.</span> <span id="s1480">Anyway, so the nuns were nice to me.</span> <span id="s1481">They knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1482">Every day and certainly every weekend, German officer, German soldiers, you know, we -- we see them, they were a few feet away, or you know, next to us or walking.</span> <span id="s1483">Any one of them could have stopped, tapped me on the shoulder --</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: -- and stop.</span> <span id="s1486">I mean, they were there constantly, okay.</span> <span id="s1487">Nothing ever happened.</span> <span id="s1488">No -- nobody ever disclosed my identity.</span> <span id="s1489">I was treated like one of the children, you know, we did whatever the hell we did.</span> <span id="s1490">I remember that we went on hikes all the time, singing songs, you know, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: What was the contact with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1493">With my brother, I had contact with him from time to time.</span> <span id="s1494">And one day the liberation, and I was -- before the liberation came, and some woman -- the French had organized some kind of system to ask local habitants of Lourdes to provide a home for these orphan children, you know, to give them a little bit of a family, a little bit of that type of experience.</span> <span id="s1495">So a woman volunteered to have me, you know, that she would be -- okay, she was unmarried, that I would be her, you know, like big brother, so to speak, you know, that idea.</span> <span id="s1496">And she turned out to be a wonderful Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1497">By some choice of the Almighty, maybe, it turned out she was a Jewish French woman, and I was to be her little boy.</span> <span id="s1498">So she treated me, obviously with tremendous love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1501">And I said that -- that I would not continue to come unless my brother came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: And she didn’t want to, but she agreed.</span> <span id="s1504">And so then we spent time with her.</span> <span id="s1505">And I remember when I was leaving her, and she was talking to another woman in my presence, and the other woman was complaining to her that here she had cared for this child, a child, and that child had never written to her.</span> <span id="s1506">And so this woman who cared for me, she said, I bet you will do the same.</span> <span id="s1507">Oh no, no, no, I promise, I promise, I won’t forget you.</span> <span id="s1508">I will write to you.</span> <span id="s1509">But I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1510">I never did.</span> <span id="s1511">And that’s one of my many regrets, you know.</span> <span id="s1512">This was a wonderful, wonderful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Ah, God knows, I don’t, you know.</span> <span id="s1515">But again, you know, maybe children are more blessed and maybe they are protected and -- and babies and little children, of course, are loved by everybody.</span> <span id="s1516">But I had all these privileges, you know, in different time, and I have to say, you know, throughout my story, it’s a human story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: It’s a human story of survival of children who, not by their own doings are able to physically survive, but by their own doing emotionally, psychologically survive.</span> <span id="s1519">And what is the price?</span> <span id="s1520">What is the price of people who didn’t do it?</span> <span id="s1521">Who saw it, who remained passive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Or -- actively or inactively.</span> <span id="s1524">And this story of survival, right, has to record all of these people’s attitude, cause nothing happened here in a vacuum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Nothing happened in isolation, nothing happened by itself.</span> <span id="s1527">There was always cause and effect, right.</span> <span id="s1528">And -- so here is this magnificent woman.</span> <span id="s1529">Here is this magnificent priest, here is this magnificent nun.</span> <span id="s1530">Here are these -- these heroes to our people, who save these few Jewish children and move them from moment to moment to moment, throughout France, right, from southwest France, right, to somewhere between Creuse and -- and Ault Sevoir, and then from there to the Ault Sevoir right on top of this plateau, on this plateau where they hid us, right, and it’s way up in the mountain.</span> <span id="s1531">That’s where the -- the French resistance his.</span> <span id="s1532">And then the German soldiers, right, came, right, I learned later, of course, years later when I [indecipherable] to fight with this resistance [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: But they hid there because it was considered safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Di -- di -- de --</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: That’s where they -- they hid us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: But you do not know which organizations were behind all this.</span> <span id="s1538">Do -- you can’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Well, look --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: The OSE, you said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: -- the -- look, the French historian, this woman that I told you, whose book I have, right, and to whom I’ve contributed some of my memories.</span> <span id="s1542">Certainly not as much as I’m doing here, but some, she records what happened in -- in Lot-et-Garonne, right, the apartment.</span> <span id="s1543">And she, in chapter 12 for example, speaks of the organization, the Jewish organization that were in [indecipherable], that -- who did, you know, the different work, okay.</span> <span id="s1544">Now, chapter 12 deals with it, chapter 13 deals with it and there are several organizations, many of them funded by American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Right, and that’s who is behind, you know, these acts.</span> <span id="s1547">And I have to add --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: But my point is you never heard while you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Exactly the -- which organization, I don’t, but I have to make a point here, that deals with what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1550">How is it that American Jews knew and contributed money to these organization in 1942 to save Jews, and that the rest of America claimed to have no knowledge of what was happening?</span> <span id="s1551">No, I mean, th-th-this is monstrous.</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, I was saved by American money with -- with French Jewish lives who were willing to do it.</span> <span id="s1553">This was in ’42 - ’43 - ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: And th -- the -- the Roosevelt administration, the -- the -- the -- the -- the newspapers here and the media claimed ignorance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: So you were in Lourdes and then as a -- when your mother go -- were you in Lourdes when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: -- reunited with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: -- no, no.</span> <span id="s1560">From Lourdes, I -- we remained there until the liberation.</span> <span id="s1561">Then a Jewish organization took over our camp, after the liberation of the south of France.</span> <span id="s1562">Now we’re in the very southwest, you know, we’re -- we’re in Lourdes next to the Spanish -- Spanish border.</span> <span id="s1563">We are then placed, Herb and I, in a Catholic family in the town of Tarbes, T-a-r-b-e-s, which is close to Lourdes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: And they become our foster parents, so to speak, right, for a time.</span> <span id="s1566">My brother recalls that they were mean to me, but they were nice to him.</span> <span id="s1567">And in that sense, obviously, the effect of all this longing for my parents, the abandonment, or the separation from my parents, obviously in me created a difference of personality for me and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s1570">This is tape number four, side A, and you had left Lourdes and you were in Tarbes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Tarbes, right.</span> <span id="s1572">In Tarbes, my brother and I are ne -- housed with this family of fa -- French Christians.</span> <span id="s1573">I know this is not a pleasant time for me, and my brother, he remembers very well that they didn’t treat me very well, but they treated him okay.</span> <span id="s1574">One day I remember an event I can never forget.</span> <span id="s1575">This woman from a Jewish agency comes to visit and she has me sit down with her and she looks in my eyes … is a moment I never, never, never, never, never could forget.</span> <span id="s1576">She looks in my eyes and she says, we have found your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: I tell you, no human being can have greater, you know, pain and -- and joy at the same moment.</span> <span id="s1579">The obvious i-is that obviously I had despaired for two, say two and a half years.</span> <span id="s1580">Obviously I had prayed and hoped, and now this hope was bringing this moment and this news.</span> <span id="s1581">Now this was in the context that other children or other people had told me that they planned on shipping us to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1582">That they were going to ship us to Palestine, which meant, obviously, that they all assumed that we were orphans and that our parents had been killed.</span> <span id="s1583">And I knew that.</span> <span id="s1584">And now this woman brought this news.</span> <span id="s1585">This was the first word I had on my parents for two and a half years, almost.</span> <span id="s1586">And I tell you, I told the story to these two French journalists, and I know one of them published it in his newspaper as the lead, you know, in his article and they reported when I came to thank the Italian farmers, I didn’t talk about yet, about my mother, what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s1587">Well, they had hidden her for th -- a lot of that two and a half year period.</span> <span id="s1588">And I went to publicly thank this family that I visited many, many, many times.</span> <span id="s1589">I consider myself a part of their family, they consider me and my brother part of their family, certainly.</span> <span id="s1590">They consider my mother part of their family.</span> <span id="s1591">Anyway, I told these newsmen this, and -- and newspaper men and they considered that to be what I consider it, th -- not fully appreciating the content.</span> <span id="s1592">Anyway, so shortly after that, by this Jewish organization we were taken and reunited with my mother.</span> <span id="s1593">And I remember my mother there on the same platform of the same railroad station, standing just about exactly the same spot that I last saw her, say two and a half years before, with her close friend that she developed, this Madame Rozinsky, and her son, who became my close friend.</span> <span id="s1594">And they were Jews of -- from Alsace-Lorraine and they were spared.</span> <span id="s1595">They were spared in the town of ma -- Marmande, and two doors down was another Jewish family by the name of Alco, all of these were our friends after the war, and they were spared because they were French born.</span> <span id="s1596">So in France that’s another thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1597">There was a very, very, very, you know, factual difference of who survived and who was not allowed to survive.</span> <span id="s1598">And we, the refugees Jews in France were the ones that were handed for slaughter.</span> <span id="s1599">Knowingly, obligingly by the French.</span> <span id="s1600">And the other one, they spared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Tell me what it was like when you saw your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Well, it was a shock, because she had gained weight and I was conscious of that, but it was my mother, and that I recognized, and there was no problem from that moment.</span> <span id="s1603">That’s it, I will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Do you remember what she said to you, right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: No, I’m sure she cried.</span> <span id="s1606">I’m sure I cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: What about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: My brother was a different number, you know.</span> <span id="s1609">He left her and I don’t think he recog --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: He didn’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: -- a-and he did not recognize her, he did not.</span> <span id="s1612">And I think my mother said that, you know, that he didn’t recognize --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: He was too little when he left, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yeah, he was too little.</span> <span id="s1615">And he had no memory of his father either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1618">I had two years on him, and I have very, very strong, you know, very, very strong memories of my parents, you know.</span> <span id="s1619">And so I don’t think we needed to say any words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1621">And then where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Now -- I don’t think there were any words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: And then where did you go with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Well, she had gotten this apartment.</span> <span id="s1627">She was allocated by the city, right, through the Secretaire Generale, the -- th-the administrative chief of the city hall, who administered that apartment that I referred to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: -- where my father had performed the -- the high holiday services, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1630">And I remember being in that apartment when the liberation of Paris came, and I remember making little flags of America and so for -- and Britain and -- and France, you know, and I hung them on the window, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s1631">You know, we, as opposed to children today who have everything handed to them and made for them, right, they have to use their talents in different ways.</span> <span id="s1632">I was a creator.</span> <span id="s1633">I created my own toys, right, and the flag was my la -- you know, and so yes, France was there in a very happy state at that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: And so was I. And so after we stayed there a -- you know a short time, you know, in that apartment, then we were given the apartment I said on the Boulevard de Marie, opposite the warehouse and there we lived.</span> <span id="s1636">And my brother and I went to school, and he became a closest friend to a boy named Saresh Guyaux, whose father was Gerard Guyaux, that man -- they lived just down the street, the side street.</span> <span id="s1637">And he helped us to survive, you know.</span> <span id="s1638">And my mother’s story is an important story.</span> <span id="s1639">She was left with my father and they struggled, right, until -- together after they were released from the camp at Casanuri.</span> <span id="s1640">Then they lived in that same mud chicken coop, as my wife calls it.</span> <span id="s1641">And one day the police came, as expected, and they arrested my father.</span> <span id="s1642">And his arrest is also recorded in the books that I have.</span> <span id="s1643">I mean, I have every evidence of why he was arrested on the orders of Eichmann, for the -- as a r -- act of ret -- retribution against the killing of two German officer in Paris.</span> <span id="s1644">And Eichmann declared that there should be a punishment for this, 2000 Jews were to be arrested throughout France and turned over to them at Drancy, and the French complied.</span> <span id="s1645">My father was one of those who was arrested and he was put in the camp of Gurs, G-u-r-s, and for transportation to Drancy, and from Drancy at fra -- Drancy on the night that he was being shipped out to go to his destiny, he didn’t know where, but anyway went from Auschwitz to Majdanek, and he was allowed one goodbye, farewell postcard, that he mailed to my mother.</span> <span id="s1646">And this I have, and it’s dated March the third, 1943, and instead -- instead of saying au revoir, or instead of saying something else, he misspelled but says the word, adieu with an exclamation mark, underscored twice, in big letters.</span> <span id="s1647">He knew he was headed for death.</span> <span id="s1648">And he said that we should have bon courage, you know, strength to deal with it, and he sent us his love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: How old was he at that time?</span> <span id="s1650">19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: He was born in 1907.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: So he was 30 si --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: In 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: -- he was 36.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: He was not 36, he was 35, to be 36.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: His birthday is in June, like mine, like my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: All born in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: And his card is there and I have it in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: You have the original card?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1668">I have the original card, I have the original letters that he wrote, of abandonment.</span> <span id="s1669">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: -- the information.</span> <span id="s1672">I have the original.</span> <span id="s1673">I have an original copy or I have the original affidavit of my grandfather, right.</span> <span id="s1674">These are original documents, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Tell me about your mother’s story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Her story is -- and I will tell you now, because a story -- history should know not just what she endured, but how I look at how she endured.</span> <span id="s1677">I consider her about as great a woman, a mother as there can be, in fact, I call her an angel.</span> <span id="s1678">After my father’s arrest in February, at the end of February, 1943, she is left alone.</span> <span id="s1679">She has no idea if her children are alive or dead, except th-there are a few photographs that are given to her.</span> <span id="s1680">And she, of course, knows nothing of what happened to her husband.</span> <span id="s1681">And so she is left there alone, right.</span> <span id="s1682">And she speaks the language cause she picks up the language fast.</span> <span id="s1683">She’s a seamstress, she is known by the farming families, you know, who use her.</span> <span id="s1684">And one day she is asked by this Italian farmer’s family, the Ros family, R-o-s to make a wedding dress for their one -- their second oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s1685">So my mother makes this wedding dress for her, and she did, I guess, a reasonably good job.</span> <span id="s1686">Then they ask her to make the suit for the groom.</span> <span id="s1687">So she makes that.</span> <span id="s1688">And from then on they are totally connected, and they become her protectors.</span> <span id="s1689">So, they take her away, she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in tremendous pain and they give her a family and a home and a place.</span> <span id="s1690">So this is two people who had immigrated from Italy when things were bad in northern Italy in the early 30’s.</span> <span id="s1691">And they became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of France at a chateau called LeCook, and -- by a woman who was Madame deFerrier, a noble lady of -- not noble in act, of course she was noble in act, but her name was of the nobility.</span> <span id="s1692">And the tenant farmers that they have is this family, Ros.</span> <span id="s1693">And this couple, the Ros’ are two magnificent -- magnificent human beings.</span> <span id="s1694">They are farmers with a little education.</span> <span id="s1695">They have six or seven children, right now I’m not counting them, and they have this farm.</span> <span id="s1696">And so they take her in and from time to time, you know, one of their son, you know transports my mother by bicycle to their farm, which is up on this hill, at the mas dejeuner.</span> <span id="s1697">And she is all alone so they adopt her and they hide her.</span> <span id="s1698">Their oldest son is ordered into Germany as part of the -- the -- the -- the German orders, it takes one child from certain families, you know, to -- as laborers in Germany, and he is one of them, and he’s not there.</span> <span id="s1699">So I guess in the sense they consoled themselves because they have some connect in that sense.</span> <span id="s1700">Anyway, she spends a lot of time there, and they even hide her.</span> <span id="s1701">One time I was taken through when I returned.</span> <span id="s1702">When I was a child growing up there I wasn’t interested in any of this, but when I returned with my wife and -- and children to LeCook, LeCook had been sold to a German couple, but they were -- they allowed us to come and visit that site.</span> <span id="s1703">And I was then taken through the chateau, as I had been as a child, we used to play there all the time after the war.</span> <span id="s1704">But I was shown a room in this chateau that had a secret wall, and my mother was hidden in that wall.</span> <span id="s1705">So when police came to LeCook to check what’s what, and so forth, so forth, they would hide her in this wall, you know, which was a fake wall.</span> <span id="s1706">So, in my family so many things happened that happened to other Jews in other places and so on, even that happened.</span> <span id="s1707">Anyway, these wonderful people kept her, nourished her, gave her support, moral and physical in that sense and helped her over this period.</span> <span id="s1708">A photograph that I have of my mother shows her extreme pain.</span> <span id="s1709">And she is in one picture shown, that’s all I have, when she is with her sewing machine [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1710">Then the next picture I have of her is two and a half years later when we’re reunited with her.</span> <span id="s1711">And she takes us with joy and pride, you know, to visit this family, to bring her sons.</span> <span id="s1712">And the pain in her eyes is so clear and her pride is so clear.</span> <span id="s1713">And I have two photographs, you know, of that particular event, where she even made the clothes that we wear.</span> <span id="s1714">And she is bringing her boys.</span> <span id="s1715">And this family that I went and thanked and -- and so forth, called just two or three weeks ago.</span> <span id="s1716">We haven’t heard from you, where are you, what’s happening?</span> <span id="s1717">Why aren’t you here, you know?</span> <span id="s1718">And -- a-a-anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: So you stayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: These people, we would go during -- we, of course immediately applied to emigrate to the United States with the help of my uncle --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1722">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: -- now, not -- not my great-uncle, but my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1726">And as fate has tha -- an-and justice not, we -- presumably one of the reasons that the United States of America went to war against Hitler was about the horror that he was committing against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1727">We, who already had been given entry into th -- America in 1935 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: -- when my mother applied, that was an unrecalled event.</span> <span id="s1730">We were then placed in the quota, the most extreme quota that United States immigrant quotas had established.</span> <span id="s1731">And that was in 1945 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Where were you living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: I was then living in Marmande.</span> <span id="s1734">I -- we left it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: So you stayed in Marmande.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: We -- we stayed in Marmande until we emigrated to United States in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Oh, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: So for those five years we lived in Marmande.</span> <span id="s1739">Well, my mother applied immediately for -- a-after the war was over, she applied immediately for pro -- visa, with the -- of course with the sponsorship of my uncle, and we were placed in the quota of Poland, which was then behind the Iron Curtain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: -- that they had raised, and now instead of being in the favored status, we were in the most un-favored status and we had to wait five years to a -- be allowed to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s1742">Now, on the ship that we took to emigrate, were Germans.</span> <span id="s1743">Germans who had applied for the right to live in the United States six months ago.</span> <span id="s1744">And I, the victim of the Holocaust, the horror for which this country supposedly went to war, I had to wait five years.</span> <span id="s1745">Now that same crime was repeated over and over since that time, to now.</span> <span id="s1746">People are allowed on fantasy, and made up and so forth, so forth, I’m being persecuted, I am -- so therefore all the Iranians, the Cubans, the Vietnamese, the -- anybody anywhere in the world is allowed to enter the United States on the say-so, violating their tourist visa, you understand, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1747">We, who were the absolute victims of the war, right, from whom everything was taken, the property, the inheritance, the families, the rights, our father, everything.</span> <span id="s1748">We were treated in the most, right, abject, the most rejected.</span> <span id="s1749">We had to wait five years for the privilege and the right to emigrate to this country, right, this country to whom we had been sponsored, and this country had already, right, granted us entry in 1935.</span> <span id="s1750">That promise was broken.</span> <span id="s1751">Now, I love this country and I condemn this country.</span> <span id="s1752">You know, I have one understanding, you know, in the recent political thing that’s going on and they’re condemning this Reverend Wright, right?</span> <span id="s1753">And I do, I condemn him too, for what he said.</span> <span id="s1754">I don’t think he has a right to say what he said.</span> <span id="s1755">On the other hand, there is a level of understanding on my part.</span> <span id="s1756">And that is, when a person, right, is part of an environment where this country denies to one group the rights and privileges guaranteed under the Constitution and the law, and it denies them indirectly or otherwise, by use of the law, then somebody has a right to be angry.</span> <span id="s1757">I am angry.</span> <span id="s1758">I truly resent the fact that Mexican and others from Latin America daily, you know, cross our borders without any permission, any permits, anything.</span> <span id="s1759">I had to go through every demands.</span> <span id="s1760">We had to prove we were honest, healthy, able people, that we would be able to survive in this country without charity.</span> <span id="s1761">We had to swear at the point of entry in New York -- I remember my mother had to sign an affidavit she didn’t come here to kill the president.</span> <span id="s1762">I thought then, I’m 16 years old, this is a joke.</span> <span id="s1763">How can that be a demand, you know, on somebody who’s entering here?</span> <span id="s1764">Yet it was.</span> <span id="s1765">So, as wonderful as this place is, it was the promised land to me from the time I was one years old, that’s where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1766">Germany was no longer my home, I had no home.</span> <span id="s1767">France was not my home, I never accepted it, right.</span> <span id="s1768">I knew I didn’t fit there.</span> <span id="s1769">I didn’t belong there.</span> <span id="s1770">They hadn’t offered, they hadn’t extended, you know.</span> <span id="s1771">Yeah, they were tolerating us, and they didn’t persecute us and they didn’t harm us, other than what they did, right.</span> <span id="s1772">But this wasn’t my home, and it wasn’t my mother’s home.</span> <span id="s1773">My brother wanted to be -- h-he wanted it to be his home, cause he had grown up there.</span> <span id="s1774">He didn’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s1775">And he was doing good in school and I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1776">I had no interest in going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: You’re talking about now in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: No, no, no, no, no, in the -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: -- or your talking about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: -- in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: In France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yeah, when we’re reunited with our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: [indecipherable] so then you -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yeah, and so I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: This is now, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Your 10 - 11 years old?</span> <span id="s1788">You were ta --</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Well, I enter school, I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: You were reunited with your mother in the fall of ’44, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Right, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: So you were 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: -- in -- i-i-in -- in the spring, I suppose, of ’45 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: ’45, yeah.</span> <span id="s1795">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: I’m not so sure now.</span> <span id="s1797">It must have been the fall of ’45 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: -- that I went to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: To school, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: -- right.</span> <span id="s1802">And this is my first bit of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Now how old am I?</span> <span id="s1805">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: You’re 11, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Yeah, di -- isn’t that wonderful?</span> <span id="s1808">I missed five years of education.</span> <span id="s1809">I had no education.</span> <span id="s1810">And I am 11 years old, all right, and I go to school.</span> <span id="s1811">And I only won -- and I only went til I was 13, because that is the required mandatory, and I was not interested in going further, because this wasn’t my place, I didn't belong there.</span> <span id="s1812">I didn’t belong in France.</span> <span id="s1813">This wasn’t my -- I didn't want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1814">I wanted to go to America, that’s all, right.</span> <span id="s1815">And then I waited [indecipherable] my mother says, okay, you got to learn a trade, you -- no matter what you do in America, you know, you have to learn a trade to survive, and God knows what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s1816">This could happen again.</span> <span id="s1817">I remember my mother telling me.</span> <span id="s1818">So I want you to become an apprentice tailor.</span> <span id="s1819">So for two years I became an apprentice tailor.</span> <span id="s1820">I hated that.</span> <span id="s1821">I never picked up a -- a needle since.</span> <span id="s1822">I know nothing about sewing.</span> <span id="s1823">I reject that as I rejected the German language.</span> <span id="s1824">Oh yeah, oh absolutely, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: So she would talk to you in French, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Who, my mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Oh, our conversation were only in French.</span> <span id="s1829">Oh yeah, only, only.</span> <span id="s1830">I never -- I don’t speak German, I don’t understand German.</span> <span id="s1831">Sure, I understand a few words, I understand, you know, after all, I heard her speak to others.</span> <span id="s1832">But when we were together it was strictly in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Did that upset her, or did she -- did she want to speak to you in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: I mean, she was about as good a mother as the world ever created.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Well no, I just didn't know, cause when you were little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: No, my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: No, when you were little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: The only time she was upset with me was one time I was walking home from school in France, in Marmande with a girl.</span> <span id="s1841">Oh, my God, she -- she -- she went berserk and she hit me with a broom, that I was not to associate with a shiksa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Yeah, I was what, 12 - 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Sure, right.</span> <span id="s1845">But I remember, because I specifically asked you what language did your parents speak to you when you were little, and you said German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Well, when we were little it was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: That -- that’s what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1848">But she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Right, but once we were in France, it was a matter of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: But then when you got tic -- back together again, it was still French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: In French, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: But when we were in -- in -- in Marmande --</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: -- and in -- in -- in Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil with our parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: -- it was in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: -- French, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: They learned it quickly, I learned it quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: We only spoke French, that was a matter of security.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Security, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Yeah, thi -- in fact, my father, what he did is he changed his appearance from the way he was before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: -- because he was afraid that the German soldiers, somebody would recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: So yeah.</span> <span id="s1870">So no, no, now in -- that was one of the -- incidentally, when I returned to ma -- Marmande and Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, and I have to say this, the Berny family says, I have something of yours.</span> <span id="s1871">And they brought me a little envelope which had the shredded pieces of my father’s prayer book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: My father was not allowed take his prayer book and it was left there when my mother on -- on one of her times, it was left there, and I don’t know exactly why.</span> <span id="s1874">And so they gave me this envelope with these pieces, and some of them I have.</span> <span id="s1875">And they told me that what they did is, they knew that he had been killed, or at least they premised that it was, so they distributed among them, the Catholic habits, as an omen of good, and so this prayer book was torn by them, right, and only certain pieces remained, and they gave them to me.</span> <span id="s1876">I tell you that that is one time I cried, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s1879">This is tape number four, side B..</span> <span id="s1880">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Okay, I wanted -- I wanted to say one thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: -- before I do, because I don’t know how much time we’re going to spend, that I’m available.</span> <span id="s1884">But one thing I want to say is this, because it ties into the first part, before I get to what happens here.</span> <span id="s1885">One time I went to Jerusalem, to the Yad Vashem, again to find my roots.</span> <span id="s1886">And this was 20 years ago, I think.</span> <span id="s1887">It was -- well, it was on the anniversary of the state of Israel, so thi -- I know that.</span> <span id="s1888">And I -- I think it was 20 years ago, but anyway -- and I went to the Yad Vashem to ask -- you know, to apply for -- I-I wanted to connect to my family, to my roots.</span> <span id="s1889">And so I filled out a card and I went to hand it to the man at the counter, and the man looked at it and he said to me, the information for you isn’t here.</span> <span id="s1890">So I looked.</span> <span id="s1891">He says, I have the information that you need.</span> <span id="s1892">So I said, yeah?</span> <span id="s1893">He says, I’m going to bring it to you.</span> <span id="s1894">In a little while he came back with these two gigantic books, and he says, there is what happened to your family.</span> <span id="s1895">I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1896">I open the book and it’s called Gedanta volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of West Germany killed by the Nazis as reported and recorded by the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in this book I looked under Lakritz and I don’t find my father.</span> <span id="s1897">So I decided to go under Weber, and I will tell you, if you would have exploded an atomic bomb, I don’t think I would have been more shocked, more surprised, more in a state of total emotional disconnect and connect, ya -- total.</span> <span id="s1898">I opened the book, I go to Weber, and the first thing I read is the name of Mirel Weber, geb Lakritz, from Kiel.</span> <span id="s1899">That’s my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1900">So I run down, the next name I find is Simon, initial S, Lakritz Weber.</span> <span id="s1901">And they put his place of residence and where he died, Majdanek, Lublin, sometime in ’43.</span> <span id="s1902">How in the world they restored to him his name of Weber as a memorial to him is -- I -- I totally without any comprehension.</span> <span id="s1903">How they went through the records and restored to him his name, is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1904">So the connection to my pursuit of my name, my identity, my roots, here it is confirmed in the Gedanta book, handed to me in the Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s1905">And so I said -- and I looked then for the other relatives, the Weizmanns, and they’re all recorded, anyway, everybody in the Weizner is in, they are recorded.</span> <span id="s1906">Aunts and uncles and cousins whose deaths are recorded.</span> <span id="s1907">Anyway, so now let me come to what happens in United States of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: We come to Oakland, right, and we stayed with my Uncle M-Mike and my Aunt Eda and her -- her three children.</span> <span id="s1910">They’re my cousins, these are my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s1911">We are welcomed in New York by an -- a niece, a cousin of mine, Friedel Knesh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: What was it like to step down on American soil?</span> <span id="s1913">A: I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1914">Imagine for a moment that a child has a dream, that California in America is the dream.</span> <span id="s1915">I remember docking -- well, no, first I remember coming -- entering into the port of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: What boat were you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1918">It was a port that left -- m-my mother arranged for us, before we left Europe that she wanted to see Paris.</span> <span id="s1919">She hadn’t seen -- we hadn’t been there, and she wanted to go to Rome.</span> <span id="s1920">And so she arranged to -- from a -- through a Jewish agency, right, that we could have these periods.</span> <span id="s1921">Remember, we didn’t have much of anything, everything was taken from us.</span> <span id="s1922">And we were not poor people in Germany, but we didn’t own the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the retail store, you know.</span> <span id="s1923">We owned a wholesale schmutter, okay.</span> <span id="s1924">Well, we were good anyway, not rich.</span> <span id="s1925">And here we are and so she’s getting help, you know, for us to immigrate to United States.</span> <span id="s1926">So we leave from Naples.</span> <span id="s1927">What was it you asked me?</span> <span id="s1928">Q: The name of the boat.</span> <span id="s1929">That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Yeah, I -- I knew the name of the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Anyway, it was an ordinary commercial boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Yeah, I get it</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: And I asked you then what it was like to put your foot down on American soil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1937">So I remember docking, but before docking, we passed by the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1938">And when we were in Paris, before we left, and we were sightseeing and so forth, we found the replica of the Statue of Liberty, you know, by the guy who -- who made th-the thing.</span> <span id="s1939">So I saw it, and mm, look at that thing, huh?</span> <span id="s1940">Yeah, it’s not so big.</span> <span id="s1941">Anyway, but it was nice, an-and you know, and gave you that umph, you know, hope, you know.</span> <span id="s1942">Next time I see you, I’ll see your big sister.</span> <span id="s1943">And there I was, I saw the big sister.</span> <span id="s1944">You know, here was the promised land, you know.</span> <span id="s1945">Here was my life, all right.</span> <span id="s1946">A boy who had very little given to him by France, right, and everything hoped for in the United States.</span> <span id="s1947">So the Statue of Liberty was a moment I cried.</span> <span id="s1948">When we docked, then we disembarked and there were people crowded around and whate -- and behind the fence, you know, and my mother found her brother and her sister-in-law, who were there.</span> <span id="s1949">And of course I didn’t know them, but of course I found out right away who they were.</span> <span id="s1950">Anyway, so after we -- we cleared the -- everything else, I think I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1951">And so somebody, you understand, it was Friedel’s husband, who was -- the husband is a -- was a taxi driver, I remember in -- in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1952">They lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1953">My aunt and uncle had come from Oakland across the United States.</span> <span id="s1954">I know those four people were there.</span> <span id="s1955">And it must have been him, he took me to a bar to go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s1956">And I saw a jukebox in this -- I had never seen a jukebox.</span> <span id="s1957">I was amazed.</span> <span id="s1958">This thing plays music.</span> <span id="s1959">I was totally amazed.</span> <span id="s1960">The only thing I knew about music was the phonograph, you know, so forth, you -- okay, so that was one thing.</span> <span id="s1961">Then I saw them selling Frosties, you know, that ice cream.</span> <span id="s1962">So, he bought me one.</span> <span id="s1963">I tasted it; it was so rich, so wonderful, so magnificent.</span> <span id="s1964">In France the ice cream is sort of watery and -- an-and icy, but here was -- it’s so rich.</span> <span id="s1965">So they had a boy, wha -- we stayed with them for a week, and this boy was a little fat, and we were thin.</span> <span id="s1966">And I saw the amount of food that they had, of milk and butter and cheese and -- and a [indecipherable] I said, no wonder he’s fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Did you speak English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Not a word.</span> <span id="s1969">And I had done something in preparation of coming here.</span> <span id="s1970">I had written to the embassy in Paris, right, the French embassy -- I mean the American embassy and I’d say we’re going to immigrate, you know, an-and I wanted something cause in -- in Marmande there was nothing about learning English.</span> <span id="s1971">There was no book in the library, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1972">I had French books, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s1973">And so they sent me a book, right, nice they were, to learn about English.</span> <span id="s1974">So on my own, you know, I learned a few words in the little thing, but on my own I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t learn anything, I ma -- it was -- so that’s the beginning, right, so, where -- with -- with Friedel and -- and -- and so forth, so forth.</span> <span id="s1975">That fat little boy, he’s a lawyer in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1976">Anyway, and he’s one -- and he is the one who finally, my other relatives that were looking for me, right, for this trip to Germany, he’s the one who connected with me and found me, you know, cause he -- they knew I was a lawyer, and he’s a lawyer, so he said, I -- I can find him.</span> <span id="s1977">He did that.</span> <span id="s1978">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: So how long did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: I think we stayed just a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Oh, then you went out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: And then -- then my mother wanted to cross the country, you know, and see the country, you know, and so for five days we went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: On this train, again, you know, we meet all these wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1985">And so we met this guy and he befriended, you know, Herb and I. And, you know, he -- he would talk to us.</span> <span id="s1986">But on that train, something happened.</span> <span id="s1987">So my mother sent us to the -- to the cart, you know, th -- to the car, the food car, whatever it’s called.</span> <span id="s1988">The catering tru -- the catering --</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: The dining car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: The dining car.</span> <span id="s1991">And so he and I are in the dining car.</span> <span id="s1992">Here it is the United States, they bring us a menu and we’re looking at this menu and we cannot understand anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s1993">But there is one thing I understood, because my aunt and uncle would send us a food parcel, you know, during the time that we were in France after the -- you know, the war ended, they would send us these wonderful packages, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: And one of the things they had -- they shipped us, was corned beef.</span> <span id="s1996">You know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1997">So I saw the word corn, so I pointed to the waiter, black guy, I remember, or maybe he was white, any -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1998">And I pointed this word corn, okay?</span> <span id="s1999">So I figure we’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: -- ordering corned beef.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: And that we knew we liked.</span> <span id="s2004">So here comes the waiter with two plates and on each plate is an ear of corn.</span> <span id="s2005">We look at this, what is this?</span> <span id="s2006">This is a joke.</span> <span id="s2007">In France the only people who ate corn were pigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: It was raised strictly for feeding of pigs and geese, right, that you fatten up for their livers in the southwest of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2012">An -- no, this is like an insult, you know.</span> <span id="s2013">I mean, this is terrible, you understand?</span> <span id="s2014">And obviously no harm was ever intended.</span> <span id="s2015">But it’s one of the moments, you know, that somebody who doesn’t speak the language and -- and -- and, you know, when I meet people like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: -- you know, and they don’t know, and they don’t comprehend, you know.</span> <span id="s2018">I say well, I went through that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s2021">Okay, I didn't know a word of English.</span> <span id="s2022">I mean, blue and you know, okay, I knew the word corn.</span> <span id="s2023">Okay, anyway, we went across the United States -- I mean across the United States by train and befriended this guy.</span> <span id="s2024">When we came to Oakland he was visiting his family, it was across the bay and he wanted to take us there, but my mother wouldn’t allow our -- cause she -- you know.</span> <span id="s2025">So he took us out for dinner anyway, in Oakland.</span> <span id="s2026">And that my mother will allow, that’s all, she wouldn’t allow any more besides.</span> <span id="s2027">Anyway, so in Oakland we lived with my uncle --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: -- until my mother got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: And she got a job working for I. Magnin, which was the high culture department store in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2032">And she became a -- a simst -- a seamstress there, and she worked there until she retired, you know.</span> <span id="s2033">And they loved her and everybody who worked there loved her, cause she was a -- a ma -- I mean, really, everybody loved my mother.</span> <span id="s2034">She was gentle and soft-spoken, you know.</span> <span id="s2035">She didn’t parade her pain or her suffering, you know.</span> <span id="s2036">She was just, I me -- I mean, a hundred percent good, in every sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: So you went to high school and college?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: So we were in Oakland, okay.</span> <span id="s2039">So now my cousins, you know, who are very active and graduated, you know, from the Oakland schools, you know, th-they tried to enroll us, okay.</span> <span id="s2040">And so they got us enrolled in Oakland Technical High School.</span> <span id="s2041">And the high school is trying to figure out what to do with us, cause we don’t speak English and there’s nobody there, no tutors, nothing.</span> <span id="s2042">The only person who speaks French in the whole school is the French teacher.</span> <span id="s2043">Obviously she wasn’t about to, you know, be our full time teacher about anything.</span> <span id="s2044">So what they decide to do, my brother is two years younger than me, so what they did is they put us together --</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: -- right, and me a year behind whatever is th-the required age and him a year ahead.</span> <span id="s2047">So they were -- okay, so we had somebody to talk to.</span> <span id="s2048">So here we entered high school at the same time, okay.</span> <span id="s2049">He and I learned the English language within six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: And that is for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Within that time period I got a job working in the market, right in the par -- in a grocery store, taking out groceries.</span> <span id="s2054">We graduated -- I became the head yell leader of my high school.</span> <span id="s2055">I was on the board, of course, the student board.</span> <span id="s2056">I was in other club, I was on the swimming team.</span> <span id="s2057">We were both admitted to University of California at Berkeley.</span> <span id="s2058">We both graduated and then I went to law school at the University of California Berkeley, Bolt Hall, which is about as -- as premier a law school as Harvard, right.</span> <span id="s2059">At the time they were the premier law schools in the United States.</span> <span id="s2060">My brother became a CPA, he went to work for the IRS, then he got tired of that and he opened his practice and he owns now a Toyota agency that he bought from one of his clients many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s2061">He has got three sons, one is a par -- pair of twins.</span> <span id="s2062">They run that agency, they’re about to enlarge it now, and so he is in the city called Novato, which is in Marin County, just a little ways between San Rafael and Petaluma, you know, very close to the wine country, Napa, okay.</span> <span id="s2063">That’s where he lives and to my regret I had to move down south to L.A. because while I was in law school I met my wife and there was my downfall, I stopped studying.</span> <span id="s2064">But anyway, I made the grades anyway to graduate, and suddenly, you know, I had regular food, and regular living and I had a wonderful wife and everything was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: When you were in high school and college --</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: -- and law school, did people ask you about your childhood and your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Well, we really did not share this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: You did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Okay, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: You did not share th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: The only thing that the chi -- no, all the things that the children -- and that’s one of the things I included in my book.</span> <span id="s2073">The children with whom we associated became the leaders and were the leaders of the school, okay, we were in the elite group in high school.</span> <span id="s2074">That’s how I got to be assistant yell leader, then I became the head yell le --</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Yell?</span> <span id="s2076">You said yell?</span> <span id="s2077">A: Yeah, yell --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: -- yell lead --</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Cheer -- is that a cheerleader?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Th-That’s -- yeah, but it was called a yell leader then, and he was the guy, you know, who led the -- the -- the yells at the basketball game and the -- and the football games and the cheers, you know, and I had two assistant -- four assistant, I mean, two on each side.</span> <span id="s2082">I had four assistant, you know.</span> <span id="s2083">I was one of the important guys in the school.</span> <span id="s2084">All the -- all the -- all th-the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: But you didn’t talk about your childhood?</span> <span id="s2086">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Other -- they all -- the only thing they knew about us was that we were immigrants from France.</span> <span id="s2089">And they treated us -- and they loved us, and they called me Frenchie, right.</span> <span id="s2090">And then they -- then they -- once I involved in the school then they didn't call me Frenchie any more, they called me Al, and everybody called me Al.</span> <span id="s2091">Anyway, so we did not talk about the war experience.</span> <span id="s2092">We didn’t talk about what we were, who we were, what happened to us, none of that.</span> <span id="s2093">We had such a desire, a drive, to mingle, to -- to be accepted, to conform, to -- all right, this is the 1950’s, you know.</span> <span id="s2094">Th-The whole society, you know, was a society of conformists.</span> <span id="s2095">We -- we all wanted, from 1950 -- I graduated in high school ’53, we both in June of ’53.</span> <span id="s2096">This was a time when this country was going through the -- the -- the immediate post-war experience that wa -- suddenly the United States was th-the leader of the world.</span> <span id="s2097">The most productive, the richest country.</span> <span id="s2098">Everything th -- everybody saw everything just going upw -- upward.</span> <span id="s2099">I-I-It was only one direction for this country.</span> <span id="s2100">It was u-upward.</span> <span id="s2101">And we were the only foreigners in the -- in the whole high school of say more than 3,000 students.</span> <span id="s2102">There were four or five Jewish kids in the school.</span> <span id="s2103">We were totally accepted, right, even though we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s2104">And I -- I -- I had -- I had no problem becoming the head yell leader, being elected.</span> <span id="s2105">As I said, we were friends to the, you know, elite students of the school, th-the -- the -- the students --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: What about when you were in college or law school, did people ask you about your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Well, there it was different, okay.</span> <span id="s2108">Incidentally, I want you to know, I sent a thank you, you know, to the students of my -- of our s -- class, through the reunion, and they published that thank you.</span> <span id="s2109">And for the first time, they learned that we had been victim of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2110">They had no idea.</span> <span id="s2111">And close friends, th-the head of the -- the -- the -- the reunion committee, I mean, she had a long talk with me on the phone.</span> <span id="s2112">She couldn’t believe it, because I thanked them, you know, for integrating us, allowing us -- this the front of my high school.</span> <span id="s2113">This is the article that I wrote, on this book.</span> <span id="s2114">This was reproduced by a subsequent y-y-year, you know.</span> <span id="s2115">Sharing memory, a special thank you to Tech, which was Oakland Tech, you know, that they recopy with my -- with my thanks, I mean, you know, I was happy they did.</span> <span id="s2116">And here is -- was the article an-and in -- in the news, you know, when we had this school reunion.</span> <span id="s2117">That’s the first time they ever learned of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: And you didn’t have the desire to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2120">My mother did not talk of that time.</span> <span id="s2121">She --</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Well, that was going to be my next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Did you all talk at home?</span> <span id="s2125">A: No.</span> <span id="s2126">Of that time?</span> <span id="s2127">No way.</span> <span id="s2128">No, no.</span> <span id="s2129">This was not a subject of discussion.</span> <span id="s2130">That’s one of the things that it’s difficult to understand maybe, but we wanted to survive, we wanted to adapt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: We wanted to become integrated in this land where we were -- were we belong.</span> <span id="s2133">We belong here.</span> <span id="s2134">We didn't belong in Germany, we didn’t belong in France, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Did you still feel very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2137">Oh, that absolutely.</span> <span id="s2138">Oh, very, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s2139">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Were you ever angry when you were younger that you were Jewish, that these terrible things happened to your family because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: No.</span> <span id="s2142">I was never angry, or regretted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: I’m saying as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: -- as a child, I was never angry that a-a -- that I don’t think ever, ever crossed my mind.</span> <span id="s2145">I was -- always felt -- m-made to feel good about being a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s2146">I was -- I-I had nothing but pride in being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: Yeah, but terrible things happened because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: I -- I understand, I understand.</span> <span id="s2149">Remember, my grandfather had his own synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: My father was a very observant Jew.</span> <span id="s2152">I mean he -- he -- he put on the Tefillin every day.</span> <span id="s2153">They kept kosher.</span> <span id="s2154">They kept kosher in France during the occupation when we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2155">When there was no meat, you understand and the only available meat was pork, they gave it to my brother and I, but not -- they wouldn’t eat it, okay.</span> <span id="s2156">To the extent that she could -- my mother could keep kosher, you understand, in -- in this kind of horrible, you know, living conditions, you know, certainly no -- no way you can, you know, maintain dietary laws, but anyway -- but as soon as we came to America, she did.</span> <span id="s2157">And so did my Uncle Mike and Eda, they were here -- they came here in our place, I mean -- no, I did not feel a sense of either shame or resentment about being a Jew, right.</span> <span id="s2158">And th-that speaks to the -- to the -- to the attitude and feelings that you have.</span> <span id="s2159">Now, was I glad to be a target and a -- and a -- and a victim?</span> <span id="s2160">No.</span> <span id="s2161">I mean, obviously that made me very angry.</span> <span id="s2162">And when I came to understand how the process had happened to my family and to me and to so forth, so forth, no, I became very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: But -- and then I learned more and more, even about the complicity of the United States and I call it what it is because it is a complixa -- complicity in the murder of six million Jews, and I say it now, forever it should be remembered that they -- the Germans were complicit, the French were complicit, so was America.</span> <span id="s2165">FDR was complicit.</span> <span id="s2166">The State Department was complicit.</span> <span id="s2167">And not -- they didn’t stop their complicity with this monstrous period of crime.</span> <span id="s2168">They didn’t even redeem it by honor us, you understand, to -- to allow us to immigrate the United States before the worst quota imposed.</span> <span id="s2169">I can’t forgive that.</span> <span id="s2170">I can’t forget that.</span> <span id="s2171">This can never be forgotten, all right.</span> <span id="s2172">And so people -- when I , you know, speak of -- of the intolerance, you know, oh -- and -- and the dysfunctional treatment of -- of millions of Mexicans and Latin Americans, of the Cubans and -- and the Vietnamese and th -- all these immigrants from everywhere, why is it that Jews were treated differently?</span> <span id="s2173">And it seems -- and you can take that view, that Jews always have to be the ones who have to pierce whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2174">They are in front.</span> <span id="s2175">They are the -- the target.</span> <span id="s2176">And maybe that’s it, again.</span> <span id="s2177">We are the chosen ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: And we’re not only chosen for what we would want to be chosen for, but we were.</span> <span id="s2180">And I use the word describing what the United States did, and this comes from a person who loves his country, this is my dream.</span> <span id="s2181">This is a place where no human being, right, could have -- could have expected more than I got out of it.</span> <span id="s2182">This is a country I would kiss the ground.</span> <span id="s2183">I kissed the ground when I landed in New York, I kissed the ground on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2184">I kissed the dra -- on my knees I kissed it.</span> <span id="s2185">But I also kissed the ground of Sather Gate which is the entrance port of -- to the University of California, Berkeley.</span> <span id="s2186">And every time I walk under that gate and every time I answer -- enter the grounds of that university, I thank God, I thank America, I thank California for having allowed me and given me this unbelievable privilege that I never, never would have had in France or Germany.</span> <span id="s2187">I and my brother were allowed with nothing, not even speaking the language, but at the end of three years of residence in this country, we were admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, the most pra -- predominant public institution in the world, right, and certainly predominant against an -- a-at that time against any university in the country.</span> <span id="s2188">We were allowed to go there and to attend and to graduate.</span> <span id="s2189">And he would have, if he wanted to, he would have gone the di -- post-graduate school, as I did.</span> <span id="s2190">I went to Berkeley, to Bolt Hall.</span> <span id="s2191">We were treated totally equally, fairly, justly.</span> <span id="s2192">So in every sense the United States gave to -- every opportunity to us.</span> <span id="s2193">We owe every bit of gratitude, you know, and thanks to the United States.</span> <span id="s2194">I mean, look, we came here with nothing, with hope.</span> <span id="s2195">And this beautiful land, this beautiful country, right, gave us every opportunity.</span> <span id="s2196">But we had to earn it.</span> <span id="s2197">And we lived through three years of high school without tutors, without aid, without assistance.</span> <span id="s2198">We had to earn it.</span> <span id="s2199">We earned it.</span> <span id="s2200">And you know what, the rest of the way also we earned, without assistance, without help, right.</span> <span id="s2201">This is a sink or swim society.</span> <span id="s2202">Well, we survived.</span> <span id="s2203">Thank God.</span> <span id="s2204">But it is only in this beautiful land, right, that gives opportunity to so many people, and has, and does, you know.</span> <span id="s2205">So I make a judgment on this country.</span> <span id="s2206">I condemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period, and I praise this country for the period since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s2209">This is tape number five, side A.</span> <span id="s2210">How did your experience of your childhood and your life affect the raising or your children?</span> <span id="s2211">Or did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things.</span> <span id="s2213">I was a very caring and -- and loving father.</span> <span id="s2214">I am still, but I had my faults.</span> <span id="s2215">And part of my fault was that I grew up with a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to counterbalance.</span> <span id="s2216">And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for certain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with anger.</span> <span id="s2217">Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected my personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive than I would have been otherwise.</span> <span id="s2218">I’m easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode, which is -- doesn’t happen often, cause I -- I control it, or it doesn’t give me rise to anger.</span> <span id="s2219">But when I do explode, I explode.</span> <span id="s2220">And so I was a father who was loving and caring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on.</span> <span id="s2221">But if something went wrong or something was not right, they would hear about it plenty.</span> <span id="s2222">And so in that sense my children have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn’t as kind or as considerate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been.</span> <span id="s2223">On the other hand, my children see -- at least my daughter does, because her two sons, our grandsons live close to us and we see them often, once a week at least, and we take them on vacation and so forth, so on.</span> <span id="s2224">Then I’m probably one of their best grandfathers that there is.</span> <span id="s2225">So as much as I, in my pursuit of s -- trying to strive for security for them, once I achieved that, I also was the greatest -- oh -- th -- I -- what am I talking about with my [tape break].</span> <span id="s2226">Hold on, let’s start over, cause I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: No, you can keep talking.</span> <span id="s2228">Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: All right.</span> <span id="s2230">In any event, so the question you ask is did it affect me as I grew up and matured, and it definitely does.</span> <span id="s2231">As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I can easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by somebody’s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very foraci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle.</span> <span id="s2232">And I will have the last word.</span> <span id="s2233">So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger.</span> <span id="s2234">One thing that has helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some of my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many ways.</span> <span id="s2235">To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events, some of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have.</span> <span id="s2236">And part of retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me to -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family.</span> <span id="s2237">And I will say that I believe the reason I became a lawyer was to spend my life, to ensure to whatever degree I had, in capability of opportunity, to make sure that other people are treated fairly, according to deeds, not according to religion or not according to fate or chance.</span> <span id="s2238">And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the state of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I haven’t gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot the Nazis or the Germans.</span> <span id="s2239">I have not taken retaliation against them or others.</span> <span id="s2240">I have accepted the fate that we had, never to forgive, never to forget.</span> <span id="s2241">And that’s an absolute.</span> <span id="s2242">And I remember having lunch with this nun who was the as -- who was the assistant of the Cardinal Mahoney, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern California, one of the preeminent Cardinals in this country, and they had selected me for their -- I was the poster child for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the reunification, or the year redemption between the Catholics and the Jews.</span> <span id="s2243">And they had one edition that was devoted, and I was the centerfold story, in full color, in full everything.</span> <span id="s2244">And a -- after it was done, she came and visited me in my office and we went to lunch together, and I expressed some of this feeling of my anger.</span> <span id="s2245">My anger at what Pope Pius 12th didn’t do.</span> <span id="s2246">What the Catholic archdi -- hierarchy did not do.</span> <span id="s2247">The choices they made, and other Catholics eminence and nuns and -- and [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s2248">Sheltered and hid, saved Jews and the others did the opposite.</span> <span id="s2249">And I told her about these, you know, these mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s2250">And she says -- and I said never to forgive, never to forget.</span> <span id="s2251">She said, of course you should never forget.</span> <span id="s2252">But she says, for your own soul, for yourself, you should forgive.</span> <span id="s2253">So I have to say that between my own therapy in writing about it and talking about it and myself and -- and so forth, and the message that she gave to me, somehow I matured and so I could bring myself to go back and accept the invitation of the state I was born, the city where I was born, to visit.</span> <span id="s2254">And I did it.</span> <span id="s2255">I was very curious to see where I was born, where I come from, you know, this part of my trip, you know, to get my roots.</span> <span id="s2256">And I got it and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2257">I had no resentment, on the contrary.</span> <span id="s2258">The mayor was a perfect English speaking person, who had married an English girl.</span> <span id="s2259">All the people there spoke English perfectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Did you feel very German when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s2262">No, no, no, no, I didn't feel German at all.</span> <span id="s2263">This was my birthplace, I am honored that I was born there, in a university town that my grandfather selected.</span> <span id="s2264">It’s a beautiful town, I just went to my granddaughter’s Bat Mitzvah, and among the guests there is her -- h-her -- one of her uncles, and he works for the Pentagon, you know, in a secret, secret job.</span> <span id="s2265">And he s-said he didn't know where I was born, and I told him, you know, cause I showed him this book, they all wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s2266">So he said, Kiel, I was in Kiel.</span> <span id="s2267">You know, as part of the Pentagon, the -- he visited, and he was th -- you know, toured everywhere and he was taken everywhere.</span> <span id="s2268">He says -- he said to me, that’s a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s2269">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s2270">And it’s a university city.</span> <span id="s2271">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s2272">You know, anyway, I am amazed that many other survivors of the Holocaust that I have met over this period of my life survive what happened to them, and instead of quitting, instead of crying, instead of feeling sorry for themselves, they picked up, right, and said I’m going forward, I’m gonna live, I have to live.</span> <span id="s2273">Right.</span> <span id="s2274">They, you know, perished, you know, not by choice but by the hands of criminals and monsters.</span> <span id="s2275">You know, whether they were the complicit one or the active one, but I’m going to live.</span> <span id="s2276">And so I met a number of them, including one who survived Auschwitz in the -- in a -- that Nazi symbol that was carved on his forehead, and he became one of the early establisher in Australia of the -- the mini-shopping malls.</span> <span id="s2277">A very rich guy.</span> <span id="s2278">And many others.</span> <span id="s2279">They survived.</span> <span id="s2280">They -- they somehow adjusted, you know, and they became husbands and fathers and uncles and -- and grandfathers.</span> <span id="s2281">I think I have the best of all relationship with my grandsons.</span> <span id="s2282">My children love me and so forth, but they remember times when I was not too kind to them, right, when I got angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: A boy and a girl and they each have two.</span> <span id="s2287">My daughter has two boys and my son, who lives in New Jersey has two girls.</span> <span id="s2288">So all we’re doing, us Jews, is reproducing ourselves.</span> <span id="s2289">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: When your children were the age that you were when things got difficult, did that bring back more memories for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2292">I was living to provide them a living, you know, a middle class, you know, living.</span> <span id="s2293">I was, you know, striving as a lawyer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: -- to support a wife and two children, cause that was the custom in those days, the women didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: And -- and I worked hard and they -- they lived a very norm -- normal life, like the other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Are there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: And they did very well.</span> <span id="s2300">They both went to UCLA, they both graduated, right, tremendously.</span> <span id="s2301">My -- my son was a -- the token white in th -- in -- at UCLA, in the school of engineering.</span> <span id="s2302">All the others were Orientals, and he went and went to Carnegie Mellon to get his M.B.A., right.</span> <span id="s2303">He was one of the applauded students when he graduated.</span> <span id="s2304">[indecipherable] They are absolutely active with their children.</span> <span id="s2305">My son is the president of the school board in his city.</span> <span id="s2306">My daughter is the president or head of the -- the PTA in all the schools of her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Are they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: We are all participants, but we are not complainers.</span> <span id="s2309">We’re not -- we don’t seek handouts, we don’t seek s -- other people’s sympathy.</span> <span id="s2310">We don’t need that.</span> <span id="s2311">We create our own environment.</span> <span id="s2312">And that is what’s to be remembered, right?</span> <span id="s2313">That we the victim do not accept ourselves as victim, cause we are stronger and better than those who persecuted us.</span> <span id="s2314">They were criminals but we are the righteous ones.</span> <span id="s2315">And the ones who helped to save us are the righteous ones.</span> <span id="s2316">And yes, maybe a miracle saved us.</span> <span id="s2317">Maybe God did, or maybe he forgot us, but in any event, we didn't quit, and my children haven’t quit and my grandchildren will not quit.</span> <span id="s2318">I wish they were a little bit more religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Did you become more religious because of your experiences --</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: -- religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Same?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: I am -- I am far, far less religious than my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: My wife, when I married my wife, she told me, I will not keep kosher.</span> <span id="s2327">If you want that, don’t marry me.</span> <span id="s2328">Okay, cause she was not raised in a Jewish -- she comes from Jewish parents, but they were not active, religious Jews.</span> <span id="s2329">They were Jews, yes, but not observant Jews.</span> <span id="s2330">So she complies with my requirement, the minimum requirement.</span> <span id="s2331">We are Conservative Jews, we go synagogue, right, twice or three times a year, and our children are Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah, so are my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2332">We are proud to be Jews, we are educated on what Judaism is about and our history and our heritage.</span> <span id="s2333">At least I profoundly honor our people.</span> <span id="s2334">I profoundly proclaim, you know, our history.</span> <span id="s2335">We are second class to nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Are there any sounds or sights or smells that you come across during the day that remind you of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Doesn’t trigger, nothing triggers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: No.</span> <span id="s2340">The only thing that triggers my feeling, my anger or my sadness is, you know, talking about it, or thinking about what happened to my father, what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s2341">The years of pain and suffering that she endured, you know.</span> <span id="s2342">That, you understand, I -- I -- I can never forgive what they did to her, or what they did to him.</span> <span id="s2343">He -- he died in the -- in the -- in the daith -- death labor camp.</span> <span id="s2344">Majdanek was built, designed, devised, operated for one purpose, to kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Do you -- as you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: And I have the records of deportation, I mean, I have the shipment.</span> <span id="s2347">Cumberland number 50, right, from Drancy to Majdanek in these listed -- do you understand on -- on the -- on the -- on the -- the shipment, right?</span> <span id="s2348">I mean, I have everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Do you think more about your childhood as you’ve gotten older?</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2351">Okay, let me put this in -- in the context.</span> <span id="s2352">I think that I grew up and developed very normally in the sense that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: You don’t feel you’ve lost your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Well, i-i-i-i -- le -- let me explain something.</span> <span id="s2355">When I say normally, I say it in the -- in the context that all I overcame, whatever disadvantages, pain and suffering I went through; for example, the fact that I was not educated for many years, right?</span> <span id="s2356">For some reason, whatever happened, in high school I applied myself to the extent necessary to be able to get grades to get into Berkeley.</span> <span id="s2357">Okay, it came.</span> <span id="s2358">And in Berkeley I became very enthusiastic about the discovery of real education, and I became in love with learning, I became in love with the libraries, I -- I became -- I -- the best time I have is when I go to law library.</span> <span id="s2359">You know, I -- I love it.</span> <span id="s2360">But I am an extrovert, you know, I’m out there, you know.</span> <span id="s2361">And I’m not in pain from the experience, and yet I am.</span> <span id="s2362">So I am in this balance, you understand, but I am holding it in equilibrium.</span> <span id="s2363">And it’s only certain time when I get angry and pushed, you know, or I allow myself to, that I lose that equilibrium.</span> <span id="s2364">But even if I do, once I express it, it’s out of me, right, that’s one of the things, the attributes of my personality.</span> <span id="s2365">That once I let out -- I have to let things out.</span> <span id="s2366">I’m not an introvert, I’m an extrovert, and so once I let it out, it’s gone.</span> <span id="s2367">I’m past whatever, you know, the moment is.</span> <span id="s2368">So yes, I am susceptible to get attacked or angry, and to become defensive, I think faster than most people.</span> <span id="s2369">I react trigger-like, you understand, to certain attacks.</span> <span id="s2370">More ferociously than most people, and most trial lawyers.</span> <span id="s2371">I am not an easy adversary.</span> <span id="s2372">If you attack -- as long as you’re civil and professional, hallelujah, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2373">I may even become meek in the process.</span> <span id="s2374">But once you attack, psshht.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Speaking of trials, what was your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Well, okay, you know -- cause this doesn’t evoke just Eichmann.</span> <span id="s2377">At the time he was tried I didn’t know that it was o-on his order, I mean, his direct order that my father was arrested and incarcer -- I did not know that.</span> <span id="s2378">I only knew that he apartami -- epetta -- ep --</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Epitomized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Epitomize, you understand, for Israel, for the Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s2381">Here is a living symbol of all our hate and anger and need for revenge, okay.</span> <span id="s2382">I -- I fully shared whatever was going on.</span> <span id="s2383">I full shared everything Israel did.</span> <span id="s2384">I commend them, I praise them, they are heroes to the world.</span> <span id="s2385">In the manner that they did it, in the fairness and justice that was handed to the man, right, who again, with the use and abuse of the law, right, who had ordered the arrest, the incarceration, the liquidation of six million Jews.</span> <span id="s2386">He, right, who did all that, was accorded just the opposite.</span> <span id="s2387">Every courtesy, every legal rights, every right to defense, everything.</span> <span id="s2388">So I am, on that sense, I felt justice was done.</span> <span id="s2389">Just as much he denied justice to my father.</span> <span id="s2390">But to him justice was done.</span> <span id="s2391">So I -- you know, I don’t -- I know -- no, thank God they -- they found him, they caught him, they tried him, they -- they gave him every chance and the guy confessed, with his damn set of excuses.</span> <span id="s2392">You know, it’s the same with the Germans today.</span> <span id="s2393">When I was invited to Kiel with my cousins and I -- we were the guests of honor of Kiel [indecipherable] for seven or eight days, the time the -- the time that they invite thousands, I believe, of people who man different -- the ships, what are they called?</span> <span id="s2394">With the -- sailboats, they come to regatta in -- in Kiel.</span> <span id="s2395">Kiel is the, you know, so we were there during the whole week, the guest of honor.</span> <span id="s2396">We were taken to every function, to meet everybody.</span> <span id="s2397">And -- okay.</span> <span id="s2398">When we had the reception there with the mayor and we had dinner with him, we had several things with him, and all -- all the other.</span> <span id="s2399">So I was asked to, like my cousin, you know, we all were invited to write in the book, the city.</span> <span id="s2400">There’s pictures of me writing.</span> <span id="s2401">When I was done writing, both good and bad, the mayor turned to me and he says, I want to give you something.</span> <span id="s2402">And he went and got out of a drawer, a picture.</span> <span id="s2403">And the picture is part of the aftermath of the war to the city of Kiel, and it shows, you know, a very -- I have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during the winter in a very heavy snow, and you’ve got a bunch of people who are walking on foot in this desolate, terrible, abysmal area of the remains of the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s2404">Well, of course, the whole city was not destroyed by the British and the American bombers.</span> <span id="s2405">The access to the port were -- the property of my grandfather it was.</span> <span id="s2406">But he gave me that so that I would get the other side of the coin, to which I’m very sensitive.</span> <span id="s2407">Well, we had dinner one night, he and I an-and my cousin.</span> <span id="s2408">I asked him, wh-why did you people invite us?</span> <span id="s2409">And he says, because when we have done it in the past, the goodwill that happened paid for whatever happened on both sides.</span> <span id="s2410">But when we went, the newspaper reported our visit and I -- again, I did not read the whole thing, but the Christian couple who were responsible for bringing attention to us and getting the city and the state to invite us and to give us what I could say is a hundred and five percent, 10 percent, you know, anything that you could expect.</span> <span id="s2411">I mean, I wa -- it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s2412">We had interpreter.</span> <span id="s2413">The -- the Jewish historian Kristina Goldberg who is a professor there interviewed us and she wrote a whole thesis on it.</span> <span id="s2414">She had written the history of our family, which is recorded in these books, right, my grandfather and -- and -- and the rest of us are all part of -- of -- you know, thesis and -- and -- and research that she did.</span> <span id="s2415">But the newspaper wrote an article that the Christian couple, right, begrudge the expenditure by the city and the state for such a lavish state for us.</span> <span id="s2416">So, you know, the Jewish people are very honored in the sense that we have survived by our own means and our own ability to survive.</span> <span id="s2417">Mentally, emotionally, economically, my family did not ask for money --</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Reparation.</span> <span id="s2420">France paid her some money.</span> <span id="s2421">We received my inheritance of my grandparents, you know, I mean the property was evaluated 1950 or ’51.</span> <span id="s2422">The seven of us all received the then appraised value of the land.</span> <span id="s2423">That land is one of the most expensive, income producing land in the city of Kiel.</span> <span id="s2424">Today the stadium was being rebuilt, you know, on that land.</span> <span id="s2425">Of course, other land too, because it’s very big and our property wasn’t that big.</span> <span id="s2426">And it is a place in Kiel, which is in the northern part of Germany, it’s very cold.</span> <span id="s2427">And all of the sports activity, conventions, or -- everything of income producing to the city occurs in that -- in that plaza.</span> <span id="s2428">So we received an appraised value of 1950, of raw land.</span> <span id="s2429">Thirty years later, 40 years later, as a lawyer I wanted to know.</span> <span id="s2430">I wasn’t interested then of the money, in fact, I hated them.</span> <span id="s2431">I don’t hate them more, you know, those who live in Germany today.</span> <span id="s2432">I hate those who -- who sit back, committed all these crimes, yeah, I hated them.</span> <span id="s2433">But not these that are here.</span> <span id="s2434">And I ask because my cousins wanted to know, aren’t we entitled to a proper inheritance, given the value of our property that was taken from us?</span> <span id="s2435">And I asked attorneys for a Jewish, so forth, t-to advise me as to whether not we had rights.</span> <span id="s2436">And I asked through the Christian couple for a set of lawyers in Kiel.</span> <span id="s2437">I was willing to pay whatever it costs.</span> <span id="s2438">And I had these meetings and I had these reviews and they told me to -- you waited too long.</span> <span id="s2439">The Statute of Limitation barred any -- but we did inherit, so -- not much, but it helped to pay for our education.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz.</span> <span id="s2442">This is tape number five, side B, and you were talking about your property in Kiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Okay, I -- I wanted to add something.</span> <span id="s2444">I have collected in these 20 years, with some help, with this Christian couple and also some luck, the confirmation of the events that I have related.</span> <span id="s2445">Everything I have related in terms of factual event is confirmed by documents, records that I’ve collected and I’m sure others, by French historian, by German historian, by the work of -- the records of the German government, of the French government.</span> <span id="s2446">And I want at least the future to understand that what I have stated is the truth.</span> <span id="s2447">Part of that is in this collection of documents and copies of confirmation by these historians and the acts of the state of Germany and the Republic of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: What is the title of the book you’ve been referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: Well, I’m referring to not one, I’m referring to a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: The book that I am referring to, which is my collection that I put together so far, which is a work in progress, I have entitled, “Holocaust documentation to the suffering of the Lakritz - Weber family, 1934 to 1945.”</span> <span id="s2452">On the cover is a page of my family, my father, my mother, my brother and I on the beach in the city of Kiel, Germany when I was a little over two years old and my brother was a -- a few months old.</span> <span id="s2453">I have very few pictures of my family because my mother and my father were afraid that when they would be searched, arrested, that their identity as Jews would be discovered, well -- in this collection that I’m going to leave with the Holocaust Museum, I intend to supplement it by an index of each page and each document and each photograph and each so forth.</span> <span id="s2454">But I do want to say this, that the cover of the book, some of the books made by the city of Kiel, and the state that I was born in, Germany, recites and refers and relates the history of my family, my grandfather in particular.</span> <span id="s2455">The -- Kristina Goldberg is a -- who is a professor over there outside of Kiel, or in Kiel, or by the other town, I’ve forgotten which, but anyway, it’s written about, incented about our family and Kiel and what happened to us.</span> <span id="s2456">She interviewed also after she did it, then she found out we were coming.</span> <span id="s2457">So she, with the permission of the city and the state went along with us, interviewed us and then she wrote another --</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: What -- what year did you go back to Kiel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Kiel we went -- was it 2001?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: I went back to France, I mean, on the thank you trip to the nuns and to the Ros family and to the Guyaux family and the Rozinsky family.</span> <span id="s2462">I went to thank them.</span> <span id="s2463">I made a -- a decision to do it.</span> <span id="s2464">The Catholic archdiocese of southern California helped me to locate this -- these -- these nuns, this order of -- turned out to be the order where Bernadette was a member, and they utilized the Catholic archives in France and elsewhere.</span> <span id="s2465">Incidentally, that congregation was th-the congregation of nuns in La Soeur de la Charité [speaks French].</span> <span id="s2466">Well, I’m sure nobody will translate that properly.</span> <span id="s2467">Anyway, they have acknowledged my -- my -- my being hidden by them.</span> <span id="s2468">They have included me in their -- in their archive.</span> <span id="s2469">Now, everything I have said, all right, the arrest and -- and detention and death of my father is recorded by the French government.</span> <span id="s2470">It is recorded by the German government.</span> <span id="s2471">It is attested to by [indecipherable] in his research, including the very shipment that he was in, and his death, ultimate death in -- in Majdanek, by Lublin.</span> <span id="s2472">The fact that I recited, that I was honored by the Catholic archdiocese to be their poster child, right, is a recorded event.</span> <span id="s2473">It was published in their distributed publication called, “The Tidings”, and this was published in January 2001, because of the second Vatican and because of Pope pi -- Pope Pius -- John Paul th-the -- the -- the second.</span> <span id="s2474">I have included m-many of the pages of the -- the i -- the historical research done by the French historian that I referred to in -- of the Jews of ther -- Lot-et-Garonne, which confirms that what happened to my parents an-and to me.</span> <span id="s2475">The German state where I was born, not only did acknowledge what happened to us, but they also acknowledge the -- the death of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather and the -- the -- the last of my uncles, where they were sent and they were killed, at Riga.</span> <span id="s2476">And the memorial is there, they are listed i-in the deaths of that camp, right, and I was sent all that documentation and th-the -- the efforts that they -- they are -- the city of Kiel is one of the sponsor of that particular monument and maintenance, in perpetuity they told me.</span> <span id="s2477">As I said, the city of Kiel, at my request created finally, a memorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts, throughout, that what’s happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family, because the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said, of -- of memorial and photos and so forth, which ha-has my -- my cousins, my family in it.</span> <span id="s2478">So, I have to say that my family is honored.</span> <span id="s2479">It’s sad to have that as an inheritance, but we don’t feel sorry for ourselves.</span> <span id="s2480">We move forward, we prevail, all right.</span> <span id="s2481">We -- we meet the challenges, and I -- I say that not as a s -- matter of speech, but this is a matter of absolute fact.</span> <span id="s2482">So in what you ask, you know, the question of how did you emotionally, as I understand, I mean, cope with different thing?</span> <span id="s2483">Well, I’ll give you the proof.</span> <span id="s2484">The proof of the pudding is what is the bottom of the balance sheet, right.</span> <span id="s2485">What is it that you did with your life?</span> <span id="s2486">What is it that your brother did?</span> <span id="s2487">What is it your mother did?</span> <span id="s2488">Well, I’ll tell you what my mother did.</span> <span id="s2489">She sacrificed everything for her two sons.</span> <span id="s2490">She worked like hell.</span> <span id="s2491">Every day she would travel, you understand, by the bus, you know, from Oakland to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2492">Every day of her life, right, until she retired.</span> <span id="s2493">Every day she worked to earn enough money, right, so we could go to school, you know?</span> <span id="s2494">Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s2495">We -- she did it.</span> <span id="s2496">Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a little help that was given to her in-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the German government.</span> <span id="s2497">Some by a pension of France, right, cause they were ab-absolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father.</span> <span id="s2498">I mean, that’s absolute.</span> <span id="s2499">I condemn them as total accomplices, okay.</span> <span id="s2500">The fact that my father’s name is on the memorial of the dead in my town, right, the only Jew that is so honored, you know, i-is -- is a -- is -- is a proof of the fact that some French people recognized the enormity of their complicity.</span> <span id="s2501">But to some degree, we have to understand, you know, they had limited choices.</span> <span id="s2502">They could only act at the peril of their own life, and they had to depend on everybody else.</span> <span id="s2503">So, you know, in this whole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster?</span> <span id="s2504">Of course, it’s the German.</span> <span id="s2505">This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and seduced by these -- these -- these monsters.</span> <span id="s2506">So they’re all accomplices, they’re all murderers.</span> <span id="s2507">Under the laws the way we have it in the United States, if you are an accomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder.</span> <span id="s2508">They are guilty of murder, period.</span> <span id="s2509">All of them.</span> <span id="s2510">That’s it.</span> <span id="s2511">Now, again, the -- the -- the importance of my statement here is that there is balance.</span> <span id="s2512">And those who survived, some of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what happened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting.</span> <span id="s2513">I will never forget the murderers of my father.</span> <span id="s2514">Never forget the pain and suffering they inflicted on my mother.</span> <span id="s2515">And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived through what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives, right, for their horrible, horrible death, you know.</span> <span id="s2516">And that is the legacy.</span> <span id="s2517">And I ask myself, why was I allowed to live?</span> <span id="s2518">You know, why was I spared?</span> <span id="s2519">Well, I believe this is one of the reasons.</span> <span id="s2520">This collection of work, my testimony here, right.</span> <span id="s2521">I didn’t give it earlier because I didn’t have all the documents that I wanted, right.</span> <span id="s2522">Now I have it.</span> <span id="s2523">Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too.</span> <span id="s2524">I answer your inquiry, but I’m willing to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned.</span> <span id="s2525">Okay, there is one other point that I need to make.</span> <span id="s2526">The United States of America, to its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the Jews of Europe.</span> <span id="s2527">And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the past but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others.</span> <span id="s2528">And that is a credit, because in the United States, after they recognized what they had done wrong or been complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s2529">They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or ’48, to be more correct, and now, to stand and protect Israel, provide them arms and money and -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone country, the lone voice.</span> <span id="s2530">Many, many time France and England, right, who should have supported, right, Israel, they voted the other way or they remained silent.</span> <span id="s2531">The United States of America, to its great credit, also grew up and learned.</span> <span id="s2532">And the fact that we today even consider that a black could be president of the United States, or a woman become president of the United States finally, I think in great part is the lessons that were learned by the United States to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2533">So the generosity of this country, and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a debt of repayment to what they didn’t do to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2534">But that doesn’t diminish my love for this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: In closing, is there any short message you wanted to give to your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Study, learn, but respect your history and your people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: That’s an important --</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: Thank you for this opportunity, thank you.</span> <span id="s2539">I thank the United States Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2540">I am happy and proud and we are blessed to have this museum.</span> <span id="s2541">May it succeed forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: What a nice note to end on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q:
