id="s14">Answer: I was born on the 21st of September, 1996, 1906, and this, you might wonder why I had the birthday and not age, its because the 21st is Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s15">Yeah.</span>

id="s26">I grew up in, I started out to grow up in Prague.</span> <span id="s27">Before I was four years old, I was almost four years old, my parents moved from Prague to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: To Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Which was the old, in the same country, Prague was in Bohemia, which was in Olsten (ph) Province.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s31">Now, I'd like to focus in on the years before, of course, you began with emigration to Palestine and all that.</span> <span id="s32">How did you get involved, first of all, in the Zionist movement and specifically with Betar (ph) and revisionist and Zionism.</span> <span id="s33">You were involved before you began in, before 1937...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">I recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: How did you get involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I had an uncle Siegmund (ph) Korn (ph), who was a member of the First Zionist Congress in Betar (ph) and he was a convinced Zionist and ____________ interestingly and he explained to me about the Jewish history and about the Jewish building a nation on their own as soon as, who would understand and I was, from the beginning, when I knew that nationally, ethically I am a Jew, was an important issue in Prague, because Prague was the capital of Bohemia and there was a fight for the languages there, between Czech and German, the Jews all held to the German side and all spoke German while most of the population spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s38">But, I was brought up by the incubel (ph).</span> <span id="s39">We had a maid, with whom I spoke only Czech and my parents spoke only Czech with me for the purpose of, that's why Czech is my mother tongue because they said, "German you'll always learn, but you should speak Czech."</span> <span id="s40">And so I was brought up by the incubel (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: So how old were you when, this, your uncle, had this effect on you?</span> <span id="s42">Were you still a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I was four years old.</span> <span id="s44">I don't remember any effect at this time, but I remember that when most of Vienna started using for drawing pencils, pencils of the Jewish National Fund ______________ and he explained it to me what the Jewish National Fund was that it buys land in Palestine and that we will have, that we always had our country there and that we will have our country there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s46">And do you remember anti-semitism growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes, I sure do.</span> <span id="s48">I remember shouting ____________ in Vienna when I came to the playground.</span> <span id="s49">I was sometimes asked, I don't know, sometimes, but I remember _____________, where I was asked, "Are you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s50">and I said, "Yes," and the boy, the student said, "Well we can't play with you," and I asked, "Why?"</span> <span id="s51">So this boy said, "Because you killed Christ.”</span> <span id="s52">And I said, "I didn't kill anybody.”</span> <span id="s53">He said, "Yes, you killed Christ.”</span> <span id="s54">I said, "No" and then he said, "Then you father did.”</span> <span id="s55">He was born (ph) insolent.</span> <span id="s56">And then there was when you traveled in the trains, you, there was a certain habit that if you were in the train and if there was a ______________ with you and you were in quarters ____________compartments that eight people if you traveled third class and that one of them starts out holding his nose and set his teeth, there must be a Jew here.</span> <span id="s57">I remember that this happened once and we left their compartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Now, were your parents also Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s60">They tended towards Zionism, but at the same time they did not know much about Jewish history and but they identified very strongly with Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s62">When you were a young adult in, in Vienna, you went to law school, you became a..</span> <span id="s63">.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">I went first to elementary school, a special elementary school that my parents sent me to.</span> <span id="s66">It was a school that was run by the City of Vienna as a letter-building _____________, a training school for teachers.</span> <span id="s67">And _____________, you are supposed to go five years to elementary school and then to the middle school or to the gymnasium, but you could after four years already miss any particular examinations unless you skip the fifth year as I did (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: At what point did you actually get involved organizationally with a revisionist, with Betar (ph), how old were you, what...?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I was involved at about 16, 17 years of age.</span> <span id="s70">Yes, but I had been before at the Zionist Congress in Carlsbad in about 1920 with my father, ______________ nearby in Marinebarton (ph) and I, before all of this was going on in Jewish matters.</span> <span id="s71">They asked that Jewish _____________ be ascribed to and my father told me stories about I was very fascinated as he turned it into stories about what happened to the other 10 tribes.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s73">So, in Vienna, to go ahead to the early 1930's, of course, in January, 1933, Hitler comes to power in Germany.</span> <span id="s74">How did that affect your Zionist activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, you must know I had belonged before to Zionist Student, Student Fraternity, but it was not academic students, it was not yet at a university.</span> <span id="s76">It was in a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s77">And it was ____________, but Zionism in Vienna had a very strong look and national Jewish component, because it was led by Robert (ph) Schlecker (ph), Robert Schlecker was the leader of the Olsten (ph) Jews and he was a good friend of my uncle, Siegmund Korn (ph), because both had been very good student at First Zionist Congress ____________ from Bruno (ph) in Moravia and my uncle from Prague and they continued their contact in Vienna, so I was somehow all this in the group which had student ____________.</span> <span id="s78">Zionism has a very strong local node which was at least as much ____________ to us national assistance, assistance of national ____________ as Zionism.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s80">So, but after Hitler's rise to power...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you feel, I mean, was your Zionist activities strengthened?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yeah, but I was before this already very much in the Jewish Student Movement.</span> <span id="s84">I was in the Jewish Academic ______________ Israel, that was one of the corporations which had been Zionist from the beginning of Zionism and I had, yesterday only I got a postcard I think it's not a postcard, I think it is a photocopy of Heffa (ph) in which he writes to _______________Israel, "To my dear corporation Israel" and to fraternities they are very different to fraternities here.</span> <span id="s85">They are a small group, usually not more than 10 or 12 at the most, would have to be accepted by unanimous vote and I was very much in this fraternity.</span> <span id="s86">This was a dueling fraternity.</span> <span id="s87">I fought two duels from quite old times (ph).</span> <span id="s88">Here you can still see a little bit, but most of this is gone.</span> <span id="s89">I fought two duels in my, in my student times.</span> <span id="s90">And this was all very much ____ Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s91">I was at Vienna investigated by the University of Vienna for having started a riot there.</span> <span id="s92">Which I really did one, once.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: That was about 1928 or '29, probably '29.</span> <span id="s95">Every Saturday, the Jewish older fraternities went on a boomer (ph) on the parade (ph) to the university ____________ everyone had a place where they stood and the Jewish students, national fraternities to which the ____ was one, the second oldest, the oldest was Fatima (ph) after whom a saint was recently named, Jerusalem, then Fatima had a place, too, and from time to time the German students, the nationalist fraternity, stood next to us, they started to beat us and to throw us out of the university and before this happened every time they sung a certain song and then after they sung it, they kicked us out.</span> <span id="s96">And once you knew only from the atmosphere that it was to happen before they started the song and once when they were close to starting the song, I then walked up there and said, "I want to speak to your leader" and said, as soon as I came to him, I was brought to him and said I had to leave a message from the Jewish student organizations, bang-then I hit him very hard which, of course, immediately that I was grabbed and beaten and kicked out, but the fight developed in the university and we were all thrown out as we usually were, but at that time it was not that you risked your lives, they just beat you.</span> <span id="s97">Once only at such a riot a man was badly injured and this was the son of Sigmund Freud, Martin Freud was his name.</span> <span id="s98">He became a lawyer.</span> <span id="s99">He was badly injured at one of those fights and I was accused of having starting the riot at the university just so, but the others had started the riots and I usually would not, they would throw us out anyhow, so I started it.</span> <span id="s100">And this is very interesting political ____________, the rector(ph), the do you director, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Director of the University, Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at that time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian.</span> <span id="s103">He was applied by the theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was ____and I told him, "You don't think that I would be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?"</span> <span id="s104">And of the newspapers in Vienna, they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for the chance to hear to have the director of the university who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned.</span> <span id="s105">That was all.</span> <span id="s106">I could have been excluded from the university ______________, because he had told me, I had told him, "You know that you really don't start this" and he said, "____ I don't know.”</span> <span id="s107">Well, he was very mild (ph) and the journalists were waiting outside for me to come out with accusations toward the Director and I told them he was a nice man, he has a very liberal attitude so this makes a nice story, too.</span> <span id="s108">So they had a big story that a priest who is not radical and who is most pleasant sort and had very good press and shortly after that the Olsten (ph) party formed a coalition to look for a Minister of Social Welfare and they got him because he was accepted to the liberal school.</span> <span id="s109">I think this has something to do with my, with my____ until I was mentioned by the____ and he became Minister of Social Welfare and he was one of the Olsten Provision (ph) government and then they told the Cardinal of Vienna died and he was well-liked by everybody, that they made him, the Pope made him Cardinal for Vienna, but he behaved very badly, well, the, the Nazis came in and he was the first one to turn to the Nazis and publish a poster, "Heil Hitler," which he agreed very much with the regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Let me ask you, during these early years, did you at any time think of settling in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: The event (ph), which is just what I wanted to emphasize, Zionism was very much of a national minority that is you ____________ of it, primary understanding for national minority, so the Jews were very satisfied that the League of Nations had adopted a law for protection of minorities and this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were least protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So, how specifically did you get involved specifically with the Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radical.</span> <span id="s114">I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to Israel when I was...1935, I was 29 years old.</span> <span id="s115">I went to Israel, but before this 1935 I went to the Congress in Zurich (ph).</span> <span id="s116">Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s117">And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech.</span> <span id="s118">But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in Catovitz (ph), which was a revisionist _____________ a few years before this, as I was very much impressed.</span> <span id="s119">He was a most impressive personality.</span> <span id="s120">I knew him well.</span> <span id="s121">A book came out recently by Shotz (ph) in ______________ manages very permanently (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: What was it about Gobutinski that impressed you, that type of Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No, it was not only the Zionism, it was the personality.</span> <span id="s124">He was an excellent orator and then he came to Vienna.</span> <span id="s125">Everybody went to hear him.</span> <span id="s126">He didn't advertise what he's talking about.</span> <span id="s127">They had a big placard that said, "Gobutinski's Speech", "Gobutinski ______________.”</span> <span id="s128">And that was enough to have people come there.</span> <span id="s129">And he is not only, I don't think he could give it a specific name.</span> <span id="s130">Half of Zionism seems (ph) one and the Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did your activities intensify between...after 1933?</span> <span id="s132">I mean you were very active well before 1933, but then, when Hitler came to power, at the time did you see that as a seminal event at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I don't remember what I thought at the time.</span> <span id="s134">But I was very active in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s135">The Jewish community has been a assimilical (ph) community with the old people coming to well-to-do Jews who are running it and after that ____________.</span> <span id="s136">Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was active in the viacom (ph) in the fight, in the fight, for getting elected into this Jewish community.</span> <span id="s137">The Jewish community was something entirely different than it is here or anywhere.</span> <span id="s138">By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not.</span> <span id="s139">And to put, they tax you.</span> <span id="s140">If you didn't pay your tax to the Jewish community, the tax ____________ of the government taxed your property.</span> <span id="s141">They had very officious tactics, this Jewish community.</span> <span id="s142">There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the ______________; "I don't want to be a Jew any more," and you were not in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s143">So the Jewish community was really direct presentation of the Jews and I was very active for, for the Zionists, for Zionists who finally got the majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Now when did you begin to, with the issue of emigration what was termed illegal emigration.</span> <span id="s145">How did you arrive at that as a solution?</span> <span id="s146">How did you come to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: When Hitler came to power in Germany, the refugees come over from Germany to Vienna, mainly well-to-do people, and they were in Vienna and their children sometimes had the desire to go to Palestine and they couldn't get visas, certificates from Betar (ph).</span> <span id="s148">The Betar (ph) was the strongest Jewish organization in Vienna and you couldn't get any number of certificates ____________.</span> <span id="s149">You know emigration was very limited by ability and the people of the leftist organization, of the liberal group, they got most of the certificates, but the Betar didn't get enough certificates.</span> <span id="s150">so one day I was in my office just as I described here, I was a lawyer, and a man came in and said, "I have a message from Dr. Wolfgang ____________, who was a Viennese Zionist from an old Vienna family, a nobility, which was very rare for Jews and his message was, "Bill, Willy, listen to this man, he has something interesting to say", and he suggested that we, he said I have some contact with...he was a Palestinian Jewish Patriot Adventurer, he was a real adventurer, and he said that I have contact with underground in Greece and I suggested following it, rent a boat from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: This is 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: This was 1936, that we...could have been '35.</span> <span id="s153">That we rent a boat from them and put our batterime (ph) on it and for people who really want to emigrate and on the way to supposedly going to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph).</span> <span id="s154">We really wanted them to be ______________ as a very rich and well-to-do, a center of power, a country should be run (ph) and there was much propaganda to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph) and he said, "We ride the boat to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph)?"</span> <span id="s155">But if we don't come to the Vierra De Tripoli, it was only the batterime (ph) will force the ____ to go to Palestine instead and there will be a big stinking develop because Jews from good houses that pilot the ship and go to...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You wanted the publicity...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: We wanted the publicity in order to point out to the world that in spite of the need to, a land to go to, in spite of what the League of Nations has decided on the strength of ____________ that this should be a Jewish nation alone, Palestine, that this is not being done.</span> <span id="s158">And.</span> <span id="s159">.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Was this successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: This is what was suggested to me.</span> <span id="s162">His name was Shriebelstein (ph) G-R-I-V-O-L-H-E-I-N (ph) Moshe Grivolhein, Galinin.</span> <span id="s163">He changed his to Galinin (ph), and I saw a different ____.</span> <span id="s164">I said, "This propaganda is very good, but we can do better.</span> <span id="s165">We can bring the people in and try to smuggle (ph) them in."</span> <span id="s166">He said there would be no problem with the _____________ because the problem being in the ____________of this ____________, so try to smuggle (ph) them in but you're going to help us to smuggle them in and we'll smuggle them in once, twice, three times until they catch us; then we will have the publicity, and in the meanwhile, ____ you people into Israel.</span> <span id="s167">And he agreed to that.</span> <span id="s168">This is when we started organizing the first two transports; we did not get enough people to go with the first one, the people were scared to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: So you had to convince people to...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, I was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s171">I would be able to smuggle them.</span> <span id="s172">There was not so much need yet.</span> <span id="s173">And so I traveled to Eastern Slovakia, Topachkarusha, Russia (ph) it was called, it was part of Slovakia and there the policy was very great about the Jews and from there you go up to Tareem (ph) to some ____________ I think only two or three batterime (ph) from Vienna of the first 16 people, 15 or 16 that had transports, I have the number here, which ____________ to Palestine.</span> <span id="s174">Independent of this, which I did not know that Gobutinski had called at one of his articles for breakings of the rules of the British persuasions and to make illegal propaganda and to make it a Jewish spot, but it was already, it had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What part did they leave from in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Different...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Different.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Different parts.</span> <span id="s179">First you came by train to Greece and then left from Athens, but the problem was that the British demonstrated, the British government demonstrated, with the governments of those countries, that they supported by letting the Jews in.</span> <span id="s180">But we needed, they said, "How do you know ____illegally into Palestine?"</span> <span id="s181">They said, "Because they don't have a visa to go anywhere to.”</span> <span id="s182">So, we had a man, Dr. Diamand, a very educated scholar, who told us, we formed a small group, The Axion (ph), who was the active action group within the revisionist party, about five or six people, and he told us, "You know the danube is international, it is an international treaty about the danube that you can go down the danube without visa to the seaport, because Britain now intervenes with all these countries, with Slovakia, with Hungary, with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, that they shouldn't let our ships through.</span> <span id="s183">Well, our ships went through without problems, without visa, so we went down the danube until they came with and we did not know, generally assumed, and I am always asked, "How did you get out?"</span> <span id="s184">It was no problem to get out; the problem was to get in!</span> <span id="s185">The problem with all of them is the very end, then the problem to get out, of course, it was not possible to get out anymore, because at the same time it was closed, the borders were closed and it was after the Panzer (ph) conference and you can't get out anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Clearly, in the 1930's which we're talking about now, so you're saying the problem wasn't leaving Europe, the problem was nowhere to go, who would accept Jewish refugees at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: The Germans helped the people travel up in German ____________ down the danube with us about 1500 miles I think, so all this ____ to the German ships flying the Nazi flag and they are loaded with refugees and turn in Galas (ph), which is over in the Donow (ph) Delta, in the Delta where the Donow gets into the Black Sea and Gallas (ph), which was the biggest ____ port ____ which is already on the ocean and Tunashaveshal (ph), which is a small place, which I was informed that Nazis traveled to the grave (ph) ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And when you talk about, when you mentioned, you referred before to the Jewish pirates, did they literally force the ships to go to...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No.</span> <span id="s190">The plan was changed.</span> <span id="s191">The plan was changed.</span> <span id="s192">They smuggled ____________ course and the ____________ was a seagoing ship to little boats and the first ships there was nothing on it, no arrangement had been made on the land.</span> <span id="s193">They just jumped into the water and fought around, just jumped into the water and swam the little place intending to look for Jewish places where they could hide, but soon the ____ took over the distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q. Right, so, so the first few transports were, in fact, successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A. Very successful, because we boated people out.</span> <span id="s196">We didn't have so many.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q.</span> <span id="s198">When was the first time a ship was caught, I mean, by the British, you know, at Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A.

S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with William Perl.</span> <span id="s205">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s207">I had spoken of the Pareta, you asked me the first ship which was caught.</span> <span id="s208">I am not sure any more, but the Pareta was one of the first ships...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Now was that at the beginning of the war, the Pareta was around...?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: It was not war yet, it was the fall of 1937, it was the summer of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: So it was right before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Very shortly before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: I'd like to go back to 1938...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And the Aunschluss (ph) and that day and the period following it, do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: That morning I was in the house of a friend of mine for a sabbath meal Friday evening when we knew all the time that the situation was very dangerous for us there and there was a notice that the Russian (ph) chancellor had received an ultimatum from Germany for complete surrender and Churchill went on the radio while we were eating just after the lighting of the candles and said that he had gotten an ultimatum from Germany to surrender and he does not want to shed blood and that is why he surrenders and______________ that was, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: And, after the Aunschluss (ph), did your Zionist activities or activities related to emigration, did they intensify even more, did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Everybody first tried to get out.</span> <span id="s219">Not everybody, but very many tried to get out and went to the borders and the borders, they are closed.</span> <span id="s220">Within the 48 hours the borders were closed.</span> <span id="s221">The first people, particularly the Hungarian and Czech borders, which are very close, they are both close and the people who try to escape, they were arrested because _____________ to try to escape and were in trouble.</span> <span id="s222">Especially in trouble, everyone was in trouble.</span> <span id="s223">And, but some very inventive people did not go to these near borders, they went to the far borders of Austria, but Marx (ph) did not go yet, the Viennese Jews, the Austrian Jews, practically all of them lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s224">They went to the ____________ (ph); they went to the Italian border and went into Italy.</span> <span id="s225">Dr. Edmund Schechter (ph), who was one of the leaders of the Revisionist organization, he was out that first night because he, instead of going to the border, to the nearest border, he went to a far border and see they still don't know yet about the stream of refugees.</span> <span id="s226">And he got in.</span> <span id="s227">And Dr. Wolfhef Hofiver (ph) went to the French soldiers, so from Germany to the French border, so he got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Was there an intensification of arrests of Jews immediately following the Aunschluss (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s230">The same night already there are people arrested, a few, but the next day more are arrested, but there are all still Nazis.</span> <span id="s231">This was on early Friday, on Sunday the Gestapo moved in, officially till Monday they would be already started.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Were the Zionists targeted?</span> <span id="s233">Did you feel especially afraid being your Zionist activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: The first day Nazis went to the houses of the members of the leaders of the community and they arrested the president of the community, Dr. Davidof (ph) Friedman, who perished, was killed.</span> <span id="s235">They arrested Dr. Yachov Ehrlich (ph), who was the, represented, only the regional representative of the Vienna City Council and he was brought to Dachau and four or five days later, there was listed the Viennese community got a letter from the Jewish community in Munich that, "We have the remains of Dr. Yachov Ehrlich, who died in the concentration camp at Dachau.</span> <span id="s236">If you want to have the remains, will you please send, tell us ____________ to..." and then everybody knew that this means business.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Now you were summoned to the office of Eichmann...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I was actually not summoned.</span> <span id="s239">I went there because there was older leaders of the organization were summoned to the office, to the Zionist organization's office, which was in the Marcraurel (ph), after the Roman Emperor who founded the City of Vienna, Marcraurel (ph), I think the houses the Zionist offices.</span> <span id="s240">And there the leaders were summoned there.</span> <span id="s241">But the leaders _____________ had fled.</span> <span id="s242">_____________ and Wolfhef Hofiver (ph) had fled and I was one of the, the three people who were at that time in charge of the Revisionist organization.</span> <span id="s243">But they didn't inform me, but I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Why did you go to Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: To meet him, to represent the Revisionists, because the other two had run.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Why did you try to...what did you say to Eichmann?</span> <span id="s247">What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I have had this prepared for you.</span> <span id="s249">I might have given it to you already, the memorandum which started the whole thing.</span> <span id="s250">I told Eichmann, first of all Eichmann asked me, I didn't have to say anything.</span> <span id="s251">He asked me several questions which showed me that he knows conditions in Israel.</span> <span id="s252">He asked me about ____ and so, and he asked me, "How about that Diamand (ph), where is Diamand?"</span> <span id="s253">I do not know Diamand.</span> <span id="s254">I said, "Who is Diamand?"</span> <span id="s255">He said, "Diamand who organized the bulk up (ph) of German Jews in Belgium and Poland."</span> <span id="s256">I said, "I do not know about him."</span> <span id="s257">They put me on the wall (ph), towards the wall with the face toward the wall and said, "Now I want to know who, where Diamand is and what you know about him."</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: He was threatening your life if you didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Was he threatening your life if you didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Sure, he put his gun into my (cough), into my back and said, "I'll give you a second, a second..." How did he put it?</span> <span id="s262">He said, "I'll give you a second naber (ph)."</span> <span id="s263">And I didn't, he didn't count down yet.</span> <span id="s264">And he said, "Now, I'll count down to three and if you don't tell me about where Diamand is and where I can find him, I'll give you, I'll make you a second asshole," and he went a little lower with his rifle, with his gun, which was not a rifle, it was a pistol.</span> <span id="s265">And I really did not know him.</span> <span id="s266">So I told him, I did some fast thinking, but I was full with fear.</span> <span id="s267">I told him, "I don't know about Diamand, but I can tell you something which is much more important for you.</span> <span id="s268">It is political information about the possibility of ____________ Jewish organizing emigration.”</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So he was receptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: He was receptive.</span> <span id="s271">He went and he was interested in other members of the Betar (ph) who were _____________ Erick Deutsch, who was my best friend.</span> <span id="s272">Erick Deutsch and I and two or three members of the Betar went with him after he had ____ and we stayed with him already.</span> <span id="s273">We weren't allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s274">Went in his car, not in his car, the police van, to the office of the Revisionist organization.</span> <span id="s275">And there, you know, they were not very organized yet at the time.</span> <span id="s276">And we had been organizing the bulk of German groups, more than anybody else, more than this Diamand and Erick Deutsch had taken older materials referred to the bulk up (ph) German groups and put it into the stairwell at the entrance of that, but the Jew who was around it to pack it was being arrested right away.</span> <span id="s277">And he put it out there and they searched the whole office and didn't find it, much about the ____________ bulk up (ph) of German groups (ph).</span> <span id="s278">If this is okay, I would say something which is very interesting.</span> <span id="s279">In ____this bulk up (ph) of German groups which started, was started by Gobutinski (ph) right after Germany came to power and the Revisionists were very active, but the Americans were getting into it, too.</span> <span id="s280">Gobutinski gave a speech in Bradislav (ph).</span> <span id="s281">I came to Vienna and Bradislav is now the capital of Slovakia and was a rather small city, but with a strong Jewish population about 60 miles from Vienna and he gave speech there and we went there all together to listen to him.</span> <span id="s282">And he said, "The Germans want equality.</span> <span id="s283">We should not give them equality.</span> <span id="s284">They want equality of arms; they want equality of freedom of trade.</span> <span id="s285">None of this do they deserve and a man in the audience, a heckler, got up and said, "But Mr. Gobutinski, denying equality means a denial of our own history."</span> <span id="s286">And the Betar wanted to get this heckler, to kick him out, and he said, "No, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s287">I'll tell you and, a story."</span> <span id="s288">"There was once in Paris, in France, a very well-known patriot, a Marquis who was very patriotic every time the Marciess (ph) was played, or sung, he got up, whatever the conditions and saluted (ph) and one night burglars broke into his house and he reached for his pistol under his pillow and while he, but when as soon as they started, one of them jumped to the spinet and started to play the Marciess (ph) and this Marquis was standing in his nightgown in his bed, saluting, while burglars robbed him of everything he had.</span> <span id="s289">What was this man?</span> <span id="s290">He said, "Marciess (ph) or the storyteller.”</span> <span id="s291">"The Marciess is whole (ph) but this man was an idiot!"</span> <span id="s292">It doesn't have a lot to do with holocaust, but it tells you a little bit about what type of personality Gobutinski was and, of course,_____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: So you say the primary concern then was not trying to regain equality but getting Jews out of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Specifically to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I read this memorandum, I told him I would give him a memorandum and I made out a memorandum which I had to translate into English because the German is so poor I had a carbon copy of it, but the carbon copy is not so good.</span> <span id="s298">I think I gave a carbon copy before to the museum, I don't know.</span> <span id="s299">But it is very poor, it is hardly legible, and I am now about to translate it, it is three pages long and so at the beginning of the second page it is dear to us and making the Germans understand that this is not really doing something very illegal ____ .</span> <span id="s300">Of course, it was illegal, but this memorandum by ____ about, I didn't hear from him, about 10 days later, which I don't know whether it was 10 days, my feeling today is I was sitting in, I was sitting in the outside in the anteroom to the president of the ______________ of the Jewish community and Eichmann was one of his bodyguards which came in and Martin (ph) complained that he saw me sitting there and he pointed me and said, "Oh Cesar (ph) assume Oh Cesar (ph) ___________________________", which is actually nothing will be with it, because we do not want to censor a place for criminality in Palestine.</span> <span id="s301">The Jews have to be autobon (ph).</span> <span id="s302">At this time, autobon (ph) did mean _____________ destroyed into many pieces, into atoms.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So he didn't buy your proposal?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I was ____________.</span> <span id="s307">I went to Berlin to complain about Eichmann.</span> <span id="s308">He was crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you, at the time, think you were crazy or were you confident?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, I knew that I have to overcome him, but only three more minutes to Berlin I changed my plan.</span> <span id="s311">I will not complain about him, but will try to make it appear that I am upset by him.</span> <span id="s312">If they find out, they find out, but the chance that I survive if the plan survived is better than if I say and complain about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: And I went to see Dr. Kareski (ph).</span> <span id="s315">Kareski was a lawyer in Berlin who was a Revisionist and he told me, "You are crazy to complain, the second plans are (ph).</span> <span id="s316">He said, "What do you need from here?"</span> <span id="s317">I think I need permission from the Gestapo to go ahead with the emigration.</span> <span id="s318">He said, what do you, I need the Gestapo Eichmann to, not to get special permission but to permit that we do it because the Jewish couldn't do anything without permission.</span> <span id="s319">Well, ____________ of the Gestapo to organize the next transport and the German lawyer was very practical and said, "You need foreign currency, too?"</span> <span id="s320">I said, "Of course, I do.”</span> <span id="s321">He said, "If you put anywhere, put it all in one ____________ foreign currency.”</span> <span id="s322">So I went the next day in Berlin where the conditions are still much better than in Vienna because in Germany the percentage of Jews in Germany was much smaller than in Vienna.</span> <span id="s323">Vienna was 10 percent Jews in very leading positions.</span> <span id="s324">A large percentage of the lawyers, of the doctors, of the physicians were Jews.</span> <span id="s325">So, much less anti-semitism and much Nazism going on in Berlin than in Vienna a few days after the Aunschluss, but all Germany was happy Vienna return of Austria to Germany ____________ has never been part of Germany.</span> <span id="s326">Germany has been part of Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: When you were in Berlin, which Nazis did you speak with?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I don't know his name, but I know, you see, I went to the Ministry of Economics, used to be Ministry, to get permission to use for the emigration foreign currency.</span> <span id="s329">And I did not know anybody there so I went in and I said...there was a guard, an armed guard, and he asked, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s330">And I told him, "I want to see Mr. So-and-So.”</span> <span id="s331">I think I asked him to give me a name, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s332">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s333">I don't think I knew any names and we went into this _____________, this elevator which went up all the time _____________ anymore and to some floor and I went out and I looked at the sign and I didn't know to look for a certain name and somebody with an impressive title, but went in with two of his favorshein (ph) and told him we had been sent from Vienna in regards to the emigration of Jews.</span> <span id="s334">It was very important and he listened to me very attentively and said, "It is very interesting, but I have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s335">See Mr. So-and-So."</span> <span id="s336">So I went to Mr. So-and-So and told him, "Mr. So-and-So, there was already somebody.</span> <span id="s337">They sent me to you.</span> <span id="s338">We are sent from Vienna and ____________ we are sent by the authorities in Vienna, not by the Betar (ph)."</span> <span id="s339">And he listened and said, "I have nothing to do with it."</span> <span id="s340">But, I said, "Who has to do with it, with the foreign currency?"</span> <span id="s341">Oh, he sent me to the right man and I repeated it for a third time the story and he was impressed.</span> <span id="s342">Everyone wanted to get rid of the Jews since I made it clear the situation had changed completely with ______________ of Austria and there is I say a memorandum too.</span> <span id="s343">And he said, "Let me have a memorandum.”</span> <span id="s344">And I made the memorandum which I asked for Vienna and made a few adjustments I had it typed and it describes ____________ buildings where _____________ and went back to them and give it to them on the first day it was and two days later, or three days later, I got the permission for 2,000 people, 12 pounds in foreign currency.</span> <span id="s345">We originally ______________ and we now started to tell the people, "Get your passports.”</span> <span id="s346">The Battarime (ph) started to get their passports and the word soon spread that you can go with the Betar (ph) with the Paragon (ph) which they were soon called, because on the door of the office of my lawyers was written, Dr. Willy Perle, ____ transport and people came in and one day shortly after apparently a neighbor had reported some suspicious looking men or Jews meeting there and the police came and raided us.</span> <span id="s347">And I showed them the permits from Berlin.</span> <span id="s348">This way Eichmann learned, Eichmann learned that I had the permission from Berlin and he shut up.</span> <span id="s349">He did not know more.</span> <span id="s350">And from this moment on, he played along very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So he wasn't angry at you, that you sort of went around his back.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: He did not know.</span> <span id="s353">He did not know.</span> <span id="s354">I don't think he knew how I worked it.</span> <span id="s355">He just knew that the police had raided our office and that we had the permission from Berlin with currency even from Berlin.</span> <span id="s356">He didn't, the German proverb, "If you have a boot on your head you don't go into the sun; if you boot (ph) on your head, you don't go into the sun.”</span> <span id="s357">He had been overruled.</span> <span id="s358">And he didn't want to see our trouble, I believe, so he went along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: So at this point in the late, after the Aunschluss...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: That was in May of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Okay, so you were still arranging for the transports from various ports still in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: At this time, I was very attached alone still in the ship operations, only one.</span> <span id="s363">I give him the money, 2,000 pounds, that he goes to Greece and gets us a boat and he came inside the boat, but in the meanwhile I was arrested.</span> <span id="s364">I was arrested in the, I think it was for my axion (ph) my action (ph).</span> <span id="s365">_____________ was arresting Jews by the hundreds, just by then somebody the name outside, dentists or what, they looked into the houses and ______________ somebody _____________ and they arrested them.</span> <span id="s366">And I thought when they arrested me it might have to do something with the transports and we had a meeting of the Betar, Erick Wolfe (ph), and I don't know who else from the Betar there and I was to ______________ but I should report to the police because the police had been at my office and said that I should come to the police about to question me.</span> <span id="s367">They wanted to ask me some questions.</span> <span id="s368">And the probability was that they just wanted to arrest me, but we decided since it is possible that news from Favorshein (ph).</span> <span id="s369">We were very nervous because Favorshein (ph) had stayed already a long time ______________he was not known.</span> <span id="s370">If he was _____________ 2,000 pounds.</span> <span id="s371">Everyone connected with this would have been arrested; they would have been killed before cheating the government out of foreign currency.</span> <span id="s372">We would have been killed right away.</span> <span id="s373">But, in the meanwhile, Favorshein (ph) came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So how long were you in the jail?</span> <span id="s375">You were in jail...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I was in the ____________, in the emergency jail.</span> <span id="s377">There was a full______________.</span> <span id="s378">I was in the emergency jail in the Catayanga (ph) Vienna, a very Jewish district, just one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s380">And when you, after you were released and you continued with your activities involved in the shipping and...</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: How was I released?</span> <span id="s382">How was I released?</span> <span id="s383">First of all, I was _____________.</span> <span id="s384">I did not have the chance, I was afraid they'd say now finish the work for our people outside who are organizing the Battarime (ph) is looking for them and have their passports ready and so on, so we went in prison in the basement, it was not a prison, of a school and there was a window up there and out this window you could see the soldier patrolling and he used a certain time to come back again and then the fingers when he was close to the end, we threw, we threw out the paper, several papers ______________ little balls of paper which we had prepared information and one woman came by and I saw a woman's feet and shoes so I threw it out and I was sitting on somebody's, I don't remember whether I did it, it might have been somebody else who did it, sat on the shoulders of another guy at the window and threw out a little ball of paper which was written, "____________ help us.</span> <span id="s385">Bring this notice to decencies (ph)" and she brought it to the people and they ordered the transports to come out and ____________ and next day I was, next morning, or afternoon, I was going to the office of the man who was in charge of this business, he was a viennese overlord or first lieutenant of police.</span> <span id="s386">And he asked me, "Do you know somebody so-and-so?"</span> <span id="s387">I said, "I don't know.”</span> <span id="s388">I know so many people, I don't know.</span> <span id="s389">He said, "He claims that you have your passport."</span> <span id="s390">"How come you have his passport?"</span> <span id="s391">So I said, "I don't have ____ already there are 100 passports.”</span> <span id="s392">I said, "I don't have only his passport, but I have some 300 passports.”</span> <span id="s393">He said, "What?"</span> <span id="s394">I said, "Yes, I have some 300 passports."</span> <span id="s395">"How come you serving (ph) passports?"</span> <span id="s396">I said, "Because I am overriding the emigration of Jews from Vienna is all.”</span> <span id="s397">And then, the intentions are (ph), he said, "Haahaaa(ph)" "Where are they at now?"</span> <span id="s398">I said, "I can't do anything, _____________ you keep me in ____________.”</span> <span id="s399">So he called Dr. Langen.</span> <span id="s400">Dr. Langen was the Chief of the Gestapo, he was later on ____________ in the Panzer ______________.</span> <span id="s401">He said, "Eichmann is not superior.</span> <span id="s402">Eichmann was only responsible for Jewish questions.</span> <span id="s403">There were other problems, too.”</span> <span id="s404">And he asked for Eichmann, first he asked for Eichmann.</span> <span id="s405">My mother, the mother of all the Jews who went out, Eichmann was not in.</span> <span id="s406">So ____________ superior.</span> <span id="s407">And he says, "I have a Jew here who claims that he is organizing transportation where there was no illegal transport emigration for Jews can take place unless it is out of ____________.</span> <span id="s408">And he says, "Okay, you are released.”</span> <span id="s409">He asked me, "When does your transport leave?"</span> <span id="s410">I told him about nine days ago, the hour, ____.</span> <span id="s411">And he says, "Oh fooey (ph), _____________ anything_____________ information from Jewish ____.</span> <span id="s412">So I told him again, exactly what time.</span> <span id="s413">I told him the time.</span> <span id="s414">I told him what time at which the train was probably leaving at the railroad station from which it was leaving.</span> <span id="s415">He said, "You go, you are out and on the train which is supposed to leave at 9:30 in the evening by 10:30 you have to be here to report here.”</span> <span id="s416">I said, "I won't look."</span> <span id="s417">I said, "Why don't you?"</span> <span id="s418">He said, "Because I can't do it alone.”</span> <span id="s419">I said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s420">I said, "My _____________ operator, ____________ ______________ is here too.</span> <span id="s421">He's out and I can't do a thing.”</span> <span id="s422">He said, "Okay for _____________ and he (ph) had Erick Deutsch called in and Erick Deutsch entered and saw me sitting there with the police officer and the police officer asked him, "Do you

boot, heavily and he didn't, still didn't get up.</span> <span id="s479">So he kicked him a second time, now blood came out of his mouth and he kicked him to death, apparently he, until he couldn't move any more.</span> <span id="s480">Shortly after this Eichmann(ph) came in and Eichmann(ph) he had ___________ stick, how do you call this little stick?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: The little

know, to go out and when we, on the way to the door, it was already from the door, were these, we knew the buses are waiting outside as far away as ____________.</span> <span id="s491">I shouted to

Jew?"</span> <span id="s493">I said, "I have important information for Dr. Lange(ph), if it doesn't get to him right away, you will be responsible for it."</span> <span id="s494">So he, Lange(ph) was about 10 steps ____________, so he brought he us to Lange(ph), Lange(ph) seemed not to remember for a moment, but then he remembered, he says, "Yes, these two people go out."</span> <span id="s495">And we went out.</span> <span id="s496">And now everything was fully permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Maybe, now could you tell what happened in the following time period as the

people left on the transport on the ninth of June, mainly ____________, everybody had the chance to come along, we got money from the Jewish community and there were many others left to ____________ 386 but I might estimate about 300 of them were ___________ and the others were Jews whom we took along.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Did, was there ever a time period, in terms of arranging these transports, where you were in a position where you had to choose, like you do the choosing in terms of who would actually be on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you want younger people?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: It was the most difficult, it was the most difficult thing, as the times became more difficult, it was, to tell somebody that you can't come along was a death sentence and there is one kid who shall never forget, which still ____________ me.</span> <span id="s523">I was in Budapest and according to an arrangement with the police, I could take Jews out of the jail, with the people who had come over the border from Czechoslovakia or Poland without papers and were in Hungarian jails and, and I had, it was a condition for their cooperating with us, take a certain number of Jews from Hungarian jails and from Hungary along and they, they brought me to, I says, "I want to interview them."</span> <span id="s524">And they brought me, there was a man about 40, 45 years old, in the cell there and I was to interview him and when I came in he knew that how important it is, but he didn't ___________ finish his ___________, he was praying a prayer, which must not be interrupted.</span> <span id="s525">And I spoke to him and he looked to me like he would ___________ like to be taken along.</span> <span id="s526">And I said, "Now has he a wife?"</span> <span id="s527">He said, "The wife ___________ , " he did know something which torpedoed the whole thing, the wife was very badly, is very, she's very sick.</span> <span id="s528">We couldn't take sick people along.</span> <span id="s529">So I was taken to see the wife in the same prison in another room and she was spitting blood and she had apparently quite advanced tuberculosis, or anyhow she was not a candidate and I had to tell him that they cannot go along.</span> <span id="s530">This still oppresses me because no doubt they ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s531">But you had, had to make the decision whom we take along all the time.</span> <span id="s532">First of all we took along young people, who were able to withstand any problems of the trip which was very problematic how we do it.</span> <span id="s533">Each boat was different.</span> <span id="s534">And then people who were Jewish, Jewish commitment was the first thing, if possible, they had the priority Jewish commitment and young.</span> <span id="s535">And then people who were needed for ____________, means somebody who was not so young, but was a nurse, we took her along, physicians we took along, although ____________ out of us.</span> <span id="s536">_____________ these positions very often and it became more and more until we were

Brooklyn, they go to the restaurant, that I would be half partner, we would be half partners in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s539">So people tried to sort of like make deals, or bribe their way...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Of course they did.</span> <span id="s541">They tried to save their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: When you chose young people or people who had, you know, needed professions such as in medical care, etcetera, was that just, for the, the, the ride itself, the transport itself or were you thinking ahead in terms of the Yushuv(ph), in terms of...</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I ___________ I heard of the need to fight the British ___________.</span> <span id="s544">To fight the fight for liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: All right, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: You see, what we did is we took on the British Empire, you see, we were six people, five, the sixth one was not so healthy from the beginning and we took on the British Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And after this, you went to London, at...</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: ____________ on the ninth, they took a transport there and ___________ talk to the, to them, to the ____________, they were flabbergasted, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s549">As I came to the, to the railroad stations, there was Lange(ph), Lange(ph) and Eichmann(ph) and Tryacowich(ph) standing, so I didn't know how to greet him, what should I tell them?</span> <span id="s550">And Tryacowich(ph) came to me and reached my hand and said, "Good evening, Herr ___________."</span> <span id="s551">And it was quite ___________ and I decided then and afterward that I will leave after the war, if he's in trouble, I'll help him.</span> <span id="s552">But I didn't, I couldn't because he was accused in Austria and convicted of war crimes against Austrian refugees but he was also in Holland ___________ responsible for the deportation of Anne Frank, who, my real desire, but without him the whole thing wouldn't have worked.</span> <span id="s553">There were many happy circumstances and I was one of those who was responsible for the whole thing.</span> <span id="s554">But I couldn't testify for him.</span> <span id="s555">I could have testified that he is at the bottom of the rescue of many thousands of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: How many, do you know approximately how many were rescued through this transport means?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes, yeah, the opinions vary between 20,000 and 40,000.</span> <span id="s558">I say it was at least 40,000 ____________ British statistics, which I will probably ____________.</span> <span id="s559">You see, was hard ___________ German, because the ships changed their names during that ___________ and it helped many people, ____________ their own, you see, there was no official transportation any more, because the Mediterranean become a war zone.</span> <span id="s560">Many people rented a little sailboat and came over.</span> <span id="s561">And here, here has the British statistics, which you probably will want to photograph.</span> <span id="s562">There's the document, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Will you just state the name of the book that you're taking this information from?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah, ____________ photograph ___________ The Forefront War, I think there are photographs here.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: The Forefront War.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Here they are.</span> <span id="s567">No, there are not photographs here.</span> <span id="s568">But I'll give you a copy of the statistics.</span> <span id="s569">____________ have some photographs here.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So this...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: The British ___________, was from the fall of 1939 to the end of the, of the Nazi empire, some 21,000 people immigrated illegally into

thousands of people into the country.</span> <span id="s573">We started in, in June, on ____________, the ninth of June, 1938.</span> <span id="s574">Which was one reason, the second reason were ships changed their names and many people came in on their own, so I, I believe that the British knew only of about half of the people, though I asked them, they said 40,000 people roughly, who entered Palestine illegally, since we started this...</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So this is, this is quite a large rescue operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, ____________.</span></p>

id="s583">A: Gildemeser has contact with the British embassy and he got me an English visa and I wanted to go to London to speak with Jabotinsky(ph) to organize it on a large scale and to ____________ can organize it without a, I didn't think that the Germans would want ____________ giving of foreign currency, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So you were nervous at some point this was going to be cut off?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s586">And I wanted to organize it in the other countries too, in Poland, Poland wasn't ___________ yet, but it was clear it was coming, ___________ Russian and for this I wanted to speak with Jabotinsky(ph) and ask him to, you know.</span> <span id="s587">I got the visa through Mr. Gildemeser and spoke to Jabotinsky(ph)

operations, then the Ergoon(ph) takes over.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Now you're mentioning frequently the, the Ergoon(ph) and the cooperation of the Ergoon(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Was, within the Zionist framework, the Ergoon(ph) was, you know, one segment that of course, there was a lot of opposition to the Ergoon(ph), even within the Zionist world.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Did you, was there opposition to what you were doing, I'm talking about within the Zionist community?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, very much opposition.</span> <span id="s595">The Jewish establishment was against it because they wanted to get good, on good terms with the British and they figured that they need the British after the war, the war was coming, there was no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s596">But after the war, they'll need the British for they, whatever they wanted to and to annoy the British they didn't understand what we understood, that it is not a question of favor that you do to somebody, international politics is a question of power.</span> <span id="s597">So they, they were against us.</span> <span id="s598">_____________ soldiers?</span> <span id="s599">No.</span> <span id="s600">Well.</span> <span id="s601">Jabotinsky asked an official if,

the application for a grant to the 380 emigrants from Austria, who recently reached Palestine, was again considered with great care.</span> <span id="s605">The executive of the council strongly deprecates all emigration which is not properly organized and which does not make proper provision for the welfare of the emigrants.</span> <span id="s606">The executive cannot in any way encourage illegal immigration into Palestine and for this reason, cannot make any contribution towards the object which your letter refers.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: It was the official ___________.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Right, from the Council for German Jewry.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And this was also published in The

and was there tension between the, these two groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No.</span> <span id="s622">But there was no local ____________, in much later stage only, there was some cooperation.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Right, so initially there was no tension but not, no cooperation either?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s626">Now when you were in London, speaking with Jabotinsky, how long were you in London for?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: From the 10th of June, for about, for about four weeks...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: And then, and then, in the meanwhile, could have been six weeks, in the meanwhile, the, the revisionist who stayed

without ____________ to Athens and they, two people from the Batar(ph) were ____________, who was a member of the ___________ of leaders, ____________ leaders...</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q:

<span id="s989">This is only that _____________ was so well organized yet when they came in, that they didn't have me on their list.</span> <span id="s990">They asked me about the name, ______________ _____________, the name of somebody who had been organizing it in the Baltic.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Was there, were there Jews who didn't want a boycott?</span> <span id="s992">Did you consider yourself alone in trying to organize a boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No I did not consider myself alone.</span> <span id="s994">We had quite a positive response.</span> <span id="s995">But there were many who for principal reasons were against the boycott.</span> <span id="s996">I'll never forget a meeting in Bratislava (ph), ____________, which is about 40 miles east of Vienna and now it is Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s997">When ____________ came to give a speech there, we all ___________ there to listen to it.</span> <span id="s998">And he spoke then about the boycott.</span> <span id="s999">It must have been somewhere between 1934 and 1948, it probably was in 1935 or 1936.</span> <span id="s1000">And he said, "The Germans are against the boycott because they ______ up, this is unfair.</span> <span id="s1001">We have to be equal.</span> <span id="s1002">We are prejudice against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1003">The Germans have the right to

says, indicated they should leave him, and he said, "Either you resist or you will be sorry."</span> <span id="s1007">Many years ago in France lived a marquee (ph) who was known for his patriotism.</span> <span id="s1008">One of his arguments was that whenever the __________ was played, wherever it was, whatever the circumstances, he stood up and stood at attention and saluted.</span> <span id="s1009">This was known.</span> <span id="s1010">One day, burglars broke into this house and he reached for his pistol below his pillow, in order to defend himself, and one of the burglars sit down at the piano, at the spinet, and started playing the ____________.</span> <span id="s1011">And this man stood up in his nightgown, with his nightcap, at attention and saluted

idiot.</span> <span id="s1014">So there are people, it was a wonderful irony, I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s1015">And this man was one of the few who were against us.</span> <span id="s1016">There were people who for principal reasons said we cannot be against anybody's equality.</span> <span id="s1017">And this, with boycotting somebody, and they can't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And were there people, either in the Zionist movement, not in the revisionist Zionist movement, who perhaps felt that the approach of trying to boycott and leave Europe was wrong?</span> <span id="s1019">That you should perhaps stay in Europe and try to fight for equal rights in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: I don't understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Your activities with the ___________, your focus was escape from Europe, leaving Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Not yet at that point.</span> <span id="s1023">As I

id="s1025">Just one last question about the boycott.</span> <span id="s1026">Were, is it fair to say that most of the organizers of the boycott were (a) Zionist and (b) revisionists?</span> <span id="s1027">Was this a Zionist activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No, this crossed party lines.</span> <span id="s1029">There was strong support from America in it.</span> <span id="s1030">And the organized boycott of German goods, I remember, we were against the _________ swimming suits, against beer, aspirin and beer, pharmaceuticals, and we were quite successful in __________

Germany.</span> <span id="s1035">And also they wanted to see Switzerland, went through the detour and traveled through Paris and through London.</span> <span id="s1036">Because it was, as I said, with an alternative, we were very happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1038">I would just like to ask, we're going to jump ahead to 1940, and in 1940 you came to the

Yes.</span> <span id="s1042">I was in jail in Athens, I was in practically all the jails in the Balkans, in Yugoslavia, in Greece and in Romania and in Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s1043">And then I was in jail in Athens because the minister, the ambassadors of Great Britain had protested against Marxism (ph) again, very sharply, the Greek Foreign Office _________ document us through this.</span> <span id="s1044">Where the British Ambassador reports home that I have intervened, the success, and William Perl is already deported.</span> <span id="s1045">And I was arrested and deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: The British Ambassador was protesting your activities because you were trying to bring Judaism to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1048">That is an answer to your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Or how I got to the United States?</span> <span id="s1051">Well, after this I was in Athens, then I was released, and was in Athens.</span> <span id="s1052">And then on the day the war broke out, I got on the Orient Express and traveled to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1053">This was very unlikely that I could travel so freely with the Jew passport that ______ have.</span> <span id="s1054">But I had arranged for to get a British entrance visa, which was the very high, highly valued.</span> <span id="s1055">And everybody knew Britain, the USA is in with Britain, so everybody tried to get into Britain.</span> <span id="s1056">And I had gone in, Bucharest (ph), where the embassy of course knew of my activities for the British Embassy, through the Embassy to get the visa, which seems impossible.</span> <span id="s1057">And I said I want to speak to the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s1058">And the guy asked, "What is it about?"</span> <span id="s1059">I said, "About my intention which I will speak about only to the Ambassador."</span> <span id="s1060">So the Ambassador didn't come, but the secretary of his came, and I told him, "I want to go to Britain because I want to organize there.</span> <span id="s1061">Just need money for the transport as I can do it on a larger scale."</span> <span id="s1062">Of course I would have been arrested right away in Britain.</span> <span id="s1063">So they tried to catch me by giving me a visa to Britain and to writing already on the visa, it was written, for recreation.</span> <span id="s1064">For recreation, that was underlined.</span> <span id="s1065">So that they don't have to prove anything legally, that I was there for recreation.</span> <span id="s1066">If I wasn't there for this, like these other things, that they could arrest me.</span> <span id="s1067">With this British visa, but with the other ___________, I was transit visas all over.</span> <span id="s1068">I could travel from there to, from actually __________, from Greece via Italy, via Yugoslavia, and Italy to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1069">And in Switzerland, I organized, continued to organize.</span> <span id="s1070">The war was on and I continued organizing and I organized there.</span> <span id="s1071">Then the largest transport ever of any group, it was __________.</span> <span id="s1072">At least 2,300 and some people.</span> <span id="s1073">I organized this from Switzerland, together with Dr. Ruben Heitz (ph), whom you probably know by name.</span> <span id="s1074">And in Italy I was arrested again.</span> <span id="s1075">I went back to Greece and was again arrested in Greece because things had been figured out for me, and was deported to the airport and from the airport I flew to Portugal.</span> <span id="s1076">And in Portugal I went from there, from Portugal, to continue the illegal transports.</span> <span id="s1077">_____________ illegal transports equal to ____________ via the Mediterranean from Portugal.</span> <span id="s1078">But I couldn't because then I was _________, for the first or second time, into the Port of Lisbon in order to negotiate ___________ which ship owners would be agreeable to going to this business.</span> <span id="s1079">There were no Greeks there.</span> <span id="s1080">A man came to me and while I was in the docks looking for a pair of sunglasses, I turned and he was standing next to me and said, "Dr. Perl, if you show yourself just once more in the Port here, we will have you arrested and deported back to Germany."</span> <span id="s1081">Now this was the end.</span> <span id="s1082">Then I was in Lisbon, they couldn't get a visa anymore.</span> <span id="s1083">Then there was a rumor that you can get visas to Shanghai and I went and got the visa to Shanghai, to China.</span> <span id="s1084">Of course, knowing that the visa exists means nothing because you had to go to a ___________ at that time and I was, I took a boat, a ship, which was to go from Lisbon to Lorenzo-Marches (ph) which was in Mozambique, for the east colony on the south-east coast of Africa, and from there I was suppose to get a visa to, try to get a visa to the United States, which was very hard.</span> <span id="s1085">But what is interesting, for the whole story of the Holocaust is, that it was impossible to get an American visa anywhere.</span> <span id="s1086">This boat landed the first time on the island of San Tome' (ph).</span> <span id="s1087">This was a freighter, _________, San Tome' (ph), the name was Mun-din-o (ph).</span> <span id="s1088">And there I went to ask for an American visa and this man had in San Tome' (ph), he had figures, numbers for entrance into America.</span> <span id="s1089">Who, what Jew, ___________, a little island of San Tome' (ph) asked for everything possible ________ to keep the Jews out.</span> <span id="s1090">And I sailed to Portugal, to shorten the story, in Portugal there was a very friendly American consulate who sold me American, I should go to America.</span> <span id="s1091">Er, to Mozambique.</span> <span id="s1092">Who sold me America, I should go to America.</span> <span id="s1093">I could not go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1094">I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1095">Back on the boat was an older man, an industrialists from Israel, from Palestine there.</span> <span id="s1096">And he told me keep out from the _______ time is not good because you have to get, if you want to get from Africa to Palestine you have to row by a _________ and the British will get you there.</span> <span id="s1097">If they will get you, they will get you in Palestine and there you will be busy and ________, important, time and effort trying to get you out so you keep out from Palestine.</span> <span id="s1098">So I decided to go really not to America.</span> <span id="s1099">This man gave me the visa to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Besides this there was a price on his head.</span> <span id="s1101">In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: By the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1104">I know but I have never be able to establish it by document.</span> <span id="s1105">I was told by the British, I was told by everybody that there's a price of 1,000 pounds on my head, but I have not established this by document.</span> <span id="s1106">They were serious, they wanted to catch me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Is this how you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No, you are in Mozambique now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: In Mozambique.</span> <span id="s1110">I had an interesting story for the Holocaust situation, how the State Department there.</span> <span id="s1111">I went to the consulate there, to the American consulate, and he says, "Yes, it's a very good idea the young man come to America."</span> <span id="s1112">I said, "Here's my passport that I have for a visa."</span> <span id="s1113">He says, "It's late now, come tomorrow morning."</span> <span id="s1114">So I left.</span> <span id="s1115">The next morning, he had spoken with his secretary who was much better informed than he, and she told me you cannot get to America without an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1116">So I was full of ___________, what do you need for an affidavit?</span> <span id="s1117">She says, "Certified by an American citizen who is reliable."</span> <span id="s1118">__________________ ________________ ___________ you shouldn't become a burden to their system."</span> <span id="s1119">So he said, "Do you have somebody?"</span> <span id="s1120">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1121">But you can do it.</span> <span id="s1122">Why don't you do it?"</span> <span id="s1123">And he said he was ready to do it but then something came up and I needed a quota number, and that's what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s1124">He didn't have, of course in Mozambique, a quota number but there were quota numbers in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s1125">Nothing in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s1126">What's the capital of South Africa?</span> <span id="s1127">What was it?</span> <span id="s1128">It doesn't come to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Johannesburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Johannesburg was the capital.</span> <span id="s1131">Yes.</span> <span id="s1132">Capetown was the biggest city and Johannesburg was the capital.</span> <span id="s1133">They had quota numbers for Czech Jews, for Czech's to America.</span> <span id="s1134">So that's how they, see, quota numbers existed where ______________.</span> <span id="s1135">So I couldn't, he couldn't give this to me so I said, "From the visa I have in my passport a visa for permanent residence in Venezuela", which I have acquired, this was not worried, I knew that I had some connections in Athens.</span> <span id="s1136">And on the strength of this I got his visa.</span> <span id="s1137">The transit visa to America.</span> <span id="s1138">But now that I _________ he said ____________ ship coming.</span> <span id="s1139">Now that I had this, in two or three days, I had some foreign ship that travels to America and he said, "You can travel with them."</span> <span id="s1140">I said, "No, I wait for an American ship."</span> <span id="s1141">Because Roosevelt, at that time, when you were in __________, flying Dutchman's they are called, the refugees on the ships, they got you on the ship legally, and at no account did they want to take them.</span> <span id="s1142">They stayed for months and for years on the boats.</span> <span id="s1143">So I wanted to wait for an American ship.</span> <span id="s1144">I waited for another week and an American ship from the _________ in Baltimore came in, a freighter with the name of Mary.</span> <span id="s1145">And I went to buy a ticket there and the Captain told me, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1146">I can't take you.</span> <span id="s1147">I know of this flying Dutchman, I can't take you."</span> <span id="s1148">So I told him, "Listen, if you find somebody, if you're out on the high seas and you find somebody drowning, do you ask for his entrance visa or do you save him?"</span> <span id="s1149">He said, "I save him, that's my duty, the duty of the seas."</span> <span id="s1150">I said, "Well I am in great danger because the Portuguese will deport me to Germany unless I leave here.</span> <span id="s1151">I have to get on a transit."</span> <span id="s1152">_________ Portugal, so even if this will go to China, they will deport me.</span> <span id="s1153">So I never wanted to.</span> <span id="s1154">So the Portuguese will deport me to Germany.</span> <span id="s1155">And so he said, "Okay, let me think it over."</span> <span id="s1156">He was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s1157">And I went right away to the Portuguese police and told them you have to give me a certificate that you will deport me because, even if I have to stay here.</span> <span id="s1158">They give me a confirmation that unless I leave this island in the permitted time of one month they will _______________ I will be deported.</span> <span id="s1159">With this I came to Captain Broaderick (ph) and showed it to him.</span> <span id="s1160">So he said, I'm a drowning man, he has to take me.</span> <span id="s1161">So I arrived and in Baltimore with the _________ on a freighter, it was a freighter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: In 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: In September, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Now I want to go to what the focus of the conversation will be, and that's really your return to Europe.</span> <span id="s1165">You go back to Europe as an American soldier in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1167">1944.</span> <span id="s1168">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Let me just ask about the years between 1940 and 1944.</span> <span id="s1170">You were living in the United States.</span> <span id="s1171">Were you aware of what, the nature of what was happening to Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Not to the full extent, no.</span> <span id="s1173">I knew that they are being deported to the east and I assumed they let them starve there and died there because this was not, this couldn't be for a resettlement.</span> <span id="s1174">They took the people out, dying people and sick people and people who could hardly stand up.</span> <span id="s1175">The old, and they put them on those trains, and for resettling in the east.</span> <span id="s1176">But the mass murders I did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: And when you, when in June, when in 1944 did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: To America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: To Europe.</span> <span id="s1180">In 1944, I'm sorry, back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: In 1944.</span> <span id="s1182">I was in, I had a very good job in the military intelligence and I asked them, when I was safe there and did very important work where I used all my knowledge of countries and so on, and, but with the invasion on the 6th of June, it was 1944 was the invasion, I couldn't keep back.</span> <span id="s1183">I wanted to get over and I volunteered for overseas duty.</span> <span id="s1184">And I got a commission until __________ was only a ___________.</span> <span id="s1185">And I got a commission in the military intelligence, and shortly after the invasion, maybe in August, I arrived in Britain.</span> <span id="s1186">With an American transport.</span> <span id="s1187">I don't remember the name which it has under the military but before it had been a passenger ship for the ____________, I don't remember her name.</span> <span id="s1188">Oh, __________ was the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: And where were you at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: At the end of the war I was in Has-felt (ph), a prisoner of war camp in Central Germany.</span> <span id="s1191">Then the news came that Hitler, that Germany has surrendered, I was there on that day, I remember how the GIs shot into the air all night long.</span> <span id="s1192">You couldn’t sleep because there was shooting all night long.</span> <span id="s1193">This was on the 7th of May, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: You were a prisoner there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No.</span> <span id="s1196">I was an American officer.</span> <span id="s1197">I was in charge of an interrogation team.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: And after May 7th, May 8th, VE Day, what was your next step?</span> <span id="s1199">What was your next location?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: I was interrogating prisoners for whom certain information was desired.</span> <span id="s1201">Especially I was charged with specific information, there were four interrogation teams, MFIU (Mobile Field Interrogation Units).</span> <span id="s1202">This belongs to, we're not attached to any Army, we were attached but didn't belong, we were not under the _________ of command.</span> <span id="s1203">We were directly in command from the Headquarters and ____________.</span> <span id="s1204">And I was at least one of those, and I use to interrogate prisoners who were of interest.</span> <span id="s1205">Before we had many prisoners, we interviewed them for broadcasting.</span> <span id="s1206">We already know what should go into our propaganda broadcast.</span> <span id="s1207">_____________________.</span> <span id="s1208">This deal had question marks, questionnaires.</span> <span id="s1209">But in life this is not a game so they didn't have to sign it.</span> <span id="s1210">Who is best liked in Germany?</span> <span id="s1211">Who is least liked?</span> <span id="s1212">So that we called American propaganda could concentrate on the least liked ones.</span> <span id="s1213">And then concentrate for example on Hitler.</span> <span id="s1214">Everybody loves Hitler.</span> <span id="s1215">Hitler was, you couldn't say anything about Hitler.</span> <span id="s1216">But ________ was the most ___________, and so on.</span> <span id="s1217">Until after a number of questionnaires were ___________ to the intelligence services I didn't always know why.</span> <span id="s1218">And this is what I did until about the beginning of September, or late in August, when we already had __________ in Germany, not in Germany, they had settled the first German town, which the name of it was Pirl.</span> <span id="s1219">I never knew of this town or this village.</span> <span id="s1220">When I was transferred at my request from London to the mainland.</span> <span id="s1221">And I was in this military intelligence on the mainland until I took _________ out of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Which was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: On the 22nd of June, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Now at what point after the war's end, or maybe before, I don't know, did it become clear to you what really had happened?</span> <span id="s1225">The extent of the Final Solution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: All this became clear to me as soon as I started interrogating prisoners of rank and all the _________ trials in England.</span> <span id="s1227">And I was assigned there to assist the combined services, detailed to ______________ which was the highest level interrogation center for the allied army.</span> <span id="s1228">All the allied armies had representatives there.</span> <span id="s1229">The Dutch and the Belgium and the Australians.</span> <span id="s1230">And I was __________ there as an American representative.</span> <span id="s1231">And there I heard for the first time, one of the first prisoners who told me about it told me about the gassing in the vans.</span> <span id="s1232">That they took people into the vans, gassed the people, he had worked on it.</span> <span id="s1233">I knew.</span> <span id="s1234">He said he didn't, but I got information from him.</span> <span id="s1235">I was not allowed to arrest him.</span> <span id="s1236">I wanted information about the vans.</span> <span id="s1237">And whatever.</span> <span id="s1238">So in turn I heard from others who had seen mass shootings in the east, but none of them knew about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: At the war's end, did you know or have knowledge of whether Mrs. Perl was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: No.</span> <span id="s1241">I knew that she had been arrested.</span> <span id="s1242">I knew that she had been arrested just before, she had to be arrested because she is ____________ when she wants to do something ideally she will do it.</span> <span id="s1243">And I knew that she would hide people, which she did.</span> <span id="s1244">And that she wouldn't be very careful about it I knew too.</span> <span id="s1245">And besides this she wrote me a letter, that she had visitors.</span> <span id="s1246">She was for a few days gone and she had visitors, when she came home she had visitors from Puno (ph).</span> <span id="s1247">Puno (ph) was the capital of ____________ who was a communist and was arrested among the first ones in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1248">And so here, in both concentration camps, so Puno (ph) was the keyword to us for concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1249">And she said, all Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1250">She will visit us from Puno (ph), or something like that.</span> <span id="s1251">So I knew that she, that she was not arrested, she was only brought to the Gestapo, she talked there three hours, but she continued.</span> <span id="s1252">And then when they arrested her and brought her to the Rounds-berg (ph) concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1253">But I knew at the time in which we are talking about now, or at the end of the war, I knew that she was in, must have been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1254">I knew about concentration camps there, I knew about Auschwitz by then.</span> <span id="s1255">Not the details but I knew that there are mass murders there and I wondering, I worried that she is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: How did you find out that she in fact was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Well, that's a story.</span> <span id="s1258">The other commanding officer, we were all European Jews in this unit, this was specialized concentrated on important information which was expected.</span> <span id="s1259">___________ very cleverly assigned a job.</span> <span id="s1260">My job was, at one time, ______________ to find out whether, if you chased allies armies approach and uprisings of the ___________ against the Nazis and they would be expected.</span> <span id="s1261">I found out, I knew this from the beginning, that there was to be no uprising because they were much too clever for that.</span> <span id="s1262">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: And you had the pass to go to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1265">I go on the 20th of June, this was about three weeks after the surrender of Germany.</span> <span id="s1266">I got a pass from the commanding officer to go, ______________, I said I have my wife, ________, want to visit her.</span> <span id="s1267">I know she will be in a camp, he didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1268">Though he said, ___________ not on the list of APO's, I give you one to visit the nearest APO.</span> <span id="s1269">I told him the nearest APO is, I don't remember where it was, it was still in the American zone, and he gave us, and this _________ two people on that trip.</span> <span id="s1270">Started off a very famous _________ family, a Count, Franz Josef ______________, he came from a very well known Austrian family, the Baron _____________.</span> <span id="s1271">And foreign ministers and prime ministers of Austria.</span> <span id="s1272">And he came with me.</span> <span id="s1273">And then a Jewish fellow by the name of, what was his name?</span> <span id="s1274">He was _____________, because ______________.</span> <span id="s1275">This was important that I remember but ________ ___________, his name was Frank (ph), he had a mother who lived in Vienna, and I make a passport out for the three of us to get into Russian occupied territory.</span> <span id="s1276">Which was very strictly forbidden at that time because negotiations with the Americans and the Russians went up where we would be and they are not, and the Russians were very suspicious anyhow.</span> <span id="s1277">And a journalist who admitted to, had ____________ his _________ to Berlin was supported from the entire theatre of all operations, sent back to Germany, so there was quite some trouble.</span> <span id="s1278">But I said I am going to Vienna, I'll find __________.</span> <span id="s1279">And I made the passport in Russian, out to me, with just the undersigned, not the undersigned, the officer William Perl, Serial Number so-and-so, will proceed in US Military Favor, and the number of the jeep, which I never filled out, and the border date, I had to fill it out.</span> <span id="s1280">Into Russian occupied territory, and then the Russians, our Russian allies are requested to be helpful to him in every way possible.</span> <span id="s1281">And I signed it myself.</span> <span id="s1282">So that if they shoot me, some trouble, I shall say, what do you want?</span> <span id="s1283">This is nothing forced.</span> <span id="s1284">This is my request to you.</span> <span id="s1285">So with this I got through to the allies, _____________ Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1287">And after you were reunited with Mrs. Perl, what, did you stay in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">[end of side one, tape 4]</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: . . . in an hour I got her into the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: There is something you ought to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1292">It was like in a movie which I never saw, we foresee that, and imagine, it was dark already.</span> <span id="s1293">And in the light of the jeep you saw these Russians, not the, the Russian horses, small horses, these wagons coming back.</span> <span id="s1294">They went back with little wagons and pulled us into Russia.</span> <span id="s1295">They had taken this, and with them came the Russian Flea Circus, who had been brought by the Germans to Russia to work there.</span> <span id="s1296">And this Flea Circus had robbed the Germans of everything they could.</span> <span id="s1297">I didn't mind that.</span> <span id="s1298">There was the women, they are sitting next to the driver of the horses, and there are dressed in fantastic ways.</span> <span id="s1299">They had stolen or robbed the Germans, the drapes, and sewed these gowns and they were wrapped into this, green and red and blue, shiny.</span> <span id="s1300">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1301">And then it was again after we passed, it was pitch dark and we ran into a hole, there was a bump hole, and we came to a river where you couldn't cross, and so on.</span> <span id="s1302">And this trip was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1303">Of course, for her it was the first _______________.</span> <span id="s1304">Where I said __________________.</span> <span id="s1305">Sure now we got into American territory because she had no paper.</span> <span id="s1306">I filled out, I had a paper that said she has been arrested as a ____________.</span> <span id="s1307">And as the ___________ beckoned, I changed the ______________, she sat in some apartment with some German family where I arrived at night and we stayed all night until early in the morning I came and reported to the Major that I brought my wife back.</span> <span id="s1308">He was horrified.</span> <span id="s1309">It was a time where every contact with any lower citizen who was not American, with any lower citizen was strictly forbidden.</span> <span id="s1310">It was very taboo.</span> <span id="s1311">Which was idiotic because you couldn't speak to your parents who might still be alive.</span> <span id="s1312">But he was horrified about it and he was scion of the Philadelphia, a very rich, very well known family.</span> <span id="s1313">This was about all he was.</span> <span id="s1314">And he called the headquarters of intelligence, I assume, and said what had happened.</span> <span id="s1315">Because earlier we were afraid of political complications with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1316">And so he says, "You proceed now to Batch-schwiber (ph), this is of course the military intelligence headquarters for Germany, and report there to so-and-so.</span> <span id="s1317">And I took Laura (ph) into the jeep and instead of going to ____________, she was quite sick, she was, looked like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s1318">And brought her to a hospital in ___________, Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1319">Which disappointed her, and continued to Batch-schwiber (ph) and there I was seen by the General, who said, "What is this, it is horrible what you did, Perl."</span> <span id="s1320">I said, "Yes I know.</span> <span id="s1321">But you have to know the story."</span> <span id="s1322">I told him the story and then he says, "What should I do with you?"</span> <span id="s1323">I says, "Sir, wait a moment.</span> <span id="s1324">Sir, what would you have done in my place?"</span> <span id="s1325">So he think for a second and he says, "Hell I would have done the same."</span> <span id="s1326">And he said, "Is it all right with you if I transfer you to another unit and out of military intelligence because this is too much for intelligence.</span> <span id="s1327">To another unit and take you off the promotion list?"</span> <span id="s1328">There was a listing where I was to be promoted to First Lieutenant from Second Lieutenant.</span> <span id="s1329">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s1330">I was promoted three weeks later.</span> <span id="s1331">So I was then offered this, and I was then transferred to war crimes.</span> <span id="s1332">You see, most people ridicule the army because they will send people in the wrong spot.</span> <span id="s1333">I was always in the military in the right spot.</span> <span id="s1334">I was in intelligence when it was really important to be in intelligence.</span> <span id="s1335">And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes, and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1337">I want to ask you in a minute about the war crimes, but just one other thing.</span> <span id="s1338">You found Mrs. Perl, of course.</span> <span id="s1339">Were you in any way trying to look for relatives, friends, Jewish friends who you thought might have perished during the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1340">Your, people who were a part of your life before you

out alive, but there were no known Jews to be left in Vienna at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: What happened to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: My brother?</span> <span id="s1346">He went with the first larger transport to Israel, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1347">But most of my relatives went with those ships but some didn't want to take the risk of the ships and they perished.</span> <span id="s1348">I had about fourteen relatives, including cousins, first cousins.</span> <span id="s1349">If I go farther it would be more.</span> <span id="s1350">Fourteen people who were murdered by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Do you know or did you know how they were murdered?</span> <span id="s1352">Do you know if they were deported to camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: I know only of one.</span> <span id="s1354">__________ ___________ who helped me with the transport.</span> <span id="s1355">He had established a branch of this in Prague, and one day he was transferred from his office into the _____________ camp, which was a somewhat better type of concentration camp, much better than the others.</span> <span id="s1356">And there he was kept until one of the last ones, where he was organizer, for the German, he was a leader among the Jews, a German agent.</span> <span id="s1357">And he was on his way back, they didn't send him to Auschwitz, he went on a trip, on a train to Auschwitz, but on his papers was written "RO", _____________ ____________, Return Undesirable.</span> <span id="s1358">And he was taken out of the first step, the _________, the fortress of _____________ of _____________, was taken out and killed there.</span> <span id="s1359">This is the only one about whom I know.</span> <span id="s1360">And one cousin I do not know where she knows this from, but I had a cousin who survived in Vienna because she was married to a Jew, but he was racially only half a Jew, so she somehow, she _____________, and from her I know that her mother was brought, perished in Lublin (ph), she said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1362">Now, I'd like to go back to . .

Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1364">She was strong and was working in a factory after the war.</span> <span id="s1365">Her husband was killed, her father was killed and her mother was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1366">She blames herself very severely for the death of her parents because of her mother.</span> <span id="s1367">Because, only the father was to be deported.</span> <span id="s1368">The deportation orders was for the father.</span> <span id="s1369">Probably they would have run the mother the next time.</span> <span id="s1370">And she said, "When my father goes I go with him voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1371">I won't let him go alone."</span> <span id="s1372">And the father tried to talk her out of it and she insisted she goes together.</span> <span id="s1373">So the mother said, "When you go and he goes, then I will voluntarily too."</span> <span id="s1374">Of course they were separated right away.</span> <span id="s1375">Her parents were murdered in Auschwitz and she survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1376">And she then met in Prague another survivor of Auschwitz who's wife and who's child has been murdered in Auschwitz, and she marries him and she lives in Vienna and she is very well-to-do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: This is your cousin?</span> <span id="s1378">Will you say her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Her name is Susie Lansky (ph).</span> <span id="s1380">I think if you would interview her you will get very good information from her because she is a survivor of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1381">And of ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1383">Now getting back to war crimes, you were a transfer from intelligence to war crimes.</span> <span id="s1384">Could you talk a little bit about the war crimes, what you did for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: I was transferred to war crimes and there was first used in a capacity of which I didn't speak so far.</span> <span id="s1386">I have studied in Vienna of interest, out of interest, graphology, the interpretation of the formality from hand writing.</span> <span id="s1387">This is based on very sound psychological principal that we express ourselves not only by words but in other ways too, among emotions, emotions.</span> <span id="s1388">And hand writing is a product of emotions and the ___________ differentiates changes to scroll copy into his own emotions, that tells us, should be able to interpreted as their emotional phase.</span> <span id="s1389">And it is.</span> <span id="s1390">You would expect somebody who is very energetic to write in an energetic stroke, and somebody who is very timid is timid, maybe ___________ stroke.</span> <span id="s1391">Somebody who is very depressed, the lines they will go up, ____________ will go up, down and up, and this is all in the simplest, not incorrect description because this is only one thing.</span> <span id="s1392">You have to know psychology to put these traits all together.</span> <span id="s1393">You can't build it on one trait.</span> <span id="s1394">And I used this already in __________ for the interpretation of handwriting of people who had to be interrogated, so that the interrogator gets a picture of the personality.</span> <span id="s1395">I wrote an article about it and I will give you a reprint, but I have only four reprints left.</span> <span id="s1396">____________ me in the American Journal of Psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1397">I have sent it to them.</span> <span id="s1398">They are the most respected paper in the psychiatric profession, they are the official __________ of the American Psychiatric Association and usually you have to wait months or years for the publication of a paper if they accept it.</span> <span id="s1399">It was accepted and in two months it was printed.</span> <span id="s1400">Now I did this first in war crimes, mainly to inform interrogators about the personality of the people whom they wanted to interrogate.</span> <span id="s1401">But then it became too boring for me.</span> <span id="s1402">There was more action to be done.</span> <span id="s1403">So I asked to be sent into the field.</span> <span id="s1404">And I was sent into the field, which was then, the Germans had ________ down many flyers, and the flyers, those who survived, were mostly killed by the population.</span> <span id="s1405">They were beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1406">And I was to go into villages that were there for intelligence and for information, the flyer has landed there, nothing was heard of him again, to find out what happened to him and who did what.</span> <span id="s1407">And I did this, the flyers murders, in several places.</span> <span id="s1408">In one place, something very odd and funny happened.</span> <span id="s1409">I came there and I knew that the flyer had __________ there and I asked what happened.</span> <span id="s1410">He was killed.</span> <span id="s1411">How was he killed?</span> <span id="s1412">Beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1413">No, he was shot, he was shot.</span> <span id="s1414">I said, __________ beaten to death but this flyer was shot.</span> <span id="s1415">I said, who did it?</span> <span id="s1416">So he said, so-and-so did it, he's a Polish worker.</span> <span id="s1417">I said, now I want to, I have to talk to him because I assumed that the Germans did it.</span> <span id="s1418">And they pushed this Polish worker in front, said he did it.</span> <span id="s1419">So I had by then __________ there and the crime was admitted at the ___________, I had the name of the Polish worker.</span> <span id="s1420">And the Polish worker, because it was shortly at the end of the war, was still there.</span> <span id="s1421">And I said, bring him to me.</span> <span id="s1422">And he came with a whole bunch of other Polish workers.</span> <span id="s1423">And I asked him, you killed this young man?</span> <span id="s1424">He said, I don't know their name but I'm thinking, but I had the right, I was entitled to kill him.</span> <span id="s1425">I said, what gives you the right?</span> <span id="s1426">And he showed me a, and he told me that he was very angry at this flyer, at the, wait a moment.</span> <span id="s1427">No, he said a certain German had killed the flyer and he had killed the German, this worker.</span> <span id="s1428">The German who was done, who had done it, was known but he was not here.</span> <span id="s1429">I didn't believe them.</span> <span id="s1430">They said that the Pollack who shot him is here.</span> <span id="s1431">So I got this Pole, and he told me, yes I shot him.</span> <span id="s1432">I said, how did this happen?</span> <span id="s1433">He said, he was very bad to the Poles.</span> <span id="s1434">He beat them and killed them and when the war was over, it was the first __________ village came in.</span> <span id="s1435">I asked a youngster there and he ___________ ____________ leader for permission to kill this guy.</span> <span id="s1436">And this is what I got, I got the permission to kill him, and he had a little slip of paper, ______________ paper with that, okay, kill the guy, so-and-so, Corporal so-and-so.</span> <span id="s1437">First of all, he was not a Corporal, the pilot first got the serial number.</span> <span id="s1438">And with this he had acquired his authorization to shoot him and he shot him.</span> <span id="s1439">But there were many places where the flyers were killed by the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: What were the nationalities of the flyers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: They were American.</span> <span id="s1442">American flyers in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1443">And his plane was shot down and he parachuted to what he thought was safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: You were involved in the Mal-mee-dee (ph) case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: ____________, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: If you could just talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: The war crimes, I ____________ ______________, but there was one major case on the minds of the Americans.</span> <span id="s1448">That was the murder of over 70 American soldiers in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1449">The Battle of the Bulge was the battle known as the Battle of the Bulge, it is know as, yes.</span> <span id="s1450">And they shot 70 soldiers and I know how, they vowed that they will follow, hunt these people who did it to the ends of the world.</span> <span id="s1451">And they were very clever.</span> <span id="s1452">American intelligence were cooperating, POW and soldiers cooperated to get together members of this unit and started to interrogate them.</span> <span id="s1453">And they had a very good lawyer, I don't know whether he was a good lawyer, he was a good officer, come and start the interrogation.</span> <span id="s1454">And he had already enlisted men and the officers separated, but he didn't get anywhere because he told them, you don't help I make you aware of your rights, you don’t have to tell, if it would be against you, and so on.</span> <span id="s1455">This didn't __________, for the situation, so nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s1456">So they said, Perl should try.</span> <span id="s1457">I was only a Second Lieutenant or _____________.</span> <span id="s1458">So I was put on the case to try to break the iron grip of those people who knew that the unit had done it.</span> <span id="s1459">But really, they didn't know that, the individuals had done it.</span> <span id="s1460">The unit was the toughest of the toughest units in the German military.</span> <span id="s1461">It was the first SS sponsored regiment of the division, of the Furor's division.</span> <span id="s1462">And it was the Lindbergh (ph) Nazi Division, or something similar.</span> <span id="s1463">It was the Furor's Division and it was the first sponsored regiment.</span> <span id="s1464">And this unit, a certain company, this unit had committed the crime.</span> <span id="s1465">So I had to ask somebody into see me, interview him, and to ask him, among other questions, who is particularly foolish and stupid among you?</span> <span id="s1466">You are mostly very bright guys.</span> <span id="s1467">He said, this guy Fleps (ph) is a very stupid guy.</span> <span id="s1468">He's Hungarian, and we make fun of his stupidity.</span> <span id="s1469">Okay.</span> <span id="s1470">And I had Mr. Fleps (ph) come in.</span> <span id="s1471">He was in complete darkness about who had done what and told Fleps (ph), I was sitting there, I said, take his shirt off.</span> <span id="s1472">They took his shirt off and he had, of course, the SS sign, here under the __________ and I said, here.</span> <span id="s1473">How do you call this when you have a birth . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Birth mark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: A birth mark.</span> <span id="s1476">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1477">So he said I've had this since childhood.</span> <span id="s1478">You see, he has the birth mark here.</span> <span id="s1479">This is this _____________, you have the right man now.</span> <span id="s1480">I said, you started the shooting on this and this place.</span> <span id="s1481">He said, no I didn't.</span> <span id="s1482">Finally he admitted that he had done the shooting but that he had orders to do it.</span> <span id="s1483">So I __________ him, who give him the orders?</span> <span id="s1484">And then I knew somebody who had given the orders and I got them all caught up, confessions of everybody, their ________, what they had done.</span> <span id="s1485">Everyone had shot people before, two or three other places, where they showed us, where they were in a shallow grave, the people who got shot.</span> <span id="s1486">Individuals.</span> <span id="s1487">This is what I did in war crimes.</span> <span id="s1488">I was in one or two of the _______ __________ the flyers faces and then I was chief intelligencia of the ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1490">The, I'd like to conclude but let me ask you.</span> <span id="s1491">You, of course, really as a founder of the Ally-a-bet (ph), of course their legal immigration continued after the war, between 1945 and 1948.</span> <span id="s1492">Were you in any way involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: No I was not involved in the resistance any more.</span> <span id="s1494">It was very ably done by the leftist organizations.</span> <span id="s1495">Very ably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: So Ba-tar (ph) in general, the revisionists was less involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Very little involved, if at all.</span> <span id="s1498">I do not know about their involvement.</span> <span id="s1499">In my understanding, he was very little involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: When did you leave Europe to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: In, after the government of Nuremberg, a week later I left.</span> <span id="s1502">I was not at Nuremberg, at the trial.</span> <span id="s1503">I was in one of the trials and have photographs of it too.</span> <span id="s1504">There are films, they make this into a documentary about the ___________ Trial.</span> <span id="s1505">Did you know that?</span> <span id="s1506">In December, about a year or two earlier, of all people told me, you are now on the screen, they are showing the ____________ Case, a documentary about it.</span> <span id="s1507">And after I was at the __________ Trial, it was by far the most important to the Americans because it involved Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: And so you, the year that you came back to the United States was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: It was in September, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: And did you think at all of going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span

want our child to be born in America.</span> <span id="s1514">So I went back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1516">You have two sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: I have two sons.</span> <span id="s1518">Rafael, my older one who is a lawyer for the government and Solomon, the younger one who is a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s1519">You know I was on one very interesting case which is very connected with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1520">I was not on that case, but I brought myself into it.</span> <span id="s1521">One day in ____________, I was in ___________, I learned that there was a man, an officer who had been in charge of the Warsaw ghetto, battling in the Warsaw ghetto, was in prison, in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Strope (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Strope (ph), yes.</span> <span id="s1524">He was in prison, he was in _________.</span> <span id="s1525">He had been just captured and there was nothing known about him except that he was no doubt the man responsible.</span> <span id="s1526">He was not in our interest.</span> <span id="s1527">But he was, war crimes didn't deal with him because he was, the crime was committed in foreign territory.</span> <span id="s1528">In foreign territory or a territory which we are not occupying by foreigners.</span> <span id="s1529">But I went to the prison and said, yes, I want to see this fellow Strope (ph).</span> <span id="s1530">And I got a folder, it was the very same folder, he said he refuses to talk under any kind of threat.</span> <span id="s1531">So ___________ did not sense as a threat because this he was prepared for.</span> <span id="s1532">So I told him, Mr. Strope (ph), he was a tall guy, very slim, graying hair, steel-gray, very bony.</span> <span id="s1533">I told him, General, or Mr. Strope (ph), I don't think I called him General, Mr. Strope (ph), you mind you, you look at me, be aware that I'm not really a soldier.</span> <span id="s1534">I am a scientist and an historian and I am interviewing you about the Warsaw ghetto and if he spoke to me, finally he says, don't speak to me, it's fine too.</span> <span id="s1535">I couldn't get it.</span> <span id="s1536">But I think it is in your interest if you talk because so far, because we are informed and we will transfer you tomorrow to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1537">You occupy Poland and they are known to be not exactly friendly to SS officers.</span> <span id="s1538">And if you want to make a statement you can do it now.</span> <span id="s1539">We know what happened in Warsaw from the stories of the Jews, but you are the one who would tell the story of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1540">High up.</span> <span id="s1541">But with you this information will be completely gone.</span> <span id="s1542">So you decide whether you want to tell the story or whether you don't.</span> <span id="s1543">Here you have sheets of paper.</span> <span id="s1544">You write.</span> <span id="s1545">If you want to I will come in the afternoon and pick it up or pick up empty sheets.</span> <span id="s1546">Good-bye.</span> <span id="s1547">Well, the first confession of Strope (ph) and it is in military style, he reports.</span> <span id="s1548">I am sure that the Jews are not interested in the details, but I wrote that this and this company did this and this many people who were killed in the first __________, this and according to him only 13, 14 or 18, a very small number of Jews that are killed, of Germans that are killed in the battle.</span> <span id="s1549">But he describes how they went into the houses and they are going underground, there were sewers and the Jews were hiding there and they finished them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Is there anything else that you'd like to add before we conclude?</span> <span id="s1551">General reflections or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: No, I've, it might be interesting, but it is not interesting for the Holocaust murders.</span> <span id="s1553">How these are successful in breaking the resistance of Germans and prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1554">When I was in _____________ I was assigned a man, a Naval Officer, who has refused to give any information.</span> <span id="s1555">And he was very interested to ask because he had been stationed at _______________.</span> <span id="s1556">_________ was the place where they made military rockets.</span> <span id="s1557">And he was assigned to me to open up.</span> <span id="s1558">______________, yes but he was not a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Now he is in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1561">So I got him and he was a threat, a fanatical Nazi.</span> <span id="s1562">Tried to make out of this for nothing, his ________ towards us.</span> <span id="s1563">So I approached him, not with any markings of rank, but with a Red Cross on my arm.</span> <span id="s1564">As a Red Cross Officer who inquires whether he's all right or whether he is properly treated according to the Geneva Convention, whether there are any complaints, does he have enough food and enough working, he ______________.</span> <span id="s1565">And there came the second time and third time, asked never any questions of military interest.</span> <span id="s1566">And then we discovered what he knew about and he was interested in music.</span> <span id="s1567">We discovered that he is very interested in ___________.</span> <span id="s1568">So I said I'm very interested in ___________ too, let us talk about it next time, I have to see somebody else.</span> <span id="s1569">And I read up about ____________ and the next time I came to him he was amazed how much I knew about _____________, about his brother Michael ____________ and so on.</span> <span id="s1570">Those were contacts, you know?</span> <span id="s1571">Of course, he didn't notice that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1572">So I told him, listen, how do you see your future?</span> <span id="s1573">He said, I don't know but I think that we still win the war.</span> <span id="s1574">I said, do you really believe this?</span> <span id="s1575">He said, yes.</span> <span id="s1576">I said, I tell you, I take you to the city and you can see for yourself, what was the _____________, what they did to London, because ______________ thought that London was half destroyed.</span> <span id="s1577">And I spoke already with your commanding officer and he said, take him.</span> <span id="s1578">He says, it's your business.</span> <span id="s1579">You take him to the city.</span> <span id="s1580">So I took him to the city, I took first his word of honor as an officer, I knew he would never break it, that he wouldn't try to escape.</span> <span id="s1581">I gave him a paper to have in case he tries to escape, I didn't take a pistol along.</span> <span id="s1582">And he went, ____________, I said, you tell the driver where you want to go.</span> <span id="s1583">So he told the driver that he just wanted to go to Piccalilli Circus and ____________, well known places where there was hardly any destruction.</span> <span id="s1584">I said, here, listen, there's hardly any destruction here.</span> <span id="s1585">You stop and ask one of the passers-by where is the destruction and there I will bring you.</span> <span id="s1586">And then you compare this to what's happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1587">So then he stopped and he asked not the first, only the second person who came by.</span> <span id="s1588">Where is the best destruction?</span> <span id="s1589">He said, I think it was some Poles if I'm not mistaken, near some Poles.</span> <span id="s1590">I said, have the driver drive to some Poles and there we saw some destruction, a total of about five blocks, a few entirely destroyed.</span> <span id="s1591">But no comparison to what they did in this.</span> <span id="s1592">And he _________ back and on the way back there was, between London and, what was the name, where we were stationed?</span> <span id="s1593">____________?</span> <span id="s1594">______________?</span> <span id="s1595">I forgot now, but I was stationed outside London.</span> <span id="s1596">I mean it was a very secret _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">End of Tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: And on the way back I stopped, we stopped at the little grocery store there.</span> <span id="s1600">Before I bought, not Kosher salami but Hebrew National salami, it was not Kosher but the Kosher-type.</span> <span id="s1601">And somebody had saw this, oh it was a _________ ___________ program and the Americans have plenty of it and they sent plenty of it to Britain and the Britains didn't like it because it smells of garlic and the garlic in it, so it was not rationed.</span> <span id="s1602">So I said, on the way back we are going to pass by there, stop me, I want to buy some snack.</span> <span id="s1603">And we stopped there.</span> <span id="s1604">We went in and I said, I want this salami.</span> <span id="s1605">And this I got and he said, no ___________?</span> <span id="s1606">I said, no.</span> <span id="s1607">He said, you know they tell us that everything is rationed and almost everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s1608">This thing is _________ too.</span> <span id="s1609">So now he was ___________ and the next time when I came to visit him, I don't know whether it was the next time but I took time with this thing.</span> <span id="s1610">I said, do you think now that you lost the war?</span> <span

<span id="s1623">I said, oh, if you can't do this, but I think it would be your patriotic duty to do it.</span> <span id="s1624">So the next time I came out, the second time, he said, I am __________.</span> <span id="s1625">I have to work with you for the reconstruction of Germany.</span> <span id="s1626">That was the end.</span> <span id="s1627">Because I was not a technician, I didn't know what about.</span> <span id="s1628">He was then handed over to the people who asked them the questions they wanted to.</span> <span id="s1629">And he was talking because he thought he
