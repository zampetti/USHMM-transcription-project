<p><span id="s4">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your education in Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: I started out in a Lyceum, a private school and you know this was just changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Before everybody had to have three or four years public school.</span> <span id="s7">Just at this time it was changed and I started out right way in private school.</span> <span id="s8">My parents were very happy.</span> <span id="s9">You see even so we never had a colored problem and all this but my parents were very happy I was right away with a better class of pupils together.</span> <span id="s10">This was an all gentile school.</span> <span id="s11">I was one Jewish girl among 600 girls – the only Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s12">And my father put me there - there were schools where there were more Jewish girls because Breslau was the third largest Jewish community in Germany – so there were schools where there were a lot of Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s13">But my father put me there – that’s where you will get the right discipline.</span> <span id="s14">That was the most disciplined school and that was the best school – it was where all the noblesse of Breslau went.</span> <span id="s15">I really got from there the best background and this was the only school which was allowed later on to take the own exam for – I mean went to school thirteen years – that means here you had three years of college right?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: You were able to make you abitur?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s18">Abitur.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Did you continue after you made your abitur?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I couldn’t because of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You mentioned you were the only Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s22">I guess you had mostly gentile friends when you were in school.</span> <span id="s23">What was the relationship like between them and you during the school years?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Very good.</span> <span id="s25">Very good.</span> <span id="s26">And you know, for instance, my parents had a kosher home and Rosh Hashahah and Yom Kippur, I took off and whenever we went on an outing with the school, all my teachers knew I was only allowed to eat dairy.</span> <span id="s27">And you know the funny part was as I was alone, we had a female director who was from the noblesse too, she insisted I had to have religious lessons there which was very boring for me.</span> <span id="s28">I was one girl with the teacher alone.</span> <span id="s29">I mean it was so boring you have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: How did you get your Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I had history in the morning like the others – I had my own teacher who came special for me and twice in the afternoon, I went to Hebrew lessons for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you belong to a congregation in Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes, sure I belonged to a congregation but for instance like you have here – my parents always tried to get me involved into Jewish community activities because in the morning I was always with gentiles and I never like it.</span> <span id="s34">They tried with me to put me into this Jewish class – and you see that’s how I am until nowadays – I don’t like to know, Tuesday I’m going here, Wednesday, I’m going there.</span> <span id="s35">I even don’t have any steady bridge, I don’t like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was the congregation which you belonged to orthodox or liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Were you orthodox at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No.</span> <span id="s40">You could call it conservative.</span> <span id="s41">I had an orthodox husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: He had a small department store – everything clothing everything but shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: When you were in school, what did you hope to become?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I wanted to study medicine but I wasn’t allowed.</span> <span id="s46">I made my abitur and I could have gone to study outside Germany but at this time parents didn’t send a girl by herself.</span> <span id="s47">I wanted so much to go to England but my father wouldn’t let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: How old were you when you made your abitur?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I stated – you could start school with six.</span> <span id="s50">I was a very sickly girl – after three months they sent me home, I got sick and then I had to start next year again so I was always the oldest in the class – I was almost 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: So you were born in 1914 and 19 would be 1933.</span> <span id="s52">And then you were not allowed into medical school anymore.</span> <span id="s53">Were you at all active in any cultural or political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I wanted to but my father wouldn’t let me – to go to a political organization – I was always interested in politics but my father wouldn’t have let me.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What would you have joined if you were able.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A You called it social democrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did a lot of your friends belong to the social democrats?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, not so many.</span> <span id="s59">You see in school these gentile girls, this wasn’t their class- noblesse wasn’t social democrats.</span> <span id="s60">They would have belonged to a different group.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: How did Hitler’s coming to power in 1933 affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I mean it didn’t affect me too much because I left school.</span> <span id="s63">But you see before already, here was already a tense situation.</span> <span id="s64">At least half of my class belonged to the Hitler organization so they kept away from me – I mean socially we didn’t get together anymore.</span> <span id="s65">They would have been in danger even more than I was.</span> <span id="s66">So there was already a certain tension.</span> <span id="s67">But my brother, he suffered terribly.</span> <span id="s68">You see my brother was four and a half years younger and he went to an all – in Germany you had all female, all girls schools and all boys school – so he went to an all boys school and every morning when he went in, the boys came in full uniform and whenever he came in, they threatened him they will throw him out of the window and they will do that and that.</span> <span id="s69">The director was very nice but my brother was afraid to go to school and my father wanted very much he should at least finish school.</span> <span id="s70">He promised him heaven on earth, try to finish school but finally he just couldn’t go anymore.</span> <span id="s71">I mean his life was threatened and them my brother went to Berlin – my father sent him to Berlin – to learn to be a gardener.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Under Zionist or Reichsvertretung supervision?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: This was it.</span> <span id="s74">This was a school to prepare people for emigration.</span> <span id="s75">Because we were thinking at this time to go to Israel to go here to go there.</span> <span id="s76">I mean in 1933 you didn’t really thing yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: I was going to ask you when this was.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We started thinking – look, I got married in 1935.</span> <span id="s79">We started thinking in 1937, 38 and it was very late already and let’s say when most of the people wanted to emigrate, all countries closed their doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: You mentioned in 1933 you had finished school and that many of the girls were already members of the BDM or other Hitler groups, how did their attitudes toward you change.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I mean socially we didn’t get together anymore.</span> <span id="s82">As long as we were at school, it was fairly well but I mean for instance, history was changes as Hitler wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s83">Then they didn’t have to do their homework anymore.</span> <span id="s84">The excuse was good enough.</span> <span id="s85">We had to go to a meeting.</span> <span id="s86">The whole school system was changed.</span> <span id="s87">As little as our director liked it, and she was very liberal in her attitude and she didn’t like the whole thing but everybody was powerless.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How did you feel as a young girl being excluded by all your former friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: It wasn’t easy but I mean I learned form my parents, that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s90">And you have to consider one thing, we German Jews were always used to a certain anti-Semitism which we just took it as it was – we accepted it.</span> <span id="s91">I mean you had plenty here in America – you know that you had what disgusted me very much when I came here.</span> <span id="s92">You had in fact more anti-Semitism in America than we ever had before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: When your brother was going to school and finding it difficult, do you remember your parents ever discussing emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: My mother was a very proud person and she wanted – we wish we would have – she wanted to pack up right away.</span> <span id="s95">She said I do not accept to be a second class citizen, let’s pack up as long as we can.</span> <span id="s96">And you know what until 1936 you would emigrate with all your money, with everything and my father said one doesn’t throw things so fast – it will not be forever.</span> <span id="s97">And you know the funny part was, it was in the beginning in 1935, 36 and a gentile person came to my father in the business and said I would suggest and you may believe me, sell your business and leave the country.</span> <span id="s98">I might know more.</span> <span id="s99">He was willing to buy the business and at this time you could have sold the business at the price you wanted but my father didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s100">He didn’t believe it would last.</span> <span id="s101">My mother wanted to leave in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did you ever see signs Juden Unerwuenscht?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: You now my parents got married in 1912 and in 1937, there was the Olympiad in Germany and my parents had their 25th wedding anniversary and I was married already and they didn’t want to celebrate in Germany and they spent their wedding anniversary in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s104">At this time, we had at the windows mogen dovids.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: On Jewish stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: They were marked, nobody should come in.</span> <span id="s107">I think I still have a picture.</span> <span id="s108">I will look later.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: How was your father’s business affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: You know what, this was the unfortunate thing – that since 1933 business did not let up.</span> <span id="s111">If it would have, maybe my father would have changed his mind.</span> <span id="s112">It did not let up.</span> <span id="s113">It got better.</span> <span id="s114">And people didn’t – I mean it didn’t disturb them – they came anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Was most of his trade gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: All gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: You mentioned that you got married in 1935, what did your husband do.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: He was an economist but he was in his parents business.</span> <span id="s119">But you see his father died.</span> <span id="s120">We got married in December, 1935 and his father died in March – let’s say indirectly affected by Hitler.</span> <span id="s121">It so happened, that’s only how I heard it, he was on the phone with somebody and he mentioned somebody – at this time you had a feeling you are, not free even to talk on the phone what you want – it might be overheard.</span> <span id="s122">And he talked with somebody evidently against Hitler and the call was interrupted.</span> <span id="s123">And from there on he felt terribly, he was not himself anymore and he died in march 1935 and his wife, my mother-in-law, she definitely did not – I mean she was part of it that we all didn’t emigrate.</span> <span id="s124">She wouldn’t have left Germany.</span> <span id="s125">She wants to be buried where her husband is.</span> <span id="s126">As we were a close knit family, one wouldn’t have gone without the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How did you husband feel about the growing Nazi threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: We all were, we young people were not independent thinkers unfortunately.</span> <span id="s129">What the parents did, we did.</span> <span id="s130">And you know, as a young person, you don’t take tings so seriously.</span> <span id="s131">At this time, nothing bothered me too much and as my father was of the opinion and I always was used to doing what my parents say, my father was used to – he always said I mean that cannot be for long.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Were you ever stopped from going to the theaters or the movies or otherwise participating in?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s134">In general you didn’t go anywhere because you had everywhere no Jews allowed, no Jews.</span> <span id="s135">Then you didn’t go.</span> <span id="s136">They started Jewish theater, the Kulturbund.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you go to that frequently?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What was the felling like, you had grown up in a very mixed atmosphere, what was the feeling like not to be able to go to all the things that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I guess if it would have bothered me a lot, I would have gotten more involved probably and have been more on my mother’s side – maybe we would have gotten out in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: When did you decide that you were going to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Look we started let’s say 1937.</span> <span id="s143">And then where, where are you going, right.</span> <span id="s144">Imean 1937 for America you needed a quota or you needed a sponsor because America was – you see let’s say for instance, I’m not a good American, I will never be because you see, I feel when I needed them, they were not there.</span> <span id="s145">Even for our ship there was no room.</span> <span id="s146">But afterwards, all the Hungarians whoever came in and now the Vietnamese, there’s plenty of room.</span> <span id="s147">But for 900 Jews, there was no room.</span> <span id="s148">I mean I have my American citizenship and I am American.</span> <span id="s149">I’m not proud and I don’t have any feeling for the country.</span> <span id="s150">I am here – my family is here.</span> <span id="s151">Otherwise, I have no feelings for the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: In 1937, did you have any family in America who might give you a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: What choices did you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Okay, there was a chance you could go to Brazil if you had a certain amount of money and you had to become Catholic.</span> <span id="s156">This is no tragedy.</span> <span id="s157">People became Catholic and other there, they were Jews.</span> <span id="s158">I mean what goes on in your inside, it’s a different story.</span> <span id="s159">But there was still something – I don’t remember quite – I’m pretty sure my husband didn’t like the idea – as an orthodox Jew even as a formality he wouldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s160">Then we were thinking of going to Israel – to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s161">To go to Palestine at this time was not easy anymore either.</span> <span id="s162">I think there were limitations to that.</span> <span id="s163">Before we decided to go anywhere, there was the pogrom – Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: What happened to your family on Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: It started in the middle of the night when my father knocked on our bedroom – it’s a pogrom.</span> <span id="s166">I’m sure I couldn’t grasp the idea right away because we were – my parents lived right on top of the store and everything was broken and they took out whatever they could and then the glass was broken from the apartment from my parents – not from ours because ours was the rear – that’s why my parents could come in.</span> <span id="s167">Then in the morning they started to get the men and put them in the police headquarters first.</span> <span id="s168">The minute it got daylight, my father, my husband and my brother left the house and they took the tramway.</span> <span id="s169">My uncle, he had a house for himself at the other end of Breslau and they went over there to hid over there because the phones where all out.</span> <span id="s170">There was no phone and you couldn’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s171">So they went over there and when they came over there, my uncle was arrested already so they wouldn’t come again so they could very well hide there.</span> <span id="s172">And then my mother left because in the meantime, and I remember I stayed alone with my dog.</span> <span id="s173">I had a German shepherd and I stayed at home and then there.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Where did your mother go?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: She went over to my uncle’s house also and I stayed alone.</span> <span id="s176">And then there was a knock at the door and an SS man came.</span> <span id="s177">But at this time you still had a feeling they didn’t do anything to women – they only got the men.</span> <span id="s178">And my dog was very vicious and he said to me take the dog away.</span> <span id="s179">And I said oh no, that dog is for my protection.</span> <span id="s180">What do you want.</span> <span id="s181">If there are any men.</span> <span id="s182">I said there are no men and I didn’t take the dog away – the dog was right with me and then he left.</span> <span id="s183">At this time, a woman could still have a big mouth because they were not after the women, they were only after the men.</span> <span id="s184">And then my cousin came over to look after me by car and left the car there and she took me and the dog over there – we left the house.</span> <span id="s185">But before I went over there I went to my mother in law to look what was going on over there so she told be before my husband went over there, he walked – I could never understand how he could do it, he looked very Jewish, he was dark, he walked to his mother and he came to his mother’s house and his brother was still there.</span> <span id="s186">At he same time when he was still there, an DD came to get his brother.</span> <span id="s187">But I want to tell you how the Germans just did what they were told.</span> <span id="s188">He did not have an arrest warrant for my husband.</span> <span id="s189">He just took my brother-in-law and my husband stayed there.</span> <span id="s190">And them my husband left his mother and he went over to my uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s191">And then when I came to my mother-in-law, she told me all this and from there on I stayed with my mother-in-law, she shouldn’t be alone.</span> <span id="s192">I slept with her and stayed with her.</span> <span id="s193">And every morning she came to me and she said Ilse, can’t we do something for Fred, can’t we do something for Fred.</span> <span id="s194">Because she knew my husband was hidden over there.</span> <span id="s195">I said you know what, I will go out – maybe one can here something.</span> <span id="s196">And I went to the police headquarters – the police headquarter was on the first floor and the SS was on top.</span> <span id="s197">I went to the police headquarter and I talked to them and they said look, we can’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s198">Usually the police was know for being more left.</span> <span id="s199">They said look, we can’t do a thing – our hands are tied.</span> <span id="s200">And then I walked around outside a little and then I saw a lot of women there together and I mixed among them and then I heard that somebody said if somebody had a ticket to emigrate, they will let them out.</span> <span id="s201">And my brother-in-law you see, my brother-in-law and my husband, they were both in their father’s business – my husband was on the inside and my brother-in-law was the salesman so he was out and he heard more so he came home one day to his mother and he said mother, everybody is buying tickets to Cuba.</span> <span id="s202">So my mother-in-law said buy too.</span> <span id="s203">So he bought five tickets for all of us to go to Cuba and he had them at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Who did the five tickets include?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Now let me figure out.</span> <span id="s206">My mother-in-law, my parents, my brother, me, my husband and himself –seven right.</span> <span id="s207">So he came home with the tickets but he didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s208">In the meantime from the police headquarters they took everybody to Buckenwald.</span> <span id="s209">So I heard this and I came home to my mother-in-law and I said you know I think Fred bought the tickets to Cuba.</span> <span id="s210">She said yes and I said let me have the tickets and maybe I can do something.</span> <span id="s211">So she gave me the tickets and I had a Photostat and I went to the SS.</span> <span id="s212">I went there and I said my brother-in-law is in Buchenwald – this is the ticket to Cuba.</span> <span id="s213">I want him out.</span> <span id="s214">There were so many women sitting there at the Gestapo, I remember I met my aunt there, she was there for my uncle because they had an affidavit for the United States.</span> <span id="s215">Everybody was sitting there and they were not unpolite so I gave them the ticket with the name of my brother-in-law and I came home to my mother-in-law and she was very happy about it.</span> <span id="s216">And it took a few days and we didn’t here a thing and one night, we were sitting and the phone was ringing and my brother-in-law was on the phone – Mother, I am in Breslau.</span> <span id="s217">I am here.</span> <span id="s218">I am coming home.</span> <span id="s219">And this was typical my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s220">You know what she did?</span> <span id="s221">She figured out he must be very dirty.</span> <span id="s222">Right away she started to let the water run in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s223">She figured the first thing he will come – I’ll send him to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s224">He came home, he looked –you know, they took off all the hair and he never got out of his suit.</span> <span id="s225">He looked worse than the dirtiest beggar.</span> <span id="s226">He didn’t say a word and we sent him right to the bathroom and we were waiting anxiously when he came out.</span> <span id="s227">When he came out, you know what, they were so intimidated - they were told not to say a word.</span> <span id="s228">We were pressing him so hard – we wanted to know.</span> <span id="s229">I am not allowed to say anything and I wouldn’t tell you anything.</span> <span id="s230">Now my brother-in-law, he was full of pep and the next day he had to go to the police headquarter every day.</span> <span id="s231">We were sitting, my mother-in-law and I, we were sitting at the window and waiting until he came back.</span> <span id="s232">Every day he had to go and he had to tell them when he is leaving the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: When he bought those tickets, were they landing permits and ship tickets?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: They were legitimate tickets.</span> <span id="s235">You know that was while Batista was there – so they were regular tickets.</span> <span id="s236">That’s why I will tell you, you cannot fight fate, you can stand on your head.</span> <span id="s237">If my husband would have been with my brother-in-law in Buchenwald instead of being hidden, we all would have been anxious to go, right?</span> <span id="s238">Now, in the meantime, my brother-in-law, he had to leave.</span> <span id="s239">He did a very foolish thing – he was very peppy and he was a young person.</span> <span id="s240">You know what he did – a very harmless thing – but as a Jew he wasn’t allowed to do it.</span> <span id="s241">He went on the tram somewhere and the terrible crime he committed – he jumped off the tram while the tram was still moving and the Gestapo caught him and he said if you’re not out by tonight, you will be back in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s242">This was the terrible crime he committed – he jumped off the tramway.</span> <span id="s243">So he couldn’t wait any longer – somebody took him over the border to Holland and there he stayed until his ship left for Cuba.</span> <span id="s244">Now we could all have left with the same ship – we all had the same permit to go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s245">But in the meantime, my parents didn’t sell their store yet – we figured we could go with the next ship.</span> <span id="s246">My mother and I, we insisted that all the men should go with my brother-in-law and she and I would finish up all the things that have to be done.</span> <span id="s247">Because we knew we were not in danger, we knew the men were in danger.</span> <span id="s248">No, my father wouldn’t go without my mother.</span> <span id="s249">My mother-in-law said you go where your husband is, don’t send your husband alone.</span> <span id="s250">She meant well.</span> <span id="s251">And my brother wouldn’t have gone alone with my brother-in-law without the rest of us.</span> <span id="s252">So we all stayed and the next ship was the St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Now, it seems they all came back home a few days after Kristallnacht . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: You see, the minute the first came back from Buchenwald, all the other men came out from hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: At that point, what did your father do about his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I’ll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s257">We had to sell, I mean we never opened the business anymore after the Kristallnacht, my mother and I – none of our men ever went to the business again – we tried to straighten out everything and a gentile came and he said he wants to buy.</span> <span id="s258">I mean, the price you got at this time was as good as nothing.</span> <span id="s259">So we sold it and we straightened out and we managed with him however we could but I was a young person and I was full of hate and I would do anything to work against him so what I did with my mother together – we prevented him to open the business before Christmas when there is the main business going on.</span> <span id="s260">He wanted to work longer – we said oh no.</span> <span id="s261">We come in at 9 o’clock and we go home a 5 o’clock.</span> <span id="s262">We don’t have to work longer.</span> <span id="s263">We closed the business – the next day we came in again at 9 o’clock and we worked both very slow and he couldn’t open at Christmas time.</span> <span id="s264">He opened after Christmas when business was very slow.</span> <span id="s265">In Germany, January and February are absolutely dead months.</span> <span id="s266">I mean much money we didn’t get anyway – why should he open the business before Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Did you think at that point that you could take anymore than 10 RM with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No.</span> <span id="s269">in the meantime we knew.</span> <span id="s270">We knew we couldn’t but you see let’s say we took furniture with us and we packed big lifts so you could pack things – valuable things in there.</span> <span id="s271">Money you couldn’t – the money what you had in the bank and so on – this was all on “spercondo” (closed accounts).</span> <span id="s272">The money you had, you bought things.</span> <span id="s273">My mother had a lot of black market money she tried to save.</span> <span id="s274">My parents accountant always complained to my father – your wife is taking too much money.</span> <span id="s275">So my father said I can’t do a thing about it.</span> <span id="s276">So my mother really tried to save a lot of money.</span> <span id="s277">And you know, that’s interesting, my parents took along, otherwise they wouldn’t have taken – they took the kitchen furniture along which was a very old piece of furniture and my brother was very handy and one night he built into - and he built a lot of things, valuables, in there.</span> <span id="s278">But you will see you cannot fight fate.</span> <span id="s279">After he finished everything and I mean nobody could have seen anything, everything was closed but he got nightmares and he was so afraid and he got so hysterical that my father said, look, the whole thing isn’t work it.</span> <span id="s280">You want to take it out, take it out.</span> <span id="s281">Then we will be without the whole thing.</span> <span id="s282">But finally it stayed in and then people came and they paced everything in the lift and I mean nobody looked and you know my uncle and aunt, they did a very smart thing.</span> <span id="s283">They packed a lift too.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: They were going to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s286">They left right after the Kristallnacht because at this time they were there too and they packed everything.</span> <span id="s287">And my aunt prepared a big dinner – a banquet – for those people who – the inspectors – they were sitting there with my cousin who was a young girl and dining and wining and in the meantime they packed everything in nobody looked, understand and they probably gave them some money too and they had a good time.</span> <span id="s288">That’s how it worked.</span> <span id="s289">We packed everything in too.</span> <span id="s290">We were unfortunately on the St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Who went on the St. Louis – all six of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Five.</span> <span id="s293">My mother-in-law never left Germany.</span> <span id="s294">She was deported later on to Lublin to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And your brother-in-law who had gone to Holland?</span> <span id="s296">Was he waiting there for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: No.</span> <span id="s298">my brother-in-law went one ship – he landed in Cuba.</span> <span id="s299">He landed in Cuba and you know what – an we were sitting with the St. Louis five weeks on the ocean if you remember, know about it.</span> <span id="s300">We were in Cuba too – we were sitting there for eight days in the harbor of Havana and my brother-in-law came by ship, by ferry boat.</span> <span id="s301">You know what, he had for the money he had, nebish for that little money, he had already furnished for us an apartment and prepared everything and my mother-in-law - that he only told me later – had sent a telegram Welcome in Cuba which my brother-in-law never showed us.</span> <span id="s302">He said I knew you wouldn’t land.</span> <span id="s303">As the situation was, I knew you wouldn’t land.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: The five of you left Breslau and went to Hamburg to board the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s306">It sailed on the 13th of May, 1939 with the blessing of Rabbi Carlebach.</span> <span id="s307">It helped a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: How did your parents feel . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: You know what – when you are young I mean emigration didn’t frighten me.</span> <span id="s310">My father on the ship when we left he said this is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: ON the day your parents left Breslau, how did they react?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: You see, my mother was never as you would say the German patriot – my mother never was.</span> <span id="s313">You see for instance, I remember when my mother told me from the first world war.</span> <span id="s314">Now my mother was a child of five children – three brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s315">Now the eldest brother was already in the army.</span> <span id="s316">Then the second one was taken and the youngest one came home from school and they drove him crazy in school – they said everybody had to go voluntarily – that was already towards the end.</span> <span id="s317">So he came home full of pep – I am going to volunteer so my mother said – at that time she was the oldest.</span> <span id="s318">She said you must be out of your mind.</span> <span id="s319">You have no time until they get you?</span> <span id="s320">I just want to show you my mother was never the big patriot.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Not too much but let’s say as the head of the family, he felt he had an obligation to provide and he has the responsibility – that’s why my mother wanted to leave in 1933 and my father was always afraid of my mother because my mother was very outspoken.</span> <span id="s323">He saw her already taken by the Gestapo before anything happened.</span> <span id="s324">But my mother was very outspoken – she didn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s325">My mother probably didn’t feel to bad but my father said on the ship this is the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Did you have any trouble on the way from Breslau to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: When you came to Havana harbor, what was your reaction after a day, then two days when you weren’t able to disembark?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I mean we still hoped because you see in the beginning they told us all kind of stories.</span> <span id="s330">There was a holiday and nobody could come to inspect – everyday was something else.</span> <span id="s331">It took a time before we realized that we will never come in.</span> <span id="s332">And my brother-in-law came everyday by ferry boat but he never said anything (shouted up to the boat) discouraging but later on when we talked to each other here he said look, as the situation was, I knew from the very beginning you had no chance – before the boat even came he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Were there any incidents on the boat ?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes, I mean one jumped into the water – he wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s335">And One died (Prof Weiler).</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: On the way over, were there any Nazi incidents?</span> <span id="s337">It was a German boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: That I don’t remember but going back the crew was very nasty- there wasn’t enough to eat.</span> <span id="s339">On the way to Havana it was pretty normal.</span> <span id="s340">We had service every Shabbat and in fact the atmosphere going there was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What was the effect of the death of Prof. Weiler?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: You know he was buried in the ocean.</span> <span id="s343">There was a service and he was sunk in the ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: When did you become aware that you wouldn’t be able to land.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: After a few days we realized there wasn’t much of a chance.</span> <span id="s346">After a few days we had to leave the harbor and we were standing in the ocean.</span> <span id="s347">And you see this is something what I think could only happen to German Jews – it would never happen to Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s348">You know what Polish Jews would have done – the right thing.</span> <span id="s349">They would have gone to the captain and told him you take us to Ellis Island or anywhere here or we kill you and that’s what we should have done.</span> <span id="s350">We were not used to – and that’s why we went to concentration camps too.</span> <span id="s351">You see Polish Jews at least they tried to fight.</span> <span id="s352">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s353">We were so used to go what we were told.</span> <span id="s354">We didn’t think left, we didn’t think right – that’s what we were taught.</span> <span id="s355">Only to German Jews that could happen – what happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: What was the moral on the boat like as you sailed away from Havana.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: That was terrible.</span> <span id="s358">And then they started classifying because you know we went to four countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s359">Now, people with young children went to Holland.</span> <span id="s360">England is very smart – only those who have affidavits leaving the country right away to the United States for a short waiting period – those went to England.</span> <span id="s361">And the rest who didn’t have anything came to France or Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: At this point, you didn’t have an affidavit to come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Let me just backtrack for a minute.</span> <span id="s365">When you found out that the JOINT negotiations fell through and you were cruising off Miami and circling around the area between Florida and Havana, how were you able to maintain hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s367">I mean, you see you probably as an American will not understand and what I do understand if people in Israel say nowadays, they do not understand.</span> <span id="s368">I do not understand anymore.</span> <span id="s369">How could we just sit there and not do anything?</span> <span id="s370">I’m telling you at this time we were not prepared for this kind of situation.</span> <span id="s371">It would not happen to me anymore.</span> <span id="s372">I would kill anybody before I would do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s373">But I had to learn the hard way.</span> <span id="s374">We were not prepared for a thing like that.</span> <span id="s375">It wouldn’t happen to me on that ship anymore.</span> <span id="s376">I would get a few people together – the captain would be killed before he would go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Was the captain sympathetic?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I have never met the captain.</span> <span id="s379">How he felt only found out – there was once an article – Schroeder right?</span> <span id="s380">I never met the captain.</span> <span id="s381">There was that committee that worked for – I’m telling you we were not prepared to take any active role in that whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: When you knew that you were going back to Europe, did the committee play a role in keeping up morale on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: We were told and we did not realize how bad it would be and what would come out of it.</span> <span id="s384">Because at this time the Germans were not there (in those countries).</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you have any choice in which country you would . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s387">We were glad already we didn’t go to Germany.</span> <span id="s388">This was already a step.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did all five of you go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: To Belgium, to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What happened to you in Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: In Brussels, there was in each country a committee and we were looking around for a furnished room and I mean we were supported by the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Meaning a bike a relief committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Right – I think it all came from the JOINT.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Did you make any further attempt to get out of Belgium at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: You couldn’t.</span> <span id="s399">You were just trapped.</span> <span id="s400">This was in June when we arrived in Belgium and in the meantime the war had started right?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: September.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: September, 1939 the war started and pretty soon the Germans came in and the Belgians still remembered from the first world war – they were terribly afraid of the Germans because at this time when the Germans came in, I mean they raped the women and they made such a mess in Belgium so everybody was afraid so when they heard the Germans came in, this was a terrible situation – this was the only time I did something right.</span> <span id="s403">So when they heard the Germans came in, everybody was running to the train to get out of Belgium.</span> <span id="s404">And I was alone with my mother and I went too to the train station and I saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s405">People with crutches – everybody was sitting there waiting for the trains to leave.</span> <span id="s406">In the meantime, there were trains standing there, trains were not leaving anymore – everything went very fast.</span> <span id="s407">And people were running by foot they were going to the border to France and don’t forget there were the bombardments all the time.</span> <span id="s408">So I went back to my mother and I said what will happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s409">I am not running.</span> <span id="s410">I am not taking – people too taxis and cars and whatever they – I’m just not budging.</span> <span id="s411">I’m staying.</span> <span id="s412">Whatever will happen, will happen, So a lot of Belgians were out, the whole city was like dead – nobody in the street.</span> <span id="s413">Everybody was afraid, the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s414">So we were staying in the house.</span> <span id="s415">And the funny part was, once I was in the street I saw people marching- soldiers.</span> <span id="s416">This was the English Army – this was when they wanted to help France.</span> <span id="s417">And everybody was very glad to see them there.</span> <span id="s418">And then later on in the afternoon, I was in the street again and I saw the army coming from the opposite way.</span> <span id="s419">I said there’s something not right.</span> <span id="s420">Later on I heard that they realized the French gave up they figured why should we die for France.</span> <span id="s421">I mean they all just gave up.</span> <span id="s422">Nobody was fighting.</span> <span id="s423">The Germans just marched in.</span> <span id="s424">When the German army first marched into Alsace-Lorraine – at that time it was German – and the German Army was told when you march in the first shot you hear, you come back.</span> <span id="s425">And as there was never a first shot, they just marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You mentioned you were alone with your mother.</span> <span id="s427">Where were your husband, brother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: This was shortly before.</span> <span id="s429">When the news came out that Belgium gave up and the Germans were coming in, they said all German Jews have to meet at a certain place because we were aliens.</span> <span id="s430">So all the men had to go there and they took them right away to the unoccupied part of France to the internierungscamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Where were they taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: First they were in St. Cyprien and then they were in Gurs and then they were in Septfong.</span> <span id="s433">The men were taken right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: What happened to you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: We stayed there.</span> <span id="s436">And you see the Germans did nothing wrong the first two years during the occupation because this is an international law – while a country is occupied for two years, the occupying country is not doing anything that is contraire to the laws of the country.</span> <span id="s437">So they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s438">After the two years, they started to take people to the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Where you in contact with the men during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s441">For quite a while.</span> <span id="s442">As soon as they could, they wrote and we wrote.</span> <span id="s443">And then they wrote for money but from each post office we only could send 100 Francs – Belgian francs.</span> <span id="s444">So my mother and I, we went through all Brussels from one post office to the other and we sent money.</span> <span id="s445">Then, my mother-in-law wrote she was deported to Poland in the meantime and she wrote for money and then we went to each post office and sent money.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: How did you get the money to send?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: We sol thing which we had brought along.</span> <span id="s448">For instance, my parents, as soon as the lift arrived, my parents went over and got out what they put in.</span> <span id="s449">My lift I never got – it arrived much later and was all destroyed by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Their lift was originally bound for Havana.</span> <span id="s451">It was shipped back to Brussels and you sold things in Brussels to send the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did the three men stay together for those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes, they were together and then all of a sudden we didn’t have any news anymore, didn’t hear anything anymore.</span> <span id="s455">Then in the meantime, we started – when we heard that they take people to the concentration camps – now in the meantime we were not told it is a concentration camps – we were told it is a working camp, only nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s456">After the two years we were told to wear the yellow start.</span> <span id="s457">Now, my mother and I we said right away we are not going to wear it.</span> <span id="s458">I mean we are not going to do it that easy and then sometimes we stayed somewhere where we were not declared that we lived there – hidden a little bit here and a little bit there.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: How did you find such places?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: The Belgians, partly they helped so they were in danger too.</span> <span id="s461">For instance, that’s how I kept all the documentary papers.</span> <span id="s462">I have it in a suitcase to a woman who worked for the underground movement and she kept everything for me.</span> <span id="s463">I mea that’s how I could declare when the Restitution started.</span> <span id="s464">I had all the papers.</span> <span id="s465">You know that was the funny part of my father – my father kept everything and he said I’m sure it will help one day.</span> <span id="s466">We still will see some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Do you know exactly what happened to your father, husband and brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: They all perished.</span> <span id="s469">They were probably shipped to one of the camps.</span> <span id="s470">From a certain time on, we didn’t hear anything anymore.</span> <span id="s471">In the meantime, my mother and I, we managed to escape from the Gestapo until – I was taken in January, 1944 and my mother was caught a week or two before.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: All that time the two of you were alone, it must have been very fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: It was – you see it came to a point where you had the feeling you know it’s not quite the right thing to compare but sometimes you read from a criminal he is getting tired of running.</span> <span id="s474">Sometimes I felt how long can you run?</span> <span id="s475">I had the feeling one day because from all the people we knew this one was caught and that one was caught.</span> <span id="s476">I mean we figured okay another day, another day but it was only a matter of time.</span> <span id="s477">Ja, then you could fro instance, I had people, acquaintances, they stayed in a room of gentile people – I mean certain people managed to survive by living underground.</span> <span id="s478">They never ventured into the street.</span> <span id="s479">These people I know they stayed in a room with gentiles who had a house by themselves and they stayed in this room – they had enough money.</span> <span id="s480">They supported in fact because the gentiles in Belgium – it’s a miserable people.</span> <span id="s481">Whatever they did, in general, they didn’t do out of their goodness.</span> <span id="s482">They took out from the Jews whatever they could the last penny.</span> <span id="s483">So these people had enough money – but you know how long can you take it.</span> <span id="s484">They were sitting in this room let’s say for two years or longer never seeing the street, always the blinds down because they saw the Gestapo was going everywhere taking out the people.</span> <span id="s485">They had certain times when they could go to the toilet because every house was searched.</span> <span id="s486">I heard it afterwards because these people I saw when I came back from the concentration camp – she said my husband always had his suitcase in the hand and he said I am giving myself up – I can’t take it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You did go into the streets and you didn’t wear the yellow star . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Because I always said I can’t stand it in the room and you know what I did - you could buy a Belgian identity card where it said you were born in Belgium somewhere, on a certain date, you had a French name.</span> <span id="s489">I mean my accent will always give me away – I don’t sound Belgian, I don’t sound French.</span> <span id="s490">So one day I had just gotten my identity card and I was going in the street and a Gestapo came and asks me for my identification.</span> <span id="s491">I gave him my identity card – no I can laugh about it – and he looks at it and he said where were you born?</span> <span id="s492">I didn’t learn that yet – I didn’t know where I was born, I didn’t when I was born, I didn’t know my name – I first got the card.</span> <span id="s493">I said you can read.</span> <span id="s494">The funny part was he was such a little Gestapo man and one woman in my house where I was living with my mother – she was a German gentile and she knew that little man.</span> <span id="s495">He was not as bad as the others.</span> <span id="s496">So I walking with him and he always wanted to know where and when I was born – so I always repeated myself I told him all the time – you can read – whatever is on the card.</span> <span id="s497">But from my accent – he recognized my accent so he took me until the police headquarter and there he gave me back my card and let me go.</span> <span id="s498">Then I went home and I learned where I was born, when I was born only to a Belgian I could get away with it but a German would recognize me accent right away.</span> <span id="s499">So I was walking with that identity card for quite a while and in the street I didn’t have a problem but I dared to much – I worked.</span> <span id="s500">I worked in a gentile place. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: How did you get the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: The jog I got through that German woman.</span> <span id="s503">Look, I didn’t want to sit at home all day long.</span> <span id="s504">I just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s505">So I worked and I was ironing – it was in a laundry and I did ironing.</span> <span id="s506">Now, you see we did one stupid thing.</span> <span id="s507">I told you my parents came along with all these valuables and we were always prepared - in case we get caught – and we knew a Belgian family whom we trusted and to them we gave the suitcase and in the suitcase was a little case with all the valuables but among the clothing and they must have looked at it and when they saw all this, they wanted to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s508">This was why we were doomed.</span> <span id="s509">So first they caught my mother when she was at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, I wasn’t at home and when I came home – ja, afterwards when they left, they sealed the apartment which didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s511">I unsealed it.</span> <span id="s512">I mean this I had learned in the meantime.</span> <span id="s513">For instance, I had a friend who they were looking for but she was not at home so they went in the apartment and then they sealed the apartment.</span> <span id="s514">She was somewhere else but she was with out any clothing or anything.</span> <span id="s515">So I still remember, it was – the moon was shining bright and both of us went to the apartment and unsealed it – it was just with mystic tape – we unsealed it and took everything out she needed, we sealed it back and she went back to the other apartment.</span> <span id="s516">And you know, this woman was highly pregnant.</span> <span id="s517">The funny part was that this woman was in her 40’s and she never thought she is pregnant.</span> <span id="s518">She had three grown up children and she went to the Dr. and she found out she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s519">They took away from her the husband and the three grown up children to the concentration camp and that woman was pregnant.</span> <span id="s520">A very religious woman – so I went with this woman t the hospital – now this was a Catholic hospital.</span> <span id="s521">They kept her in the hospital with the child for the whole time.</span> <span id="s522">I met her afterwards when I came back from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s523">When I came back, the child was a few years old and one day she said to me – she was very hard pressed financially and one day she asked if I would like to baby sit for her child – she is going to see a man who she might marry.</span> <span id="s524">But you know as orthodox Jews; she was not allowed to see him alone.</span> <span id="s525">At this time she went to his house and he lived with his sister and so I babysitted for this boy and when she came back she told me – she said Ilse, he’s a chochet and his wife was for 10 years in a mental hospital and you know according to Jewish law after 10 years you can remarry because she was incurable.</span> <span id="s526">And she said to me – I knew her husband and I knew her children – they were very religious but very modern and she said Ilse, he is much older with a long beard but he looks very good natured and my financial troubles would be gone and his children are married and to make a long story short, she got married and he was nice to the child and the child had a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Just to go back for a moment, when you were working in this laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yes, I was working in that laundry and all of a sudden a Gestapo came in and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Do you think it was this family that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh, there is no question about it because over there nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Did you already know that you mother was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes, that was before, the night before.</span> <span id="s533">That’s why I didn’t sleep there anymore.</span> <span id="s534">I slept in somebody’s house – with a Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Did you know at this time where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: At this time, we knew already and I always said to my mother – I wanted to put my mother into a convent because you could do that and I said to my mother in case they catch you, you have no chance to come back.</span> <span id="s537">I might have a chance – older people have no chance.</span> <span id="s538">But my mother didn’t want to go without me.</span> <span id="s539">Maybe we both could have gone to a convent – I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s540">But I was caught right after so I met my mother still in the headquarters which was in Belgium near Brussels, I forgot the name, with Malines it was, something like Malene – that’s where they gathered all the people and from there we went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: You were sent together?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: We were together and we arrived there and you know they separated left and right.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And they separated you both?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s545">I mean this time I knew.</span> <span id="s546">That was the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s547">They put them right to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Did you know at that time what had happened to your husband and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: You see, I always thought for older people there was no chance.</span> <span id="s550">But I mean when I came out I always hoped that my brother and husband might have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: That must have been an impossible feeling – coming there and watching . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: You have no idea.</span> <span id="s553">I mean I was in Auschwitz and I saw the buring and I couldn’t grab the idea.</span> <span id="s554">It was three days when I was in Auschwitz and I saw naked people walking towards the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s555">I thought I was dreaming – I just couldn’t grab it.</span> <span id="s556">And they came in – people – was the SS came in I don’t know and they looked at our numbers and you know I had a number there and I probably was like in a dream – I mean I couldn’t grad this whole thing what was going on there – and after they were out, I asked Why do they look at the number?</span> <span id="s557">So they looked at me like I am crazy and they said you don’t know?</span> <span id="s558">I said no.</span> <span id="s559">They said if they don’t like the number, you just join the others.</span> <span id="s560">They just picked out.</span> <span id="s561">Selection, it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How did you manage to survive in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s564">Let’s say, I mean, as a young person if you didn’t take sick and if you were not selected, you could survive.</span> <span id="s565">I mean I got typhus and there was every morning somebody coming and looking if there are any people who got sick and they were taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s566">We had the blockalteste, she was the head of the barrack and she was everyday if somebody was sick was supposed to say and we were taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s567">Now going to the hospital I knew that was the end.</span> <span id="s568">At this time was young and I didn’t want to give up yet.</span> <span id="s569">I had typhus, I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s570">I didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s571">I mean accidents happened and at night, I went out and I washed.</span> <span id="s572">Everything wet I put on – I didn’t have anything to change.</span> <span id="s573">In the morning, everybody left the block, I left the block with temperature.</span> <span id="s574">I didn’t say a word and somehow I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Were you able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: You know what our work was?</span> <span id="s577">We had to get up every morning because we were so busy.</span> <span id="s578">We had to get up at 4 a.m. and we had to go outside and stand for hours outside until some SS came to look us over.</span> <span id="s579">Now who could stand for hours?</span> <span id="s580">When the blockalteste, in general she had a little bid understanding, she was one of us – we were allowed to sit on the ground and when she said Achtung – that means jena was coming and we got up.</span> <span id="s581">So we were standing there.</span> <span id="s582">Afterwards they brought in this kind of – like our garbage can looks – with coffee.</span> <span id="s583">We got back in the block and everybody had like a little mug and we got our coffee and our ration of bread which was this big and this high and one slice of bologna and this was for the day.</span> <span id="s584">On this we had to manage to pull through the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Balogna?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: What looked like bologna.</span> <span id="s587">Now I was looking for quantity at this time not for quality.</span> <span id="s588">So I exchanged my bologna for bread so the piece was bigger than that little bit bologna and then in the evening we got a mug of soup.</span> <span id="s589">That was it.</span> <span id="s590">So this was not the worst.</span> <span id="s591">Then at six o’clock an SS with his dog came and we had to go outside.</span> <span id="s592">Don’t forget it was January when I came there and it was very cold.</span> <span id="s593">At 6 o’clock we had to be outside and we were standing in line and we had to take big stones – we had to carry.</span> <span id="s594">Big stones we had to carry – for half an hour we were walking with these stones and we had to put it on a pile there and then we took a stone from there and had to bring it back to the block.</span> <span id="s595">And this we did every morning – I think five times we walked back and forth.</span> <span id="s596">And then we were through for the day – for our busy day.</span> <span id="s597">And everybody was laughing – I mean we were all walking around in these striped uniforms and as I am a small person, everything was too wide and too long for me.</span> <span id="s598">Everybody knew me – I was always sewing.</span> <span id="s599">I couldn’t see me running around like that.</span> <span id="s600">I was busy making things shorter – I had to do something.</span> <span id="s601">And then one day, ja, everyday, for instance, when we came there, we had already everyday a shower, a sauna.</span> <span id="s602">A sauna was called – it was a big place and there was just one shower next to the other and everybody got undressed and took their shower and then we were standing a little bit until we dried up and then we put everything on again.</span> <span id="s603">One day we were standing there, it was after I was there a short time, naked, stark naked we were standing there and the leiter form the camp came in - you know he was in court, it was in the paper he was put to death – his name was Hessler.</span> <span id="s604">And at this time he was pleading he was so good to the girls and nobody said a good word for him.</span> <span id="s605">He was put to death.</span> <span id="s606">I wish I could have gone – I would have told them all the goodness he did in the camp.</span> <span id="s607">We were standing there all naked and he come in.</span> <span id="s608">I mean he couldn’t have waited until we were dressed?</span> <span id="s609">I mean we were stark naked, he walked in, all the soldiers walked in – you just were not a human being anymore.</span> <span id="s610">Okay, I managed to stand in the back but people had to stand in the front too.</span> <span id="s611">And he was standing there and holding a speech – there was a munitions factory there and he said up to now, no Jew ever worked there because we were not trustworthy.</span> <span id="s612">But he will try to put us to work there.</span> <span id="s613">But in case of any espionage, something drastic will happen.</span> <span id="s614">Okay, so he said he will ask to start with 100 people to put them to work in the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s615">Next day, the blockaltests came and asked who wants to go.</span> <span id="s616">I always was very pessimistic and I figured I let the other go first, I wait with the results they are coming back from there.</span> <span id="s617">Now they came back at night – there was two shifts from 6 AM to 6PM and the other one from 6PM to 6AM.</span> <span id="s618">Now the first shift came back and they were complaining left and right.</span> <span id="s619">They didn’t – the soup came in with meant but our – that was all our people – who were the top they took out the meat and the others got the water.</span> <span id="s620">And they were terrible treated and they didn’t want to go anymore.</span> <span id="s621">So I figured Ilse, this time you were right.</span> <span id="s622">Wait and see.</span> <span id="s623">Now next day, nobody wanted to go anymore.</span> <span id="s624">The blockalteste came in and she said 100 people have to go.</span> <span id="s625">I will see that something is done about it.</span> <span id="s626">In the meantime, it happened that Red Cross sent packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Gorgeous packages.</span> <span id="s629">Big packages.</span> <span id="s630">But you know nobody would have thought to share with somebody – that’ didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s631">Now, these packages – in order to make it attractive to work in this factory – only those who worked got his package.</span> <span id="s632">So there I lost out – gorgeous packages.</span> <span id="s633">There was bacon in there, the best things you can imagine were in there.</span> <span id="s634">So I lost out there.</span> <span id="s635">They got the most gorgeous packages.</span> <span id="s636">They couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s637">But when they left the block, they put down their number, they gave it to the blockalteste- she kept it.</span> <span id="s638">Nobody would give somebody else not even a slice of bred.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Wasn’t there a lot of trading?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes, that went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: How about stealing?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Stealing too.</span> <span id="s643">But you see, that’s one thing you learn.</span> <span id="s644">Even the mug.</span> <span id="s645">You know if you didn’t gave your mug, you couldn’t get coffee, you couldn’t get soup.</span> <span id="s646">So you had it always around the belt – it was hanging there.</span> <span id="s647">So one day it was gone, my mug was gone – so I stole it from somewhere else.</span> <span id="s648">That you have to learn – otherwise you can’t survive.</span> <span id="s649">Then I had a girl, she was extremely swift with everything.</span> <span id="s650">For instance, cabbages, potatoes they came in there with big trucks and they were thrown there in front of the kitchen and it was just laying there.</span> <span id="s651">So somebody who was swift went there, hot themselves or herself something and had something to eat – it didn’t matter even a potato was not cooked or a cabbage was not cooked – it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s652">I never could do that – I wasn’t fast enough (laughs).</span> <span id="s653">I was always caught.</span> <span id="s654">Now this girl, she was so fast.</span> <span id="s655">She always had under her bed plenty – but nobody would ever have thought to give somebody anything.</span> <span id="s656">That didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s657">And don’t forget they were all our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Why do you think that was so?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Everybody figured just she wants to survive and that’s it.</span> <span id="s660">You know what the border between a human being and an animal is very small – it doesn’t need much.</span> <span id="s661">That I have learned.</span> <span id="s662">It does not need much.</span> <span id="s663">It is not difficult to be a human being in a human surrounding.</span> <span id="s664">Otherwise it doesn’t need much.</span> <span id="s665">Believe me what I have seen there – no animal could be worse.</span> <span id="s666">The wild beast in the jungle couldn’t be worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Where you assigned to any work commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I worked in the munitions factory finally.</span> <span id="s669">So finally the situation got better – after everyone complained the German soldiers took over.</span> <span id="s670">They were standing there while the soup was given out they were standing there – no Jewish girl could take out the meat anymore.</span> <span id="s671">Then it got to a point where we all had the feeling we were better off in the munitions factory than walking with stones back and forth.</span> <span id="s672">So I joined the party and I went to the night shift.</span> <span id="s673">In the meantime I had heard that the night shift is better because in the night shift, the soldiers had their “chondas” and they didn’t have time to watch.</span> <span id="s674">They were sitting in this corner and that corner with their “chondas” and they had a good time and the prisoners had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Was there ever any instance that you saw of knew of where the soldiers abused .</span> <span id="s676">.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I heard, I heard.</span> <span id="s678">I even knew of pregnant Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s679">I heard.</span> <span id="s680">So then, I joined the night shift from 6 PM to 6 AM but it came to 12 o’clock at night – ja, I don’t know why they picked me out, I’m not a big girl.</span> <span id="s681">I mean usually the small people they set at a table and they had light work to do.</span> <span id="s682">Me, they put at a machine where there were mostly men and husky women and I did the heads for the grenades – I turned it and I burned these things.</span> <span id="s683">So it came 12 o’clock at night and I couldn’t keep my eyes open.</span> <span id="s684">I was standing there 12 hours and doing all the time the same thing, I couldn’t keep my eyes open and I must have falled asleep.</span> <span id="s685">My machine started burning.</span> <span id="s686">Thanks god, one of the men came over, he turned off the machine and he woke me up.</span> <span id="s687">If an SS would have caught me, he would have put me to death – this was espionage right away.</span> <span id="s688">Then I learned, the minute my eyes are falling, I turned off the machine and I walked around until I woke up again.</span> <span id="s689">(new tape) and you know when I was caught, I heard two girls from the underground movement were caught and they were terrible tourtured because that was the worst thing you could do.</span> <span id="s690">And they were with me working there and they were very careful – they were afraid to take about but somehow I got in contact with them so they told us what to do to help them.</span> <span id="s691">Now, we put these heads of grenades – we put in a box – I forgot there was either twenty four or forty eight in one box.</span> <span id="s692">Now they told us the first we do we should do them badly so they couldn’t do anything with them and then on top in case they are checking, we put the good ones.</span> <span id="s693">So that’s how I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: When you say do them badly, you mean they would misfire or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s696">They couldn’t do a thing with them.</span> <span id="s697">So that we did at the machines.</span> <span id="s698">We did all who had contact with these girls what they told us we did.</span> <span id="s699">I figured we will not survive anyway at least let’s do something to do them harm.</span> <span id="s700">So, that’s what we did for a long time we didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s701">Then one morning, they summoned us in the sauna again and the leiter, Mr. Hessler, he told us about his and this happened.</span> <span id="s702">They had trucks and trucks and everything misfired.</span> <span id="s703">Now, it was suggested to him to gas the whole camp.</span> <span id="s704">He does not want to do it – he will give us another chance.</span> <span id="s705">In the meantime something happened.</span> <span id="s706">A few girls worked where they had the explosive powders – gunpowder – and these girls took it out and they intended to explode the whole camp and they were caught and four girls were hanged.</span> <span id="s707">Two in front of the – we had to be present – two in front of the day shift and two in front of the night shift.</span> <span id="s708">I mean I was looking away but you knew what happened.</span> <span id="s709">It didn’t bother us too much, we figured we are going this same way – not being hanged but one way or another anyway.</span> <span id="s710">Nobody thought of ever surviving.</span> <span id="s711">So we did the same thing again and evidently either they didn’t say anything anymore or they didn’t catch anybody anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: On a day by day basis when you certainly didn’t know there was a chance to survive, how did you keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: You know what, there is a Jewish saying – you can get used to all “Tzures”.</span> <span id="s714">You learn to live with tzures.</span> <span id="s715">Another day.</span> <span id="s716">You know what, I slept together – I mean next to next – we always were two people together with another girl.</span> <span id="s717">We were on the same transport from Belgium – she was born Belgian.</span> <span id="s718">And every morning when I woke up, I said to her Adele, I wish there would be a change.</span> <span id="s719">I do not care better or worse.</span> <span id="s720">I just can’t take every day the same thing.</span> <span id="s721">Some change should be.</span> <span id="s722">And she would say to me, Ilse, if it is worse, isn’t it better status quo?</span> <span id="s723">I said, no, no.</span> <span id="s724">and end should be one way or the other.</span> <span id="s725">I just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s726">One day I was standing outside in the camp – this was before I went to the munitions factory – I was standing outside and we were working something there and it was near the hospital and the hospital had very small windows and I was thinking I want to go to the hospital because I know that’s the end.</span> <span id="s727">But I was standing there and a terrible smell came from the hospital and I said no, Ilse, it’s not the right thing, wait a while, maybe something will change, somehow.</span> <span id="s728">But very often I was, and you know very often, people were running against the fence which was barbed wire and was electrically loaded.</span> <span id="s729">Okay, they shut off the electricity and they took them off and they kept on living.</span> <span id="s730">I mean, sometimes you had a feeling you just can’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s731">So and every day the same thing and what you saw and you heard the selections here and the selections there.</span> <span id="s732">And it is working on your nerves.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: That’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: But youth overcomes and unbelievable, I was there together most of the time a mother and a daughter and the mother kept going – she survived.</span> <span id="s735">And very often when I was there, I thought of my mother and I said isn’t she glad she is gone.</span> <span id="s736">I wish I would have gone with her.</span> <span id="s737">(pause) you know it came towards the end, I was there for sixteen months.</span> <span id="s738">Sixteen months is a long time.</span> <span id="s739">And one day we stopped working for the factory.</span> <span id="s740">It came to an end and this was Poland and as the enemies closed in towards Germany, we were chased towards the center of Germany because altogether I was in four camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: You were taken away from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s743">We were taken away from Auschwitz and I don’t know exactly – I was first in Birkenau but Birkenau and Aushwitz was together more or less.</span> <span id="s744">Then we were chased towards Neustadt which was Mecklenburg near Berlin.</span> <span id="s745">And we were on these big open trains where they usually don’t transport people but coals and this stuff.</span> <span id="s746">We were sitting on these open trains and we were near Berlin and we saw Berlin burning – what a pleasure!</span> <span id="s747">And then people came towards us – they were from the underground and they said Berlin is burning – just keep up your spirits.</span> <span id="s748">Another few days and it will be all over.</span> <span id="s749">And you know what helped us morally were the soldiers – German soldiers.</span> <span id="s750">Sometimes they were very decent – they were the older ones, the ones . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: The old Wehrmacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s753">The younger ones were on the front.</span> <span id="s754">They were fighting so the old ones they were with us.</span> <span id="s755">And a few days they took us to the forest and we had to dig trenches so this was in the winter time, it was hard work and it was cold and windy so the soldiers very often were very nice to us – they just let us dig little bit and then we could sit in there – it wasn’t so cold and if they knew somebody was coming, they told us Achtung and we got out and we started shoveling again.</span> <span id="s756">Whenever we were sitting, you know we were hungry all the time, and you know what we were talking about – cooking and baking.</span> <span id="s757">I mean me the housefrau, very ambitious housefrau – we were talking about cooking and baking – about recipes.</span> <span id="s758">So we were in the forest there digging these trenches and every morning the soldiers gave us the news.</span> <span id="s759">They told us how bad it is and one day they said you will be luckier then we are.</span> <span id="s760">They kept us morally going.</span> <span id="s761">And here and there, they gave us cigarettes and the cigarettes we took to the camp and for the cigarettes we got soup or we got more bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Were you able to bribe the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: That was no SS.</span> <span id="s764">We game them to the blockalteste and to the girls because don’t forget, the polish Jews, they were at these camps before us and you know when we complained to them, they told us what a life they had.</span> <span id="s765">They said to us, you don’t know how well off you are here now.</span> <span id="s766">When we came, there were no tents, there were no houses.</span> <span id="s767">We were standing in snow, in ice without shoes.</span> <span id="s768">People were dying left and right.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: I wanted to ask you, what were the living conditions like when you came to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: You know what, typical German.</span> <span id="s771">Whomever they want to keep, they keep.</span> <span id="s772">When I came that was 1944, we had regular houses, we were sleeping on – no beds – it was called “koyen” – that was just wooden shelves and there was a kind of a mattress on it and you got a blanket.</span> <span id="s773">Every morning a sauna, - I told you I mean we were kept clean.</span> <span id="s774">Finally, we got a towel and finally we got soap.</span> <span id="s775">And every morning we were looked after if anyone had lice.</span> <span id="s776">And what I didn’t know but evidently you get lice first just behind the ears because they always looked just behind the ear.</span> <span id="s777">Now god forbid somebody had a louse because you didn’t have to have it.</span> <span id="s778">You could keep yourself clean as long as we were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s779">You see as soon as it started towards the end of the war, when we were chased to other camps, then we didn’t have that anymore.</span> <span id="s780">There was no hot water anymore and there was nothing to sleep.</span> <span id="s781">In the first camp we came to, there was straw on the floor – like animals.</span> <span id="s782">And there we started with lice.</span> <span id="s783">You know I still came back with lice to Belgium.</span> <span id="s784">You can’t get rid of lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: When you were going from camp to camp, did you know that the Germans were losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Oh sure, that we knew.</span> <span id="s787">But we were not hoping we could survive.</span> <span id="s788">We figured they will put us to death in the last minuet.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Where you afraid to hope that you would survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I never thought I would survive.</span> <span id="s791">But you know what they did and this is typical German – this order until the last minute.</span> <span id="s792">Now before we left Auschwitz, that I didn’t know until later, they destroyed all the gas ovens.</span> <span id="s793">But they kept all the documents.</span> <span id="s794">When I started the restitution, I couldn’t have told them I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s795">They knew exactly in what camps I was, what number I had – everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You said you were in four camps – from Auschwitz you went near Mecklenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Neustadt and then there was a fourth one and I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: From where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: From Neustadt – that was the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Who liberated you?</span> <span id="s801">The Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s803">That was very funny.</span> <span id="s804">You know Hitler’s birthday was on the 20th of April.</span> <span id="s805">Now this was already toward the end an every morning we had to stand outside and we were counted from the SS – appeal.</span> <span id="s806">We were standing outside and we had in our minds something should happen today – nothing happened.</span> <span id="s807">We didn’t work anymore, we were just sitting around.</span> <span id="s808">We were liberated on the 10th of May and this last day, we were standing outside and a soldier came and he was throwing around cigarettes.</span> <span id="s809">And we figured that’s a different atmosphere – something must have happened.</span> <span id="s810">And then they told us to go back in the barracks and they locked us in and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s811">But people are sometimes too fast so two girls jumped out of the window and they were shot in the last minuet before the Germans left.</span> <span id="s812">They left and afterwards we were allowed to got out.</span> <span id="s813">And we saw, when we were taken out to the forest to dig these trenches, we saw that private planes were standing there.</span> <span id="s814">They were somehow covered.</span> <span id="s815">But we figured that they were waiting for the last minuet evacuation.</span> <span id="s816">So after we heard the two shots, nobody budged in the block but after awhile, we started breaking the windows and getting out.</span> <span id="s817">So we walked out and we saw the gate open – you know that’s what is much be like when a prisoner is coming out of prison – the gate was open.</span> <span id="s818">But there was something which I still regret.</span> <span id="s819">We went out there and a German soldier was there – evidently they forgot him or he got lost there.</span> <span id="s820">So he said what are you doing here.</span> <span id="s821">This should have been enough – we should have killed him.</span> <span id="s822">I still regret it.</span> <span id="s823">I mean altogether as weak as we were, we would have been able.</span> <span id="s824">How can he ask us this?</span> <span id="s825">I still don’t understand that we didn’t kill him.</span> <span id="s826">I regret it – he should have been killed.</span> <span id="s827">And there I will show you again – the polish Jews are way ahead of us.</span> <span id="s828">Probably they were trained against unnormal anti-Semitic situations from hundreds of years while we German Jews did not know.</span> <span id="s829">Now, we were standing there and you know, we were hungry.</span> <span id="s830">We were a group, you know there were always groups together too, let’s say from Belgium, from France, we were always together.</span> <span id="s831">So, we were four girls and we saw the polish Jews running – where are they running to?</span> <span id="s832">All of a sudden I was very healthy.</span> <span id="s833">I didn’t feel anything, I wasn’t weak.</span> <span id="s834">I was running after them.</span> <span id="s835">Where were they running?</span> <span id="s836">Next to the camp was a small place like country.</span> <span id="s837">Everybody lived there in a one family house – the Germans.</span> <span id="s838">You know what, we went there to the cellars, these cellars had so much food, they could have had war for another 10 years.</span> <span id="s839">In every cellar there was so much food and they were all running away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s840">From the Americans they wouldn’t have run, but from the Russians they were running.</span> <span id="s841">So we saw all this food and we figured how do we get it to the block and they were still shooting all over.</span> <span id="s842">They were still destroying bridges and whatever.</span> <span id="s843">All of a sudden, we saw a little four wheel wagon so we took that and we put everything in there.</span> <span id="s844">Then all of a sudden we thought of a little human feelings, we thought of forks and knives and at night candles and whatever we thought to put in there.</span> <span id="s845">We didn’t get very far and the wagon broke down.</span> <span id="s846">So we looked for another one with two big wheels – this was country – and we put everything in there and we started back to the block.</span> <span id="s847">And we took pots for cooking and one girl with whom I was together – she was the cook.</span> <span id="s848">So we brought everything back and we cooked and we ate and we had a good time.</span> <span id="s849">Then we decided we don’t want to live in the block – we want to move out from the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s850">The SS lived outside the camp and they lived in gorgeous little houses so we moved into these houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: You knew all these houses were vacant?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Everybody left.</span> <span id="s853">There was nobody there.</span> <span id="s854">There were little stoves there and we took wood and coal and whatever we found and we started washing and clothing, whatever we found we took.</span> <span id="s855">We changed all the time clothing.</span> <span id="s856">And if I think of it, we were sitting there like monkeys, one taking out the lice from the other.</span> <span id="s857">And you cannot get rid of them.</span> <span id="s858">We used hot water and we took it outside and put it over the clothes hundreds of times.</span> <span id="s859">Before we got to Belgium, we passes a lot of doctors they gave us injections against the lice.</span> <span id="s860">I was four weeks in Brussels, I couldn’t go to a hairdresser because you couldn’t go with lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: When you left this camp . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Oh, that was terrific.</span> <span id="s863">So we wanted to get to look human.</span> <span id="s864">You know, I came out from the camp, I was seventy pounds.</span> <span id="s865">I mean I looked like a living skeleton.</span> <span id="s866">So we wanted all to pep up a little bit, to get a little bit human like.</span> <span id="s867">Food we had, and at night we had candles so we stayed there for a few weeks, and then we would go back.</span> <span id="s868">One night, somebody comes in with a light-speaks Russian – it was good that girl I was with, she understood Russian.</span> <span id="s869">She was Polish.</span> <span id="s870">Otherwise, I wouldn’t have know what they wanted.</span> <span id="s871">So they told us, everybody who wants to go to his country or her country should leave the next day otherwise, the rest we take with us.</span> <span id="s872">I said that’s all I need.</span> <span id="s873">And the next day we all decided where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s874">We wanted to go back to Belgium and so we assembled with the Americans – in the meantime the Americans had come.</span> <span id="s875">There you have another stupid thing of the Americans . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Why did you decide to go back to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Where should I go?</span> <span id="s878">Not to Germany.</span> <span id="s879">So I wanted to back to Belgium because I figured from there, I will go to the United States.</span> <span id="s880">I didn’t want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s881">So the Americans came, oh boy, if the Americans are reading that, I mean they didn’t know that we had something to eat after we came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s882">They were throwing something to us – little packages so I – we all thought maybe it was chocolate.</span> <span id="s883">At least that would have made sense.</span> <span id="s884">No, chewing gum.</span> <span id="s885">On an empty stomach, if we would have had an empty stomach, what do you do with chewing gum?</span> <span id="s886">And something else, then we were in that German neighborhood and a few Germans were still there.</span> <span id="s887">So, the first thing when we had come out of the camp, we all had diarrhea, so we went to a pharmacy and there was still a German there and I asked him for charcoal and he said to me, do you have money.</span> <span id="s888">Then I got very angry – I was a real rebel.</span> <span id="s889">I said look, you have two choices, to give us the charcoal because you must see from what we look like that w are coming from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s890">You can give us the charcoal nicely or we will take it.</span> <span id="s891">The rest of the consequence, I will not tell you.</span> <span id="s892">So he gave us the charcoal.</span> <span id="s893">You know here and there, there were still a few Germans and you know what two girls did.</span> <span id="s894">They took two well dressed German women and they undressed them in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: I wanted to ask you, you must have come in contact with Germans during those first few days and weeks.</span> <span id="s896">How did you feel towards them?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: I tell you I could have killed them altogether.</span> <span id="s898">You know and then we went into a grocery and we saw up there (on a shelf) all these, you Germans put in jars fruit for winter time, and she had it up there and wewould have liked it and she had plenty there so we asked for it.</span> <span id="s899">First we always asked nicely.</span> <span id="s900">Coming from the concentration camp, they couldn’t ask from us very good manners, right?</span> <span id="s901">They dehumanized us so how good manners could we have but we tried first.</span> <span id="s902">But then she didn’t want to give us anything.</span> <span id="s903">So we told her frankly.</span> <span id="s904">You might give us some or we will kill you.</span> <span id="s905">I said look, you were one of them who took everything away from us.</span> <span id="s906">We not asking anything – we are just asking to eat because we are hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Where there any instances of violence against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, just that they undressed them But you know the Americans they behaved unbelievable.</span> <span id="s909">One night we went and this cook we had with us – she said would you like good chicken soup – that was so cute.</span> <span id="s910">So you know what she did – there was a peasant living there and some chickens running around.</span> <span id="s911">I could never do it – I’m a typical city girl.</span> <span id="s912">She went over there- she plucked a chicken and she brought it over to the block and she made a good chicken soup and then we want back to that peasant and we asked for candles because we had no light at night – no electricity.</span> <span id="s913">And somehow when we went out the Americans were there and they came over to us and they told us we shouldn’t do that to the poor Germans.</span> <span id="s914">I’m telling you – I wish you could turn that off – for American stupidity there is no limit.</span> <span id="s915">They had no understanding - for the poor Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: You were liberated from Neustadt.</span> <span id="s917">How did you get out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: The American trucks were waiting for us – there were no trains yet.</span> <span id="s919">The Americans took us to – our first stop was Holland.</span> <span id="s920">You know Holland is very hospitable.</span> <span id="s921">That was so nice.</span> <span id="s922">We came to Holland – the table was all set in white tablecloths, white bread we got, priests were waiting for us to place us.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Who organized this?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: The government of Holland.</span> <span id="s925">Defiantly.</span> <span id="s926">This is Holland.</span> <span id="s927">White bread and noodles and the priests were there – they blessed us and everybody got a big package from Red Cross and then from Holland we came to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: You had gotten clothes from the farms around Neustadt.</span> <span id="s929">Could you still be pointed out as a survivor from KZ?</span> <span id="s930">Was your hair still short?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No, they only shaved it once and the they let it grow.</span> <span id="s932">But you know what they did – these people who were sitting in the munitions factory at tables – the had very boring work, they assorted things for 12 hours at a stretch.</span> <span id="s933">If they caught somebody falling asleep there, they shaved off their hair again.</span> <span id="s934">That was the punishment.</span> <span id="s935">For us, it was only when we arrived there, right away they shaved off the hair and we got our number and we got the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: You used the word dehumanizing, for a young girl this must be very . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: This hurts so much you have no idea.</span> <span id="s938">You know the funny thing is that was always my first thought when I heard a girl is going to be a nun.</span> <span id="s939">The first thing that impressed me that they shave off the hair.</span> <span id="s940">This hurts so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: That’s what I meant, to have a number put on . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: This is the end of the human being.</span> <span id="s943">You are – that’s for slaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Emotionally, how did you come back from that kind of experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Let’s say I have never become the same again.</span> <span id="s946">I was never that soft, I was never that shy.</span> <span id="s947">I have become a rebel against the world.</span> <span id="s948">And I would never take any nonsense anymore.</span> <span id="s949">You wouldn’t believe it, in our time it is understandable, but I always walk around with a knife.</span> <span id="s950">I wouldn’t give it up if somebody is attacking me.</span> <span id="s951">I mean I have learned – I have gone through a hard school.</span> <span id="s952">I am a person very easy to get along with but I can make my point and I’m not taking any nonsense.</span> <span id="s953">I wish I would have been that way before.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: From Holland, the Americans took you to Belgium.</span> <span id="s955">How long did you stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Too long, I hated that Belgium the minute I came there.</span> <span id="s957">First of all, it’s a miserable people – very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s958">You know when we came back what they said – too many Jews had come back.</span> <span id="s959">Don’t forget, some of them gave their fortune to the Belgians to keep it for them – now, they wanted them to come back?</span> <span id="s960">They hoped they would never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Did you ever find those people to whom you gave the suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: I tell you.</span> <span id="s963">I knew these people and I found these people.</span> <span id="s964">I went to the police.</span> <span id="s965">The police wouldn’t be on my side and I couldn’t prove it.</span> <span id="s966">How could I prove it?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Did you try at that point to find out what happened to the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Look, I hoped somebody would back.</span> <span id="s969">Nobody came.</span> <span id="s970">When the transports came, I hoped.</span> <span id="s971">You see that girl from Belgium I was with – we took first two rooms together.</span> <span id="s972">Each of us a room and she was cooking.</span> <span id="s973">I mean that’s all we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What did you do for money?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: We got it from committee – I think the JOINT.</span> <span id="s976">We got a certain amount of money, we got injections, we were under doctors care all the time.</span> <span id="s977">We were skeletons.</span> <span id="s978">All we did all day long, we were eating.</span> <span id="s979">You know, it was years after, when I arrived here, I was a size 16.</span> <span id="s980">(She is a size 8).</span> <span id="s981">My whole pleasure was eating.</span> <span id="s982">I didn’t care what I looked like, I couldn’t care less – that was my whole pleasure.</span> <span id="s983">Only this friend I lived with – when I became friendly with her (Mrs. Eppingen – she was a widow – she had emigrated from Germany in 1936 about to Cali with her physician husband who then died in Colombia of a tropical disease and she came here and they shared an apartment for many years) and she was very vain.</span> <span id="s984">She was very good-looking, very good figure.</span> <span id="s985">One day she said to me, Ilse, once in a while, do you look in the mirror?</span> <span id="s986">I said yes, Erna, I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s987">I know I look very plumpy.</span> <span id="s988">But I was always hungry.</span> <span id="s989">On my first job here, you know I arrived with three sandwiches every morning.</span> <span id="s990">I had a big sandwich at 10 o’clock – nobody is eating like that in America.</span> <span id="s991">I had a big sandwich for lunch and another big sandwich in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s992">Everybody looked at me but this was my pleasure.</span> <span id="s993">Then she told me she would put me on a diet that wouldn’t be hungry and I would get enough to eat and I would get a nice figure again.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: did you plan immediately to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: yes, I hated Belgium.</span> <span id="s996">This is another thing – typical American.</span> <span id="s997">I mean I got the best impression from America before I came here.</span> <span id="s998">I had my uncle here and I had my brother-in-law here – he was in the army already.</span> <span id="s999">The first think I came from the camp – I sent a cable to each of them.</span> <span id="s1000">My brother in law cabled back where’s Kurt?</span> <span id="s1001">- his brother.</span> <span id="s1002">Then I told him I want to come over.</span> <span id="s1003">My brother-in-law didn’t have much money – where should it come from?</span> <span id="s1004">My uncle came here with a lot of money but in the meantime I understand the situation.</span> <span id="s1005">He didn’t want to declare the whole thing because of tax purposes.</span> <span id="s1006">Anyway, they both gave me an affidavit and the American consulate was in Antwerp and I always got the news, it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1007">Then I got a third affidavit from cousin here and again – it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1008">I mean at this time I was young, I could work.</span> <span id="s1009">Another cousin who was a little bit more alret, she went to her congressman and she said I have a cousin in Belgium, she is young, she is healthy and she can work.</span> <span id="s1010">She has already gotten three affidavits and she is always told it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1011">Something is wrong.</span> <span id="s1012">The minute she said something is wrong – it took a few days and I was summoned to Antwerp and I got my affidavit.</span> <span id="s1013">You know what happened, everybody who could pay, paid him and those who couldn’t, the papers went on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1014">Finally, with four affidavits for one person, I came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Who picked you up at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: My uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: How did you manage the first few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: I managed all right.</span> <span id="s1019">I lived for one or two weeks with my uncle and then I was looking for a job which I got at Fleck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: How did you get that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Through the Self-Help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: How did you manage without knowing the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Don’t tell me I didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s1024">I had English in school eight years.</span> <span id="s1025">We had schooling.</span> <span id="s1026">Five years French, three years Latin, some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1027">In fact whatever, I know, I forgot because I was always together with Germans here.</span> <span id="s1028">They were all Germans.</span> <span id="s1029">The whole bunch were immigrants.</span> <span id="s1030">But you know, if I speak German with my friends, it is a different story.</span> <span id="s1031">For instance, when I am in Switzerland and somebody talks German to me, I’m getting like – everything is getting stiff in me.</span> <span id="s1032">I do not answer.</span> <span id="s1033">It’s like when a bull sees red.</span> <span id="s1034">Once here, we were in a restaurant and I usually speak German with my friends and we were speaking German there.</span> <span id="s1035">All of a sudden, a German turns around and says, oh, how nice to hear somebody speaking German.</span> <span id="s1036">I got up – I didn’t say a word and I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: in line with that, how do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Look, if the widergutmachung would be a gift from them, I wouldn’t accept it.</span> <span id="s1039">But it is not a gift.</span> <span id="s1040">It is in fact a small part of what we lost.</span> <span id="s1041">A gift I wouldn’t accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: In looking back today, do you feel yourself more a part of American society or more a part of German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Part of the American society – I found out when I was traveling with
