his younger brother died before the war.</span> <span id="s30">His second brother is still alive.</span> <span id="s31">He lives in Russia in the city of Krasnodar, that's by the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s32">So there were four brothers originally, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Interviewer: No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Interpreter: One now still lives in Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Interviewer: Was he the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Interpreter: No, he's the second oldest.</span> <span id="s37">His brother was born in 1914, his older brother.</span> <span id="s38">He is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Interviewer: I know that this will probably be hard, but does he remember anything about Odessa growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Interpreter: Before the Second World War, the life was a lot better than when they were leaving.</span> <span id="s41">His older brother went into the Army a couple of years prior to him, his oldest brother.</span> <span id="s42">He was an aviator.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Interviewer: His brother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Interpreter: His older brother, yes.</span> <span id="s45">I have to clarify something, because he mixed me up with the dates so I have to look up some records.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Interviewer: Sure, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Interpreter: He went into the Army altogether in 1940's, he was liberated from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s48">Altogether, he was about nine and a half years in the Russian Army; that includes near three and a half or four years in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Interviewer: So he was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s50">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s51">It didn't say that in his records.</span> <span id="s52">It is one of the groups in fact that we are trying….</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Interpreter: I think he was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s54">He doesn't remember.</span> <span id="s55">In 1942, April of 1942, April or June, I can't make it out, it is very old; in January of 1942 on the city of Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), in a small town called Panevtsy, and this is where he was actually taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s56">In April of 1945 he was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Interviewer: So he was in a concentration camp for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Interpreter: Three years.</span> <span id="s59">Now during these three years, I remember, because I was filling certain papers.</span> <span id="s60">In those days, about ten years ago, I was filling the papers for UJ, you know repatriation fund whatever they call that, I remember that he ran away four times.</span> <span id="s61">He was in two or three different camps besides Auschwitz, he was in -- I'll find out which.</span> <span id="s62">This is by the way, a copy of, when they liberated him, the Russian Army was giving a like a record.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Interviewer: So he was liberated by the Russian Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Interpreter: Right.</span> <span id="s65">And it says here he was liberated by, it was signed by Lt. Kronov (see references below, which say signed by others) in April of 1945, Silesia, Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s66">Where was?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Interviewer: It's in Poland (mostly in SW Poland, with some portions in Germany and some in Czech Republic, according to Where Once We Walked).</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Interpreter: Auschwitz was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Interviewer: Close.</span> <span id="s70">Auschwitz was in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Interpreter: Ahlborn was another camp and Katowice in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Interviewer: I think that's in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Interpreter: In Poland also.</span> <span id="s74">Because I can't make it out.</span> <span id="s75">It is a very, very old copy, a dark copy; you know what's the problem.</span> <span id="s76">And the handwriting, it's not print or anything.</span> <span id="s77">You know what repatriation is, right?</span> <span id="s78">This is his copy of his “NKGB” or “NKB”?</span> <span id="s79">that he is back citizen and that they checked him out and that he was in German concentration camp and they gave him the letter of repatriation and everything.</span> <span id="s80">OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Interviewer: Was he?</span> <span id="s82">I know that many of those who returned after the war to Russia, the NKB were not very nice to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Interpreter: This is the original one.</span> <span id="s84">OK, in the back.</span> <span id="s85">OK.</span> <span id="s86">It says here that he was in the Army in the 9th Polk, you know what's Polk, right, it's like a battalion, in June 1942, between June and July 1942, he was taken a prisoner and its station Tatsnitzki and Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), probably T-a-t-n-i-t-s-k-i, T-a-t-z-n-i-t-s-k-i, T-a-t-s or T-a-t-z, something like that and like they used to say Gubernia province near Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), OK?</span> <span id="s87">And in 1942, he was stationed right there, there was a camp just for war prisoners.</span> <span id="s88">Later on, in 1942, they took him to Katowice, Upper Silesia, in Germany, you know where it is, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Interviewer: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Interpreter: From over there, he ran away and he was later and captured and taken to Ahlborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Interviewer: Is that also in Germany or is it in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Interpreter: Also Poland.</span> <span id="s93">And then, he ran away from Ahlborn and they took him to Upper Silesia and that was, I think, I don't know the name of the town -- Nikloch, Upper Silesia -- Niklai , looks like Niklai, it says here Upper Silesia and it says here, Germany, but I don't think Upper Silesia was Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Interviewer: Yes, what the Germans did was they incorporated most of Poland into the Reich, so it became German territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Interpreter: Now do you want, it says here he was liberated by first, Russian front, yes here it says the name of the city, Nikolai (Mikolow, Poland or Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Niklovichi, Ukraine), Upper Silesia and the man who gave him the letter of liberation is Captain Ivanov and they had to check him out because it is dated May 12th, 1945, so actually straight from the concentration camp they took him back to the Army.</span> <span id="s96">Oh, I'm sorry, I was wrong.</span> <span id="s97">Right after they liberated him, they put him into the hospital, they had to operate.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Interviewer: He was injured and wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Interpreter: Right, he has the wound.</span> <span id="s100">He was all cut up, because of his stomach and everything.</span> <span id="s101">When after the war and people liberated, they were drinking and eating and they weren't eating for years so right away a lot of them -- so he was in a hospital and they had to do surgery on him and everything and he came out of the hospital, he doesn't know why he had the operation or anything.</span> <span id="s102">According to the records here, indicate this is the original letter given Kirzhner, Joseph, born in 1916 in the city of Odessa and he was liberated, and it is signed here Captain Ivanov and it is dated April, 1945, NKO, Department of Repatriation.</span> <span id="s103">And he was liberated by the 1st Ukranian Front.</span> <span id="s104">And Colonel Karnavolov was the guy who signed it and it was a special Krokov, some kind of Karnavolov punt, this is where they used to collect all the war prisoners, look in the records, check if they were traitors or not, anything like this.</span> <span id="s105">And it was stamped by his stamp and it says he was the head of repatriation for 1st Front of Ukraine.</span> <span id="s106">He's a Colonel Major Karnavolov.</span> <span id="s107">OK?</span> <span id="s108">Altogether, I remember that he ran away four to five times from the concentration camps and he was caught because they couldn't run far enough.</span> <span id="s109">So they were punished and one time, in Auschwitz they did some kind of experiments.</span> <span id="s110">I think a couple of the wounds, because he wasn't operated only after the war.</span> <span id="s111">During the war they also did some kind of experiments because there were a couple of operations done on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Interviewer: Does he remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Interpreter: He doesn't.</span> <span id="s114">I asked him before why did they operate and he doesn't remember anything, all right?</span> <span id="s115">His father got killed in the beginning of the War in Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Interviewer: Was he fighting in the War?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Interpreter: Yes, he died in the front.</span> <span id="s118">And Mama, she was like the Jews, they were all exterminated, she was exterminated.</span> <span id="s119">His older brother was at the front fighting, the same as he.</span> <span id="s120">And his parents sent his younger brother who lives in Krasnodar; they sent him to relatives in another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Interviewer: So away.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Interpreter: Away from the front.</span> <span id="s123">He is the youngest brother.</span> <span id="s124">He is still alive.</span> <span id="s125">He lives in Krasnodar.</span> <span id="s126">What else would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Interviewer: Let's see.</span> <span id="s128">Can we back up a little bit and ask him a little bit about his time in the Army?</span> <span id="s129">Like before the war and also about the Finnish War.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Interpreter: He remembers that he was in Finland and that he was in active Army, because they were fighting but that's all he remembers.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Interviewer: In the Army, what did he do?</span> <span id="s132">Was he an artillery man?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Interpreter: He was a driver, a truck driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Interviewer: So he drove a transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Interpreter: But in a tank division, he probably was in what do they call it, the mobile tank division?</span> <span id="s136">Oh, he was a driver of tanks?</span> <span id="s137">He drove a tank, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Interviewer: Does he remember where he may have gotten near, what cities?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Interpreter: According to the records he was captured on the Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu).</span> <span id="s140">If you remember, on Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), in 1942, it was the biggest tank, uh, that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Interviewer: No, I mean in Finland?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Interpreter: Oh, Finland.</span> <span id="s143">In Finland, he wasn't a tank driver yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Interviewer: Oh, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Interpreter: He already was a tank driver in Finland.</span> <span id="s146">And he was taken in prison, they were surrounded, the army was surrounded under the city of Nikolaiev (Mykolayiv) near Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu), you know.</span> <span id="s147">He was fighting in the city of Nikolai (Mikolow, Poland or Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Niklovichi, Ukraine) on South River or South Book (neither found).</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Interviewer: Oh, the Book River, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Interpreter: It is about 500 km somewhere near the city of Rostov (Rostov-na-Donu).</span> <span id="s150">This where actually he was taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s151">He doesn't remember, there was something Millinov, Milli, he remembers some names of the people that were in prison with him.</span> <span id="s152">The head of the 5th part of division something, Maltzev; another tank driver Yapalov, another tank driver Furdarov.</span> <span id="s153">During the war he told them that his name, he didn't tell them his real name because he was Jewish and the Jews were automatically killed so he went under the name of Urlov Sasha, which is Alexander because he has the eye because if you look at his eye --.</span> <span id="s154">He told them he was a Tartar.</span> <span id="s155">Faust or Raust (Rauscha?)</span> <span id="s156">was the name of the concentration camp in the city of Nikolai (Mikolow, Poland or Mykolayiv, Ukraine or Niklovichi, Ukraine).</span> <span id="s157">Faust.</span> <span id="s158">And another camp by the name of Selima (Sellin?)</span> <span id="s159">, or this is Selima Faust, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s160">No, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s161">Selima was his friend.</span> <span id="s162">They were together in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s163">You remember he was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s164">According to that letter, Nikolai was the last camp they (can’t understand).</span> <span id="s165">Nikolov?</span> <span id="s166">(Nikolaistr.</span> <span id="s167">?)</span> <span id="s168">I think it’s Nikolai (Nikolaistr.</span> <span id="s169">?)</span> <span id="s170">.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Interviewer: I'll look it up when I get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Interpreter: According to that letter, it's Nikolai (Nikolaistr.</span> <span id="s173">?)</span> <span id="s174">.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Interviewer: Does he remember anything about the camps, being in them, what they were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Interpreter: He says all he remembers is wire all around, and my grandmother says sometimes when they show movies then he remembers, he says this tower here, this tower there.</span> <span id="s177">He shouldn't really get into -- too much for him in one day.</span> <span id="s178">He remembers constant beatings.</span> <span id="s179">I think that should be enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Interviewer: Let me get a little bit about the end straight.</span> <span id="s181">You said he was in these different concentration camps from '42 to '45.</span> <span id="s182">And he was liberated by the Russian Army, the 1st Ukrainian Front in April of 1945.</span> <span id="s183">Now he was interviewed by the NKGB.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Interpreter: The NKO is a different, I wouldn't know; let's try to figure it out.</span> <span id="s185">NKO, this is exactly what it says.</span> <span id="s186">After the war, a lot of prisoners, they said "well, if you're alive, then you are a traitor".</span> <span id="s187">So NKO is probably a special committee who used to check and I think I gave you the name of the Colonel who signed it.</span> <span id="s188">OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Interviewer: You did.</span> <span id="s190">I know that most of the prisoners were considered traitors.</span> <span id="s191">But he wasn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Interpreter: He wasn’t.</span> <span id="s193">First of all, he had his two feet frozen, his legs were frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Interviewer: And that's because he was in the camps; in the colder air.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Interpreter: Exactly.</span> <span id="s196">That I know from his medical history because I go sometimes to the doctor and when they ask him certain things from the years before I remember.</span> <span id="s197">And I remember he used to tell me when I was a kid that a couple of times he ran away a few guys together with, the name of his friend I gave you, a couple of times he ran away from a couple of camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Interviewer: When he told you these stories, did he give you any more details?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Interpreter: Well, when they used to catch them, they used to give them heavy beatings and they used to beat them on their feet.</span> <span id="s200">The guys who used to beat them were different prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Interviewer: They were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Interpreter: Not only Germans, not only Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Interviewer: Do you remember who they were?</span> <span id="s204">Were they other prisoners or were… Interpreter: Yes, he told me they were Kapos.</span> <span id="s205">They used to beat them with a stick on their bare feet and make them walk, you know, until the blood used to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Interviewer: Did he give you any more details on this kind of thing, was this in Auschwitz or was it somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Interpreter: I can't make it out.</span> <span id="s208">He's trying to tell me something.</span> <span id="s209">I think Germans threw something.</span> <span id="s210">He has a problem with his kidney so sometimes it becomes unclear for a while.</span> <span id="s211">When the liberation army started moving in closer and they started bombing the camps, so the German soldiers lined everybody up and they started to shoot them all, or to shoot them before the Army got there, before the liberation came.</span> <span id="s212">All the prisoners started to run in different directions.</span> <span id="s213">This was just before liberation.</span> <span id="s214">And right away, right after, the bombing and shooting and disarray, within an hour or two the Russian army moved in and they were liberated.</span> <span id="s215">When he was liberated, he had a problem with his stomach and his feet were frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Interviewer: Was the problem with his stomach because he didn't have anything to eat, was that what it was and he ate too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Interpreter: He doesn't remember why but it was all the way up to here.</span> <span id="s218">You know maybe it was experiment or something.</span> <span id="s219">He doesn't remember.</span> <span id="s220">I can't make it out.</span> <span id="s221">He was operated once in Germany and after the war the second time.</span> <span id="s222">I know that his feet, you know why because his original trade after the war became a shoemaker and when I was a child I used to sit next to him and he used to fix the shoes in the house, we used to talk and I used to ask him questions and he used to tell me and I asked him how come you like your shoes white and he said because I like it white and with warm lining because during the war, he said my foot was frozen and if I get a little flu or something, my foot swells up and red constantly and then he got some kind of rash, which goes on, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Interviewer: Well, the only thing I can do if you remember more of what he told you, because….</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Interviewer: Basically, this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Interviewer: This is all he told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Interpreter: Yes.</span> <span id="s227">I remember a picture of his father, my grandfather, because he was a very big, bold man and we used to have a Communist hero called Kotovsky, his last name, I don't know if you ever follow Russian history.</span> <span id="s228">When I was a little baby, I remember I used to tell everybody my grandfather was Kotovsky because he was big and bold man and he had always uniform of Russian Army and I remember him on the pictures and what else.</span> <span id="s229">I did meet my grandfather's two brothers and we live here 17 years already so you can understand.</span> <span id="s230">I remember the stories of him running away from the camp and in one camp he told them he was from Moldavia and another camp he told them he's Tartar because most of the Tartars were considered like people the Communists and Russians used to terminate them themselves so Germans tried to leave Tartars alone.</span> <span id="s231">They used to give them a heavy beating and take them into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Interviewer: So he told this to the Germans, that he's Moldavian and Tartar.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Interpreter: Right, exactly.</span> <span id="s234">Once he told them Moldavian and that didn't work, so the next he got captured when he ran away with the other guy, you have the name, I don't remember, they told both that they were Tartar, and he advised him to say the same and he'd teach him a couple of words here and there and that's it.</span> <span id="s235">That's how it went.</span> <span id="s236">All together, I think they ran away four times.</span> <span id="s237">I remember from previous records that I filled for his pension and everything.</span> <span id="s238">Each time they were caught, they were taken to a camp.</span> <span id="s239">I think from Auschwitz alone, they tried to run twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Interviewer: And they were caught both times?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Interpreter: Yes, and they were beat on their feet by the Kapos.</span> <span id="s242">That I remember pretty well.</span> <span id="s243">And then when they wanted to do something, they were barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Interviewer: After the War, after the operation, what did he do, did he stay in Russia for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Interpreter: Oh, he came back to the city of Odessa.</span> <span id="s246">That's when he met my grandmother.</span> <span id="s247">Because this is my step-grandfather.</span> <span id="s248">My real grandfather died during the war also.</span> <span id="s249">He died in the Russian Army in 1942.</span> <span id="s250">1944, my real grandfather died.</span> <span id="s251">They met after the war.</span> <span id="s252">But he always had his health problem after the war.</span> <span id="s253">As I remember, in 1950's, he was in the hospital, 1960's.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Interviewer: When did you all come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Interpreter: We came 1976, they came 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Interviewer: You came before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Interpreter: In 1976.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Interviewer: OK, I think that's all the questions I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Interpreter: All right.</span></p></body></html>
