I’ll ask him to give a class for baalei teshuva.”</span> <span id="s31">And this is a fellow who went to night school in college only twice a week while he was learning in yeshivas.</span> <span id="s32">And thank God, he’s religious, he lives in Kew Gardens Hills.</span> <span id="s33">He’s not chasidisch, but he’s religious.</span> <span id="s34">He’s divorced, but he remarried to a religious person named Chechik.</span> <span id="s35">The children are all in yeshivas.</span> <span id="s36">His first wife was also religious, a daughter of the Waldmans from Miami.</span> <span id="s37">My second son is married to a religious girl from an important religious family.</span> <span id="s38">He also went to yeshivas.....Mirrer, Torah Temimah.</span> <span id="s39">My daughter is married to someone who learned in Lakewood and is now a head of a yeshiva in Flatbush.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">WH: How long have you lived in Boro Park?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">JG: Thirty one years.</span> <span id="s42">And when I sit here by my window on Shabbos and look out, I can’t believe what I see.</span> <span id="s43">This is one of the biggest wonders and people don’t realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">WH: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JG: After the war I met one of my friends and he made fun of me that I was still kosher “what for?”</span> <span id="s46">he asked.</span> <span id="s47">“Yes kosher, not kosher, what’s the difference?”</span> <span id="s48">And after seven years, this man returned to his roots; he wears a shtreimel!</span> <span id="s49">So many thousands of Jews didn’t believe after the war....the Nazis has incinerated their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, together with the Sefer Torahs People didn’t believe in God.</span> <span id="s50">So when I look here and see all these Jews who became religious again, I say this is the biggest miracle.</span> <span id="s51">I see the hand of God because something is going on that we don’t understand.</span> <span id="s52">The Jewish people are returning to their roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: Do you see a difference between religion here and in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">JG: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">In Europe you didn’t see as much acceptance by women that their husbands should sit and learn.</span> <span id="s56">Of course, business was much harder in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">WH: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JG: Seven or eight times.</span> <span id="s59">It’s unforgivable what they did to the Sephardic Jews in the fifties, that they moved them from religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s61">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0032 PAGE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
