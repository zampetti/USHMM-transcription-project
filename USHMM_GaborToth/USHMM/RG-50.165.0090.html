it is my oxygen.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WH: When did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">AP: March 1947, on the Marine Marlin.</span> <span id="s43">There was a strike in Bremerhaven and we had to wait there for three weeks.</span> <span id="s44">When we got here I saw my first Americans in civilian clothes – until then I’d known only soldiers.</span> <span id="s45">And I saw that they were people like all other people.</span> <span id="s46">Then my mother and I went to the Marseilles Hotel and I thought, “Oh, it’s the DP camps all over again.”</span> <span id="s47">The smell!</span> <span id="s48">I still remember the smell of the place.</span> <span id="s49">It smelled like peanuts and there was a musty smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">WH: Were your parents observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">AP: No, but they were Jewishly conscious and sent me to a Hebrew gymnasium.</span> <span id="s52">WH: What did you do when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">AP: I was told my people that the best business in America is plastics.</span> <span id="s54">Of course, I didn’t know what plastics was.</span> <span id="s55">So three days later I went to work in a plastics factory in Yonkers on McLean Avenue.</span> <span id="s56">Don’t ask.</span> <span id="s57">I was back in concentration camp all over again.</span> <span id="s58">I was cutting cones for ten hours a day for 65 cents an hour six days a week.</span> <span id="s59">I just didn’t believe what was happening – supporting my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s60">Then I got a job sorting panties for 75 cents an hour on 23rd Street.</span> <span id="s61">I became an expert on panties and I immediately wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s62">I went to USNA and they were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s63">They gave me a fellowship of $25.00 a week which I repaid years later, every penny of it, with joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WH: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">AP: Well, the high school I went to, the Hebrew gymnasium, no longer existed.</span> <span id="s66">And they wanted my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s67">I went from one school to another school, to another school.</span> <span id="s68">No way.</span> <span id="s69">Then, an incredible thing happened.</span> <span id="s70">I met Dr. Pinchas Churgin, the Dean of Yeshiva University and I spent the first Passover in the U.S. with the Churgins.</span> <span id="s71">Their daughter, Batya, a musicologist, was taking me from one place to another.</span> <span id="s72">Then finally, Dr. Churgin said, “Do you still remember your high school studies?”</span> <span id="s73">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s74">He said, “Okay, I’m going to give you the exams for Yeshiva University.”</span> <span id="s75">And so, I went to Y.U. from 1947 to 1951 and got my B.A. there.</span> <span id="s76">And I was the first conductor of an orchestra they had there.</span> <span id="s77">There was no music program there.</span> <span id="s78">I used to come there at 6:00 a.m., and wake up my guys to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: Where did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">AP: At all graduations and other functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Were there other students in your classes who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">AP: No.</span> <span id="s83">I only remember a Rabbi Arthur Schneier who was in many classes with me especially German, with Professor Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s84">I had nothing to do with the Jewish studies division.</span> <span id="s85">I was excused from that because I was also going, at the same time, to the New York College of Music, taking music courses.</span> <span id="s86">I was going to two schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WH: Is this your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">AP: No, I separated from my wife and now I’m married to Jeannie.</span> <span id="s89">The only thing that may surprise you is that she’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s90">She is one of the most beautiful people I have ever met.</span> <span id="s91">She is gentle and, strangely enough, in all my encounters.</span> <span id="s92">I never met anyone who showed me such compassion and understanding, who licked my wounds, as her.</span> <span id="s93">We’ve been together since 1973.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: What do your children do?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">AP: My son is a computer specialist and my daughter is a graphic designer.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">WH: Many survivors have strong feelings about marrying out of the religion.</span> <span id="s97">I take it you just look at people as people, as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">AP: To answer you I have to take you on a trip.</span> <span id="s99">For me to talk about my Jewishness would not only be redundant; it would be silly.</span> <span id="s100">I’m so Jewish there’s nothing I could do to change it.</span> <span id="s101">I couldn’t imagine changing it anymore than people wanting to discard their tattoos.</span> <span id="s102">I would never, ever want to change that number.</span> <span id="s103">I look at it.</span> <span id="s104">I still see the victory.</span> <span id="s105">I always think of 34452.</span> <span id="s106">That doesn’t exist anymore.</span> <span id="s107">That was my father’s number.</span> <span id="s108">It is tragic, yet it’s victorious.</span> <span id="s109">One of us died.</span> <span id="s110">The day he died was a horrifying day.</span> <span id="s111">When the war began I took care of them.</span> <span id="s112">I saved their lives innumerable times.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">And that day I couldn’t save this life.</span> <span id="s114">I was in Auschwitz, working sixteen hours a day.</span> <span id="s115">And he had a boil that was so infected that he was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s116">So he went to the hospital (illegible) in a commando that was working in the hospital.</span> <span id="s117">The place was empty.</span> <span id="s118">I asked the man working there, “Where’s my father?”</span> <span id="s119">He looks at the chimney and he says, “Right there, in the smoke.”</span> <span id="s120">And you know what’s incredible?</span> <span id="s121">How a person’s defense mechanisms work.</span> <span id="s122">My father was really a very special man.</span> <span id="s123">I didn’t shed a tear at that moment.</span> <span id="s124">What I remember, what I remember is my stone-like insides.</span> <span id="s125">I feel his death much more now; he died in forty-four, 46 years ago.</span> <span id="s126">I feel it every day stronger and stronger and I am more enraged about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: How does one have faith in a world where a man as accomplished and talented as your father could just be reduced to a nothing, to a number in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">AP: Somehow my life instincts were so strong.</span> <span id="s129">In Jeannie I met a person with whom Iam so much in concert with, that humanity has no boundaries.</span> <span id="s130">I didn’t marry Jeannie because she was Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s131">And we have no barriers because neither of us are religious.</span> <span id="s132">I think she was a Presbyterian, but we don’t practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: Do you ever go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">AP: I don’t participate in religion because I feel that throughout all the years I found no solace there or in talking to rabbis.</span> <span id="s135">I’ll never forget – one day I was at a bar mitzvah, a rabbi spoke in Scarsdale.</span> <span id="s136">He gave one of the most brilliant sermons I ever heard on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s137">And afterwards I came over to him and I said, “You don’t know how you touched my heart.”</span> <span id="s138">And he said, “Gut Shabbos, gut Shabbos, gut Shabbos.”</span> <span id="s139">So.</span> <span id="s140">I feel, frankly, more (illegible) am really, deep in my heart, a temple unto myself.</span> <span id="s141">I’m still angry at Him.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: But you believe in Him?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">AP: Oh yes, but He took away everything I ever had.</span> <span id="s144">He took away my childhood.</span> <span id="s145">But then He gave me what I have now.</span> <span id="s146">I have friends and students who I like more than I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">WH: What about other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">AP: The people that survived, in general, were the people that had the greatest chance to survive because they were the least sensitive.</span> <span id="s149">The people that were most sensitive were immediately exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: Well, you’re one of that group.</span> <span id="s151">How then, did you survive?</span> <span id="s152">AP: I don’t…I cannot understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JP: I think his family upbringing was so difficult, it trained him.</span> <span id="s154">WH: In what way was it so difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">JP: Because his parents were not home.</span> <span id="s156">He was probably not a wanted child.</span> <span id="s157">AP: I had a very European upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: What did all these experiences teach you about human nature in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">AP: I was appalled by the lack of sensitivity, indifference, and contempt of American Jews when I came here.</span> <span id="s160">As Dreyfuss would have have said, “I accuse” the Jewish people for having so little compassion and asking me certain questions.</span> <span id="s161">For example, one night I was sitting with Lorin Hollander’s teacher, in Maine, mind you, in (illegible).</span> <span id="s162">And I started at 9 p.m. and finished, five hours later, at 2:00 a.m., and this was the first time I’d ever talked about it.</span> <span id="s163">And the teacher said to me, “Did you have to upset my life that much?”</span> <span id="s164">And I found that this was not the exception, but the rule.</span> <span id="s165">I found very few people who were compassionate.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WH: Why was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">AP: It had to do with their own guilt and the fact that it simply made them uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s168">And I find that my wife, who is not Jewish, understands it better because she has the objectivity.</span> <span id="s169">If I were a sociologist, I would like to write about why I got so little compassion.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">WH: Do you have any friends who are survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">AP: No.</span> <span id="s172">I met one person I knew from childhood when I first came.</span> <span id="s173">I saw him once but never again.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
