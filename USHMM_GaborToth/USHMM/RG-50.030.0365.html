id="s10">1:01:14</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Good morning, Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is different than your name now, and when you were born and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was born September 17, 1916, in Hannover, Germany.</span> <span id="s15">My name at that time was Bernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in Hannover; and until 1936, I went through the schools and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us.</span> <span id="s16">I had to leave the university because no Jews could study further.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father and sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father and mother both came from Lódz.</span> <span id="s20">They had left Poland around when the war broke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to Elsass-Lothringen, which is part of France now and was at that time also.</span> <span id="s21">And there they lived until 1915 when they went to live in Germany.</span> <span id="s22">Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own studio and built up a wonderful clientele.</span> <span id="s23">He was really the number-one custom tailor in Hannover.</span> <span id="s24">And my mother, may she rest in peace, died very young.</span> <span id="s25">She died already 1928, when I was 12 years old and is buried in Hannover.</span> <span id="s26">My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in 1933 and -- when I had to leave the university, I went on hash'alahto be processed to go at that time Palestine.</span> <span id="s27">But my father got sick.</span> <span id="s28">He had a very serious operation, and he asked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son.</span> <span id="s29">So, this way, that is why I did not go to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s30">Then in 1938, there was a big Aktionby the Germans where they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews -- and collected them all in a concert hall in Hannover, and -- where we stayed for a day and a night.</span> <span id="s31">And then they took us in cattle trains to the Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: I'd like to go back.</span> <span id="s33">It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at such a young age for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at home after that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">1 It is unclear what the interviewee said, however, it sounds as if he said "hash'alah."</span> <span id="s37">The figurative meaning of "hash'alah" is "on loan" (Hebrew).</span></p> <p><span id="s38">2 Any nonmilitary campaign with political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, I left home.</span> <span id="s40">And -- I could not stay at that time.</span> <span id="s41">I just couldn't live with her.</span> <span id="s42">It became impossible.</span> <span id="s43">So, I had left when I was 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And you lived alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I lived alone, yes.</span> <span id="s46">I lived with friends, with their parents.</span> <span id="s47">I rented a room there.</span> <span id="s48">And I earned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: But you remained close with your father and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, I had to, yes.</span> <span id="s51">My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but we liked him.</span> <span id="s52">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s53">He was a dress manufacturer, special designed dresses.</span> <span id="s54">And so how far back do you want me to go now?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: You can certainly talk about this, sure.</span> <span id="s56">01:06:01</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to Poland, and when we came to the Polish border, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were in no-man's land for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the border and let us into a very small village.</span> <span id="s58">The name is Zbaszyn.</span> <span id="s59">There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no housing because it was a small village and here we were about 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s60">So we organized.</span> <span id="s61">I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some housing which were empty.</span> <span id="s62">So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there.</span> <span id="s63">And we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s64">In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to Lódz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started.</span> <span id="s65">Then I went to Kraków with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s66">In Czestochowa, I stayed until I think it was September 1940.</span> <span id="s67">The ghetto in Lódz had already been closed the first of May.</span> <span id="s68">So, one evening a car came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in Czestochowa, because I had corresponded with my sister in Lódz, so she knows where I was.</span> <span id="s69">And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private car to pick me up in Czestochowa and took me into the ghetto to be reunited with my sister and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">01:09:07 I was not too long in the ghetto, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski,an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview.</span> <span id="s71">And there he said, “I want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the ghetto because we have to give them work.”</span> <span id="s72">For work we will get bread and we can live.</span> <span id="s73">So we registered --</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s75">You're how old at this time?</span> <span id="s76">A: At that time I was 24 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What was your sister -- your sister's name is?</span> <span id="s78">A: Dora.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What was she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s81">Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her?</span> <span id="s82">A: No.</span> <span id="s83">I knew it only when I came to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position.</span> <span id="s86">She was able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: At first, yes, at first.</span> <span id="s89">But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for, naturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and tell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski was in a position to deal with the Ghettoverwaltung,to tell them you give us material.</span> <span id="s92">We will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">3 Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the Judenrat in the Lódz ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">4 "Ghetto Administration" which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit.</span> <span id="s96">When you were in Hannover and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: You remember the Maccabees?</span> <span id="s99">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Can you explain what that organization was?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the universities, and we decided to make sabotage.</span> <span id="s102">We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their trains, any transport of the SS people and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s103">So, we really gave them a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">01:12:10 And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go.</span> <span id="s105">That was in 1936.</span> <span id="s106">Then in '38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to Zbaszyn in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So, when you got to Lódz, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the university, and at least some violence against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s109">When I came to the ghetto, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the ghetto, and naturally I was right up in arms.</span> <span id="s110">I could not digest it that easily.</span> <span id="s111">And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the ghetto, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the ghetto, in 1942, that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived.</span> <span id="s112">And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the Lódz ghetto became a model for all the ghettos in the other areas.</span> <span id="s113">So, three days and three nights we registered all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, I got a staff and I got an office and people came day and night.</span> <span id="s116">There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days and three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what factory.</span> <span id="s117">So we delegated people directly into the various factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by yourself at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself.</span> <span id="s120">01:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt they could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s125">It was over 20.</span> <span id="s126">Between 20 and 30 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards.</span> <span id="s129">But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what factory, and with this they were given i.d. cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food.</span> <span id="s130">And this entitled them to a soup.</span> <span id="s131">There were various soups around the ghetto where the people who worked the factories were able to get a soup.</span> <span id="s132">Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s133">And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a factory and delegated him to a kitchen while I took a healthy- looking guy from the kitchen and put him into the factory.</span> <span id="s134">So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand.</span> <span id="s135">The ones who worked in the kitchen, they were sitting.</span> <span id="s136">They got a little bit more to eat than the others.</span> <span id="s137">So, this went on, then, until 1944 --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Now you're moving too fast.</span> <span id="s139">When you're registering people, there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: They still got cards.</span> <span id="s141">They still were registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And did they go with family members to certain factories or would they stay in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work.</span> <span id="s144">They were unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without i.d. cards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, everybody had to be registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200,000 people, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">01:18:01</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What is happening with housing at this point?</span> <span id="s151">When you came in was everybody living where they're supposed to be living or are they moving around?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, they had since the ghetto was closed the first of May.</span> <span id="s153">Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the town into the ghetto had to be housed.</span> <span id="s154">So, naturally, there wasn't enough housing available for every family.</span> <span id="s155">So you found in most cases that in one room lived four families.</span> <span id="s156">In every corner a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water.</span> <span id="s157">There were no toilets in the room.</span> <span id="s158">People didn't have bathrooms.</span> <span id="s159">They would have to go to outhouses.</span> <span id="s160">And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it up into the room.</span> <span id="s161">So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And were there a number of pumps in different parts of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, mostly in every house they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no bathroom and not every house had running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Were you living with your father and your sister?</span> <span id="s165">A: Yes, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, she had left in 1939 to England.</span> <span id="s168">She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in England as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: She didn't get any papers for him.</span> <span id="s171">She got papers just for herself and her son, and father was very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor.</span> <span id="s172">He was always working and had also quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s173">He had to make their suits for them, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going to their particular factories or work places, what is then your job?</span> <span id="s175">What are your responsibilities once that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What would be a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: They were always going movements on.</span> <span id="s179">People had died from hunger.</span> <span id="s180">They had to be replaced.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:21:02 OK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so many people and so many various factories, so there was always something going on where the department of labor had to act accordingly, right.</span> <span id="s182">So, there was always something going on that kept us busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Not regularly but often.</span> <span id="s185">He came to my office or I was called upon for meetings.</span> <span id="s186">And -- oh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What was your relationship like?</span> <span id="s188">What kinds of things would you discuss?</span> <span id="s189">Would it only be business or were you also discussing the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit about various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more details about.</span> <span id="s191">And also, about my background, what he wanted to know.</span> <span id="s192">But otherwise, he was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had concerts.</span> <span id="s193">We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a city by itself in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Was this a hard job for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: It was not an easy job, and especially when the Aktion took place when they asked for 800 people or 1,000 people or 2,000 people to be sent out allegedly to other working camps.</span> <span id="s196">I had no dealings with this because I left this to my partner, to Czenszenski.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: When did he come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: He came in about a year after I had the office organized, and then later on when we got a transport from Czechoslovakia there was also a gentleman who was told by the Eldest of the Jews, by Rumkowski, to work with me in the department of labor, especially for the Czech people.</span> <span id="s199">So, we had actually three at that time heading the department.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And who was the third?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Anders was his name.</span> <span id="s202">He came from Prague.</span> <span id="s203">Terrific elements in that transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Professionals, very intelligent people but unfortunately they died like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">01:24:00 They could not adjust themselves to the conditions of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">When they came into the station in Marysin, where we had our railroad station, they asked, "Where we can get a taxi?</span> <span id="s207">Is there a hotel?"</span> <span id="s208">As funny as it seems, but at that time, the tears came into my eyes when I saw these people and unfortunately we lost so many of them at that time very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Now, you said that when -- the department of labor was somehow involved in the deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well, naturally they were asked by Rumkowski to select certain people at random to be sent.</span> <span id="s211">The first transport for instance were the three Fsin German: Fleisher, Fuhrmann...what was the third F?</span> <span id="s212">I don't even remember the third.</span> <span id="s213">Well, in any case these three groups, from three groups the transports, the first transports went to a labor camp and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to working camps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s214">We had no dealings with the outside world and there was no communication with the outside world...and the Lódz ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: There was no underground radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, underground radio, I myself with a friend of mine, Dr. Smulovitcz, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s217">We listened to the radio at nighttime and we lost a very important person because of that -- Doctor...Irene, she would remember the name.</span> <span id="s218">He was shot because he listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s219">He was caught listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s220">That was a very dangerous thing to do but we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What did you learn when you were listening to the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: We learned about the war what was going on but naturally of what happened with us we did not being informed through the radio, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s223">Only much, much later we found some little paper in one of the cattle carts that came back, that they went to Auschwitz -- “Oswiecim” it's called in Polish, and -- but it was a rumor but nobody really 5 The interviewee is probably referring to occupations, not surnames.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">6 butcher (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s225">7 carriage driver (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s226">had facts because nobody returned from there.</span> <span id="s227">But they, a lot of people survived even Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: But the 1942 transports went to Chelmno.</span> <span id="s229">A: Which we did not know, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">01:27:04 As a matter of fact, some of the first transports could write into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s231">We received mail into the ghetto from these various camps.</span> <span id="s232">So, how we were supposed to know that they are going to their death?</span> <span id="s233">Nobody actually knew, nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And you think Rumkowski didn't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I don't think he did because he heard the same rumors that we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What was daily life like?</span> <span id="s237">What time did you get up in the morning and where did you eat?</span> <span id="s238">Did you eat at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, I finally got myself an apartment and I found Irene in 1942.</span> <span id="s240">I engaged with her in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Tell us about your meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: We had a date to meet at a friend's house.</span> <span id="s243">Q: Why did you have this date?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: That evening.</span> <span id="s245">And, well, I saw Irene when she walked on the street, and I fell in love with her, just by seeing her the way she walked.</span> <span id="s246">And then when I saw her face, so it went with it.</span> <span id="s247">So, I said to one of my O.D.men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to call it, I said to him, "I want to meet this girl.</span> <span id="s248">I want to meet this girl.</span> <span id="s249">You have to make a date for me."</span> <span id="s250">And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or something.</span> <span id="s251">I was home and -- no that was afterwards.</span> <span id="s252">So, finally we made a date and he made a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me.</span> <span id="s253">So, he made the date with her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was just about going away when she came.</span> <span id="s254">And she came and the whole night she was sitting and talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love with me, too.</span> <span id="s255">So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we had -- in a friend's house, she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her 8 Ordnungs Dienst [Organization for public order" (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s256">hand.</span> <span id="s257">I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this.</span> <span id="s258">They said, “OK, you can marry our daughter.”</span></p> <p><span id="s259">01:30:00 Then I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, “Congratulations we are engaged to be married.”</span> <span id="s260">And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married in June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Did you life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Since then?</span> <span id="s263">Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright, very intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous intuition.</span> <span id="s264">She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand.</span> <span id="s265">And so then I got an apartment with a room and a kitchen and I lived there with Irene then.</span> <span id="s266">And...so, I got up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my office at eight, and Irene was also working in one of the factories and we lived there with the various happenings during this time in the ghetto which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it because it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between '42 and '44.</span> <span id="s267">We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the ghetto, by attrition, and as the time passed by more and more and more starved.</span> <span id="s268">Of course sickness, hunger and in 1944 the last transport to Auschwitz was the next to the last transport, there was also was the Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and they went to Auschwitz and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately killed when he got to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s269">And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in '44 and we did not go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s270">We went to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">01:33:01</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Let me go back and try to ask you some details.</span> <span id="s273">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: I know that it's difficult.</span> <span id="s275">Did people come to you and ask you for favors?</span> <span id="s276">I mean you were in a position to make decisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: So you must have been put in situations where people asked you to do things.</span> <span id="s279">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: For them and other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Can you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I will not remember the details, but one thing was certain, that I did not take any bribes.</span> <span id="s284">Nobody could buy me, and I did it to the best of my ability and to my conscience.</span> <span id="s285">So, if somebody asked me a favor and I could do it I gladly did it, and if I couldn't, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s286">I had to say no.</span> <span id="s287">But that I did really select someone to do a favor, no, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: There were some mass demonstrations and strikes early on.</span> <span id="s289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Did you have sympathy with these strikers or did you find them disruptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Well, these people did not know the background of why the happenings what happened so they tried, they thought by striking or by demonstrating they could better their lives by getting maybe more bread or more to eat, but it didn't do any good because Rumkowski did the only thing he could do was what he did.</span> <span id="s292">All right, he was a little bit rough, but if you put yourself into his position, what could he have done?</span> <span id="s293">Like for instance, the transport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have done, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse.</span> <span id="s294">Because, for instance, a transport was supposed to go out of the ghetto and they could not fulfill the quota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four houses and took everybody that was found in there and sent them away.</span> <span id="s295">So, what was the lesser evil?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Nothing could have been done.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Do you remember that day when he gave that talk about “give me your children”?</span> <span id="s298">01:36:00</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No, I don't remember, and I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s300">I wasn't there and I did not take part in that.</span> <span id="s301">Q: Did you hear him speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No, no, I learned it when I saw the film.</span> <span id="s303">I knew that a transport had to go out, but I did not hear the speech.</span> <span id="s304">I wasn't present when he spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did you decide not to go or were you just doing something else?</span> <span id="s306">A: I tried to stay away from all the various Aktions.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I didn't want to take part in it.</span> <span id="s309">Q: You had police protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Two guards with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, well, they stayed in the office to keep order because when there is a line of people outside everybody wants to be the first.</span> <span id="s313">Everybody tries to be -- so they kept order.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So, it wasn't to protect you, or was it as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: The main reason was to keep order and then also to protect me.</span> <span id="s316">Q: Were you in danger, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Listen, in a position like I had, well, naturally people, as I mentioned to you before, with one signature I made a friend and an enemy at the same time.</span> <span id="s318">So, naturally, not that I was scared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know what people do when they're desperate.</span> <span id="s319">So they kept order.</span> <span id="s320">Now, then, as I mentioned we were the last transport.</span> <span id="s321">Only 800 people were left in the ghetto officially to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s322">We were sent to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s323">In Sachsenhausen, we were there for two weeks and then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to Koenigswusterhausen, where there were new barracks put for us and naturally also straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s324">We worked and made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we didn’t do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the eastern front against Russia.</span> <span id="s325">They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame throwers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer because I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular saw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">01:39:10 We dealt with centimeters.</span> <span id="s327">It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so, but it wouldn't fit together.</span> <span id="s328">So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I probably would have been killed for sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">What else can I say, what else can I tell you?</span> <span id="s330">In the mean time I had other experiences, like my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the forest to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not work.</span> <span id="s331">So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and told him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, “I can't, I can't.”</span> <span id="s332">So, he hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him.</span> <span id="s333">I will do his part.</span> <span id="s334">So, he gave me over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that language.</span> <span id="s335">And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it healed.</span> <span id="s336">And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven everything is all right.</span> <span id="s337">So any further details you would like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yes, I want to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s339">A: Let’s go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: You had a newspaper or more than one newspaper in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s341">A: We had a newspaper in the ghetto, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Do you remember the name of it?</span> <span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">It’s a blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What kind of a newspaper was it, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Well, daily routines, what has to be done, some what happened, and really I don't recall right now.</span> <span id="s347">It’s a blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Do you recall whether this was a newspaper put out by the Jewish council and Rumkowski or was this done by --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Oh, definitely within the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: But by the organization of the ghetto as opposed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yes, by the organization not because everything that came from the Ghettoverwaltung would be on a poster.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">01:42:00</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Was there any underground newspaper?</span> <span id="s354">A: Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Now, when you went to concerts, did they have cafes and concerts?</span> <span id="s356">Were there a lot of different sorts of cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, they had the theater and the orchestra.</span> <span id="s358">Yes, they gave concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Did one have to pay, use the money from the ghetto to go, or was this free?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, it was free.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And what was the money used for?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Inside, people bought themselves cigarettes, hand made cigarettes, various things.</span> <span id="s363">It didn't have any value outside the ghetto, it was only within the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Did this money have Rumkowski's picture on it or some of the money?</span> <span id="s365">A: Yes, oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: At that time it was absolutely natural for me.</span> <span id="s368">It was an organization.</span> <span id="s369">It was a city.</span> <span id="s370">Q: Was anybody else's picture on the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Were there coins as well as paper money?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: There were coins, too, yes, but mostly paper money.</span> <span id="s374">What else would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: What kind of a hierarchy between people who came in richer and people who came in poorer and people who came in from outside, the Czech transports, the German transports?</span> <span id="s376">Do you remember gypsy transport coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I don't recall.</span> <span id="s378">We got a lot of transports coming from little villages and towns around the vicinity of Lódz, but I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Do you recall whether there was a difference in treatment with the people who were already in Lódz from the people who were coming in from transports who might not, then had to get apartments or parts of apartments?</span> <span id="s380">Do you think there was a distinction between those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want to call them, because they had to share a room with them or whatever, so naturally they might take objection to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">01:45:12 But in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Was there sufficient -- I don't mean a lot of food -- but could every one get something to eat or was there a lot of starvation among certain groups, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: There was starvation, absolutely.</span> <span id="s385">Q: That must have been very difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: It was difficult.</span> <span id="s387">It was difficult because the bread ration which varied from time to time was too much to die but not enough to live.</span> <span id="s388">But eventually and slowly people starved, starved, and no resistance to sicknesses and a lot of people got tuberculosis and just died away.</span> <span id="s389">So, it was very much decimated by people going on transport, being sent out of the ghetto and by attrition, and died by starvation.</span> <span id="s390">So, from the 200,000 people coming to the ghetto, there were in 1944 maybe, maybe by estimation, I estimate maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people left.</span> <span id="s391">They either died away or were sent on transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Was there a different kind of work for men than there was for women in terms of the division of labor you have there?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Well, naturally, it is as you have today, too.</span> <span id="s394">There are certain jobs women can not just do and men have to do it, but I don't think there was any distinction made and women had to do the same work as the men, at least they were delegated to do the job.</span> <span id="s395">Whether they could do it with the help or without the help it's a different story, but we could not make any distinction between the various genders.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Who took care of children if both parents or every adult --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: There were Kindergartens.</span> <span id="s398">Children had to go and stay over the day and were taken care of, which was one of the fortés of Rumkowski because children was his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">01:48:12 Before the war, he was heading an orphanage and they were taken care of but naturally the same thing.</span> <span id="s400">They didn't have enough food and a lot of children died.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did the children get a ration or did the children share the parents ration?</span> <span id="s402">A: No, they got their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: They got their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s405">Every head had to get a certain ration.</span> <span id="s406">That's why they had to be registered.</span> <span id="s407">Whether a child or the elderly, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s408">They had to be registered to get the i.d. and to get the ration card.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: When you remember the people that you were seeing and talking with, do you remember if people were depressed, they were frightened, or was there a kind of accommodation to life?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, no, it was very dim.</span> <span id="s411">People tried to live as good as they could.</span> <span id="s412">In other words, they tried to make the best of it but naturally you can not help it.</span> <span id="s413">They had to be depressed because nobody knew what the next day would bring.</span> <span id="s414">And so, the whole situation made it so that you had to be depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: So, you were depressed, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s417">Because I saw with my eyes of what had happened to these various people.</span> <span id="s418">I saw them.</span> <span id="s419">They hardly could walk and they had to go to the factory.</span> <span id="s420">So when you see the people walking hardly being able to put one foot in front of the other and knowing that they have to go to do some job otherwise they wouldn't eat, you couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s421">You had to be depressed.</span> <span id="s422">You couldn't put a wall around you because you lived with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Do you know people who committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I personally didn't know anybody who committed but we had plenty of suicides, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">They could not just take it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Did you ever think about it?</span> <span id="s427">01:51:00</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Of suicide?</span> <span id="s429">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s430">Well, I was prepared for it.</span> <span id="s431">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I had made two rings, one for myself and one for Irene.</span> <span id="s433">We were able to get Zyankali and put it in the ring for when the time would come where we suffered to such a degree that we couldn't stand it anymore we could take it.</span> <span id="s434">But then my mother-in-law, may she rest in peace, without us knowing it, she removed it.</span> <span id="s435">We didn't know it because we never used it.</span> <span id="s436">We never took it off, but the ring survived in my violin and my daughter has it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Were you thinking about the ring in terms of the transport or just that the situation would get so bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, just the situation where we couldn't stand it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">9 cyanide (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: When was -- or did it become clear to you late in 1944 that these transports were not resettlement and were not work camps?</span> <span id="s441">Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: We still didn't know.</span> <span id="s443">We had rumors but we still didn't know... We didn't know that the transport before us went to Auschwitz, that we are not going to Auschwitz, that we are going somewhere else.</span> <span id="s444">We didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did you have dealings with Biebowor with the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Not directly, not directly.</span> <span id="s447">He came to my office maybe once or twice but I had no personal dealings with him, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Any of the German personnel that were in Lódz, did you have dealings with?</span> <span id="s449">A: I had some dealings, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: The one I dealt with was personally to me very nice, and I had not seen that he committed anything to the contrary.</span> <span id="s452">And he himself was not on the same level as the others.</span> <span id="s453">By “on the level” I mean psychological because he felt with us, but he couldn't do anything, but at least he gave me some lift up.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: But he didn't indicate to you what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s456">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s457">He didn't divulge anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s458">Q: Were they brutal inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Oh, plenty of brutalities in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s460">I saw where they played football with a baby and took the children and threw them right on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">01:54:05 Sure, we saw brutalities.</span> <span id="s462">I saw brutalities where the Kripo, the Kriminalpolizei,which were in the ghetto, which had the sole purpose of selecting jewelry and all valuable from the people.</span> <span id="s463">They were sitting at the window and shooting at random, like a sniper.</span> <span id="s464">By the way, I had him arrested after the war, but he was able to escape so they asked me for help to find him.</span> <span id="s465">So, I told them the next time I find someone from the war criminals, he won't be able to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">10 Hans Biebow (1902-1947), was the head of the Lódz ghetto administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">11 criminal police (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: When they were doing the shooting -- A: At random.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What went through your head that this meshuggenahguy is doing this, or this is a policy, or I got to try to stop it, or there’s no way to stop it?</span> <span id="s470">Did things go through your head, confusing things, when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Confusing in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What does this mean?</span> <span id="s473">I mean, you had been in 1936 to ‘38 blowing up trains, right?</span> <span id="s474">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: After you left Lódz you were also doing some sabotage.</span> <span id="s476">In Lódz did you think about that or did it seem like the situation where one couldn't do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Exactly, you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s478">You were helpless.</span> <span id="s479">What could you have done?</span> <span id="s480">Well, naturally you felt awful, but what could you have done?</span> <span id="s481">You were helpless.</span> <span id="s482">You couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s483">This led also to depression.</span> <span id="s484">There was no way.</span> <span id="s485">You felt like doing something, especially with my hot blood, but what could I have done?</span> <span id="s486">We had no weapons.</span> <span id="s487">People have asked me, “Why didn't you make a riot like they did in Warsaw?”</span> <span id="s488">Because with whom and with what?</span> <span id="s489">The Warsaw ghetto had dealings with the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">We didn't.</span> <span id="s491">They could trade something for weapons.</span> <span id="s492">We didn't have anybody to trade with, and we didn't have with what to trade, so how can we compare the Warsaw uprising with Lódz ghetto?</span> <span id="s493">Oranges and apples.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">01:57:02 So naturally whenever we saw any brutality, it hurt.</span> <span id="s495">You wanted to cry out and you wanted to kill the guy, but could you have done?</span> <span id="s496">You were helpless.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Let’s take a break.</span> <span id="s498">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s500">12 crazy (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s502">04:01:01</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Bert, can we go back to your earlier years for a few minutes?</span> <span id="s504">Tell me a little bit about your boxing career?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I started to get into the ring with my name on the poster.</span> <span id="s506">I must have been 14 years old and I was a junior welter featherweight.</span> <span id="s507">I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, started training.</span> <span id="s508">The Jewish sport club Bar-Kochba had no boxing in Hannover.</span> <span id="s509">We had no boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in Hannover.</span> <span id="s510">And when I was about 14 I was ready to go into the ring.</span> <span id="s511">My name was on the poster and I started boxing as a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the championship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards me because we went to the same school and he was one of the first Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">04:03:07 When it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s513">I have to go back now.</span> <span id="s514">I got him into the ring and I fought him and I won.</span> <span id="s515">I won that fight.</span> <span id="s516">Then about a year later, at that time the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that club.</span> <span id="s517">I fought him the second time and he lost again.</span> <span id="s518">Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when it came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had and I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the concert hall where we were sent away into no-man's land.</span> <span id="s519">So, that was my boxing career.</span> <span id="s520">Then, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full swing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any public place for that reason.</span> <span id="s521">So, this was the boxing career to answer your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Do you think having boxed was in any way a help to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Well, I lived in sports.</span> <span id="s524">I played soccer for 15 years from when I was a youngster until -- sometimes as a goalkeeper.</span> <span id="s525">I played two games, at 10 o'clock in the youth and at one o'clock in the second league.</span> <span id="s526">So, I was pretty good at it, too.</span> <span id="s527">I was a pretty good goalkeeper.</span> <span id="s528">And I was an oarsman in high school, and field and track I wasn't too fast in running, but I was in very good physical condition and I think this has helped me in going through the other bad environments I was forced into.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Now at the same time you were involved in music.</span> <span id="s530">You were a violinist?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s532">I did not play officially anywhere.</span> <span id="s533">I just played for myself and as Irene told you, I serenaded her our first night meeting.</span> <span id="s534">And I played with my daughter.</span> <span id="s535">The violin has a very, very sentimental value because it survived the holocaust, and we had as when I walked away from the ghetto that was the only thing I took with me and I kept it until I came to Sachsenhausen where they took it away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">04:06:16 And they took a accordion away from another colleague, but when we came to Koenigswusterhausen, to the factory where we were slaves, they gave me the violin and they gave him the accordion under the condition that he play for them.</span> <span id="s537">So, every so often in the evening we had to play for them and entertain them while they were drinking and laughing and so on.</span> <span id="s538">And it helped me also a little bit in the assignment, because as I said, I was on the circular saw, but at one time we had to go to an outside commando to a tank trap, and I had that incident with that elderly man of ours and where I could not see him beaten because he could not do his job so I had to take it for him.</span> <span id="s539">I mentioned that to you before, and so this is the violin, and I played until not too many years ago, but my fingers are a little bit arthritic now.</span> <span id="s540">They are getting stiff so it wasn't for me anymore, so I gave it as a Bar Mitzvah gift to my grandson.</span> <span id="s541">He has not played it as yet.</span> <span id="s542">He is very good on the piano and he's a tremendous flutist, but maybe one day he will take up the violin, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">He's a very ambitious guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: What did you play for these guards at the camp.</span> <span id="s545">What did you and your friend play?</span> <span id="s546">A: In the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What kind of music?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: All kinds of music, operetta, waltzes, I think at that time known hits.</span> <span id="s549">Q: Popular music?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Popular music.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you play in the ghetto other than for Irene?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, not officially as I said.</span> <span id="s553">Privately yes, amongst our friends, yes.</span> <span id="s554">Q: Did you play with a group sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s556">I did that, too, and also I had the violin on one of our cruises -- oh, no, I didn't have the violin, but I played the violin on the cruise.</span> <span id="s557">It was amateur evening, a talent show.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: This was after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes, it was after the war.</span> <span id="s560">That was the only time I played the violin officially for a crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Can you talk about your barber and what he did for and what you ended up doing for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: In the ghetto, I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me a haircut.</span> <span id="s563">Naturally when you see him every day you talk about everything, also intimate things in their lives and we were very friendly and he was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s564">And when it came to the curfew into the -- I should take you to the time when nobody was allowed to go out of the house because the Gestapo planned an Aktion where they wanted to have everybody in the house where they could easily get them and transport them away.</span> <span id="s565">I took this barber, his wife and two daughters, and locked them in my apartment for the three days where the Sperrewas in effect, and in doing so I probably saved their lives.</span> <span id="s566">Even after the war we saw each other regularly and they never forgot what I did for them and thanks to me I think they are alive.</span> <span id="s567">Unfortunately, the barber and his wife passed away last year, but the two daughters are living, one in Boston and the other one in Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: And Irene didn't know you had done this?</span> <span id="s569">A: No, after the fact she knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Irene was also --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I sent her to Marysin, a little bit outside, the periphery of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s572">So, it was not included in the Aktion and then after she knew from them.</span> <span id="s573">I did not tell her anything but they told her.</span> <span id="s574">She found out from them what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: You talked about yourself before that you never allowed yourself to take a bribe.</span> <span id="s576">This was not something you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And there was one circumstance where someone actually came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes, he wanted a favor from me and he offered me -- I don't even remember what it was, but he offered me something and I took him by his collar and threw him out of my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: I bet he was surprised at this.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Well, I don't know if he was surprised or not but he was not very friendly towards me afterwards, and I couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s582">But I did everything what I did with a good 13 This term is a derivation of Gehsperre, or the ban on movement within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s583">The policy was instituted concurrent to the violent Selektion process and prior to the deportation of the Jews to Chelmno.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">conscience so I could sleep in peace because I didn't do any harm to anybody knowingly.</span> <span id="s585">So, whatever was in my power I did for what I wanted to do not what I could get out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">04:12:02</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: When you described the evacuations and deportations, and that you wouldn't go and that you sent your partner, was he willing to go?</span> <span id="s588">He didn't say, "I'm not going to do this"?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s590">He was asked to do it and he did it because somebody had to do it and since I disqualified myself any old way I could, then he had to go and had to do what was asked of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: He survived and he died I think last year in Israel.</span> <span id="s593">Q: Did you meet him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: One wonders whether there are conversations about these circumstances or choices?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s597">I met, after the war I met David Gertler, the gentleman who came with the SS men and picked me up from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s598">I met him after the war, yes.</span> <span id="s599">He had a store in Munich, in Germany, and I met with him.</span> <span id="s600">Unfortunately he also passed away in the meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Do you have any memories of the ghetto that you think would be important to try to talk about that we haven't talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s603">But as I said, I did my duties as good as I could and I could not think of any details right now which are outstanding of the normal everyday routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Did you ever think of resigning that position?</span> <span id="s605">Did it sometimes get to be too much?</span> <span id="s606">A: Well, many times I thought, but I had no choice, because even if I wanted to resign, Rumkowski would have never allowed it.</span> <span id="s607">Because I mentioned a few times that I feel it's too much for me and he said, “You are doing a job, so do it, and stick with it.”</span> <span id="s608">Q: Do you think he needed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I tried to think, yes... because if I would not have satisfied in what I had to do, I think he would have let me know and he would have set me aside, whether my sister was his right hand or not, but I think it doesn't have anything to do with it because by that time I showed my own abilities, I would say, in doing what I had to do, what I was asked to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">04:15:21</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Do you think he would have punished you if you would have said, "I'm sorry, I really can't"?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I don't know, he might have.</span> <span id="s613">He might have.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: And your sister, can you talk about her and what she had to do as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than anybody else what was going on inside and outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s616">And one time I remember they took Rumkowski outside the ghetto and he didn't come back until the next day, so we had feared for the worst.</span> <span id="s617">But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had happened.</span> <span id="s618">Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was brought back.</span> <span id="s619">In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or said he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he did, the ghetto would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance, without anybody I believe, without me being alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Do you think Dora knew what had happened when he left and didn't come back overnight, your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: She might have.</span> <span id="s622">She never answered the question because that's another thing that people wanted to know, of what transpired.</span> <span id="s623">She would completely ignore the question, so I don't know if she knew or she didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Do you think she ever wanted to resign?</span> <span id="s625">Did she ever talk to you because she was so close to all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s627">She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign or not to resign.</span> <span id="s628">She had three girls working with her in the executive office and she worked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for her, but she was quite a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">04:18:19</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Can you describe her?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: How shall I describe her?</span> <span id="s632">Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to earth, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her.</span> <span id="s633">She was quite a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So you were close to each other?</span> <span id="s635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Was she married in the ghetto or was she single?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, they married after the ghetto.</span> <span id="s640">She married the brother of the second in command of Eric Yakobovitch.</span> <span id="s641">He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all the factories and he was a second in command.</span> <span id="s642">So, when Rumkowski was unable to do something, he was the one to enforce everything.</span> <span id="s643">He was the one to do it, and his brother married my sister after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski?</span> <span id="s645">Was he easy to work with or difficult to work with?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: We knew it was difficult to work for him.</span> <span id="s647">She didn't have to answer that because everybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took everything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him.</span> <span id="s648">He was demanding.</span> <span id="s649">He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Was he like this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always going around fundraising for his orphanage which was very close to him.</span> <span id="s652">I was told, because I did not know him, naturally, from before.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: It seems to me that the picture of any human being is very complicated, so someone damning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate.</span> <span id="s654">Do you think there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him in terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him.</span> <span id="s655">Do you think anything negatively about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">04:21:15</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out.</span> <span id="s658">That's what I can say about him, and you had to do what he wanted.</span> <span id="s659">And very, very seldom did I do against what he said.</span> <span id="s660">If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it never came really to a fight or something with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: I did, I did.</span> <span id="s663">Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy.</span> <span id="s664">Q: But he also had power, so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Tremendous power.</span> <span id="s666">He had absolute control of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s667">He was the man.</span> <span id="s668">Q: So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: That's a bit frightening to be around.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Well, you lived with either or.</span> <span id="s672">You could have had the same thing from the Germans because if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s673">So it was not an easy situation all around.</span> <span id="s674">All right?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations, many of them were sent in the early deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Possibly because they had gone on strike?</span> <span id="s678">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of what he was trying to do.</span> <span id="s680">Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is that just a stupid idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves.</span> <span id="s682">They tried to get more food and they did not realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because what do they achieve?</span> <span id="s683">At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize that.</span> <span id="s684">They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">04:24:02 But naturally it was in vain because what could they do?</span> <span id="s686">What could Rumkowski have done?</span> <span id="s687">Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for.</span> <span id="s688">So even when I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel today that I cooperated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s689">I didn't cooperate with the Germans.</span> <span id="s690">Just because we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our livelihood.</span> <span id="s691">That was our bread.</span> <span id="s692">And a lot of people don't understand that.</span> <span id="s693">Okay, we made munitions parts.</span> <span id="s694">Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have another choice?</span> <span id="s695">It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation.</span> <span id="s696">What little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation, you know, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s697">So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a lot of people.</span> <span id="s698">But they don't think.</span> <span id="s699">They just go with the masses.</span> <span id="s700">Why?</span> <span id="s701">Can you imagine that after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust - - the American army when they went into these camps and made all these films of what they found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all propaganda.</span> <span id="s702">For what propaganda?</span> <span id="s703">Who won the war?</span> <span id="s704">The Germans and the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">They didn't lose the war, they won it.</span> <span id="s706">The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of the biggest nations of the world.</span> <span id="s707">Am I right or wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Do you think that was a bad idea?</span> <span id="s709">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">04:27:01</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people left in the ghetto before the last deportations or are there more than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking.</span> <span id="s713">We're talking 1944.</span> <span id="s714">We're talking about the timeframe between January or February '44 to September, October.</span> <span id="s715">There might have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the transports took place at that timeframe.</span> <span id="s716">We were taking into the hospital and we stayed there to be transported out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s717">A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the police chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s718">We however, went, as I mentioned, to Sachsenhausen and then wound up in Koenigswusterhausen in that factory.</span> <span id="s719">And only about 800 people were left to liquidate the ghetto and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures which were left behind in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s720">So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are all set.</span> <span id="s721">More power to them because better them than the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So there's a group that's left to liquidate, to tidy up everything?</span> <span id="s723">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And they can obviously accumulate because --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Whatever they found they could hide for themselves and then Germany was finished and then they had what they took.</span> <span id="s726">What they found they had for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Now you and your father and Dora goes with Irene and her mother?</span> <span id="s728">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And David --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: David and her father and my father, we went together.</span> <span id="s731">Q: All of you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: We were separated.</span> <span id="s733">We went to Sachsenhausen and they went to Ravensbrück, and then very late, it must have been, we were liberated on the 27th of April in '45 so that must have been in the beginning of '45 where a transport of women were sent where we were into another barrack, separated from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">04:30:14 We had no contact and -- except when we went to labor, but I was in the factory, so, but they worked outside with some men also.</span> <span id="s735">So in the evening they were separated again.</span> <span id="s736">And Eric Yakobovitch’s son, who lives now in Florida, he was at that time five years old or six years old and he came with his mother also.</span> <span id="s737">But Irene and my sister, they did not come with that transport.</span> <span id="s738">They were left in Ravensbrück and they were liberated by the Russians, as we were also, in April.</span> <span id="s739">And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children came where we were.</span> <span id="s740">The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April 1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came.</span> <span id="s741">Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing happened.</span> <span id="s742">We had also air raid trenches, and every night the sirens, you know, they came during the night we were working and at day time they were bombing.</span> <span id="s743">So every time there was an air raid we had assigned places in these trenches.</span> <span id="s744">The first few alarms I went with my father and we went to the place where we were supposed to be, but then I said, "Papa, we are not going anymore."</span> <span id="s745">I was lying on the floor under the bunks.</span> <span id="s746">On this end of the barrack my father was on the other end of the barrack and every time a bomb or grenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66 shrapnel in our barrack, and where we were supposed to be there were four young brothers.</span> <span id="s747">They came originally from Pabianice.</span> <span id="s748">They were in our spot where we were and a grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out.</span> <span id="s749">It would have happened to us if we would have been there.</span> <span id="s750">That's fate.</span> <span id="s751">That’s fate and that's kismet.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Where was David?</span> <span id="s753">04:32:56</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside commando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away from the camp, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in- law, may he rest in peace.</span> <span id="s755">They were taken together with the others.</span> <span id="s756">They were sent on a march by foot.</span> <span id="s757">They were supposed to go up to the North Sea, put on a boat and as a final solution being bombed out and drowned.</span> <span id="s758">And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the war had ended already, the third of May.</span> <span id="s759">He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">My brother-in-law was able to escape at that time.</span> <span id="s761">So, that was the last few days.</span> <span id="s762">And I had my violin.</span> <span id="s763">That's all I took.</span> <span id="s764">Of course I had a few hidden items there.</span> <span id="s765">And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said "Let's not go out because they're still shooting."</span> <span id="s766">And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever.</span> <span id="s767">I warned people, "Don't overeat, take it easy," and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up.</span> <span id="s768">And I went with father and we went across a field and there was a trunk and it was covered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German money, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my father, "Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the Reichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money."</span> <span id="s769">If I would have known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a millionaire at that time.</span> <span id="s770">I could have bought whole blocks of houses.</span> <span id="s771">I didn't even touch it.</span> <span id="s772">I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle.</span> <span id="s773">I went over to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the river because the Americans were on the other side.</span> <span id="s774">That's where I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s775">I didn't want to be with the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">04:36:01 So, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first transport.</span> <span id="s777">They were French, French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s778">They were allowed to cross the Elbe River the next morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them.</span> <span id="s779">So, I go back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s780">So he said, "You are a German, so you have to wait until the Germans can go."</span> <span id="s781">So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of French people and we made it to the ferry boat and made it across the river.</span> <span id="s782">We went to the Americans.</span> <span id="s783">I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are and where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is "father" in Hebrew, how is "mother" in Hebrew and, “What kind of brakhahdo you say over this?”</span> <span id="s784">And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything.</span> <span id="s785">I had to help him.</span> <span id="s786">I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to travel.</span> <span id="s787">So, once I was very eager to go home to my hometown.</span> <span id="s788">So the commander gave me a jeep, papers I could go everywhere to get gas.</span> <span id="s789">They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have</span></p> <p><span id="s790">14 blessing (Hebrew.)</span> <span id="s791">legitimately this jeep.</span> <span id="s792">And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife, whether somebody has seen my wife.</span> <span id="s793">And nobody knew.</span> <span id="s794">Nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s795">Then I finally came to Hannover, to my hometown, and I started working right away in the town hall and registered all the people who were coming from the various camps and I repatriated people like Poles to Poland and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various passes to the various border towns and I left them there and I took the buses back home because they were all from the post office.</span> <span id="s796">In Germany all the buses are run by the post office.</span> <span id="s797">Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard of my wife.</span> <span id="s798">Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said Irene was bombed out.</span> <span id="s799">She's not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s800">And later on Irene told me that she was told that I was bombed out.</span> <span id="s801">So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found me back in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">04:39:03</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did you believe it when this woman told you that she was bombed out?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s805">And, well, naturally I was, I was, I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s806">You know, I could not get over it that easy until I saw her and then naturally you can imagine, OK, after ten months of not knowing whether she's alive or not and then we started our life back together and a year later we had our daughter, our first daughter, and then in '49 we finally immigrated to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Was there a problem with your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: And we came here and the first dilemma was at the pier.</span> <span id="s809">I was the chief interpreter on board the ship and every time the office was down below and every time I had to make the announcement on the deck I had to go all the way up and down and up and down.</span> <span id="s810">It was quite strenuous, but this way I earned my trip over to the United States.</span> <span id="s811">I didn't feel like I get charity.</span> <span id="s812">We came to the pier and I had to wait until the last man left the boat and get them through the customs.</span> <span id="s813">Finally, we were the last.</span> <span id="s814">I had three big boxes, plywood boxes, big ones, and a total of 11 items of luggage so I had quite, I had all our belongings and a custom agent came and asked me to open up everything.</span> <span id="s815">I had three packers packing my trunks at home in Germany before I left and here all by myself it was already about eight at night at that time.</span> <span id="s816">Aviva, our daughter, got very sick on board the ship.</span> <span id="s817">She had 104 fever and she was at eight.</span> <span id="s818">Irene and the child was taken off board the ship and went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s819">I didn't know what happened to my child.</span> <span id="s820">I didn't know where they were and here I was crying.</span> <span id="s821">It was November seven.</span> <span id="s822">It was a very raw day, misty, cold and I had to unpack and naturally they didn't find anything.</span> <span id="s823">Somebody who loves me showed them that I brought up a fortune and I didn't declare it, but everything I had there was on my declaration, OK?</span> <span id="s824">So, to make it short, I had to put everything back into the trunk, nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look for my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the Hotel Breslin on Broadway that I heard that my daughter is in the hospital on Metropolitan Island at that time, the Metropolitan Hospital, and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the next day for the taxi fare to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">04:42:30 So, that same night I went to the waterfront and I saw a sign "help wanted", and I went in there and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job.</span> <span id="s826">What was the job?</span> <span id="s827">75 cents an hour cleaning the presses.</span> <span id="s828">It was a spare box folding box factory on Tenth and -- I don't remember this, it was on 70th or 80th street somewhere -- in any case what was my job?</span> <span id="s829">To clean with kerosene the printing presses and the cutting presses.</span> <span id="s830">Three months later I was an a sample maker.</span> <span id="s831">I made samples and I made one patent for them also, which was patented for which I got a dollar because it was made under their name and their time so I got a dollar for it and then six months later I took over the night shift.</span> <span id="s832">I was a superintendent for the night shift.</span> <span id="s833">I worked there another three months and every time I wanted a raise they said don't rush the seasons, don't rush the seasons.</span> <span id="s834">So, I quit and went to Bulova.</span> <span id="s835">“What I am?”</span> <span id="s836">“An engineer.”</span> <span id="s837">And I started up at Bulova, a watch company, and they found out I had pyrotechnic experience so I went, I got clearance, secret clearance and I went on the missile program.</span> <span id="s838">It was a very interesting job I started there and I was with Bulova close to 11 years, over 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Then I was involved in the correspondence with another outfit, Daystrom, who had to take a bid on a big program also in the missile field, and they had heard of me because I had made myself a name already.</span> <span id="s840">So, they wanted me, and another firm, TRW, in Cleveland, they wanted me so I went for an interview and first to Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">04:45:03 I spent the whole day and at that time we were in Scranton, we lived in Scranton and then I went to Strattford in Connecticut to Avco.</span> <span id="s842">I spent a whole day being interviewed there and they made me an offer I could not refuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">So since my contract at Daystrom had a two year option that I felt I should not take, I went to work for Avco Lycoming in Strattford for 20 years, and I went up to, to become a director of a department with about 400 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">04:45:45</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did you get a degree in engineering here?</span> <span id="s846">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s847">I finished up here, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: And where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s849">A: In Germany and here.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: And here.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Tell me, what happened to Aviva?</span> <span id="s853">She was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s854">We didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Aviva, thank heaven, she came through with it after eight days.</span> <span id="s856">We had papers to go to Norfolk.</span> <span id="s857">So we took Aviva when she was all right, we took her to Norfolk.</span> <span id="s858">We had to take a ferry from somewhere down in Maryland, I guess, to go across to Norfolk, Cape May, I guess, Cape May it was.</span> <span id="s859">And we come to Norfolk and they received us there with open arms and brought us to an apartment, and Irene and I felt like crying.</span> <span id="s860">That much dirt on the floor, a refrigerator with a motor on top yet, you know, like 1850.</span> <span id="s861">And we looked at her, thanked her for it, and all night long Irene and I with the razor blades we're scraping the floor.</span> <span id="s862">The next morning, I met the people I should work with and I came back home and I said, we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts, but we don't stay here, this is not for us.</span> <span id="s863">We went to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: What about your name change?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: That was also when I asked for first papers, I was called to the Immigration Office, and they started interrogating me for about three hours, maybe a hundred questions, and I said, "What is this all about?"</span> <span id="s866">I didn't sit down, they didn't ask me to sit down, I was standing.</span> <span id="s867">They interrogated me.</span> <span id="s868">Every week I was called.</span> <span id="s869">Every week I heard the same questions standing up.</span> <span id="s870">This went on for over a year, almost a year and a half.</span> <span id="s871">One day I come, "Mr. Fuchs, sit down."</span> <span id="s872">So I sat down.</span> <span id="s873">"Now we can tell you, you have good friends."</span> <span id="s874">I said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s875">"They said that you were a Gestapo man, and that you have a lot of people on your conscious.</span> <span id="s876">But now we found out that it's not you.</span> <span id="s877">There was a Gestapo man with your name, Kommisar Fuchs.”</span> <span id="s878">He said, "They thought it's you.</span> <span id="s879">We give you the papers now, and we allow you to change your name through us so you don't have to go through court."</span> <span id="s880">So we were driving home with Irene and she saw Rhonda Fleming on a movie house.</span> <span id="s881">So she said, "Fleming, that's a good name, let's be Fleming, so we don't have to change our initials, Bernard Fuchs, Bert Fleming, it's the same initials."</span> <span id="s882">So that's the game by what we become Fleming.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Did you realize what they were questioning you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yeah, well, they asked me what I did, where I was, what my duties were, and always they shook their heads, and always the same questions.</span> <span id="s885">Then I naturally I figured that somebody must have said something.</span> <span id="s886">But what?</span> <span id="s887">And they told me that they thought that I'm the Gestapo Fuchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Can you describe the situation that there was someone in Connecticut who was also making accusations against --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I was supposed to have a speech about my experience during the Holocaust in my Masonic Lodge, and it was publicized that I will be speaking on this subject, and the Master of the Lodge called me up and said, "Bert, we have to cancel you."</span> <span id="s890">There was some accusation made that about, probably, almost the same thing of what the other accusations were.</span> <span id="s891">When I heard this, I went to my Rabbi, Rabbi Stein, and I said, "Rabbi, this and this and this happened.</span> <span id="s892">This and this accusations were made, and I would like to take this woman for a deen Torah.”</span> <span id="s893">That means for a rabbinical justice, a rabbinical court.</span> <span id="s894">So he investigated very thoroughly.</span> <span id="s895">He called Europe.</span> <span id="s896">He called the organizations here of the former Lodge people.</span> <span id="s897">He finally came to the end result and told that woman, "You better keep your mouth shut, because he can sue you for everything you have."</span> <span id="s898">And he told me, "Bert, don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s899">Everything is fine."</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Did you know this woman?</span> <span id="s901">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: And she was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I knew her by name only.</span> <span id="s904">I didn't have any dealings with her.</span> <span id="s905">But Irene knew them very well.</span> <span id="s906">And, but she passed away a year after what, after that happened.</span> <span id="s907">So that's the other happening I had.</span> <span id="s908">But I didn't worry about it, because you know I have a clean conscience and now I'm lecturing high school -- Merkaz students I lecture, and also some various speech, and I'm very active in B'nai Brith.</span> <span id="s909">I'm four years now the vice president, and I'm a Mason, and I'm very active in the Synagogue as well their federation.</span> <span id="s910">So we live a very comfortable life, and happy, as much as we can be happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: What do the students ask you, when you talk to the young students?</span> <span id="s912">Do they have questions or --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: They ask a lot of questions, yes.</span> <span id="s914">But I must say that they were almost mesmerized when I spoke to them.</span> <span id="s915">They followed every word, and afterwards they sent, every student sent me a nice little letter thanking me of and the impression they had and what they have learned, because I left them always a message.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: And what was that message?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: The message is: remember what we tell you, because we are dying out.</span> <span id="s918">So you have to tell your children; they have to tell their children of what happened, and make sure that it will never happen again.</span> <span id="s919">Have your ears and eyes wide open.</span> <span id="s920">Rot the weed out as soon as you see it.</span> <span id="s921">Any other things you would like to know?</span> <span id="s922">Did we cover it, all the territory?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">15 “Deen” means verdict or court decision (Hebrew); “Deen Torah” is a verdict based on the laws of a rabinnical court.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: I think we covered a lot of territory.</span> <span id="s925">Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I had a very successful career before I retired.</span> <span id="s927">I had a very interesting job.</span> <span id="s928">I was almost in the limelight, and I've harvested the fruits of what I'd seeded because I was very lucky in all my endeavors.</span> <span id="s929">I was a troubleshooter.</span> <span id="s930">I found the trouble, I corrected them, I proved it, and that's not an easy task, and I'm very happy and lucky that I achieved it.</span> <span id="s931">I went up the ladder, not by prodigy, not by anything else but my own ability.</span> <span id="s932">That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Thank you very much, Bert.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s935">I hope the archive will learn something, whoever will listen or read of what had happened, and really make sure that nothing happens again of that type.</span> <span id="s936">All right?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s938">Thank you.</span> <span id="s939">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
