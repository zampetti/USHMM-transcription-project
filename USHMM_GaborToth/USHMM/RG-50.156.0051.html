Scheer.</span> <span id="s7">My maiden name at home, in Poland, was Seva Leah Silberstein.</span> <span id="s8">I was born in Piotrkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And what year was that?</span> <span id="s10">What date?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: January 20, 1918.</span> <span id="s12">When I was eight years old, we moved to a different city.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: What city was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Lodz.</span> <span id="s15">And during the war, the Germans changed that to Litmanstadt.</span> <span id="s16">And there I lived very happy.</span> <span id="s17">Everything went fine.</span> <span id="s18">I had brother, seven years older.</span> <span id="s19">We were just two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And your parents?</span> <span id="s21">What kind of work did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: We had, in the beginning, a big grocery store.</span> <span id="s23">There were no supermarkets in Europe, but a big grocery store.</span> <span id="s24">That was in Piotrkow.</span> <span id="s25">And then when we came to Lodz, we were growing up a little bit, especially my brother, and he ran the business.</span> <span id="s26">It was a different one.</span> <span id="s27">We were importing from foreign countries, from Ceylon, from other countries, coffee beans, tea and cocoa.</span> <span id="s28">It came to us wholesale and we were packing it and selling it.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s30">What were your parents’ names, and where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: In Poland.</span> <span id="s32">My father was born in Piotrkow and my mother was born in Soleyev.</span> <span id="s33">It’s a little town, a nearby town, by Piotrkow.</span> <span id="s34">My father’s name was Mendel and my mother’s name was Rivkah.</span> <span id="s35">My brother’s name was Yanke Yitzhik, after my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Your grandfather, what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My grandfather’s name was Yanke Yitzhik Silberstein.</span> <span id="s38">That was from my father’s.</span> <span id="s39">I never knew him.</span> <span id="s40">He died before I was born.</span> <span id="s41">And my mother’s father, that means my grandfather from my mother’s side, was Emanuel Milshtein.</span> <span id="s42">He was born in Soleyev, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Do you know where your great-grandparents were born?</span> <span id="s44">Were they born in Poland, or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I am sure the great, even the great-grandparents, everybody was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s46">And if it wouldn’t be for the Holocaust, I probably would still be living there.</span> <span id="s47">We were a very close family.</span> <span id="s48">Some people are lucky.</span> <span id="s49">They get sometime from a relative that came before the war, they had a picture they get of the parents what they send before the war.</span> <span id="s50">I cannot have nothing, because we were such a close family we stayed all together.</span> <span id="s51">Nobody moved out of the country.</span> <span id="s52">Besides, there was no reason for it, because life was fairly good.</span> <span id="s53">We were not millionaires, but we had enough to eat, and clothes, and a home.</span> <span id="s54">And it was, as I mentioned, a close family, and nobody moved away.</span> <span id="s55">Stayed there.</span> <span id="s56">Born there and died in Poland.</span> <span id="s57">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you have aunts and uncles and cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: A lot of them.</span> <span id="s60">My mother had four sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s61">But nobody’s left.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: They all died in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: All in the Holocaust, yeah.</span> <span id="s64">There were cousins, uncles and aunts, and lots of cousins - first and second cousins.</span> <span id="s65">It was a big family, but I am the only survivor.</span> <span id="s66">After what I saw, I did not expect anybody, but I was counting on my brother.</span> <span id="s67">He was healthy, young, and strong, and I hoped that I will find him after the war, but I did not, and this is my biggest disappointment in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: To get back to your home situation, your family situation when you were growing up in Poland - what were the languages that were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: In my home, mostly Yiddish.</span> <span id="s70">And outside we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s71">And when I went to school, I took up the German language, because you had to learn the closest to your country, and since we lived close to Germany, I took up German.</span> <span id="s72">And I was very good in it.</span> <span id="s73">I could converse, and it helped a little bit during the war - my speaking German.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Then maybe you want to tell me about that particular aspect of your use of German during the war.</span> <span id="s75">Did you have any contact then with Germans and with gentiles either in business or at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Most of the Polish people were not well-educated.</span> <span id="s77">The only language they spoke was Polish.</span> <span id="s78">The Germans used to get furious if you could not understand them.</span> <span id="s79">So I did a lot, like translating when it was necessary, if they came, wanted something, or they came to arrest somebody, or so on.</span> <span id="s80">I did a lot of translating that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Around 20, 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What year would this have been then when the Germans were in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: They took over Poland in ‘39.</span> <span id="s85">September ‘39 they came in Litmanstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Were you going to school at that time, or were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, I was helping my brother in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Would you say that your family was a religious family?</span> <span id="s89">They observed the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Very religious!</span> <span id="s91">Very strict!</span> <span id="s92">Very religious orthodox.</span> <span id="s93">They (the Germans) came in in September.</span> <span id="s94">And September, it’s usually Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s95">My father was Baal Tefillah.</span> <span id="s96">This is like a cantor.</span> <span id="s97">And I remember like now.</span> <span id="s98">We lived in a very, very big building, and he gathered all the Jews from the whole building, and they went to a basement and he blow shofar.</span> <span id="s99">And there, that was already something that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s100">You were not supposed to gather lots of people, especially men, together, but that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s101">We were a very strict orthodox family.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Were you Zionist, or Hasidic?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Hasidic?</span> <span id="s104">We didn’t dream of Zionism.</span> <span id="s105">We still believed in Meshiach, but you thought there has to be another way, a more realistic way.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: For Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: For Israel.</span> <span id="s108">To get your own country.</span> <span id="s109">At this time, it wasn’t even called Israel, it was called Palestine.</span> <span id="s110">We were well educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did you go to any kind of heder or yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s113">At first it was a Bet Yaacov, they called it.</span> <span id="s114">A girls’ school, because at this time it was not mixed, girls and boys, like now.</span> <span id="s115">I went to two schools.</span> <span id="s116">First I went to public school, and then, in the afternoon, I went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s117">But then, that was not enough for my parents.</span> <span id="s118">They took me out from the Hebrew school and I had a tutor coming home, that was teaching just me, so I would learn even more.</span> <span id="s119">And my brother was well-educated.</span> <span id="s120">He spoke perfectly, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s121">And he was the kind that he taught himself a lot, because at this time when we were very young, things were hard.</span> <span id="s122">My father - scholastically in Hebrew, he did very, very well - and he was so busy with that that he did not help much to make a living.</span> <span id="s123">Mostly it was the mother.</span> <span id="s124">That’s the way it was in Europe.</span> <span id="s125">He learned a lot.</span> <span id="s126">That’s why it was a little harder until we grew up.</span> <span id="s127">And when we took over, things were nice, good.</span> <span id="s128">And my brother was very well educated in these times.</span> <span id="s129">He taught himself by corresponding to a school.</span> <span id="s130">They sent him papers, information, and he did all his homework and sent it back and it was graded.</span> <span id="s131">And he was an accountant - that he taught, by himself, because at this time, my parents could not afford to send him to a college.</span> <span id="s132">And he had a diploma.</span> <span id="s133">And later on, before we started our own business, he worked in a mill.</span> <span id="s134">A bookkeeper in a mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And so at this time, between the mid-’30s and 1941, what events were you aware of, like political events, either national or local or international?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Before the war - the trend at this time - I belonged to a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s137">And so did my brother.</span> <span id="s138">And then later on we didn’t have much time, because the war.</span> <span id="s139">In 1939, we were well to do.</span> <span id="s140">We had a lovely apartment in that big building where we lived, and then the Germans came.</span> <span id="s141">We had to vacate - leave everything in it - and we had to go in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s142">Lodz’s ghetto was famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What year was that then?</span> <span id="s144">Or about what time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: They came in in September.</span> <span id="s146">By 1940 we were already in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Who notified you, or how were you notified that you had to go into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Notices on the street, that everybody has to vacate.</span> <span id="s149">And you have to find your own place.</span> <span id="s150">Luckily I had a girlfriend that lived there before the war came, so we moved.</span> <span id="s151">It was four, five families in this small apartment.</span> <span id="s152">What we got was a kitchen, a very, very small kitchen.</span> <span id="s153">We put our bed in and for the night we had a folding bed.</span> <span id="s154">My father was not there already.</span> <span id="s155">The moment the war broke out, the moment the Germans came to Lodz, he went back to Piotrkow, the town where he was born, planning to rent an apartment and we would come there, the three of us, my mother, my brother and me.</span> <span id="s156">And meanwhile, they closed the ghetto and we could not get out any more.</span> <span id="s157">So we stayed there, and he was in Piotrkow.</span> <span id="s158">We could not communicate.</span> <span id="s159">We did not know that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s160">A very dead end, because we don’t know, we didn’t even know what happened and why.</span> <span id="s161">We were quite a while in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s162">And then they took us...We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s163">We were told that we should take everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Prior to the outbreak of the war, did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">I’m sorry to say this, but the Poles were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s167">Most of them.</span> <span id="s168">They didn’t like Jews.</span> <span id="s169">You always hear in Polish, “Jews go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s170">If they met a young man somewhere in a dark street, or going down from a streetcar, and they could give him a hit, a slap, or something, harm him, they did it.</span> <span id="s171">There was anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s172">And it was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s173">They had all kinds of parties, like anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Political parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s176">Like the Ku Klux Klans or Nazis, they were.</span> <span id="s177">Financially, the Jews were not bad off, but politically a Jew had even a problem to go to a college, a Jewish boy or a girl.</span> <span id="s178">In some colleges, they divided Jews on one side and the Poles on the other.</span> <span id="s179">They wouldn’t sit together.</span> <span id="s180">It was really bad.</span> <span id="s181">Whatever happened - they were very poor, mostly working people or farmers - but whatever bad happened, the Jews always was the scapegoat, it was always his fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How did you receive news of the outbreak of the war, and how old were you when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: That’s a long story.</span> <span id="s184">You see we were not bad off financially.</span> <span id="s185">And me and my brother took vacation.</span> <span id="s186">And he went first and I went for the week end, and he stayed with them over Saturday and Sunday, because stores were closed.</span> <span id="s187">It was no business.</span> <span id="s188">Monday he would go back.</span> <span id="s189">It was talking about the war many, many years ahead, and we got so used that we didn’t pay any more attention.</span> <span id="s190">Sometimes if business did not go so good, you’d say, “Oh, let it be a war and get it over with!”</span> <span id="s191">We sinned.</span> <span id="s192">We should never have said that!</span> <span id="s193">It wasn’t just me or my brother, but a lot of people.</span> <span id="s194">But you got so used to it, that you kind of ignored it.</span> <span id="s195">And I was in a very nice, lovely resort.</span> <span id="s196">I was 20, 21 years old and I went for vacation.</span> <span id="s197">And we were having dinner in a big, beautiful dining room, and one person, a young man, comes in saying, “You know, it’s a war!</span> <span id="s198">It’s a war!”</span> <span id="s199">And we just ignored him, but he says, “No!</span> <span id="s200">There are notices about the war on all the buildings.</span> <span id="s201">On all the public places.”</span> <span id="s202">I was with friends.</span> <span id="s203">We went out.</span> <span id="s204">And my God, there it was!</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: The notices.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: The notices about the war - that there is a war, said, everybody should try and stay close with the families and try to gather together some food, and so on.</span> <span id="s207">There might be bombardings.</span> <span id="s208">I was really frightened, because I was far away from my parents and my brother.</span> <span id="s209">And I still didn’t believe, but I gathered my things.</span> <span id="s210">I took the suitcase and I went to a train depot.</span> <span id="s211">And by golly, then I believed it was a war.</span> <span id="s212">To begin with, it was so many people and so few trains that you couldn’t get on.</span> <span id="s213">By some miracle - I left somewhere the suitcase - I was frightened, all alone, and I just pushed myself in, and when the train started to move and went a little farther, I could see for sure it’s a war, because on the way you could see military trains.</span> <span id="s214">You see, that’s why we didn’t have enough.</span> <span id="s215">They took some.</span> <span id="s216">And soldiers sitting there.</span> <span id="s217">Horses running with the train, what they needed probably for the army.</span> <span id="s218">And soldiers all over.</span> <span id="s219">All over.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: At the time did you think that there was a chance that the Polish army would be able to keep the Germans back?</span> <span id="s221">What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: That’s what we hoped.</span> <span id="s223">That’s what was going on on the radio.</span> <span id="s224">They used to say in Polish, “We don’t even give a button.</span> <span id="s225">We don’t give nothing.</span> <span id="s226">We’re going to fight to the last drop of blood.”</span> <span id="s227">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s228">I don’t know if it was corruption, whatever it was, because they came in so fast, and there was not much that they did, the Polish army, about it.</span> <span id="s229">The problem was, there were a lot of people - German - in Poland.</span> <span id="s230">Some were born even German and they migrated.</span> <span id="s231">And some, if the parents migrated, the children were born there, in Poland, but they spoke German and they were for Germany.</span> <span id="s232">So the first chance they had, they jumped there.</span> <span id="s233">You never knew they were Germans until the war came, but when the war came, they just grew like mushrooms after a rain - everywhere.</span> <span id="s234">And they were bad and mean.</span> <span id="s235">They were even worse than the regular Germans from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community in which you lived to the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s237">What did the neighbors say?</span> <span id="s238">Were there any meetings or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s240">Meetings.</span> <span id="s241">We tried to stick together.</span> <span id="s242">It was hard.</span> <span id="s243">Everybody got worried about the family, how they live, how they’ll eat.</span> <span id="s244">War time is a time that mostly you are for yourself, by yourself, with the family, because it’s a lot of problems, a lot of worries.</span> <span id="s245">And it was forbidden, even, to gather together.</span> <span id="s246">You could not.</span> <span id="s247">This was the first thing.</span> <span id="s248">You were not supposed to have any meetings.</span> <span id="s249">They’ll call it spying.</span> <span id="s250">Everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s251">No newspaper, no radio.</span> <span id="s252">Somebody put a radio together and lots of people would gather in a basement somewhere and listen to the radio, and one was watching if a German is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: When did the Nazi occupation occur then?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: As I mentioned, they came in early, around September, ‘39.</span> <span id="s255">And they took over so quick.</span> <span id="s256">And you know, they came in, as they say, like a lamb, but then turned out to be lions.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Tell me what happened then.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: At this time we still lived in our home.</span> <span id="s259">One day we heard that the Germans took over and they’re marching in.</span> <span id="s260">They said they are marching in through the street.</span> <span id="s261">At this time you still were allowed to walk out, be in town, and so we all ran out.</span> <span id="s262">They were walking on the middle of the street, the army, and we were standing, Jews, Poles, everybody, standing on the sidewalks, looking at them.</span> <span id="s263">And I thought for myself, I was young, but I thought, “They don’t look so bad.</span> <span id="s264">Maybe it won’t be...” We knew, we heard a little bit, but we thought, “Maybe it won’t be as bad.</span> <span id="s265">Maybe people exaggerate.”</span> <span id="s266">That was my first impression, but I changed my mind very quick, because it started so bad!</span> <span id="s267">They took everything away.</span> <span id="s268">We had lovely furniture and a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s269">We had to leave everything and get out.</span> <span id="s270">Only what you could take.</span> <span id="s271">And what could you take?</span> <span id="s272">You couldn’t have a car.</span> <span id="s273">At this time there were not so many cars even.</span> <span id="s274">What you could carry, that was all.</span> <span id="s275">So we went in that ghetto, and that ghetto was so miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What was life like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: The worst thing is when you cannot be occupied.</span> <span id="s278">You did not do nothing.</span> <span id="s279">There were no jobs.</span> <span id="s280">In the beginning, there were a little work, like for instance there was a rubber factory that they turned over and made in that factory these big leather coats for pilots.</span> <span id="s281">And my brother was a bookkeeper in the office of that factory.</span> <span id="s282">So luckily I got a job there.</span> <span id="s283">Getting a job meant getting a soup a day.</span> <span id="s284">You didn’t work, you didn’t get it, but you had a job, you got a ration, you got a soup a day, which was a lot.</span> <span id="s285">So I worked for a while there.</span> <span id="s286">It’s hard to talk about it.</span> <span id="s287">It’s like a chaos.</span> <span id="s288">Not mixed up, but so many things happened at once, that you don’t know where to start, even.</span> <span id="s289">My mother was not with us at this time.</span> <span id="s290">There had once a selection.</span> <span id="s291">They’ll come in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s292">Three gun shots, and everybody, no matter, you had to be dressed, and down.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: In the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes, that was in the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s295">And they took my mother away.</span> <span id="s296">And when they took her away, I tried to go with her, and a German soldier pushed me away, and he said, if I move, he’ll shoot me.</span> <span id="s297">And my mother started to scream that I should not go after her.</span> <span id="s298">She wanted to save my life.</span> <span id="s299">So anyway, when it was over, it was in the middle of the night - dark.</span> <span id="s300">But of course I could not sleep any more, and I was waiting for dawn.</span> <span id="s301">We had an idea where they took all the people.</span> <span id="s302">So it was forbidden, but I walked over there when it was the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Where was this that they had taken the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: To a big, big hospital that was already empty, because they got rid of all the sick people.</span> <span id="s305">They probably killed them.</span> <span id="s306">They didn’t care much.</span> <span id="s307">As long as you could work they kept you with as little as possible, but they let you live.</span> <span id="s308">But if you couldn’t work, you were useless.</span> <span id="s309">I have an idea what they did with them.</span> <span id="s310">Anyway, there the people that they gathered during the night were there.</span> <span id="s311">I was standing and looking, hoping that I might see my mother, even though I couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s312">But what I saw was so frightening, and so terrible.</span> <span id="s313">To begin with, the moment I left that house, there was like a market, and here I saw seven people, seven Jews, hanging.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t know when they were hung, but they were.</span> <span id="s315">And that almost killed me.</span> <span id="s316">And then when I saw the people standing at these windows and knocking at the windows, crying, pleading for help, and nobody could, I just got so upset, and I came home.</span> <span id="s317">I told you we had that rollaway bed.</span> <span id="s318">And me and my mother slept in one bed and my brother slept on that rollaway bed.</span> <span id="s319">And that morning I didn’t care even to move it.</span> <span id="s320">For the day we had to move it, take it up, because in the other room lived other people, and if that bed was standing, they couldn’t even go through.</span> <span id="s321">Anyway, I left that bed, and I ran out, hoping I might see my mother.</span> <span id="s322">I didn’t see her, but what I saw was so terrible, so frightening, so tragic that I came home, and I fell on that bed.</span> <span id="s323">I don’t know what happened to me, but for two days I was laying on that bed, not moving, looking at the ceiling.</span> <span id="s324">I didn’t know that, but when I “came back,” my brother told me what happened to me.</span> <span id="s325">He cried, he hollered, he tried to feed me.</span> <span id="s326">I wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t drink, I wouldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s327">Just numb, like that.</span> <span id="s328">He was pretty frightened.</span> <span id="s329">But after two days, I kind of started to get back, and he told me what happened.</span> <span id="s330">And so my mother wasn’t there anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Now I’m going back to that factory where I worked.</span> <span id="s332">They tried to occupy some people.</span> <span id="s333">I’ve got to say it: the ghetto was corrupted.</span> <span id="s334">It’s embarrassing to say, but that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s335">People that were nothing, nobody, before the war, got to be big shots, important people, like almost the underworld.</span> <span id="s336">They were strong.</span> <span id="s337">They could push themselves.</span> <span id="s338">They could do things better than the quiet, refined person what was sitting just doing nothing.</span> <span id="s339">he couldn’t do those things.</span> <span id="s340">He couldn’t push himself, and so on.</span> <span id="s341">I’m coming to the point, that you had to have a push, or something, to work in a factory or somewhere, because if you could holler a lot, open a big mouth and push yourself, push away everybody, and be the first - let’s say it was a line for that work - you’ll get in and get the job.</span> <span id="s342">But the quiet people, the refined ones that couldn't do it, it was bad.</span> <span id="s343">Very bad.</span> <span id="s344">I was lucky, because my brother worked there as a bookkeeper and I got the job.</span> <span id="s345">But not for long.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What kind of factory was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: They made these leather coats.</span> <span id="s348">The Germans were much for leather coats.</span> <span id="s349">And this was for the pilots.</span> <span id="s350">Beautiful, beautiful coats!</span> <span id="s351">And I tell you the work had to be perfect!</span> <span id="s352">Because we never knew when a “commission” - they called it “commission;” doesn’t mean to get money - like an inspection came, the Germans, and looked and checked how good we do the work.</span> <span id="s353">So, life was very hard in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s354">Very hard.</span> <span id="s355">You get a ration once a week, a little bit of bread, maybe two or three tablespoons of sugar, and maybe a small slice of margarine for a week.</span> <span id="s356">Things were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Were you working outside of the ghetto in this factory?</span> <span id="s358">Or was the factory inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No, the factory was inside of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: During this time, were you getting any news about what was going on outside of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s361">News of the war or anything like that?</span> <span id="s362">Or were you pretty well shut off from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was just gossip, or guessing.</span> <span id="s364">How could you get news?</span> <span id="s365">It was barbed wire all around.</span> <span id="s366">Outside were the Germans in their uniforms with their bayonets, watching that nobody goes in or goes out.</span> <span id="s367">So you had no source.</span> <span id="s368">Somebody made of all kind of old junk, a little radio if he was very smart and knew how to, and you heard maybe once in a while, but who could?</span> <span id="s369">It was mostly the men would get together and listen.</span> <span id="s370">And it was such a danger to do it, because the Germans were everywhere.</span> <span id="s371">If they catch you, that you had that little radio, you’re in big trouble.</span> <span id="s372">So you knew very, very little.</span> <span id="s373">You saw the airplanes flying one way, and the other, and you couldn’t even see soldiers marching.</span> <span id="s374">We were so locked up, so closed by ourselves, we didn’t see nothing.</span> <span id="s375">If I should be honest, the ghetto was very corrupted.</span> <span id="s376">One had everything - everything - and the other was dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s377">It was corruption.</span> <span id="s378">Everything was just so bad.</span> <span id="s379">Before we went in the ghetto, it started right away with rationed bread.</span> <span id="s380">It was a line.</span> <span id="s381">The lines were so big.</span> <span id="s382">Miles and miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: How many people in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s384">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s386">So where I lived was far to the bakery for the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s387">At this time we were four, and I could collect with four coupons a fairly nice piece of bread.</span> <span id="s388">So I had a girlfriend that lived in the same house where the bakery was.</span> <span id="s389">And if you go out early in the morning when it’s dark, they would shoot you.</span> <span id="s390">So I would go, when you still were allowed to walk on the street, and stay overnight there.</span> <span id="s391">And you know, a funny thing.</span> <span id="s392">Whenever you came, the line was already so big.</span> <span id="s393">No matter when.</span> <span id="s394">I don’t know how the people did it!</span> <span id="s395">I was a schlemiel, they call it, a schlemiel.</span> <span id="s396">I wasn’t good for it.</span> <span id="s397">I couldn’t fight, I wasn’t used to it.</span> <span id="s398">My luck, I was the one to come to the window, they closed the window.</span> <span id="s399">Spent a whole night not sleeping, standing in a line waiting, came to me, no bread.</span> <span id="s400">The ghetto was so bad.</span> <span id="s401">It’s hard to believe what people did, and you cannot blame them.</span> <span id="s402">People were swollen.</span> <span id="s403">They looked good, and you thought, “They are heavy.”</span> <span id="s404">But it was not being fat or being heavy.</span> <span id="s405">They were swollen with hunger.</span> <span id="s406">Here you talked to the person, he looks just perfect.</span> <span id="s407">Half an hour later he was dead.</span> <span id="s408">What some people did to get the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s409">Anything!</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: You were in the ghetto three years, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Maybe two and a half.</span> <span id="s412">We went to the ghetto in 1940.</span> <span id="s413">I think in ‘42 they took us.</span> <span id="s414">They said we should take anything we want, anything we have, because we are going to a working camp.</span> <span id="s415">Families can be together, and they will work together, they have little rooms, and nothing will happen to us as long as we work.</span> <span id="s416">That’s what we were told.</span> <span id="s417">Of course you took everything you had.</span> <span id="s418">Once they took us, and we just didn’t believe it - it was me and my brother - and somehow we got out.</span> <span id="s419">We run away, and we got somehow back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: You were already out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes, in a prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: In Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s424">And we got back, not together.</span> <span id="s425">I didn’t know about him, he didn’t know about me.</span> <span id="s426">It was very dark at night.</span> <span id="s427">You had to walk through a little creek between the prison and the ghetto.</span> <span id="s428">It was very far.</span> <span id="s429">By a miracle I came back.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t know how I found my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: How’d you get out of the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: It’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s433">And as I say, everything was corrupted.</span> <span id="s434">You had a diamond, you gave it to the warden.</span> <span id="s435">Everything was “juice.”</span> <span id="s436">They let you out.</span> <span id="s437">Anyway, it didn’t do us much good.</span> <span id="s438">I walked and walked and walked, and it was late and the bombs were flying, and the airplane.</span> <span id="s439">It was dark!</span> <span id="s440">Completely!</span> <span id="s441">Somehow I came back.</span> <span id="s442">And then my brother came to that room in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s443">The Germans were looking for people.</span> <span id="s444">And it was a Jewish policeman, and he showed the German where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s445">Didn’t do nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s446">Didn’t kill us.</span> <span id="s447">Nothing.</span> <span id="s448">You were hiding.</span> <span id="s449">Maybe you would save your life.</span> <span id="s450">Well, then they came again.</span> <span id="s451">We were in an attic.</span> <span id="s452">And it came one, the worst!</span> <span id="s453">He was so big, and so tall.</span> <span id="s454">A giant.</span> <span id="s455">And he took my brother, and he had a whip, and he hit him so hard.</span> <span id="s456">Every time he hit him, I felt my heart, for my heart is going out.</span> <span id="s457">I spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s458">I talked to him.</span> <span id="s459">I pleaded.</span> <span id="s460">I said, “Hit me, better.”</span> <span id="s461">Nothing helped.</span> <span id="s462">And then he could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s463">They took us both.</span> <span id="s464">And this time we didn’t get out any more.</span> <span id="s465">We were so disgusted, we didn’t even think about getting out any more.</span> <span id="s466">You know sooner or later you’ll go anyway.</span> <span id="s467">After they hit him so badly, I said, “I can’t live through that again.”</span> <span id="s468">So we went.</span> <span id="s469">We had bread, we had sugar, saved up.</span> <span id="s470">I always saved, thinking about tomorrow.</span> <span id="s471">I don’t know which is better.</span> <span id="s472">Some people, whatever they got, they ate up right away, and then they were going hungry.</span> <span id="s473">I was different that way.</span> <span id="s474">I saved up.</span> <span id="s475">As a matter of fact, my saving saved my brother once.</span> <span id="s476">He got up one morning and couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s477">Completely couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s478">And I was just so worried.</span> <span id="s479">In formal times, you cannot walk, you’re sick, you go to a doctor, you do something.</span> <span id="s480">What do you do in a ghetto when you are starving?</span> <span id="s481">And all the Germans need is to see someone that cannot walk!</span> <span id="s482">Then for sure they take him and do him away and that’s it!</span> <span id="s483">It was a black market in the ghetto, and for a bread - a bread is probably four months of your life - but for a bread you could get some other things, some medication.</span> <span id="s484">And as young as I was, I knew what was wrong with him.</span> <span id="s485">He was undernourished.</span> <span id="s486">Vitamin deficiency.</span> <span id="s487">I had saved a bread that he did not know about it.</span> <span id="s488">Every time I got my portion, a piece, a piece, a piece, every time I saved one portion.</span> <span id="s489">I got a whole bread from the ration!</span> <span id="s490">I gave this to the families, and they were happy, because the older the bread, the better it was, because had more of it.</span> <span id="s491">Fresh bread goes very quick.</span> <span id="s492">I learned that in the war.</span> <span id="s493">You eat it fast and you’re still hungry.</span> <span id="s494">Old bread is better.</span> <span id="s495">So I saved that.</span> <span id="s496">I took that bread and went and I bought a tiny bottle of vitamins - very small.</span> <span id="s497">A miracle it was.</span> <span id="s498">I started giving them.</span> <span id="s499">It took one-and-a-half days and he got down from the bed and started to walk again.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">So I think I have all my life a guilty feeling.</span> <span id="s501">We went to Washington for the Holocaust gathering, and they were talking about that guilty feeling, that you shouldn’t have a guilty feeling if you got left - for instance, one out of the whole family.</span> <span id="s502">I feel so guilty I have no peace of mind.</span> <span id="s503">I always says, “How come I got left and not my brother?”</span> <span id="s504">- I had every hope and belief that I find him, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s505">But I saved him for a while.</span> <span id="s506">We went with the transport.</span> <span id="s507">And they told us that we can take everything we own to work and everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s508">But it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s509">We were about two days and two nights on that, locked up.</span> <span id="s510">It was a cattle train.</span> <span id="s511">And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s512">A little bit of hay.</span> <span id="s513">No toilet.</span> <span id="s514">No facilities.</span> <span id="s515">People had to go where they were standing or sitting.</span> <span id="s516">And all locked up.</span> <span id="s517">Maybe once a day they’ll open these stalls in that train, so we’ll catch a little bit of air, and close it again.</span> <span id="s518">It was a whole long journey.</span> <span id="s519">We couldn’t wait to come to that, should I say, promised place?</span> <span id="s520">Not promised land, but promised place, where we’ll be able to work and get a ration, and we’ll have a little room or something.</span> <span id="s521">But we came straight to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s522">I never, never had any idea in my life that there is an Auschwitz!</span> <span id="s523">I have never heard of it, I never seen, and nobody in the ghetto knew about it.</span> <span id="s524">So I came there, and what I saw, I couldn’t believe my own eyes.</span> <span id="s525">When they opened, they took us down, I said, “My God!</span> <span id="s526">I must be in Africa!”</span> <span id="s527">And then I said to myself, “How could I get in two days by cattle train to Africa?”</span> <span id="s528">I thought, “I am in a jungle between white people.”</span> <span id="s529">That’s how the people looked to me.</span> <span id="s530">Women, girls, almost naked, shaved completely.</span> <span id="s531">And the faces from the sun.</span> <span id="s532">It must have been there so hot, or I don’t know.</span> <span id="s533">Dark!</span> <span id="s534">Like from Africa!</span> <span id="s535">I was so puzzled!</span> <span id="s536">You cannot think, you don’t know what to think first.</span> <span id="s537">Here you see soldiers taking you out.</span> <span id="s538">We go together.</span> <span id="s539">I had a big argument on the way walking out from the train, with my brother, because he had a diamond ring and he saw what’s going on.</span> <span id="s540">At this time they had in the men’s pants little pockets by the belt - a tiny little pocket for a watch.</span> <span id="s541">And he kept that ring there.</span> <span id="s542">That was the last ring.</span> <span id="s543">And when he saw what was going on, he took out the ring and wanted me to take it.</span> <span id="s544">And I said, “I won’t take it!</span> <span id="s545">I’ll die before I take that ring!”</span> <span id="s546">I said, “You take it!</span> <span id="s547">You’re a man, and men have it harder!</span> <span id="s548">That ring might save your life!”</span> <span id="s549">And we were both walking and arguing.</span> <span id="s550">Maybe other people argued both wanted the ring!</span> <span id="s551">But this was the opposite.</span> <span id="s552">He wanted me to have it, and I wanted him to have it.</span> <span id="s553">And the end was, first we thought we’d be together, but then I saw they’re separating men from women.</span> <span id="s554">It ended up that we were arguing, and we didn’t hear even what they were saying.</span> <span id="s555">Then a German separated us, came just and cut us off.</span> <span id="s556">And he was left with the ring.</span> <span id="s557">All this time, this terrible horrible times, the only good thing that I felt was that I didn’t take the ring.</span> <span id="s558">And I thought that ring might save him.</span> <span id="s559">It didn’t.</span> <span id="s560">But I would feel even more guilty if I would’ve been stuck with that ring, because my mind would always be, maybe if he would have it... It was a big diamond, and I would think if maybe he would’ve had that ring, he would have been saved.</span> <span id="s561">Auschwitz was so terrible.</span> <span id="s562">Auschwitz was so bad.</span> <span id="s563">Every night I prayed.</span> <span id="s564">We were sleeping standing up, one on the shoulder of the other one, for days.</span> <span id="s565">And somehow you get tired and you just fall asleep.</span> <span id="s566">And I could feel, when I’m going to fall asleep.</span> <span id="s567">I prayed so hard to God that he’d take my soul.</span> <span id="s568">I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s569">But God, I don’t know for what purpose, I was saved, not my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: About what time of year and what year did you arrive in Auschwitz then?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I think in July, ‘42.</span> <span id="s572">But I was in other camps, too.</span> <span id="s573">I wasn’t all the time in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: But Auschwitz was the first camp you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s576">I was in Birkenau, Ravensbruck, and then in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s577">In Auschwitz I stayed a little bit longer, but then - I suppose that’s what saved me - they came and said they need 500 girls for a working camp.</span> <span id="s578">The Germans, you couldn’t trust them, you couldn’t believe them.</span> <span id="s579">They’ll come and say they need for the working camp, and then they take the people to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s580">What do the people know where they’re going?</span> <span id="s581">But it must be my intuition.</span> <span id="s582">Like if you were in Auschwitz, you had a - I can’t say tattoo, but a number.</span> <span id="s583">They never told you what they’re going to do, and almost everybody had one.</span> <span id="s584">And they took me, and I had an intuition somehow.</span> <span id="s585">I was brave.</span> <span id="s586">I wasn’t like I am now.</span> <span id="s587">I was very brave.</span> <span id="s588">And I didn’t like the idea.</span> <span id="s589">And I just hid somewhere and ran away, so that’s why I don’t have a number.</span> <span id="s590">There were these notices that they need 500 girls for work.</span> <span id="s591">Nobody wanted to go, because you cannot trust.</span> <span id="s592">They never told you the truth.</span> <span id="s593">They said what is convenient for them, good for them.</span> <span id="s594">I was very much disgusted and I couldn’t take it any more in Auschwitz, and I said to myself, “Whatever happens, happens.</span> <span id="s595">I can’t take it any more here.”</span> <span id="s596">If you were not there, you cannot believe it.</span> <span id="s597">Each of us can write a book, and you don’t have to add nothing to make it better or nicer or more interesting, because everyone who was in Auschwitz had an experience as long as that person will live.</span> <span id="s598">Still have nightmares and thinking in dreams about it.</span> <span id="s599">So I was so disgusted that I said, “Whatever happens, I’m going.</span> <span id="s600">It can’t be worse than it is here in Auschwitz.”</span> <span id="s601">And I decided, and other girls went, and by some miracle, it really was a working camp.</span> <span id="s602">It was on the French border, Mullhausen.</span> <span id="s603">We worked very, very hard!</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Work that they didn’t even need.</span> <span id="s606">I worked in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s607">They made big parts to airplanes, all kinds of weapons.</span> <span id="s608">And girls had such bad, hard work there.</span> <span id="s609">Some girls got so sick.</span> <span id="s610">Before you put together the airplane, it’s washed - in benzene.</span> <span id="s611">It’s a combination of naphtha and gasoline.</span> <span id="s612">They washed it, and it got to their lungs.</span> <span id="s613">It was bad.</span> <span id="s614">But I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s615">I was in the control department.</span> <span id="s616">And I had a little scale, and I had to weight little parts, like a little switch, like a little screw.</span> <span id="s617">It had to weigh the right amount on that little scale.</span> <span id="s618">It was like a scale pharmacists have.</span> <span id="s619">Anyway I had this and it was very easy work.</span> <span id="s620">And I worked there and we stayed there for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s621">That saved the girls.</span> <span id="s622">I walked 20 kilometers a day.</span> <span id="s623">Where we worked was like in a bunker - underground, and on the top was a beautiful park which we never saw, but that was the tale there.</span> <span id="s624">That’s what they were telling some German.</span> <span id="s625">A beautiful park where music was playing, so the enemies shouldn’t know that there is a factory.</span> <span id="s626">And that’s all we saw.</span> <span id="s627">I walked 20 kilometers one way, and 20 the other way.</span> <span id="s628">They woke us up around 2:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s629">We walked in the dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Where’d you walk from?</span> <span id="s631">From the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: From the barracks to that factory.</span> <span id="s633">In the dark.</span> <span id="s634">We walked like soldiers, five in a row.</span> <span id="s635">On both sides German soldiers with these carbines, and German woman soldiers, and big shepherds.</span> <span id="s636">When we came it was dark and we walked home in the dark again.</span> <span id="s637">You didn’t have too much time to sleep or do nothing.</span> <span id="s638">That was it.</span> <span id="s639">And you got one soup a day, not too good one.</span> <span id="s640">And on Sunday a piece of bread and a little bit of sugar.</span> <span id="s641">But it was fairly clean, and we had a bunk, four girls, but you had a little blanket to cover yourself.</span> <span id="s642">After Auschwitz, that was heaven!</span> <span id="s643">So we stayed there until they liquidated.</span> <span id="s644">The Germans started to lose.</span> <span id="s645">They saw it’s going to be an end, so they closed it, and they took us by transport to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s646">And that was a repetition from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s647">That was bad.</span> <span id="s648">Very bad!</span> <span id="s649">Very, very bad.</span> <span id="s650">And that’s where freedom, liberation came to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: How long were you there in Bergen?</span> <span id="s652">Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No.</span> <span id="s654">You lived without a date.</span> <span id="s655">You know when you have the day off, it’s Sunday.</span> <span id="s656">And you count it that way: Monday, Tuesday, and so on.</span> <span id="s657">Saturday you just worked like any other day.</span> <span id="s658">So it was hard.</span> <span id="s659">We figured Yom Kippur when the leaves started to fall, and so on.</span> <span id="s660">It was getting cold and so we figured it must be Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: All this time, did you hear anything about what was going on with the war?</span> <span id="s662">Were there any rumors or any news at all that you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: In that munition place, we had an older soldier that they were talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: What happened at Bergen-Belsen then before the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I woke up one morning, and we were four in one bed, in these bunk beds.</span> <span id="s666">A terrible shock again, the girl that I slept all these weeks, these months, I had to wake her, and she wouldn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s667">She died at night.</span> <span id="s668">That was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s669">She didn’t sleep, she was dead already, probably the whole night, right by my side.</span> <span id="s670">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s671">I was so sick, I was ready to die so many time.</span> <span id="s672">I had typhus.</span> <span id="s673">I begged everybody.</span> <span id="s674">I saw somebody going by with a drop of water, I begged so hard.</span> <span id="s675">Nobody helped me.</span> <span id="s676">Nobody gave me.</span> <span id="s677">They had to take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s678">If they had a drop of water, they needed it.</span> <span id="s679">Didn’t give it to me.</span> <span id="s680">I remember, I fell back in bed.</span> <span id="s681">There was no pillow, no covering, no nothing.</span> <span id="s682">Just boards.</span> <span id="s683">Four boards that you don’t fall down, and maybe three boards that you lay on, and that was all.</span> <span id="s684">And with the typhus, and being that sick in a place like that, it’s hard to survive.</span> <span id="s685">And I remember I lifted my head and I fell back.</span> <span id="s686">I couldn’t keep my head up.</span> <span id="s687">And I said, “God, I pray take my soul.</span> <span id="s688">I’m ready to die.”</span> <span id="s689">That was for a moment I said it.</span> <span id="s690">Then I thought of my brother, and I said, “No, I cannot die, because if I die and he is saved and he won’t find me, he’ll die.”</span> <span id="s691">We were very, very close.</span> <span id="s692">I was the baby.</span> <span id="s693">I was seven years younger than he.</span> <span id="s694">And so I cried.</span> <span id="s695">And I remember one girl came in in that barrack and started to holler, “You know, the Germans are leaving!”</span> <span id="s696">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s697">And she came back to my bunk and hollered, “You know, they’re leaving!</span> <span id="s698">We’re going to be free!</span> <span id="s699">You’re going to be okay!”</span> <span id="s700">I remember it like now.</span> <span id="s701">I lifted my head as much as I could, and I looked out.</span> <span id="s702">I was on top, so it was a little window - and I saw Germans taking off their belts, the white one, and their hats, and they’re running!</span> <span id="s703">And I think that was the greatest moment in my life.</span> <span id="s704">I say, “Now, for sure I am ready to die,” because each of us dreamt that someday liberation would come.</span> <span id="s705">Funny thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: What happened after liberation then?</span> <span id="s707">Where’d you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Well, no disappointment, because the Americans came and the English.</span> <span id="s709">They tried to help us, but I have to say one thing.</span> <span id="s710">It was not the right help.</span> <span id="s711">Many, many people died after the liberation.</span> <span id="s712">They tried their best.</span> <span id="s713">It was the right idea, but not for people like that.</span> <span id="s714">They came and brought, for instance, Spam, the cans, or chicken soup, or tomato soup.</span> <span id="s715">The people were so starved, so hungry for those things, that they started to eat, and the stomach couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s716">What these people needed was hot water with a few spoons of cream of wheat to heal the inside.</span> <span id="s717">Their stomach couldn’t take it, and lots of people died after this.</span> <span id="s718">As I say, the intention was good, but they couldn’t take Spam or canned meat or even rice or tomato soup.</span> <span id="s719">They needed something else.</span> <span id="s720">I wasn’t hungry at all.</span> <span id="s721">With me it was different.</span> <span id="s722">And I still had my senses, and I never was that way that I have to eat, no matter what.</span> <span id="s723">And I thought, this is no good!</span> <span id="s724">I didn’t eat it!</span> <span id="s725">But my big disappointment was when they took us out to a hospital, little by little.</span> <span id="s726">They were so good, the American and the English.</span> <span id="s727">They tried so hard, but to understand a person from a concentration camp, the only one can understand, what was there.</span> <span id="s728">And as much as people try, they’ll never, it’s impossible!</span> <span id="s729">I had T.B. from the ghetto, from the concentration camp and undernourishing.</span> <span id="s730">My teeth, all pyorrhea from vitamin deficiency.</span> <span id="s731">I was young and it was hard on me, on my system.</span> <span id="s732">T.B. in Europe was the worst thing you could have!</span> <span id="s733">And there was no help at this time.</span> <span id="s734">It’s not like now.</span> <span id="s735">I couldn’t understand how I could get it!</span> <span id="s736">So they sent me straight to a hospital from Germany to Sweden at this time.</span> <span id="s737">It was Folke Bernadotte.</span> <span id="s738">He was a prince.</span> <span id="s739">He was a Swede, and he was out doing good for all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s740">I think they took 50,000 or so.</span> <span id="s741">Sweden was a neutral country.</span> <span id="s742">They never had the war, so they tried to do something and they did a lot.</span> <span id="s743">So I went to Sweden.</span> <span id="s744">Not willingly, but I had no choice, because I was so sick.</span> <span id="s745">And they put me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: How long were you in Sweden then?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: We were in five years.</span> <span id="s748">Our son was born in Sweden.</span> <span id="s749">I met my husband in Sweden.</span> <span id="s750">He’s not Swedish.</span> <span id="s751">He’s from Poland but I met him there.</span> <span id="s752">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s753">Very sick.</span> <span id="s754">And Sweden's’ a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s755">I’ve got to give them a lot of credit.</span> <span id="s756">I didn’t want to stay there, because we had a little boy, and I wanted to be as far from Europe as possible.</span> <span id="s757">But I always had the best memories of Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Was there any question of choosing Palestine or the United States to come to?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Not in Sweden.</span> <span id="s760">Some people migrated to Israel, but not too many.</span> <span id="s761">If they didn’t have affidavit to America, they went to Israel, but my husband had a cousin.</span> <span id="s762">He sent the affidavit to come here.</span> <span id="s763">So we came.</span> <span id="s764">We came as D.P.</span> <span id="s765">In ‘51 we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Was there any organization that aided you during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I think the HIAS.</span> <span id="s768">And when we came here, the Jewish Family Service took care of us for two weeks.</span> <span id="s769">Because the moment we came, I didn’t want any charity.</span> <span id="s770">I didn’t want nothing.</span> <span id="s771">Some people waited months and months, but my husband went to work two weeks after we were here.</span> <span id="s772">I had a hard time here.</span> <span id="s773">Very hard.</span> <span id="s774">I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s775">I didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s776">We came with $25 in the pocket, and it was rough.</span> <span id="s777">Very rough, but we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Do you maintain any contact with other survivors, or are you in any survivor organizations?</span> <span id="s779">You mentioned something about going to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s781">We went to Washington.</span> <span id="s782">And I am so glad that we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Tell me, what was the name of the meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Gathering of the Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s785">I didn’t want to see Washington or go sightseeing or nothing.</span> <span id="s786">I said to myself, “This I might do on my own time - another time if I have another chance.</span> <span id="s787">I came with one purpose, to look for my brother.”</span> <span id="s788">And this I did.</span> <span id="s789">I mentioned the guilty feeling that I have, that I’m the only survivor.</span> <span id="s790">But after the war, I was in a convalescent home in Sweden.</span> <span id="s791">Days and night I was sitting, writing letters in Polish, in Yiddish, in German - all over the world - all neutral countries.</span> <span id="s792">Everywhere.</span> <span id="s793">Looking for my brother, because he had every chance to be alive.</span> <span id="s794">And I did not find.</span> <span id="s795">Still I had that guilty feeling.</span> <span id="s796">I just think, “Why?</span> <span id="s797">Why should I be alive when nobody else is?”</span> <span id="s798">And that’s why I went.</span> <span id="s799">There was a convention hall.</span> <span id="s800">The last day before we left, some people that I came with went sightseeing.</span> <span id="s801">I went back to the convention hall and again, looked at computers, filled out any possible papers, information, without a stop, about my brother.</span> <span id="s802">They’re going to have a museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s803">I pledged some money.</span> <span id="s804">I get literature, I get mail from the Holocaust Gathering.</span> <span id="s805">Every time I get a letter, my heart goes out.</span> <span id="s806">I think maybe some news about my brother.</span> <span id="s807">I wish I could find out.</span> <span id="s808">Sometimes I think, “Maybe he was alive and he passed away.</span> <span id="s809">Maybe he has left a family.”</span> <span id="s810">But what do you do?</span> <span id="s811">How do you find any information?</span> <span id="s812">I wrote to Israel.</span> <span id="s813">We were two times in Israel.</span> <span id="s814">I again looked all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No.</span> <span id="s817">A lot of my friends, a lot of people gave up.</span> <span id="s818">They don’t believe in anything, which I don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s819">They say, “If there is a God...My mother was a pious woman.</span> <span id="s820">Look what happened to her,” and so on.</span> <span id="s821">But with me, the roots are so deep that I cannot change it.</span> <span id="s822">I still believe.</span> <span id="s823">You ask question that nobody answers, nobody can answer it.</span> <span id="s824">But you still believe that there is a purpose for everything.</span> <span id="s825">And what happened is very bad, but what can you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What would you say is your general feeling about human nature or non-Jews and Germans is, from your experience in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: I still believe there are some good people in the world, some good people that do the right things.</span> <span id="s828">We mostly hear about the bad people, but the good ones are quiet and we don’t know so much about them.</span> <span id="s829">I believe in God.</span> <span id="s830">We raised our children that way - a very strict orthodox.</span> <span id="s831">With as little as we had, we gave them a good education.</span> <span id="s832">The rest we leave up to them.</span> <span id="s833">They are strict, too, and they believe.</span> <span id="s834">I still believe in mankind.</span> <span id="s835">You have to, or you couldn’t live.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Can you tell me what it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: It means that your heart is broken.</span> <span id="s838">I might mend a little bit, but it could never be complete.</span> <span id="s839">To be a survivor, what you went through, only another survivor can understand you.</span> <span id="s840">I don’t mean to say that people don’t try to don’t want or don’t believe, but nobody, nobody can know or feel or think the way a survivor does.</span> <span id="s841">It’s just one survivor can talk to another and one survivor can understand another.</span> <span id="s842">All of the survivors went through so much.</span> <span id="s843">I thought during all these hard times that when we live it through, everybody will carry us around like wonders!</span> <span id="s844">The fifth wonder of the world, or so.</span> <span id="s845">And we’ll have it so good, because we suffered for other ones that did not go through that.</span> <span id="s846">But it’s a rough world.</span> <span id="s847">And you still have to fight to live.</span> <span id="s848">Life is a battle.</span> <span id="s849">And as long as you live, you have to fight it.</span> <span id="s850">It’s just some have it easier and some have it harder.</span> <span id="s851">I want to tell the world as much as I can, and I want to say: Not ever again.</span> <span id="s852">Never again.</span> <span id="s853">We have now our own country.</span> <span id="s854">I wish we would have Israel when the war started.</span> <span id="s855">Nobody was treated as bad as the Jews.</span> <span id="s856">And that was because everybody had someone that could say a word.</span> <span id="s857">We were with Russian girls.</span> <span id="s858">They were treated, in comparison with us, royally!</span> <span id="s859">They had shoes.</span> <span id="s860">They had coats.</span> <span id="s861">They had scarves.</span> <span id="s862">They had bread when we had nothing.</span> <span id="s863">And that was for one reason.</span> <span id="s864">Nobody stood up for us.</span> <span id="s865">Every country, somehow, tried to help out their prisoners that were taken.</span> <span id="s866">Nobody spoke up for you, and nobody cared even.</span> <span id="s867">And if we would have Israel at this time, I’m sure our life would be entirely different.</span> <span id="s868">And I say: No, never again.</span> <span id="s869">We should try and have our country and help them as much as possible, so Israel will be forever.</span> <span id="s870">And maybe that way we’ll never again go through what we did.</span> <span id="s871">I try to tell my children and my grandchildren, and everybody, should know what happened.</span> <span id="s872">What happened to a nation, what happened to many nations, what happened to the people.</span> <span id="s873">How bad it can be.</span> <span id="s874">And never again should be a Hitler, or Nazism, or anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s875">We should fight it, all, Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s876">Every one that is a human being and has a heart should know what happened.</span> <span id="s877">That’s about all I can say.</span></p></body></html>
