interview with Mr. Samuel Flor.</span> <span id="s3">I regret that the first few sentences of Mr. Flor's initial, first interview, for some reason, are blank on the tape, but my initial question to him was, "Please tell me where you were born and when, and a little about your family."</span> <span id="s4">As I say, the first few sentences are not on the tape but you can easily pick up the meaning of the sentence, of the question that is, from that point on.</span> <span id="s5">Please keep listening.</span> <span id="s6">You will shortly hear his remarks and my question to him, as I said, my question to him was, "Please tell me where you were born and when, and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">SF: We were four Jews in the kindergarten and we were about 25 non-Jews, and we four were always singled out for a beating since we were little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">MS: Would you give us the name of the town...</span></p> <p><span id="s9">SF: The town where I was born was called Chernovitz.1 Then when I was six years old this town became Romania and was called Cernauti.</span> <span id="s10">It had a different name because, you know, there were signed peace treaties and the geography of Europe changed entirely.</span> <span id="s11">But I cannot remember a time when I was not reminded of antisemitic beatings of Jews.</span> <span id="s12">There was not Hitler or anybody like that, but the Jews were used to this treatment.</span> <span id="s13">And then later on, I started to study music in the conservatory in Cernauti, and I went to Vienna to the Academy of Music, and I studied music there.</span> <span id="s14">I had to go to the university, too, and always on Saturdays, the students of German descent or even Austrian descent, they put on their students' uniforms and walked around in circles in the big hall of the university, and when a Jew appeared, they all jumped at him and beat him up.</span> <span id="s15">They had sticks prepared for this.</span> <span id="s16">This big hall is called in Latin the Aula, that means [unclear] hall, and the Jews knew, on Saturday we don't go there.</span> <span id="s17">Saturday in Europe is a working day.</span> <span id="s18">They have only one day, here we have a weekend Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s19">After I graduated from the university there, I concertized very much in Europe, Africa, Asia, and finally I went back to Cernauti, where I became a full professor at the university and in the conservatory, and I started to compose an opera.</span> <span id="s20">I thought I'm a composer, and I was concert-master of the Philharmonia there.</span> <span id="s21">I had my own string quartet, but then, all of a sudden, we were notified that our town will be Russia, because Hitler and Stalin at that time were allied and they decided to abolish the Versailles Peace Treaty, so our town Chernovitz became Chernovitsy and sure enough, it's forbidden to speak any other language but Russian.</span> <span id="s22">As in Romania, it was forbidden to speak any other language but Romanian.</span> <span id="s23">And especially the Jews had to prove that they are citizens of this place.</span> <span id="s24">I took pictures from the cemetery where my family, the Flors, are for the last 300 years living there.</span> <span id="s25">This didn't help.</span> <span id="s26">I had to prove it with papers.</span> <span id="s27">So I had to bribe the authority that they should believe me.</span> <span id="s28">Now, when the Russians came, all of a sudden we became Russian citizens and everybody became a passport.</span> <span id="s29">Do not misunderstand.</span> <span id="s30">A passport is not a travel document like it is in the United States.</span> <span id="s31">A passport is sort of a driver's license, an I.D. card, but it's the most important card in Russia.</span> <span id="s32">Then this was June 28, 1940, and we were--I was teaching at the Conservatory, I got married to my wife Gertrude.</span> <span id="s33">But then I was very shocked because at holidays, the Russian holidays are the day of the Red Army, which is in February, and the day of the Revolution, which is in October.</span> <span id="s34">We had to march.</span> <span id="s35">Everybody had to march.</span> <span id="s36">If you didn't bring your paper from a doctor, then you were jailed, put into jail.</span> <span id="s37">So we all had to march--which means demonstrate on the streets and say how great Russia is, how great our leader Stalin is.</span> <span id="s38">But the biggest joke was when we had to march in front of a tribune, and there was standing Russian officers and German officers with their swastika, and we had to yell, "Heil Hitler" and "Long live Stalin", and it was very shocking to me because many of my friends in Germany and in Austria were in concentration camps, were killed, and I had to yell, "Heil Hitler" and "Long live Stalin."</span></p> <p><span id="s39">MS: At the time that you had to greet Hitler and Stalin, you knew then already that friends and relatives of yours were interned in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">SF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">MS: You were aware of it at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">SF: Oh yes, very much, because I was in correspondence with Vienna and with Berlin, where my friends were living, and I, since I was a composer and I had since published there, so my publisher who escaped, and some other people who escaped, they came to us and told us.</span> <span id="s43">And we were concertizing and playing, and it was unbelievable how much the Russians offered in the respect of concerts, entertainment.</span> <span id="s44">But there was no newspaper in town, and we never had any idea of what the day is, because we had before seven daily newspapers, and all of a sudden we had only one, which was in Russian.</span> <span id="s45">And in this paper they wrote mostly how many potatoes this peasant has planted, and how much this laborer has worked, but they didn't write what happened.</span> <span id="s46">But in the meantime, many people were deported, dragged out of their homes, and taken away.</span> <span id="s47">We heard they were taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s48">At that time we didn't know.</span> <span id="s49">One of those people was my mother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">MS: These were people being deported in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">SF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">MS: Were they doing it by sections?</span> <span id="s53">I mean, how did they, if you knew this was happening, wasn't there an instant desire to leave the country at that point, or to try to save yourself from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SF: This is the nicest American question I've ever heard.</span> <span id="s55">To leave the country at that point...</span></p> <p><span id="s56">MS: Was impossible?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">SF: It was impossible to leave, to move.</span> <span id="s58">When you came outside of the city limit, there were guards with dogs, and peasants of a whole village tried to escape.</span> <span id="s59">And they had sacks with cats, because they knew that there would be dogs.</span> <span id="s60">At a certain time they let the cat run so the dogs would chase the cats.</span> <span id="s61">Those peasants were completely eliminated.</span> <span id="s62">One night the Russians came into the house of my father-in-law, who was a pharmacist, searched the whole house and then they took him away.</span> <span id="s63">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s64">Today is 1981.</span> <span id="s65">About 2 weeks ago, I received a letter from Israel, where somebody wrote, she spoke to a man who was in jail with my father-in-law, and she knew how he died.</span> <span id="s66">But we never saw his body, we just got his clothes.</span> <span id="s67">That was under the Russians.</span> <span id="s68">And this went on until June 22, 1941.</span> <span id="s69">On June 22, 1941, those two friends, Hitler and Stalin, got mad at each other and started the war.</span> <span id="s70">And sure enough, the bombs were flying, the planes were bombing us, and so on, and all of a sudden, I saw that my director from the Philharmonia and all the authorities of the Russians were leaving.</span> <span id="s71">So I packed my knapsack, and my wife and we walked.</span> <span id="s72">We came to the river Prut, which is a river in this town, and all of a sudden there were standing machine guns, and they didn't let us pass.</span> <span id="s73">And I talked to the guards, I said, "Listen, my paper was, my name was in the paper very often, and when the Germans come they surely will kill me first."</span> <span id="s74">He said, "Nothing doing, you cannot pass here."</span> <span id="s75">And while we were arguing with those guards, German planes came to bomb the bridge.</span> <span id="s76">So I took my wife and said, "We can die home, we don't have to die at the bridge."</span> <span id="s77">So we went home.</span> <span id="s78">The next day we heard that most of the people were killed there, and we saw through our window how the bridge was bombed and destroyed.</span> <span id="s79">On July 5, the Germans came.</span> <span id="s80">When the Germans marched into our town, there was no Russian left anymore.</span> <span id="s81">The town was very quiet, but they came in with Rumanian soldiers, and the janitor from our house, who was a Communist all the time, because he told the authorities who was a rich person's house, who should be deported to Siberia, or not.</span> <span id="s82">This janitor stood on the street with a bottle of liquor and tried to get the German soldiers in, to invite him and to show his patriotism towards the Germans.</span> <span id="s83">It was very interesting how this man talked because we heard him say, "I love this 'Heil Hitler' so much, but I hide him under the bed and now I've hanged 'Heil Hitler' on the wall."</span> <span id="s84">This guy didn't have any idea that Hitler's first name was Adolf.</span> <span id="s85">He thought it's "Heil".</span> <span id="s86">So finally he got some Germans in.</span> <span id="s87">So sure enough the Jews were rounded up, among them I also was rounded up.</span> <span id="s88">Rounded up means we had to stand on the sidewalk, and we were taken to the Palace of Culture.</span> <span id="s89">I played very often there.</span> <span id="s90">The benches were missing, the chairs were not there, and we stood in line.</span> <span id="s91">And we stood and stood.</span> <span id="s92">It was five in the morning, we were taken, six.</span> <span id="s93">It was middle of July, and loud voices said, "Whoever moves will be shot."</span> <span id="s94">A man went with a whip and whipped the people who moved.</span> <span id="s95">So we stood.</span> <span id="s96">In front of me I saw a man and I saw his neck getting red and more red and more red, and so we stood.</span> <span id="s97">I recognized him.</span> <span id="s98">His name was Schoenbaum.</span> <span id="s99">He played cello.</span> <span id="s100">He was a cellist.</span> <span id="s101">But sure we cannot talk.</span> <span id="s102">We cannot whisper, and we knew always behind us more people were brought in, and more people were brought in, and so we stood.</span> <span id="s103">And it was evening and we stood.</span> <span id="s104">All night we stood.</span> <span id="s105">We already stood 24 hours.</span> <span id="s106">Many people sang together, and this guy with the whip or the guys with the whip came and beat them up.</span> <span id="s107">But you were not allowed to move.</span> <span id="s108">And then finally there came the command, "Links rum!</span> <span id="s109">"2 That means, turn about and march, well, who could turn about.</span> <span id="s110">We almost fell down, and we started to march.</span> <span id="s111">And we marched down the Francens [phonetic] Street, around the university.</span> <span id="s112">I knew the territory very well and since I am tall, I was on the side.</span> <span id="s113">In fours we were marching, and I saw hedges there; there is a park.</span> <span id="s114">And I told a man in front of me: "Run."</span> <span id="s115">And I jumped and he jumped over the hedge, and four or five ran after us.</span> <span id="s116">We heard gunshots.</span> <span id="s117">I don't know whether it was rifle shots.</span> <span id="s118">But those people marched.</span> <span id="s119">We ran down the hill, came to another street, I think we were five people.</span> <span id="s120">Sure, a group of Germans, five, came, and took us.</span> <span id="s121">And they led us and arrested other people, so now we marched again with this group.</span> <span id="s122">But we were much less.</span> <span id="s123">I think we were 50 or 100 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">MS: May I ask you a question.</span> <span id="s125">Was your wife one of that group with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">SF: Only men was there.</span> <span id="s127">There were no women.</span> <span id="s128">We marched there, and they took us to the river Prut.</span> <span id="s129">There was a sort of a beach called Mamaya [phonetic].</span> <span id="s130">And on this Mamaya Beach they took us and I saw what has happened.</span> <span id="s131">The group from before what I was with, they were all machine gunned, and they were all dead and we had to bury them, and among them was our Rabbi Mark.</span> <span id="s132">After they, we buried those people, some said Kaddish.</span> <span id="s133">Then they lined us up on the wall with our hands up, we should stand, and they had an entertainment, a very interesting entertainment.</span> <span id="s134">They cocked their rifle, I mean they pulled it back, I'm not sure if they're loaded, and you were not about to turn around, and then they were shooting.</span> <span id="s135">Two fell down and died from heart attacks.</span> <span id="s136">They didn't shoot at us, higher probably.</span> <span id="s137">None was killed, and then they said "Get, get going."</span> <span id="s138">So we ran back home.</span> <span id="s139">So you can imagine, my mother, my sister, and my wife.</span> <span id="s140">They were desperate, but I came back, and they heard all the people were killed and all of a sudden I'm alive.</span> <span id="s141">Then they took us to slave labor.</span> <span id="s142">We worked on this River Prut on the bridge, and very often they put an electric shock into the iron bars where we were standing, so most of us fell into the water.</span> <span id="s143">But I swim, but some, how do you say, drowned.</span> <span id="s144">Then all of a sudden the order came that all Jews have to go into a ghetto.</span> <span id="s145">A ghetto is a place where they put barbed wire around and say, "Now you will live here."</span> <span id="s146">So we lived in this place, squeezed together, about 30, 40 in a room.</span> <span id="s147">It was October.</span> <span id="s148">It was raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">MS: Would you please repeat the name of the city in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">SF: The city is Chernovitz and the people were told with loud speaker, cars went through the streets and said, "All Jews have to be by nightfall in the ghetto."</span> <span id="s151">It was about 10 in the morning.</span> <span id="s152">"Have to be," between this street, and that street, down to the river and down to the river, drag.</span> <span id="s153">And the people walked and walked.</span> <span id="s154">Nobody had a horse or wagon, or a car or a truck, or something, so old, young, people with baby carriage pushed.</span> <span id="s155">So we went there.</span> <span id="s156">Don't forget, Jews are very obedient.</span> <span id="s157">The most obedient people in Europe was the Jews, out of gratefulness that they were not beaten up.</span> <span id="s158">So, therefore, it's basic European education.</span> <span id="s159">You are treated like an animal, but you're grateful that you're not beaten.</span> <span id="s160">So, they had their sense of humor, and this didn't go just because of Hitler, it went for centuries.</span> <span id="s161">So we went to this ghetto, surrounded by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s162">We slept 30, 40 in a room.</span> <span id="s163">It was October, it was raining, and again, a loud speaker came there, "Everybody by the name from A to F will be, has to go down to the train, and you will be relocated."</span> <span id="s164">So the people walked down to the train, from A to F. And there we were put in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s165">But, before, we saw, day before, two days before, we saw cattle cars going, people looking out of the windows, out of this little barred windows from a cattle car, and yelling very loud, "Chernovitz, Lura, Homorod, Vatra, Dornei, Kempolo [phonetic]."</span> <span id="s166">All the people yelled places from where they came.</span> <span id="s167">These were the Jews which were deported from about 100 miles away, from 50 miles away, and they had to pass through this railroad line.</span> <span id="s168">And we always stood and waited for when a train came, and then we knew where people were deported.</span> <span id="s169">Now it's our turn.</span> <span id="s170">We were hurled into cattle cars.</span> <span id="s171">Cattle car has written, "Four horses or thirty men."</span> <span id="s172">Here they put 80 people in it.</span> <span id="s173">And so we were taken and on this cattle car.</span> <span id="s174">We stood there and stood there, the car didn't move.</span> <span id="s175">We were taken about five in the evening.</span> <span id="s176">At seven in the morning the car started to move, but the doors were locked.</span> <span id="s177">We screamed and yelled, "Water."</span> <span id="s178">Nothing was given us, neither water, nor were there toilet facilities, nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s179">We are locked in the car, and we made a turn when everybody can stand at the window for two minutes.</span> <span id="s180">Window means, it's a little cubicle.</span> <span id="s181">So we made this turn, and the train started to move in the morning, and we know this territory very well where the train moved.</span> <span id="s182">And then we moved through Bessarabia, and all of a sudden some time at three in the afternoon, the train stopped on an open track.</span> <span id="s183">The door was flung open, and some Romanian and German soldiers stood there with horsewhips and whipped us down.</span> <span id="s184">Now, to get off such a train without a track.</span> <span id="s185">Here you have Track 5 or Track 6 if you go to New York or Chicago.</span> <span id="s186">No, they have no tracks.</span> <span id="s187">To go down from this train regularly is about four, five feet, but here we had to jump down 10 feet, or even deeper.</span> <span id="s188">And now, imagine, old people, my mother, my sister, my wife, and I. And so we somehow got down, and now we had to use this little trench as a bathroom while those soldiers were standing with rifles, bayonet on the rifle, and watching us do it.</span> <span id="s189">And if they saw somebody bend down, had a fountain pen, had a watch hanging, had a billfold, they took everything away, but we were glad they didn't shoot you.</span> <span id="s190">So, you're grateful.</span> <span id="s191">Now it was unbelievable, ugly, and very sad.</span> <span id="s192">Then the train was taken.</span> <span id="s193">We were whipped to get on the train.</span> <span id="s194">So we moved, and we came to Mogilev,3 this is a town on the Dniester [River].</span></p> <p><span id="s195">MS: Excuse me just one moment Mr. Flor.</span> <span id="s196">What direction, you were going further into, you were going easterly in to...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">SF: Northeast, into the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">MS: Into the Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">SF: Yes, and northeast was Mogilev.</span> <span id="s200">And all of a sudden it was said very loud: "Whoever has with him foreign currency, or gold, or diamonds, will be shot."</span> <span id="s201">Now you imagine some 3,000 or 4,000 people are lying down in rainy, muddy ground, and hearing this on the loud speaker.</span> <span id="s202">And the first people walked there and put something in.</span> <span id="s203">We didn't see what.</span> <span id="s204">It was probably money or so.</span> <span id="s205">And I saw next to me a man taking out of his pocket money and just throwing it away, and it was lying in the wind.</span> <span id="s206">What money it was, I don't know, either English or Swiss or maybe American.</span> <span id="s207">And there was a diamond bracelet lying there, and a girl threw it.</span> <span id="s208">"Please move, otherwise they will think it's yours."</span> <span id="s209">There was a field filled with money and filled with diamonds.</span> <span id="s210">And then all of a sudden we heard a sound and saw some smoke coming, so people were shot.</span> <span id="s211">I didn't see any.</span> <span id="s212">It was far.</span> <span id="s213">Then we were put on a ferry, crossed the Dniester River, and we were in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s214">And here it was said, "Whoever had relatives or friends in Mogilev, from the other town should call them.</span> <span id="s215">We send somebody with a paper and they will come here."</span></p> <p><span id="s216">MS: What do you think their purpose in that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">SF: I don't have any idea what the purpose was.</span> <span id="s218">It was told, and after about maybe a half an hour, one man went with the paper into the town of Mogilev, and after a half an hour some people came.</span> <span id="s219">It was the biggest shock.</span> <span id="s220">I saw people like you hardly see it at the movies, in rags, walking and coming.</span> <span id="s221">I did not recognize those people.</span> <span id="s222">I didn't call for anybody.</span> <span id="s223">We didn't have any relatives there at the time.</span> <span id="s224">But those people took their relatives and embrace them, and this man came with horsewhip and beat them into the ditch, and said, "Now you have enough and you have seen them, and now they will go with you."</span> <span id="s225">So we were not taken to this town.</span> <span id="s226">Now we were chased into a circle, that means, we had to stand and go in a circle, and then we were taken to Gaul [phonetic].</span> <span id="s227">Now one was holding onto the other and having his bundles, but always we were pushed to go faster.</span> <span id="s228">So we dropped our bundles, people dropped down, couldn't move.</span> <span id="s229">So we had to leave them there.</span> <span id="s230">This is the way we walked all night.</span> <span id="s231">In the morning we were put into a barn, a huge, huge barn with straw, where we fell down and slept immediately.</span> <span id="s232">But we woke up, it was hot, and then we had to go again.</span> <span id="s233">In the afternoon we came again to the place which we left before and we saw the people still lying there, their teeth broken out, and the Ukrainian peasants were behind us and taking the bundles away and dividing it with the soldiers, the gold teeth and whatever was in the bundle.</span> <span id="s234">So we walked, then we were put on a train again.</span> <span id="s235">And all of a sudden the train stopped, but this ride was maybe one day, and we were in Ladesti on the Bugac River, on a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s236">And on this stone quarry, there was neither house or a tree, or anything but a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s237">And now we saw from another car people coming out like birds, flying with their hands and making gesticulations, and we found out they were from the insane asylum of Chernovitz, all the Jewish inmates.</span> <span id="s238">They were deported with us.</span> <span id="s239">And we were on this stone quarry, it was called carrera di pietra in Romanian, which means stone quarry.</span> <span id="s240">And we were now, we had Ukrainian guards.</span> <span id="s241">Nobody was permitted to go down.</span> <span id="s242">We had to stay on top of this stone quarry, but once a day you were permitted with a bucket to go to the river and bring your bucket of water, and only the head of the family could go.</span> <span id="s243">Now, what you do with the water?</span> <span id="s244">You wash yourself, you drink, you cook.</span> <span id="s245">There was no facilities.</span> <span id="s246">We were permitted to make fire.</span> <span id="s247">We found some little wood lying around.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">MS: No food was provided?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">SF: Nothing, nothing, zero, and we got the idea to take grass, and to put the grass, to mush it into water and to try to eat this.</span> <span id="s250">To boil it a little, then we got nettles.</span> <span id="s251">Those are leaves, this is not poison ivy, this is plain nettles and they burn your figures, and this we also mushed.</span> <span id="s252">And it was good to eat.</span> <span id="s253">I mean good, relative.</span> <span id="s254">But many people got blue, swollen, and dead.</span> <span id="s255">And their ribs, when they were moving, means they were still alive, and they were not moving, they throw them into the river.</span> <span id="s256">But especially the crazy people, one by the name of Iskowitch, and this Iskowitch always stood in front of us with big eyes and said, "Brot", which means, "Give me bread."</span> <span id="s257">His hands were like claws and this other woman--it was sort of a chorus, "Give me bread."</span> <span id="s258">You know a hungry person is very hard to tame, but a crazy hungry person, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s259">So we can't help it.</span> <span id="s260">This Iskowitch killed several of his people by, how do you say, biting into their neck like a vampire or something.</span> <span id="s261">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s262">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s263">So from this stone quarry people were taken into the town of Tulchin,4 [alternate spelling Tul'cin] a certain group only.</span> <span id="s264">I was among this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">MS: Was there a selection made for the Tulchin?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">SF: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s267">One day three Germans and two Rumanians and a civilian came with a list of names, and read names.</span> <span id="s268">And he called the name Professor Samuel Flor.</span> <span id="s269">And he called Dr. Mosen and [unclear] Schreiber, Dr. Mayer, Veshler, Tembler, so he called all those names and we stood in line and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">MS: Were they to your knowledge, people of particular skills, were they professional people?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">SF: Yes, professional people all of those.</span> <span id="s272">Glazer, a roofer, Katz, and we were taken to Tulchin.</span> <span id="s273">Now in Tulchin we all were put to sort of a slave labor, which means work in peat up to your knees.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">MS: Work in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">SF: This is a black thing which is under water, you take it off, and you make squares, and you heat with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">MS: Oh, peat.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">SF: Peat, that's it.</span> <span id="s278">And here we got food, two potatoes a day per person.</span> <span id="s279">Oh, and a handful of peas, they were rotten peas, but it was peas.</span> <span id="s280">So, and we lived in a new ghetto which was done in the town of Tulchin, at the southeast end of the town.</span> <span id="s281">There were very dilapidated houses because, don't forget, the war went through Tulchin, so many places were somehow burned or something and there they said we should live.</span> <span id="s282">So we lived there and we--they were surrounded with barbed wire and while--we had to go to work every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">MS: Was this within the camp or you worked outside of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">SF: Outside.</span> <span id="s285">We were taken every day to a certain place to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">MS: By a guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">SF: Now I did a different work.</span> <span id="s288">I worked in the hospital.</span> <span id="s289">And I don't want to get into this here, what I did in the hospital, and, but this had nothing to do with Jews.</span> <span id="s290">We were 18 people taken every day to the hospital to do certain work there, and we were taken home every day.</span> <span id="s291">Now my wife, Gertrude, she always asked me every day "Will we survive?"</span> <span id="s292">I said "Yes, we will survive."</span> <span id="s293">I don't know why I said it and I don't know why she asked.</span> <span id="s294">She was nervous but I, to me, I saw the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s296">SF: "...all nationalities are the same.</span> <span id="s297">It doesn't make any difference which they say, and all of a sudden you go here with a swastika and you hate Jews and you kill Jews, I show you.</span> <span id="s298">And he said, "Hitler gave me the greatest thing anybody can give me.</span> <span id="s299">I have a house, I have a garden, and I have a vegetable garden and a little plot of land.</span> <span id="s300">I never dreamt I would have this and, therefore, I'm a most grateful man."</span> <span id="s301">There was a man Sonderführer Fritz von Rohde, and one day I talked with this man and he said, "I'm very worried."</span> <span id="s302">He was worried?</span> <span id="s303">He gave me a cigarette.</span> <span id="s304">I looked then at him, and he said, "I come now from Kolomyja, and this is a town in Poland, which is about 100 miles from here and he said, "I get the order to put flat 500 Jews.</span> <span id="s305">So I tell one of the boys of the Hitler Youth, "You go and count the cartridges."</span> <span id="s306">And the boy comes back and says, "Melde gehorsam, Herr Sonderführer.</span> <span id="s307">I'm telling you, Mr. Sonderführer, that we have only 380 cartridges."</span> <span id="s308">He said, "This is terrible.</span> <span id="s309">How can we shoot 500 when they give us only 380 cartridges?"</span> <span id="s310">and this young man said, "I have an idea.</span> <span id="s311">Let's shoot 380, and 120 we beat to death.</span> <span id="s312">We club them to death."</span> <span id="s313">And Sonderführer Fritz von Rohde said, "Nothing doing, I killed 25,000 Jews but I never touched a single Jew, because this is not a war against Jews.</span> <span id="s314">This is a war for humanity, as my immediate superior Eichmann said."</span> <span id="s315">That was the only time I heard the name Eichmann.</span> <span id="s316">So this was the Sonderführer Fritz von Rohde, a very cultivated, cultured man.</span> <span id="s317">Very nice man, but as you can see, the basis of their upbringing or education is, they do something for humanity.</span> <span id="s318">By that, they do it for the fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">MS: Humanity being the elimination of all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">SF: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">MS: This is humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">SF: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s323">Therefore, we should not forget, we stand here and hate and are ready to kill, look what those miserable people did.</span> <span id="s324">But don't forget those miserable people were educated and brought up for the last 2,000 years this way.</span> <span id="s325">And we are mad that such a thing happens?</span> <span id="s326">And so it is very sad because, unfortunately, we Americans did not behave very nicely during the whole activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MS: I don't follow you.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">SF: You don't follow, no?</span> <span id="s329">It is impossible that the United States did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s330">I never said, "Declare war, " God forbid, although you had to declare war.</span> <span id="s331">I say, "You should realize what's going on, and since such a thing is going on, we cannot deal with the Germans."</span> <span id="s332">What they do?</span> <span id="s333">"We cannot deal with the Poles."</span> <span id="s334">Beneš, President Beneš from Czechoslovakia came and talked to Roosevelt, Beck from Poland, the President, came and talked to Roosevelt, and they told him exactly what had happened.</span> <span id="s335">This happened from 1933, not as most of the people think 1941.</span> <span id="s336">They talked about the Iron Guard,5 and there was a man by the name of Antonescu, who was the president of Rumania.</span> <span id="s337">Now, what did he do?</span> <span id="s338">He did absolutely what Hitler told him or showed him to do.</span> <span id="s339">So, therefore, I must tell you that it is impossible that something was wrong in the war and we here don't know it.</span> <span id="s340">I have read in the New York Times, I went to the library in New York, a very short article which was written on June 18, 1941.</span> <span id="s341">You can see this article, too.</span> <span id="s342">The population of the Bukovina, which is Chernovitz, sent a telegram to Marshall Stalin to ask him to permit them to go into the interior of Russia, because they feel badly to live so close to the border.</span> <span id="s343">And after the liberation, Marshall Stalin permitted them to move to the interior.</span> <span id="s344">In New York Times, that's the reality.</span> <span id="s345">June 13, 14, 15, trucks went through the streets of our town, Chernovitz, and dragged people out of the houses, 35,000, in order to deport them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s346">I am sorry, I saw it.</span> <span id="s347">I cannot tell you what happened other town, I can tell you only what happened in this town.</span> <span id="s348">But you see what's written in the New York Times.</span> <span id="s349">So, therefore, I say that there are certain things which cannot happen, I'm talking only of Europe now, in Europe, that the United States should not know and not take action.</span> <span id="s350">By not taking action, the only action I ask for to say, I cannot deal with murderers, but they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s351">Now to go on.</span> <span id="s352">In Tulchin, with Sonderführer Fritz von Rohde, my wife was very nervous all the time--will we survive or not.</span> <span id="s353">And finally she said, "We have to hide."</span> <span id="s354">I said, "How and where can you hide?"</span> <span id="s355">I said, "Whenever the Germans leave, they exterminate the camp."</span> <span id="s356">Every camp where the Germans left, north of us, we heard through the grapevine, Uman, Giessen, Braslav–these are camps.</span> <span id="s357">All the people were plain killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s358">And anyway, so, and, while she was nervous and said, "We have to hide," I said, "Where do you want to hide?"</span> <span id="s359">She said, "Here, in this room."</span> <span id="s360">We lived 18 people.</span> <span id="s361">"Where?"</span> <span id="s362">She said, "Dig a hole."</span> <span id="s363">And she stamped with her foot.</span> <span id="s364">And we heard this hole.</span> <span id="s365">And since we were working people, so we opened the boards, and there was a little concrete and we went down.</span> <span id="s366">It was a sort of a room; it was very musty.</span> <span id="s367">That's right.</span> <span id="s368">So we slept on straw.</span> <span id="s369">Let's nail those boards together," and so we tried.</span> <span id="s370">We went down, and I checked.</span> <span id="s371">You couldn't see anything.</span> <span id="s372">Everybody in the camp, about that time we were about 500 people in the camp, everybody knew.</span> <span id="s373">Said we're crazy.</span> <span id="s374">Said, "Listen, you dig a hole in your room, you will be burning like rats.</span> <span id="s375">Best thing is you should stay outside.</span> <span id="s376">Maybe we can escape."</span> <span id="s377">O.K.</span> <span id="s378">The only day which happened that we were not taken to work, this was December 31, 1943.</span> <span id="s379">In the morning we were already lined up to go to work.</span> <span id="s380">They said, "Go back into your huts or barracks, whatever."</span> <span id="s381">And we sat there all day until next morning, and then we were taken to work.</span> <span id="s382">I never knew why.</span> <span id="s383">When I came to the United States I found out why.</span> <span id="s384">There's an Upton Sinclair book, Presidential Mission, World's End, Dragon's Teeth; it's a Lanny Budd series it's called.</span> <span id="s385">In this book I read, Hitler was near Tulchin on this day.</span> <span id="s386">Nobody was permitted to move on the street, from camp or from the people who lived there.</span> <span id="s387">Then comes a second day when we were sent home at 12 noon, because in the morning we were taken to the barracks, to make crates and to load them, and we saw most of the German trucks go west.</span> <span id="s388">So west means they are retreating.</span> <span id="s389">And while we saw this and we were doing the crates, at noon we were all taken back to the camp and, while we were taken back, I saw from outside the Rükzugs-SS, that means the storm troopers, the retreat storm troopers, came with another roll of barbed wire, so the fence was now maybe 15 feet high.</span> <span id="s390">O.K., that's it and this must be that.</span> <span id="s391">While we went into the camp, into our room--we 18 people--I heard very clearly cannons, boom, boom, pretty far.</span> <span id="s392">So I said, "It's time to go down, let's crawl down."</span></p> <p><span id="s393">MS: Into your room?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SF: Into this hole in our room, we crawled down, and we stood there.</span> <span id="s395">And all of a sudden Dr. Moser yells, "Can I come down?"</span> <span id="s396">He laughed all the time.</span> <span id="s397">"Come down, you want to die like a rat."</span> <span id="s398">Then came Herr und Frau Deligdish [phonetic].</span> <span id="s399">She was a history teacher and he was a worker at the lumber mill.</span> <span id="s400">So she came down, both came down and we saw soon enough we were standing 68 people, one next to the other.</span> <span id="s401">So we are full.</span> <span id="s402">We close the trap and we stand there.</span> <span id="s403">Dr. Fishman said, "We are here to live or to die, but if anybody opens their mouth, we'll be killed here.</span> <span id="s404">We have to stand like one person."</span> <span id="s405">And this moment we heard steps on top and we knew it right away, these are Germans.</span> <span id="s406">And since we all speak fluent German, so we heard one said, "You lie down and rest and we will do it."</span> <span id="s407">So, it was a young voice.</span> <span id="s408">They planted field cannon in front of this hut and they started shooting.</span> <span id="s409">Sound travels 333 meters a second, I started to count, 21, 22, to hear how far they aim.</span> <span id="s410">And it was Friday noon when we climbed down.</span> <span id="s411">We thought we would be there two hours, three hours.</span> <span id="s412">We stood there until Monday morning; Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</span> <span id="s413">Monday morning was March 15, 1944.</span> <span id="s414">We smelled smoke, so we knew they burned everything out, so we pushed the trap out.</span> <span id="s415">Everything was smoking, but nothing was burning in our house.</span> <span id="s416">Everything around was burning.</span> <span id="s417">The wind was blowing and so on.</span> <span id="s418">And we pushed it out, and we came out, and I stuck my head out, and there stood a little 10, 11 year old boys, dressed in long coats, with long rifles, with hats over their, I mean, this Russian hats.</span> <span id="s419">I look at them and said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s420">"No," they said, I told them the story concentration camp, they didn't have any idea what we talk.</span> <span id="s421">I said, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s422">He said, "Me, Russki partizan [phonetic]."</span> <span id="s423">He said, "We are the genuine Russian partisans; beware of imitation."</span> <span id="s424">Those kids there, with long rifles, "[unclear] Fritz, where's the Germans?"</span> <span id="s425">They called them Fritz, all the Germans.</span> <span id="s426">And one yelled, and here a German jumped on a truck, and this boy, without taking the rifle on the shoulder, shoot!</span> <span id="s427">Then they threw a grenade into the motor of the truck.</span> <span id="s428">They didn't pay much attention, so about three or four days later, the Russian army came.</span> <span id="s429">The interesting thing was, by that time, I think we were 300 in the camp.</span> <span id="s430">None of us wanted to go out through the gate or in.</span> <span id="s431">They all wanted to climb the fence.</span> <span id="s432">They tore the rags they had, they tore their bodies, but they wanted to climb the fence.</span> <span id="s433">I don't know what--the psychology--and then we went out into the town of Tulchin, but we were terribly afraid.</span> <span id="s434">We were hiding in houses but finally--the Russians were very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s435">They wanted everybody to go to the army but we were like skeletons, number one, and number two, they said, "Oh, come on, you're no good, if you are no good for the Germans, you are no good for us."</span> <span id="s436">We told them, "Jews."</span> <span id="s437">We went to the authorities, talked to them.</span> <span id="s438">A few of us got arrested, but then they let us out a day later because we were stinking too much, they said.</span> <span id="s439">And finally we got on a truck.</span> <span id="s440">Somehow we got a bottle of vodka, and we waved the vodka in front of a trunk, and the guy stopped.</span> <span id="s441">My mother, my sister, Gert, my wife, and I and two friends, we went on this truck and he took us to go south.</span> <span id="s442">And all of a sudden, in the middle of the woods, he stopped, asked us to go down to the woods, undress completely.</span> <span id="s443">He took all our miserable rags, including the shoes and left with the Russian truck.</span> <span id="s444">So we came south to a town Soroca [also spelled Soroki], which is on the Dniester River, and we came to the Dniester River.</span> <span id="s445">There were some people, many, many people from the concentration camp who survived.</span> <span id="s446">Sure, we know each other.</span> <span id="s447">My name was also known, and they came and they told us, gave us a hint how to get across the Dniester, and finally we came back to Chernovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">MS: You were able to make your way back to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">SF: Back to Chernovitz, and when we came to Chernovitz, we came into our apartment.</span> <span id="s450">The apartment was a condominium which we built.</span> <span id="s451">And they were a family in the apartment who lived next door.</span> <span id="s452">We knew them.</span> <span id="s453">They were Nazis all the time and they were terrible antisemites, and so on.</span> <span id="s454">They were very shocked to see us come back, and we told them, "But no, this is our apartment."</span> <span id="s455">He said, "Listen, if you talk very much, then we will tell the authorities you are the owner of an apartment, and then you go to Siberia."</span> <span id="s456">The ruling was that Hitler and Stalin had an agreement, whatever they find when they move into a town which was nationalized, it belongs to them.</span> <span id="s457">Now when we were deported, our house was nationalized.</span> <span id="s458">So here comes the neighbor, a good Nazi, and said, "Listen, I'm a good Nazi, I want this house."</span> <span id="s459">They said, "O.K.</span> <span id="s460">You give a token down payment, let's say a dollar," so he gives the token down payment and he's the owner of the house.</span> <span id="s461">So, therefore, Gertrude and I, we joined the Czech army right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">MS: The Czech army?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SF: The Czech army passed by, and I saw there a name of a man who I knew, and this man knew me even better, only by reputation.</span> <span id="s464">He was a composer.</span> <span id="s465">So I talked to this man and he said, "Please, by all means, come."</span> <span id="s466">And Gertrude's mother was Czech, so we joined the Czech army.</span> <span id="s467">We were fighting now the Russians, I mean the Germans, surrounded by the Russians, but provided by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s468">Into Prague, and we moved into Prague May 8, 1945, the day when the war was over.</span> <span id="s469">I became an officer.</span> <span id="s470">At night we were playing, and day we were shooting, and when I was an officer, 88 officers of the original Czech army survived this miserable war.</span> <span id="s471">Here it is here, I found a paper from the army.</span> <span id="s472">I will show you this later.</span> <span id="s473">You see, and there is something written about me, I conducted the orchestra there.</span> <span id="s474">It was during the war.</span> <span id="s475">[unclear].</span> <span id="s476">It means "Our concerts."</span> <span id="s477">And then we were received, big honor, but I saw right away it cannot go on very happily here so I tried very hard to get out, so I got out.</span> <span id="s478">We went to South America, Barranquilla, Colombia, where we stayed for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">MS: Can I ask you, your emigration then was from Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">SF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">MS: How did you come, regarding a passport and funds, and the ability to leave at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SF: The army provided passport, clothes, food, and officer salary.</span> <span id="s483">Now, first we were soldiers, but I became an officer, my wife became a sergeant, and, then, after the war was over, we were discharged and we got some money.</span> <span id="s484">But money is the most unimportant thing there.</span> <span id="s485">The means how to get out, and there was a group of Belgian soldiers who were fighting with the Czechs.</span> <span id="s486">They took us along, and we climbed under the benches in the truck, and that is the way we got out.</span> <span id="s487">Then we came to Paris.</span> <span id="s488">In Paris we waited six months for a possibility of a boat getting out, but Gertrude, my wife, has an uncle in Barranquilla in South America, and sent him a telegram, and two days later a visa was waiting for us with a little money.</span> <span id="s489">So then we cross the ocean by boat, only for army personnel.</span> <span id="s490">There were no civilians on this boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">MS: What became of the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">SF: My mother and my sister, when the Russians came in, we all came out, they went south to Bucharest, and from Bucharest they went into a DP camp in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s493">Now do you know what's a DP camp?</span> <span id="s494">A displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s495">Why is there such a camp?</span> <span id="s496">How come these camps?</span> <span id="s497">The reason for the displaced person camp was that most of the Jews who came home were told, "Get the hell out of here, or I tell the authorities."</span> <span id="s498">And they were running.</span> <span id="s499">Most of those people were running away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s500">They didn't feel so much Jewish or anything, they felt like animals who were treated less than a louse.</span> <span id="s501">And they wanted, "Just please, let me live, that's all I want.</span> <span id="s502">I do anything you want, if you let me live.</span> <span id="s503">But let me live like a human being, not like an animal in the camp."</span> <span id="s504">So, therefore, these were the DP camps.</span> <span id="s505">It is very unfortunate that I was in Paris at the HIAS.6 I was in uniform and I didn't need any help.</span> <span id="s506">I never got any help and I never wanted any help.</span> <span id="s507">So when I came to the HIAS I could see how impossible it is to be just, to help this person or that person.</span> <span id="s508">You don't know.</span> <span id="s509">But they helped very much the DP people to cross the ocean to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s510">But don't forget, Jews are as human as anybody else, so they have the same characteristic, and, therefore, they got out.</span> <span id="s511">And when we came to the United States, and here I will finish very soon.</span> <span id="s512">I started to drive.</span> <span id="s513">I played first the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra in Philadelphia, and then Mitropoulos engaged me to come to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s514">When I came here, it took me two days to get a job, two days, I played.</span> <span id="s515">And then I started to drive, and one day, when I came back to this territory, to the east, from Minneapolis, I had to come to the George Washington Bridge, and the bridge was a beautiful Bild [picture].</span> <span id="s516">I saw, I saw it was wonderful; the closer I came, the bigger the bridge became, and I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s517">While I drove onto the bridge here at the toll booth, a man stuck his hand out, and I said, "Mister, who built the bridge?"</span> <span id="s518">He looked at me, like I'm crazy.</span> <span id="s519">"Fifty cents!"</span> <span id="s520">I said, "Who built it?"</span> <span id="s521">He grabbed my fifty cents, a car behind me honking like mad, so he didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s522">I go on the right side, turn to the right.</span> <span id="s523">I come West Side River Emergency Parking.</span> <span id="s524">I go into the emergency parking, get out and look at the bridge.</span> <span id="s525">The bridge is even more beautiful on this side.</span> <span id="s526">I said, "Hey, Gertrude, look!"</span> <span id="s527">A policeman comes and says, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s528">"I'm looking at the bridge."</span> <span id="s529">"Something wrong with you?"</span> <span id="s530">"No."</span> <span id="s531">"No, you can't park
