id="s3">A: William Ned Cartledge</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: And your address.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: It’s 1271 Vista Valley Drive Q: And date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: October 1, 1916.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: How old were you at the time of the liberation of the camp?</span> <span id="s8">A: About 30 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And, at the beginning of the war, what were your career goals?</span> <span id="s10">What were you planning on doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was in the cotton business, and I had planned to pursue the field of cotton merchandising.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What is your present occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I am a salesman with Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And what was your military unit at the time you went into the camp?</span> <span id="s15">A: The 89th Chemical Mortar Battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And your rank at that time?</span> <span id="s17">A: A First Lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Now you are going to tell me which camps you went into.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: The first time I witnessed anything of this nature was at a place called Gardelegen, an incident which was reported, I believe, in Life Magazine.</span> <span id="s20">After I came home from overseas, I did see some of the pictures of the Gardelegen incident, but these photographs that I have here are the ones that some of the fellows in my outfit took.</span> <span id="s21">Not me personally, but we developed them ourselves since they weren't what you would call top notch photographs, but they do record some of the horrors of these things.</span> <span id="s22">And the Gardelegen incident was a case where the Germans had about 500 political prisoners and as the Allies moved in, they were moving these prisoners back so they wouldn't be liberated by the Allies.</span> <span id="s23">I don't know why this particular group was so important to them, but anyway they got to the point where they couldn't continue to carry these political prisoners so they just decided to exterminate them.</span> <span id="s24">I don’t know exactly who they were but we were told at the time that they were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s25">So they put them in this airplane hangar in the small airstrip in which there was straw on the floor, covered with oil, and they put them in there and set the straw on fire, and as the people tried to break out of the building, they were machine-gunned down.</span> <span id="s26">At the time we got there, the bodies were stacked up six or seven deep, mostly concentrated at the doors.</span> <span id="s27">Most of their clothing was burned from their bodies there and they were laying there.</span> <span id="s28">The Army came in and made the local German citizens in that area bury the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What kind of reaction did the German local citizens have to what they were seeing at this incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: It seemed to be a very matter of fact type of thing.</span> <span id="s31">I was told that one German refused to bury these people and he ran and he was shot by one of the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s32">I didn't actually see the incident, but that was told to me when we went down to visit this particular spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: How many people were burned in this hangar?</span> <span id="s34">A: About 500.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And how long after the incident did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We arrived probably the next day after it had occurred, but we came back on the second day to take the pictures.</span> <span id="s37">Some of the bodies had already been removed when we took the pictures themselves, but there were still quite a few bodies there.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Is there any other information around this particular incident that you want to be sure and include?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No.</span> <span id="s40">We just happened on it by accident.</span> <span id="s41">We weren't sent.</span> <span id="s42">With Ludwigslust, which was an actual concentration camp with buildings and barracks provided for prisoners, it was different.</span> <span id="s43">They asked if any of us wanted to go there to witness this.</span> <span id="s44">At that time we were attached to the 82nd Airborne, and, as a matter of fact, they encouraged us to go so that we would get some nature of the enemy which we were fighting.</span> <span id="s45">The war was not over at this time, and naturally they were interested in impressing on the American soldier the nature of the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You say "they?"</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Our command.</span> <span id="s48">I am assuming it came down from somewhere to our battalion commander who passed the orders on to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: About what date was it that you went into Ludwigslust ?</span> <span id="s50">A: Ludwigslust was probably, I'd say, in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Of 1945, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: The Americans had moved in prior to your arriving there?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">I was not one of the first soldiers there, but there were still a number of prisoners there.</span> <span id="s56">I was appalled at the appearance of these people who seemed oblivious to everything.</span> <span id="s57">They just sat around up against the walls with big, glassy eyes staring at us, and there were ambulances coming to take them away.</span> <span id="s58">In talking with some of the medical personnel, this one doctor told me that probably not many of them would survive, that their condition was so bad.</span> <span id="s59">They had been in starvation so long that probably not many of them would survive even though they were living at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What did they look like to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: They were just almost like skin and bones.</span> <span id="s62">They had on their traditional striped uniform even though some of the uniforms were torn and worn, and you could see the bones, like at the knees, which were just like a big knot in the bones.</span> <span id="s63">Skin and bones so to speak.</span> <span id="s64">And the faces just real thin and emaciated looking and cheeks hollow, and the thing that impressed me most was the large eyes.</span> <span id="s65">They just almost looked through you.</span> <span id="s66">They didn't look at you, they didn’t seem to be aware of us walking around looking at this place.</span> <span id="s67">Inside some of these buildings was a type of latrine which was very primitive.</span> <span id="s68">It was just like a big concrete pit, even though it was built up from the floor, and it only had like two logs or two rails across the top for seating.</span> <span id="s69">One of the soldiers there told us that they had talked with one of the prisoners and he said that the prisoners were quite ill and frequently they would be up on these poles and the Germans would come through and push them off into this cesspool.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What else did you see at that camp?</span> <span id="s71">What did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: It was almost incomprehensible that one human would do another one that way.</span> <span id="s73">It was hard to comprehend and hard part to sink in and to understand why people would do things like that, but there it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">There was no contradiction as to what happened there.</span> <span id="s75">I mean it was evident to those of us who saw it, and I saw enough that I didn't want to see much more of it.</span> <span id="s76">But near there supposedly was another camp.</span> <span id="s77">I didn't see it but some of the other fellows in my outfit saw and reported it.</span> <span id="s78">They said it was for Jewish women only, and apparently they were still inside this enclosure, even though the Americans had just arrived there.</span> <span id="s79">Nobody had let them out or anything.</span> <span id="s80">They were starving practically, and the soldiers said they had some K rations and things and they threw them over the fence.</span> <span id="s81">There was a mad dash for these things.</span> <span id="s82">Candies and anything that they had they threw into the fence to these people.</span> <span id="s83">They apparently had been without food for quite a number of days, but had not been released from the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">The Germans had a lot of prisoners from other countries who worked on the farms, who were not imprisoned, and who seemed to be quite content with their role.</span> <span id="s85">Maybe they knew there would not be much chance of their escaping from Germany, but these people in this general area didn't seem to be disturbed by these incidents.</span> <span id="s86">What few we came in contact with didn’t seem to know much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: The people that lived there or were working there?</span> <span id="s88">A: The slave laborer.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: That were not in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: That were not in the camps.</span> <span id="s91">They didn't seem to be aware too much about what was going on in the camps and the nature of the treatment of these people.</span> <span id="s92">We counted a few of them that did speak some English; as a matter of fact, one man had worked at the Ford Motor Co. in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s93">He was a Yugoslavian and he had been home some time prior to the war.</span> <span id="s94">When the war broke out, they conscripted him into the Yugoslav Army, and he was captured by the Germans and made a farm laborer.</span> <span id="s95">But he didn't seem to be aware of much of the nature of what was going on around.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What was your reaction and the reaction of the men in your unit when you went into the camp to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I think most of them were just shocked beyond belief.</span> <span id="s98">They just couldn't comprehend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A We talked about it some, and especially when we had the pictures made, but most people would more or less just shake their heads.</span> <span id="s101">It was almost inconceivable that this could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: When you did talk about it, the little bit that you did talk about, what kind of things did you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Average soldier things.</span> <span id="s104">We’d say, “Can you imagine those sons of a ?</span> <span id="s105">They were just horrified by the treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: How do you feel about the prisoners that were in the camp?</span> <span id="s107">These skeletons that you described.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: There really isn't any way to describe it except that it was just something that was almost unbelievable.</span> <span id="s109">That's about all.</span> <span id="s110">It’s been quite a long time ago.</span> <span id="s111">Maybe I could have described my feelings a little better then, but it was absolutely revolting.</span> <span id="s112">I just couldn't really couldn't grasp it all.</span> <span id="s113">I have never forgotten the appearance of those people that just sat along the walls, propped up against the walls and just sat there, didn't move, didn’t say anything to anyone, just sat there.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: When you use the word "revolting", you are talking about the situation or the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Towards the situation more than anything else.</span> <span id="s116">I only had sympathy for the people, but it was a little late for that.</span> <span id="s117">Even though I realized what a terrible experience they had, they were beyond the point of my help.</span> <span id="s118">Medical help would probably help some of them, but a medical officer told me a lot of them would never survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s120">We talked about your being at the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">When was the first time you recall hearing about these?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A. I think pretty much having read in the paper prior to going overseas.</span> <span id="s123">I remember hearing about concentration camps probably well long before I was ever in the Army, but it didn't really make a lot of impression on me at the time because there was not any vivid details given of these camps.</span> <span id="s124">I didn’t hear anything about the quantities of the numbers of people that were involved.</span> <span id="s125">I didn't imagine that it was in the millions.</span> <span id="s126">I thought maybe a few thousand something.</span> <span id="s127">I don't think many people in this country knew, but I realized that it was going on and to some extent the nature of Hitler’s German government.</span> <span id="s128">I, frankly, am not one of the ones who say well, this was only the Nazis and maybe a lot of good Germans had to do this and had to do that, because they were ordered to.</span> <span id="s129">I have not quite excused the German people as a whole for these atrocities myself.</span> <span id="s130">That may be a prejudiced or unfair view, but that's still my point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: You condemn the whole German people for this kind of thing?</span> <span id="s132">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: From what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A Yes, I am sure there were some people who couldn't help it, but I am sure there were a lot of people who could have had some influence that didn't make any attempt to do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: You think more, perhaps, could have been done than actually was?</span> <span id="s136">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So you knew something about the camps.</span> <span id="s138">You had heard and read before you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And yet I am getting the impression that what you saw and what you expected to see were two different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes .</span> <span id="s142">I was not prepared for that type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: You have already told me about what the prisoners did, about how they just ignored you.</span> <span id="s144">Were there any German guards left there when you reached the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No., I didn't see any of the Germans there.</span> <span id="s146">I am sure they had left before the troops got there, because Ludwigslust is across the Elbe River and the Germans didn't want to be captured by the Russians and they fled by the thousands .</span> <span id="s147">We just met them by the thousands coming to the river.</span> <span id="s148">There were only military pontoon bridges there and the Americans wouldn't let them cross the river.</span> <span id="s149">And they were just like for miles and miles, all along the banks of the river there.</span> <span id="s150">I had one picture which was taken from the Saturday Evening Post in describing this exodus.</span> <span id="s151">I was in this particular area when this picture was taken right here.</span> <span id="s152">They came by the thousands.</span> <span id="s153">I don't know if this is pertinent to the situation, but we had one officer of Polish background and he held great hostility towards the Germans.</span> <span id="s154">When they’d ride along in their bicycles, he and one of our sergeants would go out there and take their bicycles away from them and make them walk.</span> <span id="s155">He’d throw the bicycle over to the side and tell them to get on down the road.</span> <span id="s156">We weren’t trying to take the prisoners.</span> <span id="s157">They were just going to go to one area.</span> <span id="s158">They were told to go to one area and stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: He didn't have much sympathy for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: He didn’t have much sympat hy.</span> <span id="s161">He didn’t want them to ride, he wanted them to walk, and any that complained he gave them a good boot and sent them on down the road.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t remember if he had been to the concentration camp before this or afterwards, but some of the soldiers had very definite feelings against the Germans and would probably have inflicted some form of physical punishment on them if it had been left to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What was the source of these ill feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Just the general nature of the Germans themselves.</span> <span id="s165">The soldiers had learned of things, learned about the nature of things and the Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: The nature of what things?</span> <span id="s167">I would like you to give some specifics.</span> <span id="s168">I know what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Perhaps having heard of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s170">Not actually seeing them at this time, but they had seen the Gardelegen incident.</span> <span id="s171">This was after the Gardelegen incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: The Gardelegen incident was where they burned the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes, this was before we viewed the Ludwigslust thing.</span> <span id="s174">We saw the Ludwigslust camp probably more towards April.</span> <span id="s175">The Gardelegen thing was probably in early March.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: You received some negative reactions from some of the enlisted men toward the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes, and as I said one of the officers was of Polish background.</span> <span id="s178">He was quite bitter towards the Germans and he wanted to wreak a little vengeance on them if he had had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s179">Of course, military law would have forbid it, but he got by with as much of it as he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: You said earlier that the higher ups, the officers, sort of wanted the men [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I think it came down from the higher command that the men shouldn't be ordered to go, but should be encouraged to go so that they could see the nature of these things and remember them.</span> <span id="s182">The war wasn't over then.</span> <span id="s183">I am sure the higher command wanted the soldiers to be well aware of the nature of the enemy.</span> <span id="s184">I think in some ways Americans always kind of had admiration for the Germans -- their scientific knowledge and intellectual contributions to the world.</span> <span id="s185">And to see the other side of the people was what the command had in mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you have any other contact with the German civilians, other than knowing that they were involved in burying some of the survivors of this other place?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, being the Executive Officer of my company, it was my job to get housing.</span> <span id="s188">When we'd move into an area where Germans were living, it was my job to pick out the houses that we wanted the troops to occupy, and the German civilians couldn't stay in the houses that we were occupying and had to leave.</span> <span id="s189">Sometimes you encountered people who seemed to have a fear of you as a soldier.</span> <span id="s190">But generally speaking, I don't believe the German civilians really feared the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s191">But they very definitely feared the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You make a distinction between the feelings of the German soldiers and the German people and the Russians.</span> <span id="s193">What was the feeling of the German soldiers towards the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I didn’t have really enough contact with them to know, because by the time we would get there, the Germans would already be gone.</span> <span id="s195">Once or twice we picked up a few prisoners around in farmhouses and things like that, but we actually didn't encounter a lot.</span> <span id="s196">There was one instance when we did go to one farmhouse where the prisoners were hiding.</span> <span id="s197">This was down below Essen.</span> <span id="s198">We had bivouacked near a cemetery.</span> <span id="s199">We always liked to go around and pick up a few fresh eggs and maybe a little wine, if we could find it.</span> <span id="s200">My company commander and I went down to the cemetery and we went over to a nice little cottage which was outside the confines of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s201">It was a beautifully landscaped cemetery, almost like a park, and as I was walking along under the low hanging branches of a tree, I saw some fresh earth.</span> <span id="s202">So I went over there to see what could be buried there.</span> <span id="s203">I started sort of poking around in there and I came on a bayonet hidden in there.</span> <span id="s204">When I took the bayonet and started digging, I found ammunition and pistols and rifles and things wrapped up in cloth.</span> <span id="s205">I didn't think anything about it, but I did take the bayonet with me.</span> <span id="s206">I went to this house and when I walked in there with that bayonet, the older man there, who was probably around 70 years old, obviously recognized it.</span> <span id="s207">I didn't connect it with him at all, but he was frightened and the women in that house were absolutely frightened to death of us.</span> <span id="s208">They were shaking they were so frightened.</span> <span id="s209">It turns out there was what they call the Volkstrum which was the People's Army which was to resist the Allies.</span> <span id="s210">Even though Germany was conquered, they were making provisions for them to continue to resist the Allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: The people may have been a part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes, and they were probably the ones who hid these rifles and pistols and ammunition over there in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s213">They thought that we were coming for them, but we weren’t.</span> <span id="s214">We were looking for eggs and wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: After having visited Ludwigslust and after having see burned bodies at the airstrip, was there any particular reaction you noticed from some of the men you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: No, other than the comments.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: But I am talking about beyond that point in time.</span> <span id="s218">Did they have any difficulty in dealing with that experience in any way that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Not that I was aware of, really.</span> <span id="s220">There was a comment about it almost to the point of disbelief, but there was some cursing every once in awhile about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: It came up from time to time, even after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, yes at times, but as I recall there wasn't a great deal of conversation about it.</span> <span id="s223">Those people, hard as it was to accept, they accepted it, didn't have too much comment about it.</span> <span id="s224">My outfit has a reunion every year.</span> <span id="s225">I haven't been every time, but usually someone brings their album, and there will be some of these pictures in there, and they will make comments about it or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So you have had some opportunity to talk about this in more recent years with some of the same men?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes, just this past summer we had our reunion in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and there were two or three fellows who brought their albums along.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't bring mine along, but we were looking through them, commenting on the things, and said you remember this and you remember that.</span> <span id="s229">Not any one of them have forgotten it.</span> <span id="s230">I’ll put it that way.</span> <span id="s231">Not any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Prior to coming back from the war, did you write hom about what you had seen at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: It just wasn’t anything that I really wanted to.</span> <span id="s236">I told about it after I got back home and I had the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Who did you tell then?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I told my mother and father and my sister who was still living at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: You talked about it with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes, I talked about it with my family but not a great deal.</span> <span id="s241">The pictures were shown and they realized how horrible it was.</span> <span id="s242">I think it is sometimes hard for them to comprehend.</span> <span id="s243">Even seeing it, it’s hard to</span></p> <p><span id="s244">comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: What was your purpose when you cam e home in sharing this with your family and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I suppose just to let them see the nature of things that happened sometimes in the world .</span> <span id="s247">I didn't think it out beforehand.</span> <span id="s248">It was just matter of fact exposure of them to these pictures and things and I have had people since then say "I don't want to look at it" and “How horrible.</span> <span id="s249">But they don't pursue it much further.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Why are you willing to talk about this now to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I heard your appeal on television and to me it was an unforgettable thing and I just thought if I could make some small contribution to the program that I would be happy to.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: It’s unforgettable for you.</span> <span id="s253">What is the message for other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: The message for other people is we don't want to ever suppose that people are not capable of very inhumane treatment of other people, that you can’t assume that everybody is going to treat every one else like they’d like to be treated, and that as a result of political propaganda and other types of propaganda, an entire people can be persuaded to commit quite terrible things.</span> <span id="s255">Maybe a social atrocity so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Are you aware that there are some people that don't believe this really happened?</span> <span id="s257">They think it's propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I suppose there could be some people, but it woul d have to be a very ignorant person, a very prejudiced type of person.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Prejudiced meaning they just don't want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No, they don't want to believe that.</span> <span id="s261">They think, as you say, it’s a lot of</span></p> <p><span id="s262">propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: I thought I’d just throw that in.</span> <span id="s264">It’s hard for me to believe too.</span> <span id="s265">Did you consider yourself a religious person at the time you viewed these things in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: That is a hard definition, I would have to get your definition of religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Within your definition.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I am a Unitarian, and I consider myself a religious person in the sense that I do have moral values and I do believe that as a people we must have moral values to survive and get along in the world and I do believe that if Americans are guilty or were guilty of the same thing, it would be part my guilt too.</span> <span id="s269">I do social commentary woodcarvings, and I did a thing on the Calley incident in the Viet Nam War, which was a little bit different.</span> <span id="s270">A similar thing in a way, because the reaction that a lot of people in this country had to Calley's killing those people was that it was all right because in the first place, they were not our kind of people, and secondly they were Communists, and that it is all right to kill people that are not our kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And you think the same kind of thing was true in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes, because the Jewish people were not true Germans.</span> <span id="s273">It was all right to kill them.</span> <span id="s274">And I think we are not too civilized ourselves.</span> <span id="s275">I think Calley was singled out probably and he probably didn’t get the punishment he deserved, but at the same time, he got more punishment than a lot of other people who I’m sure did things as bad as he did.</span> <span id="s276">I think the statement that this Captain who prosecuted Calley made with reference to this was great.</span> <span id="s277">I kept it for a long time -- it was a clipping out a magazine -- but I’ve lost it since.</span> <span id="s278">He was calling to our attention that if we have any moral values at all, we must punish people who do things like that, even though it was done as an act of war.</span> <span id="s279">He was saying we cannot tolerate people who commit those type of atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: And you kind of identify with that?</span> <span id="s281">A: I identify with that completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Do you think you are perhaps more religious in that sense today than you were in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: That is a matter of degree and that is....</span> <span id="s284">Q: A hard question.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: A hard question, because I could never be that cruel.</span> <span id="s286">I don’t have that kind of feeling towards people.</span> <span id="s287">Sometimes I get upset with people, but I certainly don't hold grudges against them over a long period of time.</span> <span id="s288">I do not hold a personal grudge against the German people, but I still think they were responsible and should be held accountable for the conduct of their country.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Just as you said you feel the guilt as an American of an American’s conduct?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Quite a statement.</span> <span id="s292">You touched a little bit on the Viet Nam War and related incidents to Germany.</span> <span id="s293">What about something like the civil rights movement?</span> <span id="s294">Do your experiences in Germany affect your thinking about the civil rights movement in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I have always been regarded as a liberal and I am still of the opinion that people should have equal rights under the law.</span> <span id="s296">But I realize too that we are not perfect and, as a matter of fact, I think now there is as much prejudice against black people because of the pressure that has been brought on by the government in job situations in particular, where black people have been promoted over capable white people.</span> <span id="s297">I think the job should go to the most capable person, white or black, and I don't believe that to promote a person who is not capable because they are black or Spanish-American is any more fair than it was when we didn't promote a black person because he was black.</span> <span id="s298">I think it is the same type situation, and I firmly believe that if that policy is continued the prejudice against the black people will continue to grow.</span> <span id="s299">It is not being solved by the fact that you got a certain number of black people in high management as opposed to ten years ago or fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s300">There are lot of capable black people who are doing good jobs in management situations.</span> <span id="s301">There are also some who don't belong in those situations, and that's the situation that these people that I talk with every day will tell you.</span> <span id="s302">Being a salesman in Sears hardware department, you don't get to talk to people very long at times, but it doesn't take them long to tell you just about where they stand on situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You’re seeing that the so called "reverse discrimination" is creating as much dissension as the other side of the coin -- segregation</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And you see this as a danger to our political system?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I am no prophet, but I think if we were to have a severe depression, in which a lot of people were out of jobs, you'd see the Klan increase considerably and would see a lot more of the type of activity that the</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Klan participates in.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Are you saying that in bad times a scapegoat is needed.</span> <span id="s309">A: Yes, that's what I'm saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Is this what happened in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yes, I think that was true, I really do.</span> <span id="s312">In other words, it's easier to get crowds to hate somebody than it is to love them.</span> <span id="s313">You can get up a crowd to go hate somebody or participate in some kind of violent group, but it is sometimes pretty hard to get a crowd to go out and do some good somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: I’m goingng to turn this tape over, and we will go on and do the other side.</span> <span id="s315">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s317">Conversation continues on Side Two as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: [Unintelligible] if one of your children said to you they want to join the Nazi Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I just don't believe that my children do that.</span> <span id="s320">Iwould want them to explain why.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: What kind of things would you say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: As parents we are very open discussing things of this nature, and we're just like everybody else.</span> <span id="s323">We do make jokes about the blacks and ethnic groups at times.</span> <span id="s324">We are all guilty of that, but we understand what the nature of our joke is about.</span> <span id="s325">We don't think that that should be part of our attitude and treatment of these people, and I'll say this about Jewish people.</span> <span id="s326">They tell more stories relating to Jewish people than anybody else.</span> <span id="s327">They can laugh at themselves, because they are great comics of the world.</span> <span id="s328">I heard somebody say you have to have experienced or witnessed tragedy before you can be a good comic.</span> <span id="s329">But at the same time, I believe my children would not ever come into the Nazi Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: It's kind of a hard question for you to answer.</span> <span id="s331">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you see the situation that was happening in Germany in the camps as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: To me it was primarily, but there were other people involved.</span> <span id="s334">I was told a lot of these people that were in this Gardelegen incident were not primarily Jewish people, but were Dutch or French, or people in their political life who were opposed to the German occupation and resisted the German occupations and didn't cooperate with the German occupation.</span> <span id="s335">I think the Germans didn't want to release them even though by the time of the Gardelegen incident, the Germans were pretty sure that they had lost the war.</span> <span id="s336">They could have just as easily released them and let them go back toward the Allied lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Why do you think the Germans didn't want to let them get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Because I think they felt that they were their enemies and would be their enemies in the future and they wanted to exterminate them.</span> <span id="s339">They were tired of hauling them around, and I don't exactly know how to describe the attitude they had toward people not of their own kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">They were not of any value to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Did what you saw in the camp leave you with the need to insure to do something today to make sure something like this doesn't happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">This is what I do in my art work.</span> <span id="s344">This is one of the voices I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: I would like to read that when finished</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I am not an articulate person, not a great speaker.</span> <span id="s347">I can't get up before a group and expound my ideas about things, but through my art work I can.</span> <span id="s348">I do social commentary type things though and this was one small voice that I had.</span> <span id="s349">Though I’ve won maybe three awards from my art work, it is not the kind of art work that's on display at every place you go.</span> <span id="s350">I have art work that's won awards that I have stored out there in the back.</span> <span id="s351">I have pictures of it.</span> <span id="s352">One of my pieces won an award at the Arts Festival of Atlanta, and it has been on display two or three times in public places.</span> <span id="s353">But that's my small voice, and I am still pursuing that even though woodcarving takes considerable more time than a painting does of that nature.</span> <span id="s354">I remember having read somewhere, maybe in Art in America, several years ago about an art critic who said "artists didn't do enough social commentary things."</span> <span id="s355">As a matter of fact the man who made the statement was the man who was the judge of the Arts Festival in Atlanta when they purchased my piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Your social commentary piece.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">I don't have a picture of it, which I wish I did.</span> <span id="s359">Judy Alexander is going to have a show of my work in the next two or three months and maybe one in New York too.</span> <span id="s360">Art shows are commercial enterprises and they need to earn money, but I don't think my work is going to be the kind of stuff that sells to the public, because it is not living room art.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Seems like you don’t want to let go of it anyway.</span> <span id="s362">Did you do anything on the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Couldn't quite handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: No, I haven't come up with the right kind of idea for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Before we finish our tape, is there anything that you wanted to tell me today that we haven’t touched on, is there anything you want to add to what we have discussed so far?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, but I do believe that your project is worthwhile in that we should keep alive the idea that all of us are responsible, that you can't say those were the Nazis who did this or that in this country it is the Klan who is doing that, or that's some other group other than me, and I think that is the important thing.</span> <span id="s368">We must, as horrible as it is, remind people that it's pretty easy to get a group to go off to hate somebody and to do injury to somebody who is not their own kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: I thank you, Mr. Cartledge, for all you shared with us today .</span></p></body></html>
