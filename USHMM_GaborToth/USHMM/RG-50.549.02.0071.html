from a book I wrote it down, and I was reading and studying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I had everything in the kitchen written down, thank you --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I had to, I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: You made little signs for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes, I had to.</span> <span id="s629">My husband learned English quicker than I am, because he was working with people.</span> <span id="s630">But I did, too.</span> <span id="s631">I was not embarrass, I was not -- it didn’t feel -- you know, nobody was condescending me.</span> <span id="s632">They were listening to me.</span> <span id="s633">So I repeat, and repeat until it came out right.</span> <span id="s634">People were very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Great, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: The first time when I went shopping, I have to tell you, was a market.</span> <span id="s637">I was waiting for the guy to give me something, so whatever he gave it to me, I brought it back to him, I said, “No good, no good,” because -- so he said, “You pick up yourself.”</span> <span id="s638">And I couldn’t understand what he was telling me, so he took mine hand and said pick, and put it, there is, you know, and that’s how I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: And later I be -- wa -- became friends with very nice people, and I just spoke English to, and that’s how I picked up.</span> <span id="s641">And I had another German girlfriend from here who spoke beautiful English, and she said, “Sonia, I’m gonna help you.”</span> <span id="s642">And that’s, you know, it helped me t -- every little bit helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s644">You obviously learned, probably from your parents, to have an open mind, and an open heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Because you were not mistrustful.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, I -- I -- I’m still trustful.</span> <span id="s648">I give everybody the benefit of the doubt.</span> <span id="s649">That’s how you say it?</span> <span id="s650">Unti -- but people are nice to me, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s651">Knock -- knock on wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: But considering what -- those four years, what you went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: -- it would not be surprising if you had become some other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I -- some people -- I t -- I -- I -- I could no -- I --I don’t have the nature.</span> <span id="s656">I -- I don’t think -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s657">Even when I was in concentration camp, some people were nice to me.</span> <span id="s658">They even -- I tr -- you know, that I was step dancing.</span> <span id="s659">When I was in Landsberg in the kid’s concentration camp, I wa -- I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I want to go ho -- to mine parents.</span> <span id="s660">I couldn’t -- I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s661">And two girl -- my mother has two girlfriends who were in concentration camp with me, too.</span> <span id="s662">So you can imagine I always run to them for them to tell me something about my mother.</span> <span id="s663">And whenever they were talking about it, they light up.</span> <span id="s664">They were -- because I -- she was -- she was wonderful.</span> <span id="s665">And -- and -- so I said to myself, what can I do?</span> <span id="s666">My -- my -- my mother always said to me, “You have to live.</span> <span id="s667">You have to live.</span> <span id="s668">You have to do everything to live.”</span> <span id="s669">So I remember I said, I don’t have any profession, I don’t know anything, no skill, but I know how to dance and sing.</span> <span id="s670">And I was singing, and s-singing to me -- and -- and nobody saw me, you know.</span> <span id="s671">And everybody was think that I lost my mind, because if they would catch me, I would get some beating.</span> <span id="s672">And that’s how it start, and you know, it -- it went -- when you sing, when you happy, it -- forgot the word -- it reflects on other people, yes?</span> <span id="s673">And everybody starts.</span> <span id="s674">We had -- ha -- very bad time, it was horrible for us, although --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And you were singing --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: -- for people in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s679">And other people are singing too, because they knew how to sing.</span> <span id="s680">And we si -- we form a little group, so every -- when everyone had -- we had a little time, we were singing and tap dancing for them.</span> <span id="s681">Even when I went to the holox -- Holocaust reunion, were people there who remembered those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: And I was talking to a lady, and I look at her, and I talk to her, and she told me her name, and I didn’t know who she was.</span> <span id="s684">And I told her my name, she kissed me and I kissed her back, but I didn’t -- later when she said she was in the same concentration camp I was -- you know, it’s so many years, you don’t want to -- you -- you -- you don’t want to remember all those bad things, but that -- it stays -- sticks with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: People said and -- it will go away.</span> <span id="s687">It doesn’t go away.</span> <span id="s688">When it’s good, we remember.</span> <span id="s689">When our baby’s born, we remember.</span> <span id="s690">When I go to the cemetery sometimes, you know, because I sometimes do, put some flowers, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: When you -- when you were in Landsberg, and then when you came to the United States, were you looking for relatives during that time, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I knew that I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s693">My husband didn’t want to look for anybody, because he said -- people were telling us, they are going to think that you want money from them.</span> <span id="s694">But my husband had some relatives, I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: But you -- you knew that nobody had survived in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: No, I knew.</span> <span id="s697">Because when I was in Poland, I was looking, too.</span> <span id="s698">I went to Kraków, through the rad -- on the rad --

the bookkeeper, but I’m learning, and I told him to please, if I do mistake, write me a note.</span> <span id="s1233">He said I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s1234">So I’m grateful for it, too, learning something.</span> <span id="s1235">It’s never too late, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1237">Let me ask you about for the last 20 years or so, in this country, since the late 70’s, early 80’s, there’s been a lot of awareness here about the Holocaust, and me -- much more films, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: -- books, articles, it’s everywhere now.</span> <span id="s1240">For a long time you didn’t know too much about it, at least not in a public way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yes, I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yes, they were telling us in the Jewish center, and I read some books, too.</span> <span id="s1244">But I mean, I’m grateful for it, that they wrote, but you know, you have to feel it on your own self.</span> <span id="s1245">What people who -- some -- people understand.</span> <span id="s1246">Some people say never happen.</span> <span id="s1247">I don’t fight with them.</span> <span id="s1248">Fine.</span> <span id="s1249">But a guy came to mine shop, and we were talking, and he said, because I have little things written down on cards, and hang up every place -- something from the Torah, something how you should, aw -- beautiful things.</span> <span id="s1250">We talk, and he ask me, “How long are you in America?”</span> <span id="s1251">I said, “A few years.”</span> <span id="s1252">I said, “I’m longer than you are, and you speak better English than I do.”</span> <span id="s1253">So an -- and you -- because you were lucky, you went to school here, you know, and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1254">I was deny -- we -- we were denying to go to school when we were young, too.</span> <span id="s1255">So we were starting talking, and talking, and he ask me why -- I told him I came here after the war in 1949.</span> <span id="s1256">He was a little bit older than I, and so he said to me, “Where were you?”</span> <span id="s1257">So I said, “I am a survivor from those death camps.”</span> <span id="s1258">“You are really?”</span> <span id="s1259">I said, “Yes, I’m really.”</span> <span id="s1260">And my husband has, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: A number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Well, he asked me where’s your number, I said I didn’t have a number, I just had a little thing like the soldiers, fifty th -- 53354, my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: You had it on a brace -- on a necklace?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: On a little things -- no, a little something hanging, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Uh-huh, but you didn’t have it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Later, they took it away from me because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: You didn’t have a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No, not a tattoo.</span> <span id="s1269">Well, we’re talking and talking, and he looked at me, said, “Is it really true?”</span> <span id="s1270">You know, I said, “I had a mother, and a father and a brother, and a family, and uncles, and aunts, and friends, and teachers.</span> <span id="s1271">It’s true.”</span> <span id="s1272">He looked at me, he said, “Because people were telling me, and I didn’t believe them.”</span> <span id="s1273">I said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s1274">“Because they were pushing it on me.”</span> <span id="s1275">I said, “They didn’t push it on you, they were maybe [indecipherable] I would think, but it’s true.”</span> <span id="s1276">He said, “You know, I believe you.”</span> <span id="s1277">I said, “Okay, thank you.”</span> <span id="s1278">And then he -- “I wish I would have -- I would tell you that it never happened, but it did happen.”</span> <span id="s1279">He kissed me, and he thanked me, and he went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: This was just a man that came into your store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1282">Now he comes in from time to time.</span> <span id="s1283">That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: But in these years -- in these last 20 years, a lot of survivors have been getting together?</span> <span id="s1285">In groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: No, no, it’s -- no-not -- not -- not here in Richmond, because many passed away, and a few are -- we talk to each other from time to time.</span> <span id="s1287">We went to weddings of the children, to -- to 50 wedding anniversary, and it’s nice, but you know, everybody has a life, and they are busy.</span> <span id="s1288">But when we see each other we are very happy to see each other.</span> <span id="s1289">But with some you make friends, with some -- like I vi -- like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Have you been -- so you have not been active in any kind of survivor’s groups, or I know that -- you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Yes, I was, yes I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: But now I’m not too active, because I have -- I am active, I have to take care of myself, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1295">What kinds of things did you do when you were active with those survivor’s groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: We -- we were getting together, we had lectures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Lectures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yes, and I had people coming from other cities, to meet with each one, speaking in University of Richmond, survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Talking about the same thing we are talking now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Their experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: And Elie Wiesel was here to speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah, you know, you know who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Elie Wiesel, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: I call him Wiesel, he’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: -- he’s a -- Elie Wiesel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: He came to speak at the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: To -- to the University of Richmond, yes.</span> <span id="s1311">We had other speakers.</span> <span id="s1312">And it’s -- for us it’s a little bit harder, because sometimes we have the children, the grandchildren, so you know.</span> <span id="s1313">I was very active, and I was going dancing with mine husband a few times a week.</span> <span id="s1314">This was very important.</span> <span id="s1315">Now I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: I go to weddings, but -- so, this is the [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: So how -- how do you think that being a survivor is -- is -- affected your life?</span> <span id="s1319">I mean, it’s an obvious question, and I mean, it affects you in every way, every day.</span> <span id="s1320">But how do you think -- what qualities do you think you have that maybe you -- people -- other people your age, who were born here, for example, don’t have, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: It’s a big, big subject, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: I-I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: I am mys -- I don’t know, I’m myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1327">You are who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I am that -- I am myself, and I’m a very happy person.</span> <span id="s1329">And I’m very positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Extremely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: And tolerant, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Someti -- sometimes I coat -- when it -- sometimes I can be a little bit negative, and I said, “Uh-uh, remember.</span> <span id="s1334">Do you remember?”</span> <span id="s1335">You know what I’m talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: No, I don’t exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1338">You know, remember we went through hell.</span> <span id="s1339">We were in hell for so many years.</span> <span id="s1340">So when something goes wrong, goes the other way, I say, oh, it’s going to be okay.</span> <span id="s1341">I’m stronger than that.</span> <span id="s1342">Remember what’s happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: So you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: And I’m extremely tolerant.</span> <span id="s1345">Extremely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And it’s something you’re aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Very aware of.</span> <span id="s1348">To everybody.</span> <span id="s1349">And it -- it -- do -- sometimes they come -- ga -- get -- with very intelligent

very nice to explaining to you things like that.</span> <span id="s1353">It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: You mean about anything, or about the -- are you talking about history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: About -- when they talk about something, and I really don’t know, I am not embarrassed to say I don’t know, please explain to me.</span> <span id="s1356">And people -- some people say, ha, ha, ha.</span> <span id="s1357">Doesn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s1358">You go to college to get -- to -- how to get -- to get knowledge, yes?</span> <span id="s1359">So if I don’t know, I ask somebody who knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1361">Have you -- do you feel the need to read books, and study things about World War two, and

very -- extremely important.</span> <span id="s1464">And for the older people.</span> <span id="s1465">We have to look up to the older people, doesn’t matter to whom.</span> <span id="s1466">Which is true, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1468">Have more respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Have more res -- have a lot of respect.</span> <span id="s1470">Doesn’t matter who it is.</span> <span id="s1471">And with kindness we can do a lot, a lot good.</span> <span id="s1472">I couldn’t criticize, I -- I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1473">I even didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s1474">Maybe some people would, I -- I -- I really -- you have to go to work, you lucky.</span> <span id="s1475">I am lucky that I can do many things.</span> <span id="s1476">I mean it.</span> <span id="s1477">And -- and that’s -- something I can, I sit, and I can do it, I can.</span> <span id="s1478">But many things maybe it’s -- people criticize.</span> <span id="s1479">I just don’t know what to tell you, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: It’s not in you nature, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: It’s not in my nature.</span> <span id="s1482">I never criticize my children, never.</span> <span id="s1483">I criticize myself, but not the children.</span> <span id="s1484">When something happen, I said look at me.</span> <span id="s1485">I cannot do this, and I cannot -- but you c -- you shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1486">You should tell them in a nice way, maybe, but not criticize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Mm-hm, help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Sure, it’s how you help.</span> <span id="s1489">Maybe I remember this from the time I was little, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Your parents must have been that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: I was always told that I can do everything, and that I am special.</span> <span id="s1492">And mine kids are special to me, every one.</span> <span id="s1493">If they do something wrong, I just tell them in a nice way, you know, you have to change -- change something.</span> <span id="s1494">But no c -- I think -- I don’t like to criticize anybody, and I don’t like to blame anybody for nothing either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1496">Do you and your husband -- you’ve been married quite a long time now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Just a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Yeah, just a few.</span> <span id="s1499">You have a very close relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s1503">This is my life.</span> <span id="s1504">It’s like I told you, he’s more than a husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1506">You were very young when you first met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yes, mine professor, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Your professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yes, taught me everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Was there a time when you first met him, or maybe some years later, when you both told each other everything that happened?</span> <span id="s1511">Do you know everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: -- that happened to him, and does he know everything that happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: But we don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Once, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: We talk about it, we don’t want it -- sometimes when he speaks -- when he speaks and I’m there, I start laughing to myself, and [indecipherable] people looked at me, because you know, I know all the -- and he -- he tol -- he was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1523">He will tell you.</span> <span id="s1524">And he was telling about his sister, and about his sister baby, and all those [indecipherable] about his father, but it’s so many years, you know.</span> <span id="s1525">Sometimes I just remind him of -- talk about it.</span> <span id="s1526">Now we are busy with the children, and the grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Yeah, yeah, it’s behind you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: It is behind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: No.</span> <span id="s1533">And -- and some new -- it was so nice last night, we were called, a baby was born.</span> <span id="s1534">It’s not mine cousin, it’s mine husband -- some cousin had -- her adopted daughter, but you can imagine -- they are so happy.</span> <span id="s1535">And they told me please call si -- ca-call up your children.</span> <span id="s1536">So I said to my husband, “Isn’t it wonderful to have a family?”</span> <span id="s1537">Because we really didn’t have anybody when we are ca -- when we came here.</span> <span id="s1538">Ver -- wu -- we were -- we had the people we met here, from Poland, from Germany, from other countries.</span> <span id="s1539">But I remember when I bought this house, it’s like, I ask my husband what should I do?</span> <span id="s1540">He said you should take candles, salt, and bread.</span> <span id="s1541">So I said, why.</span> <span id="s1542">Candles to light so you would always have light.</span> <span id="s1543">Bread so you would -- would never be hungry, but I don’t remember what -- why the salt.</span> <span id="s1544">This I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1545">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1546">See, I ask him because I -- I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1547">He was a little older than I am, so he knows more.</span> <span id="s1548">But I’m trying to learn, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Given the fact that it’s so difficult for you to talk about those things that happened to you, why did you want to do these interviews, and how -- you did an interview with the Holocaust Museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Because it -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: -- and I could see when I watched that video interview, the pain that you had, just even when those thoughts crossed your mind.</span> <span id="s1552">You don’t even have to say them, it’s clear.</span> <span id="s1553">Well why -- why do you do these interviews now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: I think it’s important.</span> <span id="s1555">I think we all have to speak.</span> <span id="s1556">See, I just can’t -- I would love to say something, I just can’t.</span> <span id="s1557">I -- everything is engrave in mine heart, but I just can’t -- I -- I just can’t.</span> <span id="s1558">I just want to tell you I saw too much, too much.</span> <span id="s1559">I hope nobody any place will see it.</span> <span id="s1560">And sometimes this is mine testimony, okay, for the people who were slaughter, and perished.</span> <span id="s1561">So maybe I can speak -- I c -- I cannot speak for them, I know I cannot.</span> <span id="s1562">But maybe a few words.</span> <span id="s1563">I just hope that the history will never repeat such self.</span> <span id="s1564">And nobody will be prosecute -- prosecute from any reason, for any reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: I remember in your interview, you -- very early in the interview, you mentioned a fe -- a fellow named Marek Lieberman, was his name, Marek?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Marek Lieberman.</span> <span id="s1567">He was mine friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: And -- and you --</span></p> <p><span

Museum interview with Sonia Brodecki.</span> <span id="s1574">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s1575">At the end of the last tape, Sonia, we were talking about how you -- you remember certain people and the things they did, and how you’re -- it’s been important to you to tell people about those individuals.</span> <span id="s1576">And -- and one of the people that you mentioned in your video interview was a fellow named Marek Lieberman.</span> <span id="s1577">And I thought maybe you’d like a chance to tell a little bit more about him, since he seemed to have been an important person to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Marek -- Marek Lieberman, he was maybe 23 or 24 years old.</span> <span id="s1579">We worship him, all the children.</span> <span id="s1580">We were --

and took out money.</span> <span id="s1586">And they hang Mareksa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1588">Were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah, they were Jewish, yeah, they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: And they were helping other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: They were helping other people because they had the resources, they had the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: [indecipherable] who were coming to Poland and need help, so helping, and somebody informed the Germans, somebody who knew about it, I don’t know who it was, that they have money, they put money in the wall, and the Germans came to the -- to the houses, they took out the money, and they took Marek, and they hanged him, and they called the whole Jewish -- I don’t know, every -- the whole Jewish people from Richmond, to -- to -- to Shinkaveetcha, I forgot -- I forgot the number who had -- we had to come and s-see how he -- they hanged him.</span> <span id="s1594">And I was standing maybe three or -- feet away from here, from Marek.</span> <span id="s1595">And so

wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1606">Even people who didn’t have money were living in the house, that couldn’t pay, because the German -- later the German throw everybody anyhow, because they moved to the houses there.</span> <span id="s1607">And Marek was married to a beautiful lady, she was blonde, young.</span> <span id="s1608">And she was giving birth to a baby.</span> <span

here.”</span> <span id="s1676">I couldn’t believe it, that he risk his life to come, because if they would catch him, they would kill him, to come and give us news how everything is going, the
