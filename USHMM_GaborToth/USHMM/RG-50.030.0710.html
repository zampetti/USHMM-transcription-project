Early 1942</span></p> <p><span id="s58">[DL] 1942?</span> <span id="s59">Okay and what actually happened to you when you were fighting in Egypt?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">[AG] Well we were a company on water supply, and we were maintaining the water supply, and digging out what was called a ‘beers’, that the Romans had dug, to store corn in, cause they filled up with ha... and we was out out out in the wilds, finding these places, we then went to Tobruk,</span></p> <p><span id="s61">[00:05:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s62">[AG] and the company, was split up into sections, there doing various water supply jobs.</span> <span id="s63">And I was was, my, my er, section was looking after an Italian made pumping station, and I sent out to look after a reservoir, on me own, and one morning the, it was miles away from anywhere and some officers came on, and an English officer in, he, in South African Army, said to me “could I blow the reservoir?”</span> <span id="s64">Well everything was there except the detonators, and I told him I wanted dets, he got them up for me, with a, er, South African sergeant, and we made it blowable.</span> <span id="s65">And then, a couple or three days later, Jerry made a big push, I’d got told to blow the reservoir, and when I got outside, and there was a Major there, old gentleman crying his eyes out, an English one in the South African Army, and he said to me “I would never have believed it, look down there”, and somebody had a white flag up.</span> <span id="s66">Anyway, I was living in a little foxhole myself, I went, he gives me this, South African [LAUGHS] gave me a, bottle of South African brandy.</span> <span id="s67">So I was sozzled actually when I got to prisoner, but he come out and, er [LAUGHS], there was a big tank there with a officer wiggling a forty-five around “come mate” – I said “yes I’m coming mate”, and if went down into brook and joined the column</span></p> <p><span id="s68">[DL] So that’s when you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s70">[DL] ... captured by the Germans?</span> <span id="s71">And what happened to you once you had been captured by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">[AG] We marched a long way and we got into Bengasi, and in the Bengasi..., sure handed, as old as the Italians, and we were put in cages, in big compounds, and the, er, Sansui tribe, was firing at us.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">[DL] This is when you’re still in, in Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">[AG] Yeah, and this was Bengasi, and anyway we had the barest rations, and er, well we didn’t have any rations, and er, the water we had, you had to put your hand out through the wire, and you know, so drink, anyway, the Sansui were sh...sh...shooting at us, trying to stop us.</span> <span id="s75">From there they shipped us over to, lord, Italy, I forget where it was we landed, and when we landed, the old people, pretty near the sea we landed, the old people were crying, and the youngsters were throwing stones at us.</span> <span id="s76">Anyway we got put in huts, for a while.</span> <span id="s77">And er, didn’t have anything to do, then all of a sudden, they just shift us out in tents</span></p> <p><span id="s78">[DL] And whereabouts in Italy was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">[AG] In Italy, I’ll tell ye in a minute.</span> <span id="s80">Erm, oh god, I should think I went, a minute, anyway, we were in tents, on a side of a hill, which gradually became a mud heap, and er was there one day, and everybody it was, when the er,</span></p> <p><span id="s81">[00:10:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s82">[AG] Allies had landed in Italy, we, instead of being told to get out and find them, we were told to stay, but that gave the gentlemen time to round us all up.</span> <span id="s83">We were put on trains and shifted into Germany.</span> <span id="s84">At a place called Lamsdorf, which actually I think, is in Poland.</span> <span id="s85">Well from there which was a huge camp we was moved out to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">[DL] Before you went to Auschwitz, and you were sent in trucks to Lamsdorf, when was this?</span> <span id="s87">Do you remember roughly which year, which month it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">[AG] Oh, 19, end of 1942 I think</span></p> <p><span id="s89">[DL] So it was 1942 you were sent from...</span></p> <p><span id="s90">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s91">[DL] ...erm, from Italy to Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">[AG] Yeah, it was</span></p> <p><span id="s93">[DL] ...and what were conditions like for the duration of your transport to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">[AG] Oh like cattle trucks.</span> <span id="s95">Cattle trucks, I don’t know how many men was in there but er, the only food the Italians give us was a tin of so called corned beef, which we were told was made of donkeys [LAUGHS], and er, er, thing a bread all the time, we was travelling all the time in the trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">[DL] And how long did the journey last for?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">[AG] I think it was about a week if that’s right with my memory</span></p> <p><span id="s98">[DL] And were there any stops on the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">[AG] We had to go up through Brenner Pass, so that way.</span> <span id="s100">And er, all the stops and starts as the Air Force came over like</span></p> <p><span id="s101">[DL] But did they actually stop and allow you out of the trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">[AG] No.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">[DL] And were there and stops in terms of replenishing water or supplies...?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">[AG] No no no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">[DL] How did you, in terms of water, how did you actually survive, did you have any water?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">[AG] Luck [LAUGHS], luck and well, we were doing our damnedest to upset the Jerry actually.</span> <span id="s107">But we didn’t, we didn’t upset...we got to Lamsdorf.</span> <span id="s108">So right, that was a huge camp that was the central camp in Poland where they sent out the work parties to Auschwitz and various other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">[DL] And how were the cattle trucks to Auschwitz, what were conditions like for you in those trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">[AG] Same.</span> <span id="s111">Cattle trucks.</span> <span id="s112">I can remember passing a label with Auschwitz on, and of course we never knew what it was, never knew what was happening, and just after Auschwitz, we stopped, and we got out, the, this was about midnight, and we marched down to a brand new camp, hutted camp.</span> <span id="s113">So thought this is going to be alright.</span> <span id="s114">Well about three weeks later we all got moved out of the camp to nearer the factory that was, what was being built.</span> <span id="s115">And then they put us in huts what was alright, they were alright there was nothing wrong with them</span></p> <p><span id="s116">[DL] And when you arrived at Auschwitz, what was your recollections when you actually arrived, when the cattle trucks came into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">[AG] Well we didn’t see Auschwitz cause we was held in the camp they give us, for about three weeks, we didn’t see nothing happening until we got up by the wire on this big factory.</span> <span id="s118">And then we saw the Jews and everything else, what was happening</span></p> <p><span id="s119">[DL] And that’s IG Farben</span></p> <p><span id="s120">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s121">[DL] And what did you witness when you got, when you got up towards IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">[AG] Well we were watching these, couldn’t hardly believe it, all these poor people in what we used to call pyjama suits, and the way the Germans were treating them.</span> <span id="s123">To the Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s124">[00:15:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s125">[AG] they were just dirt, they...if the German wanted to kill one he would, [COUGH], and they were split up into parties, and each party had a chap on, which was also a Jew, and if they thought the gang wasn’t working hard enough he thrashed him.</span> <span id="s126">[COUGH], excuse me, erm, and er we couldn’t make it out to see Jews at times killing Jews.</span> <span id="s127">So if they didn’t work hard enough, they were thrashed and I seem them killed.</span> <span id="s128">And they were left.</span> <span id="s129">They were picked up at night, taken back, put in the boiler.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">[DL] Sorry they were taken back and put where?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">[AG] They were put in the actual Auschwitz, German, German Auschwitz, and er, they er, sometimes you saw, but as regards to Jerry in our camp, he was mainly the older generation of Jerries that had fought at the end of the 1914 1918 war</span></p> <p><span id="s132">[DL] You’re talking about your guards...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s134">[DL] ...so the men who guarded you?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">[AG] Our guards.</span> <span id="s136">You had, there was some, well the Jews had SS guards, and they would try to intimidate us but they couldn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s137">[DL] The SS would try to intimidate you?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">[AG] They had a, we did have one boy shot.</span> <span id="s139">He was in the, when we had to go in the factories to work in small parties, he was one of a small party, that was painting pylons.</span> <span id="s140">You know, pylons, and he couldn’t go up, which is feasible.</span> <span id="s141">He was a minor.</span> <span id="s142">He told the Jerry, the Jerry man the gaffer I think was there, he said “I can’t go up”.</span> <span id="s143">Well there was an SS bloke there, and this SS bloke, oh yes he’s got to go up, he’s got to go up and all this, and he turned around and shot.</span> <span id="s144">Immediately we were all taken back into the camp.</span> <span id="s145">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">[DL] And you witnessed the shooting of Corporate Reynolds?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">[AG] Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">[DL] Did you witness yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">[AG] No, no no I didn’t, that er that was the old in case of nine all, it was happened there, but in the end if an SS came round the corner, and we were there, he turned his back and went back where he come from</span></p> <p><span id="s150">[DL] Why did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">[AG] Cause he know damned well we should get him if we wanted to</span></p> <p><span id="s152">[DL] And were there cases where British...</span></p> <p><span id="s153">[AG] Jerry put a, in our camp, the Jerry put a spy in our camp, we found out.</span> <span id="s154">He was disposed of, and Jerry never put another one in there</span></p> <p><span id="s155">[DL] So what actually happened to this man?</span> <span id="s156">How did you know or why did you suspect that he wasn’t what he said he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">[AG] Well, they found out he was supposed to be in the Yorkshire Yeomanry unit, he had the badges and all of it, but how they found out I don’t know.</span> <span id="s158">But when they found out, he wasn’t no more.</span> <span id="s159">I don’t, I know where he was but I’m not saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">[00:20:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s161">[AG] But with that, the SS and that, was looked very careful what they done to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">[DL] And in terms of other resistance, or passive resistance or sabotage...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">[AG] O yeah they, when, I think it was the Canadians, they, they, er put a boat on shore and blew them up on the coast, or anyway, Jerry said, to, we put some of their men in iron, in chains you know, and they had the bright idea of putting our hands in rope.</span> <span id="s164">So we had to line up, and they tied around the rope with string, and while they were doing that, the one he done before went to the back of the queue, and took off, took off the string, and they were going round in circles, like this.</span> <span id="s165">And in the end, Jerry he got fed up with it, he didn’t bother no more</span></p> <p><span id="s166">[DL] So this was a punishment in retaliation to what the Allies had done during the war</span></p> <p><span id="s167">[AG] Yeah, yer...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">[DL] And, and this was just a random punishment...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s170">[DL] ...without purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">[AG] That’s right</span></p> <p><span id="s172">[DL] And other acts of sabotage that happened – what other acts of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">[AG] Oh, er when one was walking about the factory, it was also a railway, parcelling yard.</span> <span id="s174">You change the tickets on the trucks, on the trains that were made up, so perhaps the Russians that were waiting for ammunition, all they got were loads of paint.</span> <span id="s175">Take one card out and swap them all over</span></p> <p><span id="s176">[DL] You mean the Germans on the Russian front if they were waiting for ammunition...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">[AG] Yeah, yeah we used to swap them over.</span> <span id="s178">Swap the cards over no matter where it was, take that card and put it on another train see</span></p> <p><span id="s179">[DL] So the train would then change direction, and end up at the Russian front with paint instead of bullets?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">[AG] That’s right.</span> <span id="s181">Then one day, two boys had a bright idea, they were railway engineers, they pinched a train, pinched an engine.</span> <span id="s182">Went for a ride, Jerry didn’t know where his engine was till it came back down the line ooh...ohhh.</span> <span id="s183">.</span> <span id="s184">oooh!</span> <span id="s185">[LAUGHS], small stuff</span></p> <p><span id="s186">[DL] Weren’t they afraid?</span> <span id="s187">When I was speaking with Ron Jones he mentioned that there was fear, or at least fear for him of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s188">Was there a fear for other men as well that such acts of defiance...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">[AG] No</span></p> <p><span id="s190">[DL] ...could result in...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">[AG] No they didn’t do, we had no fear of the gas chambers at all.</span> <span id="s192">Only punishment we got here was put in the cooler for perhaps two days or three days – that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">[DL] Did you ever end up in the cooler?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">[AG] No</span></p> <p><span id="s195">[DL] And when did you actually find out about the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">[AG] Well, we found out within about two days of being there, cause you could smell it, you could smell it in the air.</span> <span id="s197">And the Jews that we managed to talk to told us, cause if they were caught talking to us, that was the end of them.</span> <span id="s198">That’s the end of them, they went back to their camp, and murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">[DL] So did you talk to any of the Jews, or did you manage to talk to any of the Jews, or communicate with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">[AG] Well, you could, but you had to be very careful, you had to be very careful because of the SS saw you talking to them they tried to wallop, they’d kill the Jew</span></p> <p><span id="s201">[DL] In front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">[AG] In front of us</span></p> <p><span id="s203">[DL] So when you were working at the IG Farben factory,</span></p> <p><span id="s204">[00:25:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s205">[DL] how many people would you see, would you say on a day to day basis did you see being murdered?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">[AG] Oh I expect to see two or three at least</span></p> <p><span id="s207">[DL] And for what reason</span></p> <p><span id="s208">[AG] Just because the Germans didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s209">And the Capos, they got a bit more to eat that the others, what it amounted to</span></p> <p><span id="s210">[DL] What happened to you at the IG Farben factory?</span> <span id="s211">– You became injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">[AG] Yes, I got these fingers squashed loading pipes</span></p> <p><span id="s213">[DL] And so what, what did you do when you were injured, how did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">[AG] I went back to the camp hospital, cause we had a doctor, and he got them right, then I stopped in the camp then for a few months, but it was the doctor that’d keep that hospital full, if you understand what I mean.</span> <span id="s215">You only have to have a cold oh, you went in hospital.</span> <span id="s216">You wasn’t working for the Jerry, then Jerry, er um, have a blitz, and kick you all out of the hospital, and by the next morning, you’re all back in again</span></p> <p><span id="s217">[DL] What were conditions like in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">[AG] Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">[DL] What were conditions like in your hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">[AG] Good, good, got nothing to grumble about</span></p> <p><span id="s221">[DL] And when you were convalescing from your injury, you made a garden?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">[AG] No, er yeah I had a garden</span></p> <p><span id="s223">[DL] So could you talk a little about the garden which you made?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">[AG] Yeah well that was funny, I was there one day, and I got myself, found a spade, find out what the soil was like you know, so I made a little garden between us and er, I asked permission from Charlie Coward, the camp, camp officer, and he said yeah, and then I got some tomato plants, he got me some tomato plants cause he was, what they called a man of confidence, he was allowed to go to Auschwitz to, and pick up the mail and things like that, and er, I give him a bar of chocolate, and he gives us a dozen tomato plans, quite lovely.</span> <span id="s225">Then of course, this Saturday night we gave a concert, as we used to do things like that in the camp, and er, we’re clearing Sunday morning, we were, we had the stage and that outside, it was clear that way, and the Yanks come over bombing.</span> <span id="s226">I went into my little foxhole, and er, I didn’t like the Jerry shelter, of course one came down, hit the end of the shelter, ah let’s see what, how many was killed there, well I know there was twenty odd, killed there.</span> <span id="s227">I got out of my little hole, went down there, and the first bloke I pulled out was my friend.</span> <span id="s228">I was still there working, and the doctor said “you want my tea”, “I’m alright” I said, and he said “you want my tea”, and that’s an order.</span> <span id="s229">So after things quietened down and that, I said, why did you order me up there, and he said “If you hadn’t have pulled a friend out, you’d have been alright, because I’d seen it in your eyes you’d be the next one to go down</span></p> <p><span id="s230">[DL] To go down?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">[AG] To go down on the floor you know?</span> <span id="s232">Faint, pass out</span></p> <p><span id="s233">[DL] Was that because you’d been injured by the blast?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">[AG] No, it’s because I’d pulled my mate out first – if I didn’t know the bloke it wouldn’t have affected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">[00:30:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s236">[DL] When you’d had your garden, before it was destroyed, what did you witness, erm from the nearby concentration camp, how close were you to, to the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">[AG] Well actually, we were about, I should suppose, about a quarter mile, it was, seeing the, maps, I had the maps of them but I’ve lost them, we was about a quarter of a mile.</span> <span id="s238">We were next door to the boundary, the boundary wire of the factory, there’s only road between us, but the actual, I suppose about a quarter of a mile away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">[DL] And, when you were working on your garden, did you witness atrocities at that point as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">[AG] No, I couldn’t because I was in between huts.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">[DL] The radio set in the British camp, er, how did that actually work?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">[AG] Don’t ask me cause nobody knows, they were working it</span></p> <p><span id="s243">[DL] And what about, we’ve touched on some of the sabotage acts which were carried out, erm, were there other sabotage acts in terms of what, what was the mantra, the British mantra in IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">[AG] No, everything was done, how can I put, sort of automatic, you were going to help the Jerries as hard as you could</span></p> <p><span id="s245">[DL] And what did you do to try to help the Jews in terms of...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">[AG] If we could, used to pass them food, what we could spare, pass them bits... But, that’s all we could do</span></p> <p><span id="s247">[DL] And how many Jewish people, how many concentration camp victims would you estimate were working at IG Farben at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">[AG] I should, I should imagine there be a couple of thousand.</span> <span id="s249">Cause it was a huge place.</span> <span id="s250">It were going to be fifteen square mile when it were finished</span></p> <p><span id="s251">[DL] And the number of British POWs there?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">[AG] About six hundred</span></p> <p><span id="s253">[DL] And you were witnessing everyday what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">[AG] Oh yes</span></p> <p><span id="s255">[DL] And what was the average day like for yourself at IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">[AG] Well you were stood up to, and nothing to the Jerry [COUGH / LAUGH], you didn’t work if you didn’t want to, but if a Jerry come along he see you be doing something even if you be doing nothing.</span> <span id="s257">They put, our boys dug a trench, and they put a big cable in there, electric cable [LAUGHS], but while they were doing it, the pick axes slipped, went through this cable two or three times, come to some big top notch Jerry, so he pulls the handle down and nothing happens [LAUGHS], that’s the sort of thing we was doing</span></p> <p><span id="s258">[DL] In terms of away from the factory, erm, what sort of entertainment did you out on?</span> <span id="s259">You touched upon the stage plays earlier...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">[AG] Yeah we had stage plays, had erm, a little sort of jazz band effort there you know cause there wasn’t very much else there you see, play cards, talking amongst yourselves</span></p> <p><span id="s261">[DL] Did you ever discuss what was happening with the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">[AG] Oh yeah, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s263">[DL] And what did you, when you discussed what was happening to the Jews, what was the discussion?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">[AG] well the discussion was seeing and talking if there was a way we could help any of them, you see, actually, I don’t think, anybody tried to get out from ours where we were, because it was in the middle of a swamp, our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">[00:35:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s266">[AG] And without you know the roads you lose yourself</span></p> <p><span id="s267">[DL] You took part in stage plays with POWs who were in Sweeny Todd alongside Ron Jones.</span> <span id="s268">What are you recollections of those shows, and rehearsals leading up to...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">[AG] Fun, fun.</span> <span id="s270">It was awful fun.</span> <span id="s271">When we actually put the play on, Jerry always put a man in the hut, and he was in the centre seat in front the stage.</span> <span id="s272">We weren’t allowed to sing God save the King, so we sang the Land of Hope and Glory.</span> <span id="s273">But when we stood up, we made sure that bloody Jerry stood up with us, we squashed him till he stood up</span></p> <p><span id="s274">[DL] And that German was a censor?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">[AG] He was an, he was an armoured Jerry, sergeants see that we didn’t make fun of Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s276">Another what used to happen, they used to give us pep talks, all lined up and this little Jerry officer, he about four foot six, he come in, strutting in all his lot, and he’d start “we sunk four of your battleships yesterday - hooray”, cause they cheered like that, and in the end, you’ve heard of man jumping, jumping with rage, I seen him actually jumping up and down.</span> <span id="s277">You take no notice of them, cause we had a rough idea of what was happening with the couple of radios we had in there see</span></p> <p><span id="s278">[DL] Was this man an SS officer or was he...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">[AG] He was a normal German officer, cause when our boys landed in France, Jerry used to put on a ‘music while you work on’ in hospital you know, you used to have music while you were working in the hospital, and they forgot to switch it off, and they said “the allies have landed on the coasts this morning.</span> <span id="s280">In France we have resisted it”.</span> <span id="s281">We all, they called us all in, in the camp, house had the biggest bonfire of their life when that happened [LAUGHS]</span></p> <p><span id="s282">[DL] And this was just in the hospital where the music was played?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s284">[DL] And this was just in the British POW hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s286">[DL] And how many people would you say roughly worked in that hospital, or were patients in that hospital at any one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">[AG] Well it varied, it could be a dozen patients in there all the time, and half a dozen helping I suppose</span></p> <p><span id="s288">[DL] In terms of just going back to to to what was going on around you with the Jews, what’s your, looking back on it now, what’s your recollection?</span> <span id="s289">What stands in your memory now as to the treatment which you witnessed at that point in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">[AG] what was, what stands in my life was the dead, the dead left out in the factory after the bombing.</span> <span id="s291">You see this big factory had concrete cellars and things like that, you know, and when the bombing come, the Jews went in there, and they were left when the bombs hit them, left there for a couple of days</span></p> <p><span id="s292">[DL] And how many roughly would you say were in the cellars?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">[AG] I couldn’t tell ye I don’t know</span></p> <p><span id="s294">[DL] At the start of 1945, you were, you were ordered to leave the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s295">[AG] Yep</span></p> <p><span id="s296">[DL] ...what was your memory of the walk from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">[AG] Bloody cold [LAUGHS], and a lack of food, they never fed us if they couldn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s298">[00:40:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s299">[DL] And what did you see on, on the march as you walked away from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">[AG] A lot of dead Jews beside the road, cause they marched out before us, some of them</span></p> <p><span id="s301">[DL] And what happened to you during the course of the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">[AG] Well personally, myself, during the march I went down with, I didn’t know it at the time, with pneumonia, but there was two dentists, dentist officers, there was six of us put in a big mansion, and they were given, Jerry give them some pills, I don’t know what they were.</span> <span id="s303">Anyway can’t remember that bit all that much, but they saved us, saved our lives.</span> <span id="s304">And from then, they put us on a train to Pilson, and I’ve never moved on a train so fast in all my life.</span> <span id="s305">Was in Pilson station, and the engine’s on our carriage, there’s only one coach on each end and they come over bombing, and I don’t think wheels of that truck touched the rails into a tunnel, so as to keep the engines from getting blasted</span></p> <p><span id="s306">[DL] When you arrived, erm at Pilson, what happened to you after that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">[AG] Well, I joined up with another column, and just marched</span></p> <p><span id="s308">[DL] And the other column, was that made up of other prisoners of war, or was the concentration camp victims...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">[AG] No, there was no concentration camps that I knew moved out, these were all prisoners</span></p> <p><span id="s310">[DL] And how were you treated during the course of your march?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">[AG] We were treated alright – they couldn’t give us no food, we had a scrounge everything, but I didn’t see any, how can I put it, cruelty, cause they were the same as us see, mainly old war people, they were not too bad at all.</span> <span id="s312">But then, we were put in three barns on the side of the hill, and what the Red Cross done, and Jerry agreed to it, sent some wagons to the Swiss border, they were loaded up with parcels, Red Cross parcels, and told to find the columns.</span> <span id="s313">Then, we had three of these wagons hit us, so we were alright for food then.</span> <span id="s314">And then we stopped in there for a fortnight I suppose</span></p> <p><span id="s315">[DL] When about was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">[AG] Eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">[DL] What date would you say roughly this happened, and roughly where about were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">[AG] I can’t tell you where it was, it was somewhere in, in Germany, making towards the coast, I don’t know, I don’t know the name of the place</span></p> <p><span id="s319">[DL] And which month would you say this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">[AG] Er May, this was April time</span></p> <p><span id="s321">[DL] And so at what point were you then freed from German captivity?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">[AG] What happened was we let one night, evening, we decided two or three of us, we was on the village at the bottom of the hill, we’d go and have a pint.</span> <span id="s323">So we all marched down the village, and I went away in the pub, I said we wanted beer, and the Jerry said we’re not serving you, so two of us jumped over the bar and got our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">[00:45:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s325">[AG] We had some money we could pay, you know camp money, and at the end of this room, you know, there was a load of old hatcheries you know, signs, course they looked black as ink, well we had them all singing before we left.</span> <span id="s326">Well next night, we looked out and down in the valley there was some vehicles with yellow, yellow sheets on them.</span> <span id="s327">Well we didn’t know what that meant; it was identification, American identification.</span> <span id="s328">And the next things we knew was a jeep coming up, and the silly blighters loaded with fags, all they had on them, fags.</span> <span id="s329">So they said, right don’t go out tonight, we’re going to mortar the woods, alright, and the next morning we’d made friends with the farmer, two or three of us, made friends with the farmer cause the Jerry couldn’t feed us we had to go out, get food where we could.</span> <span id="s330">And er, we thought we wonder what’s happened to our friends.</span> <span id="s331">It was mother and father and three little kiddies</span></p> <p><span id="s332">[DL] These were your farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">[AG] The farmers this was see, so me and my mate, the other mate stopped, with the gear what we had because if the gear was left, it wasn’t there when you got back</span></p> <p><span id="s334">[DL] And the gear being?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">[AG] Well what you was carrying you know, what, could make what you got, see that, nothing much might be over a coat, or something like that see, we got there, went in, couldn’t see nobody, all the chickens were in their pens, and all the cows and the rest of it, and I happened to look up, and they were in the corner in the attic.</span> <span id="s336">I said come on, get out “No, the Americans will kill us”.</span> <span id="s337">I said “what the hell are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s338">, “well the SS will be back, will be through presently”, well I said “there ain’t no SS, they’re all gone”, they were that scared of their own people.</span> <span id="s339">Anyway, they come down and we’d give them tea, one thing or another, and the kids the bit of chocolate we had, and we come on</span></p> <p><span id="s340">[DL] And that’s when you met up with the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s342">[DL] And then what happened?</span> <span id="s343">You were taken where?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">[AG] The Americans, don’t put this down, rotten buggers the lot, they got no discipline</span></p> <p><span id="s345">[DL] We are recording this</span></p> <p><span id="s346">[AG] Oh bugger</span></p> <p><span id="s347">[DL] So what happened when you were then freed by the Americans?</span> <span id="s348">What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">[AG] We had to jump the wagons, cause they couldn’t provide wagons, we landed in a town, and er, the er, there was an American military sergeant there, and we got off the wagon and he took us in this beautiful new, new, barracks, opened the door and said “what do I do with these Bill?”</span> <span id="s350">, and that was a Brigadier.</span> <span id="s351">You don’t call a Brigadier “Bill!”</span></p> <p><span id="s352">[DL] But what happened to you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">[AG] They gradually ferried us, we got back to, er, it was an aerodrome we got back, and erm, we wanted somewhere to sleep and we found a guesthouse with a poor old lady in the, got in there and couldn’t find her.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">[00:50:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s355">[AG] Anyway, she did come in and I explained we was waiting and she said that was alright, and the poor lady, we found an SS store full of food, so she had a big table you, she could sit fifteen, so we found two boilers, got thee going, and in walks two boys with six cockerels.</span> <span id="s356">So I says to her can you see to these, she says “where did you get them?”</span> <span id="s357">Oh, we said we found them walking, killed em, everything went in the boiler.</span> <span id="s358">So we laid everything out properly, you know planes and what have you, and then, couple of boys had found an SS store, full of tinned fruit, cream and all that, so we had a good afters as well, with pudding as well.</span> <span id="s359">But the old lady who was there, I said “come on ma’am, your house, we’re using your stuff, top of the table”.</span> <span id="s360">Oh and she was dribbling, she said no, she said “no I can’t” – “why?”</span> <span id="s361">, she said the SS, the SS will kill you, I said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">[DL] So what actually happened at that point, when did you then fly from where you were back into Britain?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">[AG] I landed back in Britain the 8th May, forty...forty-four, I suppose it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">[DL] Forty-five?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">[AG] Forty-five, and er, the er, Aylesbury, somewhere around Aylesbury, jumped out the plane and er, had to get deloused, the powder in there, this big hut being deloused, all the women, Army making tea for us</span></p> <p><span id="s366">[DL] And at this point, did you, were you having nightmares of your time at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">[AG] Not until I actually got home.</span> <span id="s368">When I got home, after about a week, a plane came over and I was under the bed.</span> <span id="s369">But that gradually faded</span></p> <p><span id="s370">[DL] And was that because of the air raids that actually happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s372">[DL] In terms of what you witnessed, er with the Jews and how the SS treated the Jews, did that haunt you after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">[AG] No, no</span></p> <p><span id="s374">[DL] Even though you had witnessed firsthand...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">[AG] No it didn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s376">[DL] Is there a reason why it didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">[AG] Yes, because I’m a hard man, a really hard man, what I seen, nobody would believe, I’m a hard man.</span> <span id="s378">I’d never want counselling for nothing I’ve done, and I’ve been with the police, I’ve been helping undertakers, but I’ve never wanted counselling, and I’ve scraped them off the floor</span></p> <p><span id="s379">[DL] And this was in your civilian role after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">[AG] Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s381">[DL] And during the war did you feel that you, your attitudes towards what you were witnessing, at IG Farben, did you feel your attitudes harden?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">[AG] You had to be hard, you had to be hard, it’s no good.</span> <span id="s383">I was lucky; I was in a unit which wasn’t a fighting unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">[00:55:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s385">[AG] We could fight if we had to, but we weren’t front line troops</span></p> <p><span id="s386">[DL] Would you say that the British POW troops at Auschwitz, at E175 Auschwitz, did they empathise with the Jews, or, or was there this hardness which you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">[AG] No, you, how can I put it, you do what you could for the Jews, but you had to be hard in case you got shot.</span> <span id="s388">You get what I mean?</span> <span id="s389">If the SS saw you talking to Jews or trying to help Jews, they’d just as likely shoot ye</span></p> <p><span id="s390">[DL] So there was a real fear of...</span></p> <p><span id="s391">[AG] Oh yeah, you stuck to your own discipline</span></p> <p><span id="s392">[DL] Because earlier we talked about Ron Jones, and Ron Jones being scared of the gas chambers and you were saying the British on the whole weren’t scared of the gas chambers</span></p> <p><span id="s393">[AG] Yeah we weren’t scared of them</span></p> <p><span id="s394">[DL] But, you’re saying that you were potentially scared of being shot if you were seen talking with the Jews</span></p> <p><span id="s395">[AG] Well yeah, they do, they would do, until they killed one of our boys, then in the end we had the SS running</span></p> <p><span id="s396">[DL] What makes you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">[AG] Well, a twelve pound sledge hammer from scaffolding makes a lovely hitter mind</span></p> <p><span id="s398">[DL] Are you referring to the plan which the British were going to put into effect for, er the murder of Corporate Reynolds?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">[AG] Well, it’s part Corporate Reynolds, although in the end, same as I say, the SS got wary of us</span></p> <p><span id="s400">[DL] And was the plan ever put into effect of dropping weight onto those you considered to be responsible?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">[AG] We did a couple</span></p> <p><span id="s402">[DL] Would you like to elaborate?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">[AG] No</span></p> <p><span id="s404">[DL] So were they SS that the British POWs er attacked on that occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">[AG] No they, they were, the SS were great men of their own ideas, but they’d never come up against proper fighting Englishmen.</span> <span id="s406">If you were ordered to be there you were there.</span> <span id="s407">And you stopped there.</span> <span id="s408">You either stopped there on the floor, or pulled out when you was told to.</span> <span id="s409">You never ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">[DL] So what you’re saying is the British did attack erm SS, at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s412">[DL] So when did the British attack and how many did they attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">[AG] I don’t know, I’m talking about in the general war now mind</span></p> <p><span id="s414">[DL] Oh okay so not in Auschwitz, not in...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">[AG] No, we couldn’t, couldn’t do it in Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s416">[DL] Okay.</span> <span id="s417">After the war, you gave evidence to er, to the trials, the IG Farben trial in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s418">What evidence did you actually give?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">[AG] Well more or less what I’m telling you</span></p> <p><span id="s420">[DL] And your feelings looking back on the evidence which you gave?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">[AG] Was right, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s422">[DL] Looking back at your time at er, er, er E175 Auschwitz, what are your feelings about what you witnessed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">[AG] My feelings are that it was how can I put it?</span> <span id="s424">Greed that caused a lot of this, greed, I got to be better than everyone else, greed, to hell with everyone else</span></p> <p><span id="s425">[DL] Greed by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">[AG] Yeah, yeah, when you get ordinary German people, German people I’m talking about like this, cowed, looking turning around, looking behind them all the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">[DL] When you returned to this country, how did people react to you, to your return, how did people actually react to you being a POW at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">[01:00:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s429">[AG] They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s430">I can tell you a story, I wanted to go home, go down Cornwall, I got on a train, here with another boy, ex POW at Auschwitz, I didn’t know him but there were two women on the train, on the carriage, they didn’t know him but they just showed their pictures and the papers, and they wouldn’t believe it, and we stuck it, as long as we could then we exploded.</span> <span id="s431">They didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s432">And, I’m going to tell you this, there’s a lot of English people today who don’t believe it</span></p> <p><span id="s433">[DL] Having witnessed it yourself, having been there, how does that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">[AG] Angry.</span> <span id="s435">They never told the history at school about Auschwitz, you see, they hid it</span></p> <p><span id="s436">[DL] And how long did it take for you to be able to talk about your experiences at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">[AG] Oh, two, three years</span></p> <p><span id="s438">[DL] Why did it take you so long, and who did you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">[AG] Well, in general conversation that’s all</span></p> <p><span id="s440">[DL] And what reaction did you get from the people you told?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">[AG] People that had been in the services were alright, they understood but the majority of people wouldn’t believe it [SNEEZE]</span></p> <p><span id="s442">[DL] The majority of people wouldn’t believe you were in E175 Auschwitz, or wouldn’t believe what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">[AG] They would, they wouldn’t believe what the Germans had been doing</span></p> <p><span id="s444">[DL] And did you try to explain to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">[AG] Yeah we tried [SNEEZE], we tried to</span></p> <p><span id="s446">[DL] And did eventually, did you give up trying to explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">[AG] Well, it faded</span></p> <p><span id="s448">[DL] Would you say there wasn’t very much interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">[AG] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s450">[DL] What did you do after the war, as a job and did you actually finally retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">[AG] O I was, I er, went to a factory here down at Yatonfordhigh, they got declared bankrupt, then I went back on the building, I joined the constabulary, went on for a bit, then I became a civilian member of the constabulary</span></p> <p><span id="s452">[DL] Did you ever return to
