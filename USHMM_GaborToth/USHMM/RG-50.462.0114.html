Tape one, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s3">PS: This is Phil Solomon, interviewing a U.S. Army Veteran of World War II.</span> <span id="s4">The gentleman prefers to remain anonymous.</span> <span id="s5">The date is November 10, 1987.</span> <span id="s6">Sir, can you please tell me where in Europe and in what unit you were serving before you arrived at the site of the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">LIB: I was a CIC [Counter Intelligence Corps], special agent, military intelligence, war department, at the rank of Captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">PS: Did you, can you, do you recall about what date you arrived at the sight of the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">LIB: It was Dachau.</span> <span id="s10">I believe it was in April.</span> <span id="s11">We were sent in to interrogate Nazis that had stayed there, because they--through my interpreter, I was told that they thought that the United States government would be easier on them if they told the truth, and they also were afraid that the Russians would kill them.</span> <span id="s12">There were men and women, Nazi soldiers, at the camp, and, oh, when I entered the camp, let me to tell you what I saw first.</span> <span id="s13">When I had entered the camp, with approximately six or seven other agents for interrogation, I was taken by the, by some of the Nazis, I was taken to one building which was an outside building.</span> <span id="s14">I believe there were five or six ovens.</span> <span id="s15">The ovens were open.</span> <span id="s16">You could still smell the flesh, the bodies that were burnt in the oven.</span> <span id="s17">In fact I can still remember today what the smell smells like.</span> <span id="s18">Behind the ovens still it was dried blood.</span> <span id="s19">You could see blood on the back, on the walls.</span> <span id="s20">And I was taken further down in the camp.</span> <span id="s21">There was a hanging post.</span> <span id="s22">I was told by the Nazis that stayed behind, through my interpreter, that the post was used for any of the prisoners in Dachau that worked for the officers in their living quarters.</span> <span id="s23">That if anyone was caught stealing they would be hung.</span> <span id="s24">There was a major, I do not remember his name.</span> <span id="s25">This has been so long ago.</span> <span id="s26">And if anyone was caught, he would take them out and have them hung in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s27">Through my interpreter, one of the Nazis told me that this major had taken a fourteen-year-old boy outside in the middle of the night and hung him because he was caught stealing; it was either bread or some potatoes, in the officers' quarters.</span> <span id="s28">And I was also told that this Nazi, this major, got a kick out of it, and thought it was fun, like a hobby.</span> <span id="s29">And I also was told that he had several people hung.</span> <span id="s30">This was outside of one of their officers' quarters.</span> <span id="s31">And I also saw a pile of bodies that was covered by army tarps.</span> <span id="s32">That's further on down in the camp.</span> <span id="s33">I was not allowed to look at the, further down in the camp, at the gas, where they gassed, where they gassed the people that they had there.</span> <span id="s34">Because it was all surrounded by the army troops.</span> <span id="s35">As I say, I was only there for interrogation, and the Nazis that stayed behind, I would like to emphasize, that they said that they only stayed behind because they would be treated fairly if they told us the truth, which we did give them our word, and that they were afraid the Russians would kill them.</span> <span id="s36">The high-ranking officers did not stay there.</span> <span id="s37">In other words, they were taken away by the United States Army, when they had first arrived to take over the camp.</span> <span id="s38">I'm trying to remember what else I can remember it's so long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">PS: The German officers that you mentioned...</span></p> <p><span id="s40">LIB: They, some of the German officers and some of the German Nazis there were also women--male, and female, who stayed behind in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">PS: They were there when the camp was liberated by the First...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">LIB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">PS: They were there in the camp then?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">LIB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">PS: And you say, you said that they remained voluntarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">LIB: Voluntarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">PS: Within the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">LIB: Because they were told they would get better treatment, and we were sent there to interrogate them, through my interpreter, who spoke five languages.</span> <span id="s49">I do speak broken German myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PS: Before you arrived at the camp, had you heard anything at all about the mass murder of Jews and political prisoners and others in Germany at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">LIB: No, only through rumors while I, before I was sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">PS: Now you said...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">LIB: About our job, about the nomenclature of our job was what to do or expedite when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PS: Expedite the interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">LIB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">PS: In this interrogation, are you free to reveal things that were revealed to you, or to the general intelligence agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">LIB: Only my name and the officers in charge of my unit.</span> <span id="s58">I cannot give the names.</span> <span id="s59">But I am telling the God's honest truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">PS: Was there anything revealed in the interrogation of these Germans that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s61">LIB: They were Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PS: Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">LIB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">PS: They were in the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">LIB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">PS: S.S. also?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">LIB: Yes, S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">PS: And some who served within the prison as guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">LIB: As guards, as guards, and more or less, I would say as a strong arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">PS: Do you know how many...</span></p> <p><span id="s71">LIB: I would not use the word guard.</span> <span id="s72">I would use the word strong arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">PS: Do you know how many days after the initial liberating troops entered Dachau that your intelligence unit entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">LIB: I would say two to three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">PS: I wonder, these Nazis who remained behind, they were not attacked by the concentration camp survivors who had, who were free at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">LIB: We were told that, but our, the troops that were guarding the place when we had entered, were given strict orders not to harm any of them, and not to let anyone else harm them, because our main objective was to interrogate and find out the truth, to the best of our ability.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">PS: Can you estimate how many prisoners were there when you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">LIB: I would...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">PS: Survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">LIB: I would say, God, I would say, oh, approximately [pause] oh my God, I, I was never told.</span> <span id="s81">I would say approximately six, maybe six to seven hundred, a little less or more.</span> <span id="s82">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">PS: Survivors that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">LIB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">PS: And of course the bodies that you saw, would you say far out numbered the number of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">LIB: I don't know.</span> <span id="s87">I know that was, to my right as you entered the gates, further down there, the building that was guarded by the United States Army, I would say, it's, it's hard to say when you see a pile of bodies, which were covered with United States Army tarps.</span> <span id="s88">In fact you could, the smell was horrible.</span> <span id="s89">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">PS: Sir, you yourself interrogated some of these Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">With other CIC.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">PS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">LIB: Special Agents.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">PS: During that interrogation, did you yourself learn of anything that you didn't know up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s97">About the major that would take some of the people out and hang them in the middle of the night if he thought they stole food while working in the officers' quarters.</span> <span id="s98">And he, I was told by the Nazis that stayed back, that he didn't care whether they were children, men, women.</span> <span id="s99">He got a kick out of it, like it was a game.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">PS: Do you know if this particular camp was set up for Jews only or if it was a mixed camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">LIB: No, it was mixed.</span> <span id="s102">I was told by the Nazis that stayed behind that approximately 80, 85 percent were Jewish, and the other 15 or 20 percent were Poles, Czechoslovakians, and I don't know what other nationalities.</span> <span id="s103">I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">PS: Did you see any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">LIB: No, I did not see any children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">PS: Living, or bodies of children?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">LIB: I did not lift up the tarp to see.</span> <span id="s108">That I do not know.</span> <span id="s109">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s110">PS: Were you given any responsibilities, to sign and arranging for the transfer or care of prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">LIB: No.</span> <span id="s112">Only for interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">PS: Can you describe, did, you have personal contact with some of the prisoners in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">LIB: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">PS: Can you describe the behavior pattern of these Nazi soldiers who, as you say, of their own free will remained behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">LIB: They were very calm, because we had promised them fair treatment.</span> <span id="s117">We would promise them anything to get the truth out of them.</span> <span id="s118">So I know this is the truth, because they were afraid of their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">PS: Did the experience of seeing these prisoners alive and dead, and speaking with the German, the Nazi guards, have any effect on your feeling about being part of the war and fighting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s121">Even up to this day I still remember the smell of the ovens.</span> <span id="s122">What I saw, it was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">PS: Do you recall the reactions of other men in your unit?</span> <span id="s124">Did you talk with them about what you were experiencing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">LIB: Yes, they felt the same way I did.</span> <span id="s126">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">PS: Can you please tell me how long you remained in the camp, and whether your experience lingered after you left.</span> <span id="s128">Has it had any influence on your thinking, as you look back?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s130">Still I cannot forget what I saw, never.</span> <span id="s131">And what I smelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">PS: In your own mind, can you explain German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">LIB: To exterminate, I was told, also in interrogation, that the Nazis told me they were only following orders, and they thought that the Führer, Adolf Hitler, was eliminating people of the world that would only harm Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">PS: How long, approximately, did you remain at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">LIB: Well, I came in, in the morning.</span> <span id="s136">I mean, I know it was in the morning.</span> <span id="s137">And we left, oh my God, I guess we left very late at night.</span> <span id="s138">It must have been at least somewhere around, close to midnight, maybe eleven o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">PS: And that you recall was the latter part of April of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">LIB: It was in April 1945, in April of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">PS: Now, after you left Dachau, can you tell us where you went from there and what your unit participated in after leaving Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">LIB: We went, we went back to Munich, turned in all of our reports, and we still had to go through an oral, we had to go through an oral talk of our, of our investigation, through our interpreters.</span> <span id="s143">And I had also taken pictures.</span> <span id="s144">I didn't take them.</span> <span id="s145">I had another investigator with me, another special agent had taken pictures--of the ovens, of the bodies, of the hanging post, which was the most horrendous thing I could, one could even picture.</span> <span id="s146">And we had to turn them in.</span> <span id="s147">It was, why I don't know.</span> <span id="s148">And there are certain things that I am not able to talk about, and certain names.</span> <span id="s149">Now, the major that would have these people hung, when they were caught stealing food, I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s150">If I did, I would give the name.</span> <span id="s151">I also was told by the Nazis that stayed back that he would make an excuse up to find someone stealing, even if they did or did not steal, just to keep himself busy.</span> <span id="s152">He enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s153">He was, he was, I guess he had to be crazy or, I don't know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">PS: This major of whom you speak, he was not one of those who remained behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">LIB: No, he was taken out, immediately on the first wave, when the whole American troops...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">PS: Oh he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">LIB: ... came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">PS: He was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">LIB: He was taken out on the first wave, immediately.</span> <span id="s160">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s161">PS: At the time that you were witness to the concentration camp at Dachau, were you aware at that time that this was just one of many Nazi concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">LIB: No, I knew there was more, more than that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s163">I heard there was more.</span> <span id="s164">I was never to any other concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">PS: When you left Dachau, you say you and your unit reported back to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">LIB: To headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: Yeah, the headquarters.</span> <span id="s168">And you gave your reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">LIB: To our commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">PS: Right.</span> <span id="s171">Then, where did you go from there, from Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">LIB: I was sent to transportation quarter, headquarters, for other assignments, which had nothing to do with prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">PS: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">LIB: For under cover as a CIC agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">PS: Between then and the time you left Europe, were you in contact in any other way with any other concentration camps or Displaced Persons Camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">LIB: Not with any camps, but certain agents that were my friends and were with me.</span> <span id="s177">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s178">PS: After the war, you say that you were a part of administration or investigative work within DP camps, Displaced Persons' Camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">LIB: Yes, I stayed for the occupation until 19-, I left approximately 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PS: Which was...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">LIB: I was stationed at Coburg, Germany, which had, I believe, the largest DP camp in Europe, which was mostly Jewish, and Polish.</span> <span id="s182">But like Dachau I would say, it was 90 percent Jewish.</span> <span id="s183">And our job was to search the DP camp in Coburg.</span> <span id="s184">They would wake us up three o'clock in the morning, four o'clock in the morning, in the afternoon, to go into the camp, search each room, and we would search for gold, silver, watches, rings.</span> <span id="s185">We were not told why.</span> <span id="s186">When we did find them, we would have to turn everything over to our commanding officer and in the room, I'd like to emphasize in the DP camp in Coburg, Germany, some of the rooms were as big as the room I'm sitting in now, which would be--what size room do you think I'm sitting in now, approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">PS: Oh, I would say about 10 by 15?</span> <span id="s188">About 15 foot square.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">LIB: There would be families in each room.</span> <span id="s190">Some families would have approximately seven, six, eight people in one room.</span> <span id="s191">And they, we also had the biggest riot at this camp, because of waking up the people, searching them all times, night, morning.</span> <span id="s192">We were never told why, only what to look for.</span> <span id="s193">Up to this day I still don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PS: Were these people of which you speak mainly survivors of Nazi concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">LIB: Some of them were, yes.</span> <span id="s196">Some of them were, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">PS: Now, most of the concentration camps were liberated, oh, pretty much during the month of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s198">These people, therefore, had been in the camp for approximately how long a period at the time that you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">LIB: Well, that I don't know what time, how long they were there.</span> <span id="s200">This--I was stationed in Coburg, assigned to this duty in 1946, or 1947.</span> <span id="s201">It's been so long ago.</span> <span id="s202">I do remember the camp was, the building of the camp was an ex-German Army post, which was all marble.</span> <span id="s203">Everything was marble, the walls, the floors.</span> <span id="s204">And we also had to have guards inside the building, with rifles, outside of the building, outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s205">When we had the riot, which was in 1946, when the DP camp rioted, our outfit had to come in with fixed bayonets, loaded rifles, and they were told--of course I wasn't told, because I was only there for interrogation--but I was there and watched that if anyone tried to walk out of the compound, out of the camp, or try to climb over the fence, the orders were to shoot or bayonet.</span> <span id="s206">Why?</span> <span id="s207">I do not know.</span> <span id="s208">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">PS: And again you s..</span> <span id="s210">.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">LIB: Up to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">PS: And again you say that these people were survivors of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">LIB: Some of them were, yes.</span> <span id="s214">Some of them, well, I was told some of them were, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">PS: Were there charges against these people that you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">LIB: No, no.</span> <span id="s217">They were only, they were only, there until the United States government could find other towns and houses to spread them out.</span> <span id="s218">Because I also went on trains with the DPs from Coburg, to various towns, where they would be set up to go back to wherever they had lived before, or, we were never told why.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">PS: You say that you had orders to shoot or bayonet.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">LIB: I didn't have orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">PS: Well I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">LIB: The troops had orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">PS: Yeah, the troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">LIB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">PS: Therefore, we would assume that these people were not given the freedom to leave the confines of the grounds...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">LIB: They were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">PS: When they wished?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">LIB: No.</span> <span id="s229">No they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">PS: Were there many attempts, do you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s231">LIB: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">PS: To escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">LIB: Not really escape.</span> <span id="s234">It's so hard to explain.</span> <span id="s235">They were fed.</span> <span id="s236">They were given medical treatment.</span> <span id="s237">But the living conditions was just, I guess it was the best that the United States government could do.</span> <span id="s238">Like I say, in one room I--when they would go on raids--I would have to go as an, for interrogation if someone was found with something they would be interrogated why they had it, where did they get it.</span> <span id="s239">But I was never told why we had to search each room at the DP camp in Coburg.</span> <span id="s240">Everything that was of any value, which, when I mean of value, a watch, a ring, anything that was gold, silver, of any value.</span> <span id="s241">And each room would be searched.</span> <span id="s242">It would have to be turned over to our commanding officer.</span> <span id="s243">I would ask why, what is the reason for it?</span> <span id="s244">Aren't they allowed to own anything?</span> <span id="s245">I was never given a reason why.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">PS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">LIB: I still don't know, up to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">PS: And these people to your knowledge were not enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">LIB: No, no.</span> <span id="s250">They did receive their food, medical treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">PS: As to the medical treatment, would you say there were adequate doctors and adequate medical supplies available?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">LIB: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s253">Yes, I would say that.</span> <span id="s254">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">PS: For the most part?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">LIB: I believe one of the main reasons I was also told, I did speak broken German and I did have an interpreter at my side at all times, no matter where I went.</span> <span id="s257">I once told my interpreter, which I wasn't--I was breaking regulations--that they were so tired of being locked up in one room.</span> <span id="s258">They weren't locked in the room.</span> <span id="s259">They were so tired of being billeted in one room, and so many people, not enough bathroom facilities, six and seven people.</span> <span id="s260">This included the families, the children, the husband, the wife, in one room, with a, three or four toilets on one floor to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s261">They were just tired of living the way they were.</span> <span id="s262">But we had no other place to put them.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">PS: For the most part, were there many deaths among the residents during the time that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">Like, someone would die of maybe pneumonia or old age, but it wasn't through no fault of not receiving medical treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">PS: You would say probably that many of the deaths were caused by their long...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">LIB: Natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">PS: Well, and their weakened condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">LIB: And weakened condition, but they were fed very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">LIB: And they did receive...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">PS: But they were for...</span></p> <p><span id="s273">LIB: Good medical help.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">PS: They were for the most part, though, survivors of concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s276">I don't know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">PS: So that their physical condition probably was poorer to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">LIB: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s279">But I would say in this camp in Coburg, there had to be approximately, oh my gosh, close to a thousand, I would say, close to a thousand people.</span> <span id="s280">Or maybe eight or nine hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">PS: Would you say that considering the available facilities that these people received the best care that could be afforded them at the time and place?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">LIB: At the time, yes, because this, this, this was was right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">PS: Do you have any idea of how long these people lived under these conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">LIB: Well, I was only stationed there for approximately eight months before I was transferred.</span> <span id="s285">I was transferred to another constabulary, which was the 53rd constabulary, in Füssen, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">PS: Do you know, who administered this camp?</span> <span id="s287">Relief organizations or...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">LIB: The United States government.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">PS: Oh, this was directly under the care of the United States government.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">LIB: United States government.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">PS: Did this include, do you know, people who were, who survived camps other than concentration camps that the U.S. Army liberated?</span> <span id="s292">In other words, like Bergen-Belsen was liberated by the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">LIB: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">PS: There were?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">LIB: Were mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">PS: They were all mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">LIB: All mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s299">PS: Doing the interview by Phil Solomon, on November 10th, 1987.</span> <span id="s300">There were no other governments then involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">LIB: No other...</span></p> <p><span id="s302">PS: Among the French or the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">LIB: Only the United States Army.</span> <span id="s304">I also would like to say that I was told one reason why the search and seizure for contraband at the DP camp in Coburg, we were told that black market, they may be used for black market.</span> <span id="s305">But I still couldn't understand what would be the difference.</span> <span id="s306">I don't know how they could use it for black market, because they were not allowed to leave the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">PS: Again, getting back to the people who were residents of this DP camp, did these people perform any physical work or services during the stay?</span> <span id="s308">Those physically able, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">LIB: No, only to keep the camp clean.</span> <span id="s310">That is all.</span> <span id="s311">Only to keep the camp clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">PS: Were any German civilians employed within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">LIB: No.</span> <span id="s314">No.</span> <span id="s315">It was strictly forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">PS: Were there any attempts to locate the families of these survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">LIB: Oh yes, yes, but I had nothing to do with that department.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">PS: But there were attempts.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">LIB: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">PS: To your knowledge, there were attempts being made.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">LIB: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s322">Yes.</span> <span id="s323">In fact when they did find relatives they would try to ship them out in boxcars.</span> <span id="s324">I went with boxcars with displaced persons.</span> <span id="s325">And it was, I mean they were in boxcars, no seats, no nothing.</span> <span id="s326">Maybe 50 to 75 people in one boxcar at a time.</span> <span id="s327">And then they'd stop at a town and the boxcar would be opened, and then food was given, water.</span> <span id="s328">But it was the best we had with the, with so many people, with, it's all we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">PS: Yeah, sir, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">LIB: The transportation was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">PS: You yourself do feel comfortable in the fact that the best possible was done for these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">LIB: No, I don't really feel comfortable now, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">PS: Is there anything in particular that does disturb you regarding this?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">LIB: There should have been more help given, more food, more water, better way of transportation.</span> <span id="s335">That was, in my opinion it, there could have been a more humane way for the nomenclature of the transportation of these displaced persons, in my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">PS: And you do feel that given all the facilities available, it would have been possible to care for them in a little better manner?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s338">I don't know who would have the authority to do that.</span> <span id="s339">I do know that myself, and many of the troops would give extra candy, if they had it, for the children, and anything they could find, to make their trips more comfortable.</span> <span id="s340">But there was no way the trips could be comfortable, because some of the places they were taken from, the camp were 60, 75, 100 miles where they had to be relocated.</span> <span id="s341">So it was, it was very inhumane but...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">PS: Do you believe that any of them were transported to possibly other Displaced Persons Camps where the facilities would have been, where there would have been more room and they wouldn't have been as confined as they were in this particular camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">LIB: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s344">I really don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">PS: Were you aware of the distribution system that was used at this camp?</span> <span id="s346">In other words, were they released and transported mostly in cases where families were located?</span> <span id="s347">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s348">LIB: No, oh, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">PS: Or, do you have any idea how long a period of time most people remained here?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">LIB: Well, I stayed there approximately eight months before I was transferred, and I would, I used to know some of the people stayed there so long that I would know them by name.</span> <span id="s351">Like, "Good morning Mr. So-and-so, or Mrs. So-and-so," so I know that some of them stayed there at least six months, maybe longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">PS: In your own mind, can you explain the German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">LIB: Only what the Nazis had told me that were left back at Dachau, that Hitler wanted to get rid of the Jews, especially the Jews.</span> <span id="s354">That they were just no good to his country.</span> <span id="s355">And they would always say they were following orders.</span> <span id="s356">To them it didn't even seem like they were, when they were being interrogated, that they weren't even doing anything wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">PS: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">LIB: It's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">PS: Did any of the prisoners you liberated ever contact you or your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">LIB: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">PS: Do you think that your, do you think that you would have felt the same toward the war, that you would have had the same feelings had you not had these experiences and been eyewitness to the atrocities in concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">LIB: Yes.</span> <span id="s363">Yes, because it was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">PS: Sir, would you like to add anything to your testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">LIB: I just wish that the United States government, and the other governments of occupation had of taken care of the displaced persons far more better than they did.</span> <span id="s366">It should have been set up more humane.</span> <span id="s367">There could have been more room for them, but when I, when I look back I can't think of any other place we could have put the Displaced Persons.</span> <span id="s368">There were so many of them, but, so many, thousands, so many of them.</span> <span id="s369">I would see them come in and out, trainloads, boxcars.</span> <span id="s370">And I was always mad because they transported them in boxcars.</span> <span id="s371">Because, that would be the same way as Hitler had the people taken to the concentration camps, in boxcars.</span> <span id="s372">That's my only criticism I really have.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PS: And yet, wouldn't you say that, according to your standards, the treatment and the conditions under which they lived was far from the best, and yet considering they had just been snatched from the jaws of death, from concentration camps, that this was in your opinion a tremendous step in their salvation, in their liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">LIB: Yes, because I believe that in the back of many of their minds, when I would talk to them, on the side, that it was like bringing back memories and fear of not knowing what really is gonna happen, when they reach the next town.</span> <span id="s375">I was told that by many of the DPs.</span> <span id="s376">And I would always try to console them and tell them, "Well, this is the best transportation we have.</span> <span id="s377">I don't know any other way."</span></p> <p><span id="s378">PS: Sir, we thank you very, very much, for your important testimony.</span> <span id="s379">Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">LIB: You are quite welcome.</span></p></body></html>
