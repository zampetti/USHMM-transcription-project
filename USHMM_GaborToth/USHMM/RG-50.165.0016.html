(WH narrates:…very conversational, she sells antiques, the house looks like a museum…chairs here…a wall…cupboards…closets…tables, chairs of all sizes, shapes and description types-it looks sort of like a loft transplanted from Soho to Deep River, CT., a very quiet town and this looks very, very typical New England.</span> <span id="s13">She sells her paintings and as she says, if she gets two buyers a week, that is a lot.</span> <span id="s14">She makes a point that the survivors are very, very meticulous-they’re very, very concerned about cleanliness.</span> <span id="s15">They are very, as she puts it in her own words, antiseptic.</span> <span id="s16">Antiseptic is the word she used.</span> <span id="s17">That they care-that everything has to be cleaned because they had to live with dirt for so long and I can say that every pillow here is made up perfectly and every room is made up perfectly, the feeling you get is someone very, very busy.</span> <span id="s18">She has to work all day and night on her manuscripts and on her papers-she only sells antiques in order to live off…must be painless).</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: Okay, Irene, you have one sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">ID: I have one sister, five years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: And do you have any brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">ID: No, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">WH: And how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">ID: Two.</span> <span id="s25">Nicole and Alexandria.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WH: Your-.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">ID: Oh, you have it all prepared!</span></p> <p><span id="s28">WH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">ID: I really am in awe of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WH: Why is that?</span> <span id="s31">That I have prepared the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">ID: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH; Oh, I…</span></p> <p><span id="s34">ID: …so scientific.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: One has to.</span> <span id="s36">What was your father’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">ID: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: None?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">ID: He was a self-fashioned.</span> <span id="s40">.</span> <span id="s41">he was a con artist, that was his occupation.</span> <span id="s42">Do you know what a ‘var shal a goniff’ is?’</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: Yes, I know Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">ID: Well, that was what he was.</span> <span id="s45">And I’m going right into his footsteps.</span> <span id="s46">I’m the Polish mafia.</span> <span id="s47">I’m not kidding you.</span> <span id="s48">He knew how to repair watches, sometimes, but his idea of making money was to go to horse races and get dressed to kill in English cut jackets and win on horses.</span> <span id="s49">Sometimes he won and sometimes he lost.</span> <span id="s50">And if he lost, to recapture his finances, he never went to work, of course, because that’s…what he did.</span> <span id="s51">He scared up a game of poker and he recaptured it playing cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">ID: The other way he made money is to visit his mother-in-law who was a pushover for him and was a wealthy dowager.</span> <span id="s54">And he would go to the house on Friday night and…while having dinner, he’d catch her for(?)</span> <span id="s55">…just for the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WH: How did your mother feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">ID: How my mother felt-she was insane about him because he was so attractive and charming.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">ID: It was impossible to resist him.</span> <span id="s60">There’s nobody who could resist him.</span> <span id="s61">No way.</span> <span id="s62">He was like Nelson Rockefeller…with charm…bubbly and…</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WH: It’s amazing that with his talent, right, that he could not become a survivor…you said he was the first person killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">ID: Well, you see, the thing was, I really should amend my answers about his profession.</span> <span id="s65">He did know how to repair watches…he was very lazy, he never even shaved.</span> <span id="s66">He had an attendant coming to shave him in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: Did he have any sort of Jewish identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">ID: Ah, he went when he was forced</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: But not as an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">ID: He went as an adult, a little bit.</span> <span id="s71">I suppose he was Bar Mitzvah, but I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s72">And he came from, not an orthodox, but semi-orthodox family…of merchants.</span> <span id="s73">He was not an intellectual, he could hardly read or write.</span> <span id="s74">He didn’t finish high school, and now myself when I go to a fancy client’s house to Park avenue dinner party, and I deliver myself of an oration or a monologue straight from Chekhov, the first question that I give people the chance to ask me, and they say, What did your father do?</span> <span id="s75">Was he a diplomat?</span> <span id="s76">Was he a professor?</span> <span id="s77">He must have been brilliant!</span> <span id="s78">And I say, He could hardly read or write.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: What was your mother like?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">ID: My mother was brilliant…so, anyway, my mother was very good in the sciences, she was good in the art, she was good in the languages, she was quadrilingual…at least she was good in music…but she was a meek person, which I didn’t respect.</span> <span id="s81">I loved my mother, but I didn’t like her and I criticize her and I yell at her all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: …at the time the war broke out you were fifteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">ID: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: And you were already in gymnasium school?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">ID: Well, you see…these professors…who were part of our school that was closed up by the Germans and we had tutorial lessons in different specialties…</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: During the war, you were in the Ghetto during the first part of the war until ’43 and then you went into hiding as you indicated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">ID: Yes.</span> <span id="s88">My father arranged for the escape…excuse me for a minute to interject, to get back to your original question of about five points back, chronologically speaking, when you asked me about if my father was so smart and shrewd and could survive by his wits, why didn’t he escape.</span> <span id="s89">Because he arranged for me first to get out because I was the strongest and I would lay the territory for everybody.</span> <span id="s90">He got me and the false papers and then he arranged for my mother and my sister…the day of his escape… arranged with a guard…that day the started burning the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s91">I was in a bus with that lady from Brazil I was telling you about who said you could only have one dinner a night.</span> <span id="s92">I was on the bus and I saw the flames from under the wall.</span> <span id="s93">I had to keep my face straight and I realized that my father would never escape alive…I didn’t want to give myself away by crying when everybody (on the bus) kept saying, ‘great, the Jews are burning alive, they deserve it.’</span> <span id="s94">…my first hiding place was in a jewelry shop…without any facilities…I was alone…we could not exist as a family…we all had authentic Christian papers purchased from a priest…with different names and geographical locations…my name was Barbara Sawicka…because of being locked in the shop every night with a dead bolt I developed claustrophobia…it was like being burned alive!</span> <span id="s95">…no shrink can take (this fear) away from me!</span> <span id="s96">I have spent thousands of dollars with psychiatrists…I have lost some very good clients (because of it).</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: After the war, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ID: I went first…liberated by the Russians (in Berlin)…when Allied forces came…the section near…the airport…I worked (there)…it’s a munitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">WH: You went back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">ID: …I walked from Berlin to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s101">715 miles…</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: How long did it take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">ID: Five to six weeks on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: (walked 15 miles a day)…you got some rides, I take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">ID: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: No one picked you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">ID: No.</span> <span id="s108">(traveled with very little food.)</span></p> <p><span id="s109">WH: How did you have the strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">ID: I was swollen with hunger…that’s why I do not know how to drive.</span> <span id="s111">This is another residue of war.</span> <span id="s112">All my money goes to my drivers.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: …why does it affect your ability to drive?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">ID: Anything to do with transportation, I freak out…I’m scared to drive…after the war…I met my mother and sister…I love these people who rent penthouses and…townhouses.</span> <span id="s115">We rented a corner of a room.</span> <span id="s116">We were really rich, you see…I guess G-d decided to reimburse me for that inconvenience and this is how I ended up in a mansion of 36 rooms in Essex.</span> <span id="s117">I had to overcompensate.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: How long were you in Warsaw before you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">ID: …maybe a month or two…until we could get to…Austria…we went to…a very famous displaced persons camp…we were in Austria about a year…with my mother and sister…</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WH: You arranged for transport on the S.S. Marine Perch…</span></p> <p><span id="s121">ID: We were brought here under false pretenses.</span> <span id="s122">That’s the most important part of the story…my father had a brother who was a goddamned bastard…a doctor…and you as a psychologist or socialist should know that every Jewish parent wants to have a son (and here she raises her voice in mimicry, as she said: ) who’s a doctor!</span> <span id="s123">…and they promised us the sky in the letters…</span></p> <p><span id="s124">WH: He was here during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">ID: He was here because he studied in Switzerland…and he and my aunt…became very American.</span> <span id="s126">So American you could just throw up…like John Birch Society American…this uncle spoke English with a heavy Jewish accent, had terrible manners…undesirable in my book…He couldn’t measure up to my father (knows the bitterness)…he was a Colonel in the army, Professor at John Hopkins University, Professor at Louisville, KY and Director at VA hospital.</span> <span id="s127">He was very humanitarian in one way…his name was Dr. Joshua Ehrlich…my sister (married a doctor and lives in Chicago)…he, (my uncle) wrote us these glowing letters…(that he)…will adopt…(me and my sister)…(he said: ) we love you children!</span> <span id="s128">…we (will) educate them…my German was perfect, my Latin almost as good as an Episcopalian priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">WH: This is in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">ID: (yes).</span> <span id="s131">We came here because I wanted to be a Freudian analyst…I could have made, without any aggrandizing, I will tell you that I would have made the most brilliant analyst…he (my uncle) promised to send me to study medicine at Louisville, KY…but the affidavit was made out…by a granduncle…who had limited savings…who lived in Washington, PA…the affidavit promised us education (so we would not be a burden to society)…we were torn because my mother was a member of HaShomer Hatzair…she was a Zionist and I was brought up in a very Jewish, religious home…my grandparents…were famous Jewish philanthropists…the most famous in Warsaw (on my mother’s side)…Rubelchick (?)</span> <span id="s132">…we all wanted to go to Israel…a kibbutz after a slave labor camp in Versailles.</span> <span id="s133">It just depends what you compare it with.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: …(why didn’t you go to Israel after you came to America?)</span></p> <p><span id="s135">ID: …very hard to go to Israel after having any of the luxuries here.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WH: What about the possibility of going to Israel before you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">ID: My uncle…he was dying to see the…two little cutie girls…under false promises lured us here…I’m full of hate and venom like a snake outside a zoo (for the uncle)…(he) was not even waiting for us at the pier…he sent my aunt…when we got off the Marine Perch…and we only had one suitcase between myself, my sister and mother and seven dollars.</span> <span id="s138">I thought that they were going to take us to Louisville, KY and put us to school…instead they gave us…to other relatives, my mother’s cousins…in Brooklyn…we realized that…we’re not going to school…my mother had to work in a factory…my aunt took me to Louisville, KY…I came here in 1947…and (she) wanted me to become a physical therapist and marry a Jewish doctor…last thing on my mind so I went back…(told to be a factory worker at a corset factory and receive training)…the crime was…that we were brought here under false pretenses…she (my mother) could have blackmailed my uncle and say that she gonna write a letter to Washington to say that they lied about our education…(so we could have received money to go to school).</span> <span id="s139">I was so angry I did not go to his funeral.</span> <span id="s140">I’m very vindictive.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WH: What could he gain from bringing you over (here to America?)</span></p> <p><span id="s142">ID: He thought he’d have two children who would worship…him because he was a Jewish doctor…and I had no respect for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WH: Why didn’t he bring you to Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">ID: Because he claimed I wasn’t intellectual enough to make it…the character of the Jewish people isn’t always very good.</span> <span id="s145">It’s avaricious and mean…(I think)…he wanted us to pay back for this hardships…the second generation of the survivors…the parents say they worked in the sweat shops and they say, ‘we had it hard, so you shouldn’t have it so easy’ They didn’t learn from the war.</span> <span id="s146">Many of them had no business surviving…useless individuals…being mourned only by your family that means you haven’t made a big dent in society.</span> <span id="s147">You have to touch at least 2,000 lives in order to have any justification for being here.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">WH: What was the trip like…on the Marine Perch?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">ID: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s150">It was steerage.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">WH: You were in a big dormitory like room?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">ID: …20 people in steerage…</span></p> <p><span id="s153">WH: Were all the people Jewish on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">ID: They had to be…(in order to be on this boat).</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WH: How long was the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">ID: Eleven to thirteen days…it was a terrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: What did one do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">ID: Throw up (get sick).</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WH: What was your first impression when you sailed into New York Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">ID: I didn’t see my uncle’s face…I was full of hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WH: How about the buildings-the Island of Manhattan…the Statue of Liberty…mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">ID: Not at all.</span> <span id="s163">I couldn’t give a good goddamn.</span> <span id="s164">I didn’t like the design of the sculpture…my aesthetic sensibilities made me realize what a tourist trap.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: …any trouble going through customs (after your aunt met you)?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">ID: No, I had nothing to declare.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">WH: You went to Brooklyn then?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">ID: We went to Brooklyn with a cousin of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s169">(Mother’s family in Poland had a leather tannery…supplied…leather to the Polish cavalry…cousin in America in the same business…this cousin met us at the pier…we got an apartment in Long Island City…my cousin paid rent for us for a whole year.</span> <span id="s170">$60.00 a month he paid for us…my sister went to…high school there, and I went to Hunter College at night and my mother worked in the garment district.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WH: Did you get help from any organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">ID: No, they helped to make me miserable.</span> <span id="s173">They had idiots working for them…no sensitivity…(HIAS) didn’t understand that we were from a different strata of society than most of the other survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: (This shows the bitterness of status loss.</span> <span id="s175">Some survivors, she says, were, in essence, low lifes.)</span></p> <p><span id="s176">ID: …I am a snob.</span> <span id="s177">I identify with Park Avenue and not Brooklyn because I was brought up to be a snob…because (that class) are philanthropists, kind people and gave a lot to the city of Warsaw…when my grandfather died we had 2,000 people to the funeral and 5 streets were closed…I say only upper class came to the funeral…my sister says, simple, middle class were there…she’s an idiot, my sister, and suffers from amnesia…survivors are pathological liars.</span> <span id="s178">You have to remember this.</span> <span id="s179">Nobody will tell you this.</span> <span id="s180">If you meet then at the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance, Ladies Auxillary, and you ask them what street they lived on and they forget that means they were in a little town outside of Warsaw…they never remember it as it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">ID: Survivors are sadists…they paying back what they got from the Germans…in trivial ways.</span> <span id="s183">I’ll show what I mean…(?)</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">A Polish survivor comes back from the Riviera and he says, ‘I just came back from the Riviera and I ate in this wonderful restaurant,’ and I’ll say, ‘Can you tell me the name of it?</span> <span id="s186">Maybe I’ll go there when I go.’</span> <span id="s187">‘Oy,’ he says, ‘I forgot the name of it!’</span> <span id="s188">What they doing?</span> <span id="s189">They needling you those goddamn bastards.</span> <span id="s190">They want to tell you and then frustrate you.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WH: (Interview beautifully illustrates the class differences).</span></p> <p><span id="s192">ID: They (the survivors) give and take…I hate the survivors…there are very few that I have any use for.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: That’s a personality trait that I’ve already seen…</span></p> <p><span id="s194">ID: Then you know how perceptive I am… WEH: To get people’s hopes up and then to dash them.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">ID: …I do it all the time…my husband (used to complain that) I gave too much time to the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WH: When you first lived with…the family who paid your rent for the first year…</span></p> <p><span id="s197">ID: I was sent to the Fulton Fish Market.</span> <span id="s198">Worked in the jewelry department…during the war.</span> <span id="s199">I worked as a maid…with my first salary check I went to a book shop.</span> <span id="s200">I bought a Webster’s College Dictionary and I almost totally memorized it… I started (nights) Hunter College in 1949 and graduated in 1956…had menial jobs…lived in Jackson Heights…I hated it because of all the Polish refugees.</span> <span id="s201">(Hated her apartment also because it was small and ugly).</span></p> <p><span id="s202">End of Side #1</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Side #2</span></p> <p><span id="s204">WH: You said they save the money for the children?</span> <span id="s205">(The survivors)</span></p> <p><span id="s206">ID: But I don’t!</span> <span id="s207">I spend it every day because my children are very wealthy and very professional.</span> <span id="s208">Much more than most of the survivors’ children (?)</span> <span id="s209">…I spend $300.00 a month to call survivors to be their support person.</span> <span id="s210">To talk to them.</span> <span id="s211">To make them feel good about life.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">WH: …why do you have a separate book for the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">ID: …when I go to different meetings and somebody gives me a name I have it here and I have different books for my clients…relatives and survivors and Polish people I put (?)</span> <span id="s214">together…if I go to the Warsaw ghetto meeting I like to have it with me.</span> <span id="s215">Maybe I want to call somebody for dinner…but you can never have dinner with them!</span> <span id="s216">‘I have to feed my husband at 5 0’clock!’</span> <span id="s217">And to which I say…when I was in voluntary exile…like when…(I)…was in Jackson Heights when my mother was sick…I said to myself, ‘I know all these people’…who beg me to see them and I come to New York…?</span> <span id="s218">…Beekman Tower Hotel which is extremely expensive because my clients are all on the East Side…I do a lot of business at auctions, (?)</span> <span id="s219">restaurants.</span> <span id="s220">I can’t include the survivors in this kind of sdene…every night I call somebody from this little blue book and I invite them to dinner to a nice restaurant…I know they won’t pay for (it) because they have to save the money for the CHILDREN but I don’t so I can buy them dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">The answers were always like this: ‘Oy, I wish I could.’</span> <span id="s222">‘What’s stopping you, did you get paralyzed?’</span> <span id="s223">‘No…I have to feed my husband dinner.’</span> <span id="s224">‘…can’t you leave him dinner on a tray?</span> <span id="s225">My mother is dying like (?)</span> <span id="s226">a dog.</span> <span id="s227">I need you.</span> <span id="s228">I need your support.’</span> <span id="s229">After five refusals to the person who said ‘no’ I just said in perfect Polish, ‘Don’t call me when your…(father) husband drops dead of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s230">I won’t be holding your hand.’</span> <span id="s231">You’ll have a lot of free evenings…one of the survivors…who is brilliant but an idiot in terms of living…her husband died…and I called her up and I said, ‘I’m so sorry your husband died’ and she said, ‘well, I’m sad but…it’s very inconvenient I have to learn how to drive.’</span> <span id="s232">I said, ‘I don’t know how to drive’ and…she said to me…’When your husband dies you will have to learn how to drive too’…I’ll get a second husband who knows how to drive and will get me a limo and I will pick up him in a bar just the way I picked up the first husband…the survivors are very different.</span> <span id="s233">They think very differently.</span> <span id="s234">And they are very selfish and ungiving…and when you ask them to use the telephone, to me, another fifty dollars, a hundred dollars is like five cents for anybody else.</span> <span id="s235">Not because I’m a millionaire.</span> <span id="s236">It’s because of my attitude.</span> <span id="s237">It costs me $300,00 dollars a month to call the survivors.</span> <span id="s238">I’m the only one in CT (who calls survivors)…they don’t care (how much I spend)…so you know what?</span> <span id="s239">I made myself a note on the telephone.</span> <span id="s240">I said, for every f-cking call to every f-cking survivor who has no business surviving I get myself

religious…we had makeshift temples- we all went to temples.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">WH: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">ID: Yes, in the war.</span> <span id="s514">That’s the American Jew.</span> <span id="s515">Suddenly they became very religious because they look for salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">WH: You don’t believe in G-d, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">ID: I certainly DO!!</span></p> <p><span id="s518">WH: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">ID: A am the most G-d fearing person- I think that every second, G-d is watching me and if I do something that is not nice or cheat somebody in business or do something that isn’t ethical I get killed and go to hell.</span> <span id="s520">(?)</span> <span id="s521">I’m not kidding you.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">WH: Did you believe in G-d before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">ID: …always did…I have two G-ds.</span> <span id="s524">The Christian and the Jewish G-d that’s how I’m doing so well.</span> <span id="s525">Because…the maids that my mother hired…(inaudible)…they took us to church- I went to church every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">WH: But you don’t believe in an exclusively Jewish G-d?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">ID: I believe in higher power but I’m very Jewish oriented.</span> <span id="s528">I can start crying in a Temple in Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s529">I get very sentimental.</span> <span id="s530">My grandfather went to shul every Friday night and I remember that he had a tallis and all those little square things…what are those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">WH: Tfellin.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">ID: Yeh, all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">WH: Did your parents keep anything in the house when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Id: Kosher food, I suppose we had and there was also ham and stuff for the maid but we had kosher food…</span></p> <p><span id="s535">WH: Did you keep any of that up when you lived on the West Side?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">ID: My mother did…?</span> <span id="s537">…</span></p> <p><span id="s538">WH: On the West Side, when you lived there…did you see that as a survivor neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">ID: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">WH: Never thought of it…</span></p> <p><span id="s541">ID: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">WH: You didn’t see survivors…?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">ID: I didn’t think about the war right after the war.</span> <span id="s544">I think about the war now ALL the time.</span> <span id="s545">I told you it was 30 years ago…</span></p> <p><span id="s546">WH: Sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">ID: Yeh.</span> <span id="s548">But at that time…what concerned us was every day life- how am I going to survive the fight with my husband- how my children going to go to school- will I have enough money to buy the food in Gristede’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">WH: Speaking of survival…this is a question that…(inaudible) be very interested in, which is, you mentioned, you made some general statements about survivors- why do you think you personally survived the war?</span> <span id="s550">To what would you owe it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">ID: …G-d was watching over me.</span> <span id="s552">That’s the only reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">WH: G-d was watching over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">ID: That’s the only reason and I think…I was rewarded for all the good things that my mother’s family did for humanity and all the people they fed in the kitchen and all the money they give to charity and G-d decided to save part of the family…I can be very sophisticated in art and so on and literature but I basically have a kabbalistic- Polish peasant mind…I always simplify issues like that...I don’t intellectualize them…(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s555">WH: Do you think that if there was a Holocaust now that you’d survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">ID: Probably…although I don’t know I have a quota of very good years so perhaps not.</span> <span id="s557">Maybe I used up my quota</span></p> <p><span id="s558">WH: Do you think that survivors as a group are different…(have)…something that enabled the to survive?</span> <span id="s559">When you look at them as a population- .</span></p> <p><span id="s560">ID: No…because some of the very weak people survived and some of the very robust people did not survive.</span> <span id="s561">My aunt used to steal my rations of bread from me in the camp…</span></p> <p><span id="s562">WH: Did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">ID: She survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">WH: …you go on vacation, don’t you?</span> <span id="s565">…</span></p> <p><span id="s566">ID: As seldom as possible.</span> <span id="s567">I hate vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">ID: Because I like to be between my kitchen sink and my Olivetti typewriter.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">WH: You like to be busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">ID: I like to write or read.</span> <span id="s572">Anything else is a disturbance in my life…</span></p> <p><span id="s573">WH: You don’t have problems concentrating…(inaudible)…</span></p> <p><span id="s574">ID: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">WH: The reason that I ask is because you said a few moments ago that…you think about the war all the time…</span></p> <p><span id="s576">ID: Well, whatever I say, you have to divide by 5 and subtract 30 (?)</span> <span id="s577">because I exaggerate.</span> <span id="s578">I think a lot but it doesn’t interfere with my work.</span> <span id="s579">My work comes first.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">WH: If you took the friends that you have now, say your four best friends, people you regard as your closest friends, how many of them are Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">ID: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">WH: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">ID: …wait a second- one is half Jewish…but he lies…(a) man called me today…he just had an audience with the Pope, he’s Polish Christian but he’s a humanitarian and a (dog lover?)</span> <span id="s584">and so on.</span> <span id="s585">I know him through business.</span> <span id="s586">My best friends are through business.</span> <span id="s587">There are people who (?)</span> <span id="s588">work here become wonderful friends.</span> <span id="s589">My clients are like my club…(?)</span> <span id="s590">very close…two gay women lesbians from Grosse Point.</span> <span id="s591">Multimillionaires and also very literary and brilliant who live in (?)</span> <span id="s592">in an estate on the water…the Jewish people don’t like me.</span> <span id="s593">They didn’t like my father either.</span> <span id="s594">They don’t like me.</span> <span id="s595">They’re jealous of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">WH: Of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">ID: Well I was friendly with George Plimpton, and the Frost family and I was with Town and Country and I worked for Nelson Rockefeller when he was in Newport and all of a sudden they dreamt about what they didn’t do.</span> <span id="s598">So even though they have all the money- and I don’t really have a fortune- if this French artist dies I have 2 million dollars.</span> <span id="s599">Alright.</span> <span id="s600">I have an apartment that’s worth maybe $300, 000 and I have savings of maybe $200,00 so altogether, maybe a million dollars.</span> <span id="s601">That’s not a lot of money today.</span> <span id="s602">But it’s enough for me because my needs aren’t great.</span> <span id="s603">And I don’t have to go to the Riviera.</span> <span id="s604">You ask me about a vacation.</span> <span id="s605">I want to say something about a general observation of the survivors that you will not hear from anybody else.</span> <span id="s606">Ever.</span> <span id="s607">And I would like you to quote it in the book if possible.</span> <span id="s608">When you ask a survivor, ‘How are you?</span> <span id="s609">How Me?</span> <span id="s610">How do you feel?</span> <span id="s611">Are you happy?’</span> <span id="s612">(the phone rings and she shouts: ) F-ck off!!!</span></p> <p><span id="s613">End
