is where you were born and the date of your birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Lily Blayer: I was born in Czechoslovakia in 1916, March 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">EL: And your family lived in what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">LB: Berehove.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">EL: And what kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">LB: My father was in business, a kosher delicatessen and bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">EL: As you were growing up, do you remember any anti-Semitism in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">LB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">EL: So you had non-Jewish friends, Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">LB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">EL: And you did not live in a particularly Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">LB: No, very mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">EL: Was your family observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">LB: Yes, Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">EL: How many were in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">LB: Immediate family?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">EL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">LB: Four of us.</span> <span id="s28">My brother, my parents.</span> <span id="s29">But the family was one hundred people altogether, aunts and cousins, the next immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">EL: Just to jump ahead a little bit, out of those one hundred people, how many survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">LB: About twenty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EL: When war broke out, what were you doing?</span> <span id="s33">Were you working or were you a student?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">LB: I was working in my fatherâ€™s business.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EL: And so you were selling?</span> <span id="s36">A sales person?</span> <span id="s37">Before war broke out, had you heard anything about antisemitism in Germany, about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">LB: Yes, not all the details of what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">EL: And what happened after war came?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">LB: After the war came, we were aware of it.</span> <span id="s41">Poland was occupied in 1939 and everyone was running away from Poland -- civilians and military -- and then we found out when they came into the store and started to ask questions.</span> <span id="s42">Jewish people...what happened to the Jewish people?</span> <span id="s43">Many had not crossed the border, but the military didn't know who were the Jewish people and who weren't.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">EL: But you were in the part of Czechoslovakia, you were in Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">LB: Czechoslovakia, that was one country like the United States has fifty states, we had five states.</span> <span id="s46">I was in the Eastern part close to Poland on the northern part and south, Rumania and Hungary</span></p> <p><span id="s47">EL: Hungary occupied that part of Czechoslovakia where you...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">LB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">EL: And that was right after the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">LB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">EL: And so for a number of years, you lived under Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">LB: Yes, for many years, under Hungary, very bad conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">EL: How did life change for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">LB: It was a..</span> <span id="s55">.</span> <span id="s56">revoked license, any freedom to go out on the streets at certain time, beaten up on the street.</span> <span id="s57">Jewish people, they saw...kicked in the head.</span> <span id="s58">What a bad day.</span> <span id="s59">They could show off, coming to ring the doorbell, you were to serve them or the business would be taken away.</span> <span id="s60">"You want to sell your House?"</span> <span id="s61">and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">EL: And what about the attitudes of your neighbors?</span> <span id="s63">Of the non-Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">LB: Turned against.</span> <span id="s65">Absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s66">Either for fear, or feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">EL: So there was little help?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">LB: Absolutely no help.</span> <span id="s69">If we were inside they thought we were hiding and if we were outside, we were looking for Russian planes.</span> <span id="s70">Accusations.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EL: But your father continued in business?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">LB: Business until 1942 and from then on, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">EL: What happened in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">LB: In 1942, first the license was taken away from all the delis then we tried to make a living from the bakery and they gave a ruling that no Jewish people should be bakery owners -- distributors of flour...and that ended our business completely.</span> <span id="s75">.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">EL: Then how did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">LB: We had some savings and we sold some jewelry and we had part of the equipment from the bakery we had left.</span> <span id="s78">Cutting down everything, cutting down to the necessities.</span> <span id="s79">Even the necessities, we didn't know where they were coming from...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">EL: During those years, did you hear of camps, mass murders, what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">LB: No, we didn't have any radios, newspapers and we could not go out from the state.</span> <span id="s82">We were not in a ghetto but the whole city was a ghetto for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">EL: How many Jews were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">LB: 6000.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">EL: And in the whole town?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">LB: 22,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EL: Out of 22,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">LB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">EL: Then in 1944, Hungary was occupied by Germans.</span> <span id="s90">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">LB: Then it worsened.</span> <span id="s92">It was real fast.</span> <span id="s93">It was occupied March 19 and May 15th, we were taken out of Berehove.</span> <span id="s94">It was a short period because the Russians were close.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">EL: What happened that time?</span> <span id="s96">Were you placed in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">LB: We were placed in a ghetto three weeks after.</span> <span id="s98">My father was taken three days earlier, as a hostage because two families went into hiding and they would not come out.</span> <span id="s99">They would kill one by one the hostages.</span> <span id="s100">Doctors, lawyers, business men.</span> <span id="s101">I Don't know how they took the names.</span> <span id="s102">Everyone was there in the hostage place which was a Jewish club, a very prominent Jewish club.</span> <span id="s103">Every day, we had to take food.</span> <span id="s104">Absolutely nothing was provided.</span> <span id="s105">No sleeping facilities, no food, no sanitary -- absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s106">Then it took four weeks and then one day they said they would get all the Jews, in the whole city...everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EL: They never found the two families?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">LB: No.</span> <span id="s109">The families returned.</span> <span id="s110">The whole family returned.</span> <span id="s111">That was the only Jewish family to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">EL: Did you ever think of going into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">LB: There was a time when we could have gone into hiding but I didn't want to take my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EL: What about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">LB: My brother was taken so early, he was taken first to Sortov, Leiberg and each one was not like a military thing and it didn't sound like he was going to be taken away and we were satisfied with that but there was no other choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">EL: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">LB: That was in about 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">EL: So he was in the labor camps all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">LB: All those years...but it got worse and worse because the Hungarian government always had new rulings, new written laws and that was put under people whatever they were doing.</span> <span id="s120">First there were military and then they took every uniform there to have their own clothing.</span> <span id="s121">All the men, they were all young men.</span> <span id="s122">No women.</span> <span id="s123">And then they were taken from one place to another.</span> <span id="s124">Some were shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s125">My brother, somehow he got a medical...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">EL: Getting back to 1944, eventually everyone was ordered to assemble for deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">LB: They did it more horribly than it could have been done.</span> <span id="s128">I'm not sure that I can explain it.</span> <span id="s129">They came with a horse and buggy to put things on -- your personal things.</span> <span id="s130">And they allowed us to take mattresses to the ghetto, besides personal things.</span> <span id="s131">And they said you wanted to walk after the buggy and they said "no, H., sit on the top.</span> <span id="s132">Just humiliating the people.</span> <span id="s133">That was the main purpose.</span> <span id="s134">Humiliating always.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">EL: And the non-Jewish population was watching this?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">LB: Oh, with pleasure.</span> <span id="s137">With pleasure.</span> <span id="s138">And we came back, they said only that more came back than went.</span> <span id="s139">Because I was home before the war was over and that they didn't like it that I came back before the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EL: You were in the ghetto then for about a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">LB: A month.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">EL: What was...the ghetto was a part of the rundown city?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">LB: No.</span> <span id="s144">That was a big factory and at that time it was dried by air in the open like a carport and vacated.</span> <span id="s145">They put everyone there on the clay floor, like the brick, and that's what we put our mattresses on.</span> <span id="s146">And we were able to cook something.</span> <span id="s147">That was a community kitchen.</span> <span id="s148">And there were meals served too.</span> <span id="s149">That...Everything was provided by Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s150">The government, local, didn't supply anything and then we just got down our food because we thought we just had just a certain amount of food with us.</span> <span id="s151">It should last longer.</span> <span id="s152">We could eat much better but we got afraid to eat and one day came at...that everybody should turn in their jewelry and they would search everyone and if they should find something, then they would shoot the head of the family and they put everything out.</span> <span id="s153">That was the end of our...Earrings were taken from the ear.</span> <span id="s154">They marched in there.</span> <span id="s155">The Hungarian army...it was the Hungarian army.</span> <span id="s156">It was enough for them.</span> <span id="s157">They didn't need the Nazis.</span> <span id="s158">They did a good Job.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">EL: So this was all Hungarian controlling?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">LB: Cooperation naturally with the Germans.</span> <span id="s161">But from the outside, they didn't come in.</span> <span id="s162">We were already taken then, transferred to cattle wagons and the SS was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EL: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">LB: May 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EL: So everyone was ordered out of the brick factory to assemble at the railroad station?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">LB: Yes, at the big factory, there was a railroad for the business that came into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s167">It was standing there for four weeks because negotiations were going on.</span> <span id="s168">The government or something...6000 tanks, or 600...or how many the Hungarians were asking from the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">EL: Some kind of deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s171">Some kind of dealing was going on and the US government didn't trust the Nazis and this was how they planned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">EL: Did you have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">LB: No, but we knew we were coming to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">EL: Did anyone try to escape?</span> <span id="s175">Did anyone...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">LB: From there?</span> <span id="s177">No.</span> <span id="s178">From the ghetto we had a chance to escape, as I told you.</span> <span id="s179">But there were so many odds against it, I don't know anyone who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">EL: What was the train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">LB: Horrible.</span> <span id="s182">Three days.</span> <span id="s183">We got there on the 18th and they gave us water and little bread, opened the door and threw us the bread.</span> <span id="s184">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s185">People dying -- an infant died -- with mothers there.</span> <span id="s186">It was a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s187">But we knew it.</span> <span id="s188">My father told us.</span> <span id="s189">He said it was the end for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">EL: When you got to Auschwitz, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">LB: Then there were Jewish inmates doing the dirty work -- telling us to keep the children -- they were whispering, give the children to the grandmothers.</span> <span id="s192">We didn't know what that meant.</span> <span id="s193">But we knew they were to be killed.</span> <span id="s194">First my father was separated from us.</span> <span id="s195">The men and the women were separated and then I was separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s196">That was Mengele.</span> <span id="s197">I wanted to kiss my mother but he said, "No, you will see her, don't worry."</span> <span id="s198">And that was it.</span> <span id="s199">I didn't see my father or anything.</span> <span id="s200">We didn't know where my brother was, absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">EL: How did Auschwitz look to you?</span> <span id="s202">Did you smell anything?</span> <span id="s203">Did you see anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">LB: The chimneys were going continuously.</span> <span id="s205">The Jewish inmates who were head of the buildings with the SS, they told us the story, some of them told us something else.</span> <span id="s206">"Don't worry."</span> <span id="s207">But some of them told the truth, that we'd be in there, that's it.</span> <span id="s208">You will see nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">EL: And so after being separated from your parents, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">LB: They took us to a place to take a shower, took away everything and gave us a gray garb to wear, like a uniform type of thing.</span> <span id="s211">They shaved our heads and put a number.</span> <span id="s212">And that was going fast, driving us back and forth, it was going fast, because they knew another transport was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">EL: You were in a state of shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">LB: Somehow, we were in a trance.</span> <span id="s215">Everybody.</span> <span id="s216">Everybody was crying and absolutely going crazy.</span> <span id="s217">Crying for food, their fathers, mothers, sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">EL: Because out of the transport, only a few had been selected to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">LB: Sure.</span> <span id="s220">Some of the sisters were maybe limping a little bit and didn't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">EL: Once you had gotten your prison clothes, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">LB: They put us in the barracks.</span> <span id="s223">Like you see in the picture of a sleeping hall.</span> <span id="s224">1200 slept in one room and they put a big barrel in front of the door and that was the facility.</span> <span id="s225">Sanitary facility and you have to carry that out every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">EL: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">LB: In this one, four weeks.</span> <span id="s228">That was the quarantine.</span> <span id="s229">I don't know.</span> <span id="s230">The Hungarian Jews had this quarantine...</span></p> <p><span id="s231">EL: To see if you had typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">LB: But I don't know because no doctors showed up and they didn't care if you got typhus.</span> <span id="s233">What was the difference?</span> <span id="s234">Then They started to take us out to work -- and taking transport people.</span> <span id="s235">Constantly selection.</span> <span id="s236">We never knew when we'd be taken to another place, because Auschwitz was very close to the Russian side, so they wanted to take us inside Germany, inside Poland because Auschwitz is on the south side.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">EL: But there were also selections for gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">LB: That's what the purpose of selection was.</span> <span id="s239">That's enough if you had a pimple on your body, a little nothing and I get sick to my stomach and I don't want to go.</span> <span id="s240">I got hurt by a shovel and it was draining constantly but still I didn't come home.</span> <span id="s241">And I had best called the selection, I don't know.</span> <span id="s242">I put a bandage on it [her leg].</span> <span id="s243">I was in and out of the hospital and I slept in the hospital one night but then tomorrow, there were selections and they said to get out so I was working in the building and there were selections and we came back from work and we started selections.</span> <span id="s244">We didn't have to jump, just step out of the building, in the main floor and we didn't know where we were going so we went into the washroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">EL: To hide from the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s247">We thought what could happen?</span> <span id="s248">We can survive that or we can go to selection and have less chance to survive that.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">EL: Who did selecting?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">LB: Mengele did, with a nurse and the SS woman.</span> <span id="s251">We just walked.</span> <span id="s252">They just let you walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EL: And this went on constantly?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">LB: Constantly.</span> <span id="s255">When we came home from work, we'd see someone standing there in the barrack and we knew it was selection and we tried to get away.</span> <span id="s256">We couldn't mingle with the other one, if you mingle with the other block, you don't know if the same thing is happening.</span> <span id="s257">And that [her leg] was always draining and full of puss and everything.</span> <span id="s258">And just, they said "Couldn't you do something?"</span> <span id="s259">How could you so something when you are surrounded with electric fence all over and the SS with big German shepherds chasing you and pulling you?</span> <span id="s260">You can't hide or run.</span> <span id="s261">There is no way.</span> <span id="s262">We couldn't run nowhere, in the beginning because one by one, every country was taken.</span> <span id="s263">If you went to Belgium, then Belgium was taken.</span> <span id="s264">We knew it would be taken because soon when Austria was taken, we knew we'd be taken because we heard some news from British radio.</span> <span id="s265">Some people had something, I don't know, it wasn't short wave, something, and we heard something -- but we knew something was happening but it was like being locked in a room and you try to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EL: And it was the same once you got into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">LB: There was no way.</span> <span id="s268">A lot of people tried to get away then we had to stand and then we had to stand and they came in and blew the whistle.</span> <span id="s269">"Out!</span> <span id="s270">Out!"</span> <span id="s271">It could be 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, because they found out someone escaped.</span> <span id="s272">We'd be standing out in the snow, rain, sunshine until they found the person, or couldn't find the person.</span> <span id="s273">Naturally, if they found a person, they'd get shot, because we were always counted.</span> <span id="s274">Three, four times a day, we were counted in groups and before work, after work, when we got to work...always counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">EL: How did prisoners act towards each other?</span> <span id="s276">Was there help?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">LB: There was some help.</span> <span id="s278">But some were special there, because they were there for so many years because we came the last year of the war.</span> <span id="s279">They were there since 1939, the Polish, the Germans.</span> <span id="s280">They were bitter.</span> <span id="s281">They were not too nice.</span> <span id="s282">But when it came to greed, they were so hungry that they'd steal their sister's bread.</span> <span id="s283">They became enemies.</span> <span id="s284">No more human feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">EL: Did you ever have an experience when you were helped by someone else, another prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">LB: Yes, but that was a relative.</span> <span id="s287">I was helped and she risked her life.</span> <span id="s288">There were three lagers, ABC.</span> <span id="s289">I was in the A and she came from the C at 4:00 AM or 3:00 AM and brought something for us because her brother was in the gas chamber and so he was a commander and they have a chance to get some food so she brought me.</span> <span id="s290">It was the only person who helped and some others didn't have any and you couldn't get a contact and the best food.</span> <span id="s291">If they pass by, you were afraid to talk to somebody because the dog was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">EL: What kind of work were you doing most of the time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">LB: In the beginning, we were just carrying stones from one block and back and forth.</span> <span id="s294">It was just tormenting -- no purpose -- and it was in the fog, and the men.</span> <span id="s295">But that was terrible.</span> <span id="s296">The shoes were never tied.</span> <span id="s297">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s298">When we would get back, everything was moist and smelled and the mice...maybe rats...who knows?</span> <span id="s299">When they woke us up walking on us, we just pushed them off and we didn't care and went back to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">EL: When you went out, every night you went back to the camp?</span> <span id="s301">Or was there another camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">LB: No.</span> <span id="s303">Always the same.</span> <span id="s304">And then we were transferred to another camp, to the C-lager.</span> <span id="s305">There were gypsies and before that they killed others gypsies.</span> <span id="s306">And they put in the Jews.</span> <span id="s307">And from there, until there, I was in the hospital, in and out, because of my leg mainly, that was my hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">EL: What did you have to do to get into the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">LB: Just apply for it and if I was qualified then I could go I couldn't go in winter or in very bad conditions.</span> <span id="s310">They said you have a temperature to get in the hospital and the doctor said that was a Jew inmate was helping the SS doctor.</span> <span id="s311">I will help you in, but you will have to have a temperature or something.</span> <span id="s312">If I get caught, I'll be in trouble and it will be on your record.</span> <span id="s313">So go out onto the ice, where you can get real cold and frozen and don't get warm, so you can come in.</span> <span id="s314">I couldn't get a temperature so one day I said I couldn't work and he said, "Let's see your temperature."</span> <span id="s315">It was a little bit and he said that it was good enough.</span> <span id="s316">That's when I got into the hospital and then I was liberated.</span> <span id="s317">It took quite long.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">EL: When the Russians came, you were in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">LB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">EL: Did the SS try to evacuate the hospital before the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s322">They tried to evacuate the hospital, they came back but not forcefully.</span> <span id="s323">Just voluntarily.</span> <span id="s324">They said, "Do you want to go?</span> <span id="s325">Because we will bomb it, explode the hospital.</span> <span id="s326">It is your choice.</span> <span id="s327">Do you want to stay here and die or walk?"</span> <span id="s328">I didn't walk.</span> <span id="s329">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s330">I didn't think I could make it and I had my cousin and she was very sick.</span> <span id="s331">I thought we might survive.</span> <span id="s332">She was more sick than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">EL: So you stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">LB: I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">EL: And then the Russians came and liberated you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">LB: The Russians came and they didn't bring anything, any facilities for inmates, food, and people were dying constantly.</span> <span id="s337">To carry out every day, to carry out the dead.</span> <span id="s338">They called me "strong one" because I had a lot of clothes on, because when all the facilities were opened, we broke open the doors, we meant to get clothes, blankets.</span> <span id="s339">In the beginning, we just walked in.</span> <span id="s340">But the Russians gave us things, warm clothes.</span> <span id="s341">We had absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s342">That was Birkenau.</span> <span id="s343">Then somebody came to look for family.</span> <span id="s344">They were in bad condition.</span> <span id="s345">They were three men I knew from my home town.</span> <span id="s346">They said if they could, they would come back with a sled because Auschwitz was provided, they had food.</span> <span id="s347">The Russians had food.</span> <span id="s348">They had a kitchen.</span> <span id="s349">They came back.</span> <span id="s350">They were pulling the sled...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">EL: From Birkenau to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s353">My cousin was on the sled.</span> <span id="s354">There were four of us.</span> <span id="s355">We couldn't do it because the three men's hands were frozen.</span> <span id="s356">They couldn't pull a little bit.</span> <span id="s357">And then we stopped.</span> <span id="s358">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s359">It was January.</span> <span id="s360">And when you don't have enough nourishment, then you feel cold.</span> <span id="s361">You shiver all the time.</span> <span id="s362">But we made it.</span> <span id="s363">We made it.</span> <span id="s364">We didn't have any heat, and we were in the dark.</span> <span id="s365">No heat, no light after they left, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">EL: And eventually, you went to Berehove and the neighbors weren't happy to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">LB: No.</span> <span id="s368">They were very shocked.</span> <span id="s369">They thought nobody would come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">EL: You mentioned before why you survived.</span> <span id="s371">What enabled you to survive?</span> <span id="s372">Do you feel basically it was luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">LB: It was luck.</span> <span id="s374">Just luck.</span> <span id="s375">A matter of luck.</span> <span id="s376">There was no way to get out.</span> <span id="s377">I feel that if I had to wait for the US to liberate, I didn't have any strength left.</span> <span id="s378">I was fading away.</span> <span id="s379">I was 60 pounds when I came back.</span> <span id="s380">I am now 126 pounds.</span> <span id="s381">There was no way.</span> <span id="s382">Some people are asking, "Why didn't you try to get away?"</span> <span id="s383">But there was no way.</span> <span id="s384">Okay, some people tried, but it was a very low percentage.</span> <span id="s385">We didn't get help from anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">EL: How do you think that the experience you had, how do you think it changed the way you look at things?</span> <span id="s387">How did it change your attitude?</span> <span id="s388">What effects did it have on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">LB: Certain times I'm very bitter.</span> <span id="s390">Honestly, the US didn't come to help early and we had to wait.</span> <span id="s391">And something else, they were asking to bomb Auschwitz's tracks and they were there.</span> <span id="s392">They could have bombed but they were there.</span> <span id="s393">They didn't have to walk there!</span></p> <p><span id="s394">EL: You could hear the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s396">We heard the bombing.</span> <span id="s397">It was at the time I was in the Hospital.</span> <span id="s398">Some, they were bombing...but they were already dead, but the inmates, the Jews.</span> <span id="s399">But that was Russia.</span> <span id="s400">They were closer, the Americans.</span> <span id="s401">But we blame the other inmates when we had a little time and we were back to human a little bit there and where are they?</span> <span id="s402">And there was a God.</span> <span id="s403">We looked up many times and thought it was the same sky that we saw at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EL: Your family was an observant family, before Auschwitz, before living in Berehove, your family was observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">LB: Yes, my father's family and my mother's family -- both very observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">EL: Did you lose faith in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">LB: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s408">I tried to keep it.</span> <span id="s409">Mainly, when I came back and saw what happened because you don't visualize.</span> <span id="s410">You see it but you don't visualize it when you come back to the emptiness.</span> <span id="s411">And I said, "What is this all about?"</span> <span id="s412">I was first fasting on Yom Kippur in Auschwitz, but I haven't fasted since I came back.</span> <span id="s413">I don't feel guilty.</span> <span id="s414">I talked to others a long time ago, we don't talk about it now and we do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">EL: Survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">B We fasted enough.</span> <span id="s417">We did our share and we don't want to fast.</span> <span id="s418">That's all.</span> <span id="s419">It's not that we're convinced that they don't have to do this.</span> <span id="s420">It's just bitterness.</span> <span id="s421">It will stay with us until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EL: What would you say to future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">LB: Try to do everything so that it shouldn't happen again.</span> <span id="s424">That's why I am here.</span> <span id="s425">I will come because I can't take this...

is.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">LB: It is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">EL: But I think it's important...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">LB: It's very important that people should know what happened and that it shouldn't happen again because we allowed evidence and experience in our life.</span> <span id="s432">It's very scary.</span> <span id="s433">Very many...and it's very hard to see it going on again and fight again...</span></p> <p><span id="s434">EL: Let's hope and pray.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">LB: That it shouldn't.</span> <span id="s436">Maybe in modern society, it makes it worse and so many things available, you know what the other side is doing.</span> <span id="s437">That's the point.</span> <span id="s438">It will always be with us.</span> <span id="s439">And it will be very difficult.</span> <span id="s440">We try to lead a normal life -- every survivor -- but it's not the same.</span> <span id="s441">We just schlep.</span> <span id="s442">You do things and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">EL: What has always bothered me is that the murderers are the ones who went back, so many of them, to normal lives...but not the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">LB: But one satisfaction, I don't know if you want to hear it, it's not interesting...when I came back, from the concentration camp....Before we went, one man was bothering our parents, not physically but mentally, and when I was in Auschwitz, I always thought there was another reason why I had to survive, I thought that I would get even with him.</span> <span id="s445">When we came back, I asked my brother where this man was, and he said that he's in a good place, the Russians took him.</span> <span id="s446">There was a place, called Oswego, and they took them and fed them, and made them sick.</span> <span id="s447">The Russians know how to torment people, just like the Germans.</span> <span id="s448">He found there was no available medication, you couldn't get penicillin, just all primitive.</span> <span id="s449">In our store, we sold what was available to see, to eat!</span> <span id="s450">And the drugstore didn't have penicillin, but we had it.</span> <span id="s451">This woman came by.</span> <span id="s452">Her husband was dying and she needed penicillin.</span> <span id="s453">I was there when she came in.</span> <span id="s454">My brother and cousins knew about it.</span> <span id="s455">He said that it was good he was dying.</span> <span id="s456">A lot of people died.</span> <span id="s457">We needed the penicillin for the people who came back.</span> <span id="s458">They are sick.</span> <span id="s459">And he died.</span> <span id="s460">That one thing is satisfaction.</span> <span id="s461">He couldn't be free again.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">EL: So, at least it was something?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">LB: It felt good at the time that if he was terrible.</span> <span id="s464">I had to take over and I didn't want my father to get sick so I had to go out.</span> <span id="s465">My brother wasn't home.</span> <span id="s466">I had no regrets.</span> <span

all the trouble with me and I have a son who is nice and we have grandchildren and we try to enjoy what we have.</span> <span id="s473">That's all we can do.</span> <span id="s474">Life is for living.</span> <span id="s475">A normal condition...you have to go on living.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">EL: I know it's so difficult to go back to this part of the past, it's better to do it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">LB: I never want to see a film that is so dramatic, I want to see comedy.</span> <span id="s478">I want every minute of my life to be cheerful because I had so many deterrents in my young life.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">EL: It's totally understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">LB: Yes, and not exactly only in camp, but before...before Hungarian

problems.</span> <span id="s492">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s493">My great grandfather ordered a move in Czechoslovakia, it was from Poland...they came from Poland.</span> <span

because it smelled already, the antisemitism...from the First World War.</span> <span id="s520">In Hungary, because all those, since the King Franz Josef died...then it was just history we learned.</span> <span id="s521">It is fading all away.</span> <span id="s522">It was a long time ago when I went to university.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">EL: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span
