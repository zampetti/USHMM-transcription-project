were little, but -- but not -- not during the war, when you were little.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I was only -- the first time I went to Pinsk was just 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:

to someone, to the family, Polish family.</span> <span id="s72">And she lived in two rooms, and what I remember also that it was novelty for me that it was one big stove and it was in the corner.</span> <span id="s73">So when you put fire on one side, the other room was warm as well, Now everyth -- it was in the corner, so -- so four rooms were heated by one big fireplace, and was kind of a novelty for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Tell us about her.</span> <span id="s75">You mentioned that she came to visit you when you were a little girl, not that you went so much before 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, she used to be in our house every d -- every summer, and she used to bring her own dishes because she was kosher.</span> <span id="s77">Ye -- and she -- so

id="s80">A: I don’t remember -- I -- I really loved her dearly because she was unpretentious and very simple woman, very sweet, sweet lady.</span> <span id="s81">That what I remember about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Di-Did that bother your mother that she wouldn’t eat from your table, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: -- that be a friction?</span> <span id="s85">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: That was th -- no, that was kind of joke at home, everybody was laughing, but don’t bother her at all, you know.</span> <span id="s87">She used to store her dishes always in the attic, so when she used to come in she had to take them out because she didn’t believe my mother didn’t wash them properly.</span> <span id="s88">But she was very unpretentious, she had one glass plate, and it was made out of glass because that -- she could use for both, you know, meat and milk.</span> <span id="s89">And he -- that

that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: They live in Nowy Sacz and they were very kind of society people.</span> <span id="s94">Well dressed and well spoken and I had to behave when I was in their house.</span> <span id="s95">And I was quite often in their house, of course.</span> <span id="s96">Always I had to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s98">Was that hard, or were you a sort of rambunctious little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Not really because that how it was, so I knew my place.</span> <span id="s100">You know, we -- in -- if -- on that time, children didn’t have to ha -- any rights whatsoever.</span> <span id="s101">It’s not like today my kids.</span> <span id="s102">It’s -- you know, for instance, when older people used to visit, I used to come and say hi, and I had to leave the room.</span> <span id="s103">It was no place for me with older people.</span> <span id="s104">I couldn’t hang around with -- with my father friends.</span> <span id="s105">But I ha -- I was si -- obliged to come in and introduce myself or -- or just say hi.</span> <span id="s106">And that was the story, it was very rigid discipline in our home, even when I was only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: T-Tell us what you remember about your home.</span> <span id="s108">What -- what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And wh -- and -- and how did you get from -- you were born in Kraków, but you lived in another place.</span> <span id="s111">T-Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, my f-father was a medical doctor and apparently -- and he had his training in hospital in Kraków, but I never really live in Kraków, I was only born there.</span> <span id="s113">And we live in this small, charming little village near Nowy Sacz, which was in -- they have like 200 people of Jewish population, and I don’t think they have more than thousand people entire village.</span> <span id="s114">And that was in Carpathian mountains, stuck between, you know, in the valley between mountains, and -- very beautiful place.</span> <span id="s115">And my father bought his practice that -- our doctor who die.</span> <span id="s116">He was Polish doctor and his family stay in this place, and my parents were very friendly with the -- with this [indecipherable] and her daughter.</span> <span id="s117">And he -- these two women, they were teachers in sch -- in the school.</span> <span id="s118">I don’t remember how many classes, I think only five classes were in the school.</span> <span id="s119">Fi -- five grades.</span> <span id="s120">Maybe more, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s121">I went to first grade, and she was my teacher.</span> <span id="s122">And the population was mostly Polish farmers, and it was also priest, who was my father’s friend, and the lawyer who came from this region, he used to have a law firm in New York -- in Nowy Sacz, and he was my father’s friend.</span> <span id="s123">And it was always crowd of guests and people coming to our -- for vacation, for longer stay, for skiing because it was a good skiing in the area.</span> <span id="s124">And my parents were extremely social, and social life was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Tell us the name of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Wanska.</span> <span id="s127">Wanska Nadunietsin.</span> <span id="s128">It was the -- on the Dunajec river, between Nowy Sacz and Starzenice, Starzenice was the resort town.</span> <span id="s129">It’s a beautiful, beautiful place.</span> <span id="s130">My parents used to go hiking and -- and used to, I remember, on the carnival season, my mother used to bring those balloons and stuff and hang on my -- from the parties that used to attend.</span> <span id="s131">They had very, very social life.</span> <span id="s132">To restaurant in the nearby region.</span> <span id="s133">My -- my father had a good practice, and he was very much liked by local people.</span> <span id="s134">He also had the patients which couldn’t pay, and he -- he was always working for government, so as regional doctor he was paid for certain [indecipherable] probably patient that couldn’t pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: He was working for the Polish government?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: For the --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: For the regional government.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Regional government.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Regional government, yes.</span> <span id="s141">He was the -- I don’t know -- regional doctor, that’s what they call that.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Can you talk a bit more about his standing in the community?</span> <span id="s143">You’ve described a small community, how did your father fit in as the -- the town doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I -- it was in -- on that time in Poland it was big distance between peasants and -- and people which were educated.</span> <span id="s145">So they were all kind of lower -- lower class people that [indecipherable] you call, and he had commanded respect.</span> <span id="s146">I remember his patients waiting -- he had practice at home, it -- part of the house was clinic -- by the way, he bought an -- on ‘36, I think, he built the house for us, it was designed by his friend architect, and it was a really beautiful house.</span> <span id="s147">It was never fully furnished, because war started.</span> <span id="s148">And he -- so people were [indecipherable] he -- kissing his, you know, bending and -- and grabbing his feet, or kissing his hand.</span> <span id="s149">Now, that kind of relation between poor and -- and whoever gave them help, it always amazed me [indecipherable] because all my friends were the village children.</span> <span id="s150">I used to run with them, I used to eat in their houses.</span> <span id="s151">And I didn’t realize that actually they did it because they needed my father.</span> <span id="s152">So my -- I rather assoc -- associate myself with all those kids.</span> <span id="s153">We had fun climbing the trees, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: When you had talked about your father getting together with the priest, can you talk a little bit more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh yes, the local priest, which was [speaks Polish here] used to call him, he was a big friend of my parents.</span> <span id="s156">And my father was playing bridge, there used to be evening bridge with the priest, and the police, the commandant of local police, Mr. Polovich, and he -- the pharmacist, that was a bridge party.</span> <span id="s157">And he -- probably they -- they used to drink as well, because drinking in Poland was one of the social events.</span> <span id="s158">And he -- and also he had the friends around, you know, some people living in the estates, which my father probably treated, and they befriend him, the Polish people.</span> <span id="s159">He had friends, he -- we were extremely assimilated.</span> <span id="s160">I knew I am Jewish, but wa -- I never went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s161">My parents never observe any holidays, except my mother, probably from [indecipherable] she never ate on the Yom Kippur, that’s -- she only drank tea, I tho -- tea with milk, that was her way of celebrating.</span> <span id="s162">But my father family was to-totally unobservant.</span> <span id="s163">But he -- my grandfather was Zionist, and we have this little box of [speaks Polish here] we should bring, with money to b-buy land in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: So that was something that --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: S-So they didn’t observe holidays, or was there anything special about Friday in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s168">On weeke -- on Fridays, on Saturdays, on Sundays, my parents usually took off.</span> <span id="s169">They went to friends and -- and they have friends, they have a lot of Polish friends, and a lot of Jewish friends, mostly doctors or lawyers, and he -- from Nowy Sacz, or -- or from Starzenice, or those nearby places, larger cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: In general, what ca -- in general, can you tell us more about the atmosphere in the town?</span> <span id="s171">Was that normal for Jews and non-Jews to be so friendly, or do you think it was particularly your father was very comfortable --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, it was my father who was the -- actually, because in this town was -- is small Jewish population, which is actually large -- large Jewish population for the size of town.</span> <span id="s173">And they were mostly very religious.</span> <span id="s174">They used to walk in those, you know, dress, headdresses, and -- but we had nothing -- at least I don’t remember, I never had anything in common with these people.</span> <span id="s175">It was the only place that my father -- mother used to go, they had some kind of restaurant, and every fr -- every Thursday, I think, they used to have the market.</span> <span id="s176">So from y -- on -- in the center of the town.</span> <span id="s177">So used to -- so people from nearby [indecipherable] or the merchant used to come and bring, you know, those goods.</span> <span id="s178">And was a big ma -- great big market and people were making pots on the street, you know, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s179">So -- and they were selling -- also, local people were selling stuff on this market.</span> <span id="s180">But the only people that my fr -- my mother used to go, it was the local store.</span> <span id="s181">Her name was Mrs. Horowicz, and she always bring the chair and my mother had to sit down, and she chat, and then she bought whatever she needed, and she used to go home.</span> <span id="s182">And the local little restaurant actually that was kind of in, when the peasants, whoever they sold the goods on the market used to drink, they live out of vodka, you know, and -- and this woman was very observant.</span> <span id="s183">And I call her [speaks Polish here] gran-grandmother Haija.</span> <span id="s184">And they used to go there, is always fascinated me.</span> <span id="s185">And on high holiday, where you didn’t bring the bre -- eat the bread, I used to bring with my sandwich, and she didn’t know how to get me out because I -- I was spoiling her holiday.</span> <span id="s186">And so the only family I remember that’s from the town, but we had really nothing in common in -- except they were my pa -- father patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I -- I don’t know if -- how did you think about the observant Jews?</span> <span id="s188">Did you consider yourself a part of them in some way, or separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Totally separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: It was like, you know, having some Muslim community here, and you don’t belong there.</span> <span id="s192">That what I felt.</span> <span id="s193">It means -- I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s194">I f -- consider myself Polish.</span> <span id="s195">My father was a great Polish patriot, he was in Polish army when he was a young 18 years old boy, he escaped to Pulsudski legion, and he fought for independent and probably that why he had all those friends.</span> <span id="s196">And later on he graduate from Lvov, from university in Lvov, and then he went to Vienna, to the -- for his training and then he was in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The only time that I remember really anti-Semite is just before war, that I faced that.</span> <span id="s199">My mother send me to Mrs. Horowicz to buy something, and it was a group of young boys, young people, in front of the store, and they didn't let me -- anybody -- get to the store, and they directed everybody to store -- Polish store which opened next door.</span> <span id="s200">So I was afraid and I went to this Polish store and I bought whatever it was.</span> <span id="s201">I was eight years old in that time.</span> <span id="s202">And when I bring it home, I told my mother what happened, I couldn’t go to buy -- bought at this place, she asked me to return it.</span> <span id="s203">And maybe because my father has -- was -- had the standing, he -- and he asked me to go to Mrs. Horowicz, so I went, nobody touched me.</span> <span id="s204">But the first time I saw, you know, this -- I felt what happened, really.</span> <span id="s205">But he -- we were kind of protected in this town, and if you -- I really didn’t feel anything because I was not privileged to -- nobody really told me anything.</span> <span id="s206">I felt extremely secure, and extremely important because my father.</span> <span id="s207">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Tell us what your parents taught you about faith, or God.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: It was no discussion in our house about faith and God.</span> <span id="s212">That was for -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s213">It was nothing against and nothing for.</span> <span id="s214">The first -- actually the first time I was taught about faith, when I was with nuns.</span> <span id="s215">And maybe because of my training, I was not really very convinced.</span> <span id="s216">I was baptized, and se -- I was taught all those religious, you know, everything about Catholic religion, and I know -- I know til today, and I went to Communion, and -- but I -- it was kind of, you know, very superficial.</span> <span id="s217">I was never very convinced, I was -- what my pa -- fa -- my parents used to, what I heard at home, that is not really important because you need to be moral [indecipherable] it is something that you have to face.</span> <span id="s218">And faith was something that everybody was privileged to do whatever.</span> <span id="s219">They didn’t -- they were not [indecipherable] fighting [indecipherable] but it was total freedom of your thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that, that your parents said you had to be moral inside, so they -- they really were talking to you about really core values, but in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah, oh yes, I was taught values.</span> <span id="s222">People don’t do that [indecipherable] used to say.</span> <span id="s223">And I had to -- I knew exactly what is right, what is wrong.</span> <span id="s224">It was very strongly defined in our family, that you don’t do certain things, you have to -- you know better.</span> <span id="s225">So I was taught -- I saw it in my family that there were certain thing that we don’t do.</span> <span id="s226">You don’t lie, you don’t steal, you don’t -- you have to be helpful, you need to be -- you n-need to give, you cannot be selfish.</span> <span id="s227">That what we were taught.</span> <span id="s228">You have, for instance, you know, what every child in probably Europe on that time was taught, that if you see the older person, you have to stand up and give the place to the older person.</span> <span id="s229">You cannot [indecipherable] yourself.</span> <span id="s230">Is -- is no-no.</span> <span id="s231">You don’t behave like that.</span> <span id="s232">You cannot steal, you cannot -- you know, you have to be consider.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: For example, how did your mother or father teach you about helping others?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: I saw it because my father was helping.</span> <span id="s235">I used to go, when I was a little child, he had those patient in the mountains, he couldn’t get -- reach them by car, so they used to bring is -- on the wintertime they used to send sleds, you know, and he used to take me with him to those houses.</span> <span id="s236">And people are so poor, you know.</span> <span id="s237">When I think about it today -- they live in the huts, and they didn’t have glass in the windows, only skin from the animal skin, which was transparent.</span> <span id="s238">And they didn't have a floor, the floor was just, you know, earth, and some wooden chips.</span> <span id="s239">And they sleep in one room with the animals, because is -- was warm, and these people were -- were so poor.</span> <span id="s240">He used to leave money to -- for -- to these people for the i -- because they couldn’t buy medicine.</span> <span id="s241">That why they kissed his hands, you know, and

very well.</span> <span id="s330">So they really live out a variety of apples and cherries.</span> <span id="s331">They used to farm.</span> <span id="s332">And the -- the were mostly farms.</span> <span id="s333">It was a poor area because they didn’t have a land [indecipherable] mountains.</span> <span id="s334">But every little corner was just farmed.</span> <span id="s335">And they had the lambs, you know, and wool, and cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Did you know the priest at all, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s338">After the war when my

pleasant, you know, I listened to this priest talking to people.</span> <span id="s356">I even remember once when -- just before war, when he talk about arming themself.</span> <span id="s357">And he said, we don’t have umbrella for rain.</span> <span id="s358">I remember the -- it’s funny that I remember that kind of statement, that we don’t have any umbrella to protect ourself.</span> <span id="s359">And -- but, you know, it was kind of fun.</span> <span id="s360">I didn’t have any religious convicti -- convictions.</span> <span id="s361">It was not very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What was the priest actually telling people to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: To protect themself, to -- you know, to go to the army and to -- was just before war.</span> <span id="s364">E-Explain how important it is to fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Did -- did your maid -- when she took you, did she explain anything about the service, or perhaps teach you how to cross yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: No, she was a very simple woman.</span> <span id="s367">Everybody crossed themselves, I could cross myself too, I know all the prayers.</span> <span id="s368">But they were -- they didn’t have any meaning for me, you know, just -- everybody did it, so I did it too.</span> <span id="s369">Was kind of -- it was not deep, you know, religious conviction or anything like that.</span> <span id="s370">So when I was -- during the war, I really don’t have any problem, because I did not have Jewish accent.</span> <span id="s371">I knew all the ritu -- rituals.</span> <span id="s372">So I -- I just could easil -- it’s like, you know, acting on the stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Where would your father and mother take off to every Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh, they went to [indecipherable] or they went to a restaurants, or they used to go hiking with friends.</span> <span id="s375">So they -- they had a lot of social arrangements, and they had to meet people.</span> <span id="s376">You know, this little town, Wanska was just -- my father used to work and probably they meet people that they felt comfortable with.</span> <span id="s377">They went to see family, my father had two sisters, and -- three sister, actually.</span> <span id="s378">So they always visit here or there.</span> <span id="s379">They went to Kraków quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: C-Can you describe the house that your father built?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Oh yes, yes, it

family room and then living room separate.</span> <span id="s387">And I know that my grandfather gave him a gift of furniture to this living room, which were exported from Vienna, I think, from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: This is your father’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Who had the brick factory.</span></p> <p><span

terraces, you know, that we can -- I loved this house, it was -- and the huge, huge garden where my father planted apple trees, apple orchard.</span> <span id="s395">The garden used to go all the way down to the river.</span> <span id="s396">And he -- he had ros -- rose bushes, which he liked cultivate very much, so we had th-the roses.</span> <span id="s397">And in front he would -- he brought the gardener, and he had -- we have the big, we call it clump, it means the flower bed, and it looked like a star.</span> <span id="s398">And everything was se -- surrounded by high walls, so -- and I remember funny things.</span> <span id="s399">It was the -- we had a dog, which -- three dogs actually, one was on the -- all the time on the chain, and it supposed to be very bad dog, but I could reach him anyway.</span> <span id="s400">And this dog was -- once he got himself loose, and he jumped the fence, and he -- across the -- near the fence, it was a farmer who had the sheeps -- how you call sheep male, you know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: A ram, or a -- ram?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Ram, ram.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: And he scared the ram, and the ram ran away and he hit he -- with head, our fence, and he die.</span> <span id="s405">So I remember confusion and the farmer run to my father because I don’t know how much money the ram costs, and my father had to pay for this ram.</span> <span id="s406">So that was kind of event which stay in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: And your dog, what happened to your dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Nothing, he was chained back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: What kind of dog was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I think it was a mutt, but big one.</span> <span id="s411">His name was Aggo.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Aggo.</span> <span id="s413">And there were two other dogs, smaller dogs that ran around?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: And he had -- my father had the elder terrier, he -- that he bought in England, and he was with all the papers, you know, and he -- I had a-another mutt, which was little one, which my mother bought from the Gypsies, because there were plenty of Gypsies passing by.</span> <span id="s415">And they wanted to kill this dog because it was a litter -- they had the litter, and my mother caught them drowning those little dogs.</span> <span id="s416">So she save one, it was a little -- it was white with black eye.</span> <span id="s417">And she decided that he needs to be small.</span> <span id="s418">So we used to go to this grandmother [indecipherable] to her restaurant, and they gave him -- gave him alcohol to drink because he not supposed to -- have he -- he grew

and at night he was release and he used to run around the house on the wire.</span> <span id="s439">So nobody could really approach the house.</span> <span id="s440">I don’t know why, probably there were a lot thiefs, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s441">The people were poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Do you remember the address of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A:

like one day.</span> <span id="s625">My mother’s sister used to live in Warsaw, she moved from Krinice to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s626">Her husband was pharmacist and he -- we stay in her house, in her apartment, all of us in Warsaw one day and then we took train to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s627">And my grandmother prepare, you know, whatever room he -- sh-she had.</span> <span id="s628">So my grandparents live in one room, my aunt live in another room, and my mother and myself we live with grandmother in one room.</span> <span id="s629">So simply, she opened the house for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And what -- what were the trains like?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I think were Pullman’s, nice trains, you know, with the --</span></p> <p><span

compare anything.</span> <span id="s637">I never went by train anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Do you know what triggered this decision?</span> <span id="s639">What triggered the decision to leave the house and the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Probably my mother didn’t want to stay away from her family.</span> <span id="s641">Maybe she’s -- felt safe, you know, away from German borders, and with her family.</span> <span id="s642">And maybe she convinced my grandparents that it is a good idea to just leave.</span> <span id="s643">A lot of people -- a lot of Jews on that time escape from that central Poland to eastern Poland in the -- hoping that Germans won’t reach them.</span> <span id="s644">And you know, it was already -- they already knew about the hay -- Hitler behavior toward Jews in Austria and in Germany.</span> <span id="s645">So Jews were just escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So how many were you altogether, when you were making the train ride from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: It was my mother and myself, and one -- my aunt and her daughter, my grandfather and my grandmother and my second aunt and her daughter, because men went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s649">Do you know where your father was going to when he was mobilized?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, no, we knew that he is going to fight Germans, that what we knew, and he -- very short, I don’t -- I cannot redefine how time on this moment, but he just came back, came to Pinsk, and he was in army uniform, extremely tired, with his medical bag.</span> <span id="s651">He escape because Russian captured his unit, and he escaped.</span> <span id="s652">If not, he would end up in Katyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Katyn.</span> <span id="s655">Katyn was the place where Russian killed Polish officers.</span> <span id="s656">So he managed to -- you know, just to -- he decide -- he saw probably that war is over, army is being defeated, so it was not point for him to wait, and he decided to come to Pinsk.</span> <span id="s657">And it was -- I remember it was night when he came in, and h -- I couldn’t recognize him, because he was so dirty, and he was unshaved, with this army uniform, the long coat.</span> <span id="s658">And Russian was there, so immediately some friends of my mother -- she had a lot of friends in Pinsk because she came from the town, gave him the suit.</span> <span id="s659">And he -- when he rested, my aunt -- my uncle, one that studied medicine in -- it was already Russian were there, so he was a doctor already, he arranged for him to work in clinic in hospital, so he went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: In Pinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: In Pinsk.</span> <span id="s662">And Russian wanted everybody to get Russian passports, and my father was a great Polish patriot, and he would never take Russian passport, so he decided to go back to Germany -- to Germans.</span> <span id="s663">And my grandfather decided, well, Germans are cultured people, whatever they said about them is not true, I’m not going to deal with those Russian underdogs, we are going back.</span> <span id="s664">So we [indecipherable] to go back to Nowy Sacz.</span> <span id="s665">And we didn’t know that Russian are rounding these people and sending them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s666">So we started to hide from exportation in -- to Siberia, and we had to leave Pinsk, and we went to some small village, I don’t remember the name, and later on through Lvov, and later on through Turka, where my father had cousin and her husband was a dentist and he knew Russian -- he was treating Russians and he arranged for a passport -- finally he -- they decided to take Russian passport to -- you know, to -- not to be sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s667">I wish they would send us to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Now let me go back, you actually covered a lot of ground there.</span> <span id="s669">When you’re in Pinsk, h-how long do you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I went to school over winter, so we stay probably til spring.</span> <span id="s671">Yeah, because I used to go to Russian school all that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So maybe eight months, seven, eight months?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Maybe five --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: -- six months, yes, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And describe where you’re living again.</span> <span id="s677">You’re at your grandmother’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes, and later on we moved, and we live in our aun -- uncle house, in Lolla.</span> <span id="s679">My -- so we live --we -- they gave us one room and we live in this one room.</span> <span id="s680">We really --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Who -- who lived in the one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Ma -- our family, my father, myself and my mother.</span> <span id="s683">We had -- we live in one room that they gave us.</span> <span id="s684">And he -- I don’t think they wanted to stay in Pinsk because they never look for any apartment.</span> <span id="s685">And I don’t think in this point they have money.</span> <span id="s686">They didn’t have any money to rent apartment, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: So you don’t think when they were packing they were able to grab any money?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Maybe they had some, but you know, the money have changed, that they have Polish zloty, which was nothing.</span> <span id="s689">So the things that my mother used -- used to sell the jewelry, and -- to get some money.</span> <span id="s690">And then my father work, so he used to have whatever he could add.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: So your mother did bring some jewelry with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I’m sure she di -- she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: They had some dollars, I know that, they have some, they used to change -- but the Polish money was worthless.</span> <span id="s697">Whatever they had, it was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: And did you have any idea what was happening back in [indecipherable]?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No, no we didn’t have any contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: That was Germany, and it was no contact whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: And so your father during this time -- well, first of all, how long had you been there before your father arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Maybe a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Maybe -- maybe less, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did he -- did he say how he escaped from the s -- the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Probably yes, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s708">Don’t forget that I was not privileged to -- to grown up information.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I know that he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Somehow he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Somehow he escaped, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And -- and once he was in Pinsk, was he worried that the Soviet army would find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s717">Didn’t have any data about him, you know, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: When the -- in the moment he was out of uniform, there were so many people, the only thing that he -- they -- they needed a registration, and they register to go back, so they knew that.</span> <span id="s720">Otherwise -- but there were so many refugees on that time.</span> <span id="s721">People from western part of Poland, tremendous amount of refugees.</span> <span id="s722">Even Polish people that escaped from Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And did you feel safe in Pinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No.</span> <span id="s725">No.</span> <span id="s726">It’s funny, you know, the moment we -- I left the house, I have this feeling that something is happening.</span> <span id="s727">Well, my safety was over, you know, that -- my family was in danger.</span> <span id="s728">We -- we didn’t have home.</span> <span id="s729">My powerful father was nobody, you know, and my grandfather, who knew everybody was suddenly no one, and i-it -- it change.</span> <span id="s730">I think it was a time when I suddenly knew who I am, and we had contact only with Jews, we didn’t have any more contact with these Polish people.</span> <span id="s731">With my mother family, and the friends that my -- my father used to meet, they were like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Were there some people you tried to contact in Pinsk who were not Jews, who weren’t ab -- who -- who chose not to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: I -- n -- well, no, not really, not really.</span> <span id="s734">I even didn’t have any friends, except the children of my mother friends, which were Jews.</span> <span id="s735">It was quite a big Jewish population in Pinsk, it was practically a tremendous number of Jews living in Pinsk.</span> <span id="s736">And she had a lot of friends, because she used to go to school there, so she had -- and some of her friends came back, you know, escaped when they were -- they were in central Poland, they came back to Pinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: How did the Jewish community in Pinsk treat you or accept you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: It was the chaos and fear.</span> <span id="s739">It was not a normal time.</span> <span id="s740">Nobody treat anybody, you know, the -- everybody tried to survive and to -- even people that lived there for -- they settle in Pinsk, they live in Pinsk, everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s741">It was a big confusion what might happen, what will happen.</span> <span id="s742">The -- there were some number of people who were Communists, they were happy that Russian came, and -- I really don’t know, it was -- that was our immigration, you know, we live in one room, we didn’t have -- we didn’t own anything.</span> <span id="s743">And then from Pinsk my parents decided to -- as I told you, we had to leave because we were rounded, and we didn’t want to be sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: I-I -- what -- what was the specific threat, were there actually round-ups going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes, yes, they be [indecipherable], which was the Russian unit, used to come to the houses, usually at night and take these people who didn’t have the passport, they didn’t have the papers, to the railroad station and

id="s748">Russian passport, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And you had Polish passports at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Well, we register to go back, so whoever register to go back was enemy of the state.</span> <span id="s751">So need to be -- they didn't want people to go back to Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: They want them -- so they were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s754">Siberia was empty place, you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s755">That why you have those Jews which survive war in Russia.</span> <span id="s756">You were simply forcefully sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Was there debate within your family about this choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes, my mother was -- hated co -- Russians and Communists.</span> <span id="s759">Probably it was something that was left over from revolution, and she definitely didn’t want to go to Siberia, it was kind of -- so they decided that is much better off -- nobody expected the German are going to kill people.</span> <span id="s760">It was beyond the imagination.</span> <span id="s761">So it was better to go back and stay, you know, in our place, to go to [indecipherable] and we had home, and house and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: S-So when the round-ups started, how quickly did you go back, leave pink -- Pinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: I don’t know, but suddenly we -- my father decided we have to move.</span> <span id="s764">And there was entire family, so first my aunt went through.</span> <span id="s765">I don’t remember this name of this little town.</span> <span id="s766">And then she sent the messenger, some -- someone that we should all go -- come.</span> <span

Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: To dista -- yes, and then we stayed near Lvov for awhile and my parents didn’t feel that we can stay in Lvov.</span> <span id="s779">They didn’t have anybody, you know, and friends.</span> <span id="s780">Then we went to Turka where my father cousin invited us and he -- well, we can -- we can arrange something for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So at this point, who is traveling together?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: My mother, myself and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s785">And my grandparents came later, and my aunt came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: And when -- tell us where Turka is, it’s also known by two names?</span> <span id="s787">Turka and th --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Netstrian, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: And then Turka.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Tor -- Turka Netstrian --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: -- actually.</span> <span id="s793">That’s full name.</span> <span id="s794">That was the place, little town, actually town near Druhobich Sembor in eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s795">That was -- they were quite number of Jews living in Turka, and my father cousin was a dentist over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And who was in control at that -- the Germans were in control?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: No, Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Oh, the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: It’s Russians -- it was still Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: -- control, yes.</span> <span id="s804">So my -- they arrange for papers, my father started to work in hospital and see my -- the first -- we used to live with my father cousins.</span> <span id="s805">Later on my parents left -- rent a little apartment, like two rooms and kitchen, where we stay with -- entire family used to stay there, you know just those two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: What kind of papers did they arrange for?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Pa -- Russian passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: So why was it safer in Turka than Pinsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: They cross in pi --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: I-If the Russians were in charge in both places?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Because probably in Pinsk, authority knew that we want to go back to i -- to -- you know, you couldn’t arrange a passport any more, because they knew where we want to go back, so we were done of the -- we actually -- they actually looking for us to send us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s812">They didn’t -- had our names.</span> <span id="s813">And in Turka it was a chaos, it was a war.</span> <span id="s814">A-Authority didn’t know about it, so it was simpler to arrange papers in another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: You were more anonymous in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Ano -- yes, exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: So f -- a fer -- at first you and your father and mother arrived, and how -- when did other family members come and who came?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I don’t remember the sequence, but everybody came.</span> <span id="s819">It means my father, two sister and parents.</span> <span id="s820">And two sister with husbands.</span> <span id="s821">Husbands already came and managed to came back from the war, you know, because Polish army was -- and it was another aunt, the youngest one, with her husband, but they decided to go to Romania.</span> <span id="s822">They felt that -- somebody told them -- they didn’t have any children, and they decided, well, we are going to Romania.</span> <span id="s823">And they survive in Romania.</span> <span id="s824">So they escaped through the border to Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Before we go on with Turka, did your family every discuss leaving Poland altogether, and this would have been in maybe ’38 or ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No.</span> <span id="s827">No, my father was -- my family was so patriotic Polish that all the -- the culture was Polish culture, you know, that was totally unthinkable that we can leave Poland.</span> <span id="s828">It was our country.</span> <span id="s829">My father fought in the war, and he fought for independent, and it was his language and his -- was his culture.</span> <span id="s830">And he had Polish friends and all others were just skunks, you know?</span> <span id="s831">But he consider Polish people extremely noble, and he -- he had friends from any, you know, layer of society, and he felt very, very liked, and so I don’t think that with -- my mother maybe more than my father, but he definitely w-wouldn’t leave Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So when the family first left Wanska, it -- it -- it wasn’t so much that the family -- that your father felt that you and your mother would be in danger, it was just because of the war, per se --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: -- not that -- that the Germans would come and then it would be followed by a Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Well, nobody thought about Holocaust.</span> <span id="s836">The Holocaust was something that nobody consider.</span> <span id="s837">It -- that was very good example -- my grandfath-father, who was actually Austrian, he consider himself Austrian culture, you know.</span> <span id="s838">In Turka he was surrounded on the street.</span> <span id="s839">The German -- it was raining and German truck, big army truck was stuck in the mud.</span> <span id="s840">And so they rounded the Jews, mostly older Jews to lift this truck from the mud, and it was probably more game than they needed to lift this truck.</span> <span id="s841">And my f -- grandfather was around that, and he was always very well dressed, and -- and he had the medal from the first World War.</span> <span id="s842">And that he was privilege of even before, you know?</span> <span id="s843">So he went to this German, he showed him this cross that he had, and he said, well I am Austrian, and I fought for Franz Joseph, or whoever it was, naively.</span> <span id="s844">And then this man -- he was beaten so badly that somebody brought him home, my father took him to hospital, and he actually didn’t recover after that.</span> <span id="s845">He die later on, he had internal bleeding, I don’t know if his [indecipherable] but -- and I remember him laying in bed, because we had only two rooms and kitchen, and he was -- it was funny, because he was -- how you call it?</span> <span id="s846">Crying and -- in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s847">He said [speaks Yiddish here].</span> <span id="s848">Have me out of pain, or what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: And did he d-die at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: No, he die in hospital.</span> <span id="s851">My father arranged to take him to hospital and he died in hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: And this was Simhar?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: What was his full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Simhar Kleinman.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: So even when people began to sense that none of the rules were the same any more, there was still the belief that some things were the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s858">Grand --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Your grandfather felt that --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: My father felt that that is the culture, you know, and he really, really liked the German culture.</span> <span id="s861">He considered them -- you know, he simply didn’t believe that they can be cruel like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: He considered them, like German themselves, superior probably.</span> <span id="s864">[indecipherable] superior.</span> <span id="s865">Some -- it was a family, they si -- when things were so bad it was -- I don’t remember the name of these people, they have daughter my age and it was -- father was a doctor and his wife, they decided to commit suicide, and they poisoned themself, including the child over there.</span> <span id="s866">My father found them.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: And this was in Turka?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Was that ever considered by your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s871">There was such will to live, you know.</span> <span id="s872">We need to be probably depressed, tremendously depressed to try to take the life, now or never.</span> <span id="s873">Now, now or never, never.</span> <span id="s874">My mother was fighter.</span> <span id="s875">He would never consider to take her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: When you first got to Turka -- I wonder if we can go through some of the details, you said that the family arranged papers and then, can you talk a little bit about your father getting a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, in the -- when he had those, you know, papers, he started to work in hospital, and he -- probably he was helped by his cousin and his connections.</span> <span id="s878">And he really befriend a lot of people in hospital.</span> <span id="s879">I even remember the director of hospital was -- that was Ukrainian town, too, quite a number of people were Ukrainian, there were Jewish Ukrainian and Polish people.</span> <span id="s880">And director of hospital, his name w-was Garbovsky, he was Ukrainian, was a -- and there were some Ukrainian doctors, and it was a Polish doctor, his name was Gibywa.</span> <span id="s881">Probably Gibywa is Lithuanian name probably was -- was -- was from Leepfa.</span> <span id="s882">And he became very close friend of my father.</span> <span id="s883">He was -- he didn’t have family, he live in hospital.</span> <span id="s884">His mother lived in town.</span> <span id="s885">And they -- they just -- just click, they became friends.</span> <span id="s886">My father -- there were number of Jewish doctors, there was Dr. Rebach, and doctor -- some invited my parents, you know, just to -- because they knew they don’t know people.</span> <span id="s887">And he was kind of like the --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Was your father known as a Jewish doctor, or because of the Russian papers was he --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: No, no, he was Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: -- pretending to be something --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: No, he was Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: He had papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: He was a Jew, he had his own name?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: He had his own name --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: -- he -- he simply had [indecipherable] papers, acquired papers, passport, yes, that’s what they call.</span> <span id="s898">He -- so he -- finally -- we had a problem with food, food was so scarce, people used to be -- get hung -- be hungry and more and more and more, even Polish people.</span> <span id="s899">So the only way to have food was to buy them from farmers.</span> <span id="s900">And we didn’t have too much money, or at least as much as my father earned.</span> <span id="s901">So my grandmother used to cut whatever pieces of fabric we had, and she was very handy.</span> <span id="s902">She used to crochet, and si -- and exchange, you know, whatever she sew, for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: This your maternal grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Fat -- no, my maternal grandmother stay in Pinsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Oh, okay, this is your paternal --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Paternal grandmother, yes.</span> <span id="s907">She used to be very handy.</span> <span id="s908">And that a -- how we really survive.</span> <span id="s909">And another source of food was sending me to the stores, a Polish stores, nobody really knew me in Turka, and was staying in the line, and buying this -- after f -- many hours, you get little loaf of bread, or some milk, or whatever was ration on that time.</span> <span id="s910">A -- another sort of food that was very important --</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: At that point were you passing for Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Ah Jews in di -- veris -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: So you wouldn’t have -- if you were Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: There was a Russian time, on the Russian time we didn’t have this problem, but when German came to Turka, that where problem started.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: In the Russian time my father worked freely, and food was available, and fe -- they did not prosecute Jews.</span> <span id="s919">So when German came -- oh, that was also -- before German came, when Russian decided was escape from German, he gra -- they grabbed my father to the army because they needed medical corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Again.</span> <span id="s922">And he escaped again.</span> <span id="s923">He was like two weeks -- German came in and he was missing, so

back.</span> <span id="s927">So he came back and again he went to hospital, and they didn’t care, they really like him, so that he work in hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: He went to the same hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: This -- yes, it was only one hospital.</span> <span id="s930">It was outside the town and he -- it was one hospital building, that was it.</span> <span id="s931">It was a little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Do you remember the name of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Hospital.</span> <span id="s934">Just hospital, that’s it.</span> <span id="s935">It’s -- they didn’t have any official name probably, because it was government hospital, it was paid by government.</span> <span id="s936">It was not private hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So you arrived in Turka in the spring of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: ’40 -- yes, in 1940.</span> <span id="s939">1940.</span></p> <p><span

or anything like that.</span> <span id="s944">It was shortage of food, everybody suffered, but life was kind of normal.</span> <span id="s945">We didn’t feel in danger at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s947">Were there -- in that period, were there ever any good times that you remember?</span> <span id="s948">Where you might have gone for a hike with your

different.</span> <span id="s976">Russians were much more pleasant.</span> <span id="s977">They were not so powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: And do you remember when it was that they invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Was end -- end of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: So it was winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: December,

train station, and when Russian left they -- they bombed the bridge.</span> <span id="s993">So bridge was not there, ra-railroad bridge was.</span> <span id="s994">And they enter, you know, the main road, I think.</span> <span id="s995">It was just underneath the viaduct.</span> <span id="s996">So I remember when the -- those tanks, you know, they just passed by.</span> <span id="s997">And my cousin, myself -- my cousin Philip, that was the -- my uncle dentist’ son, we of course went to watch, because the kids used to go and watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Oh, y-you weren't just up

<p><span id="s1003">A: They -- actually they immediately started to terrorize Jews.</span> <span id="s1004">The Gestapo became very active.</span> <span id="s1005">And I know that on that time there were some Jews from the Austria, temporary living, that they left in ’39, living in Turka.</span> <span id="s1006">And he -- things have changed, the Gestapo started terrorize people right away.</span> <span id="s1007">And it was this -- I cannot tell you -- give you facts because I really don’t remember -- I don’t know, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1008">But it was this fear.</span> <span id="s1009">They immediately rounded and took some men and send them to work, you know, to road work and mostly Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s1010">I stopped going to school, school was not available.</span> <span id="s1011">And he -- on that time we moved to the house, I told you that, my parent -- parents ran and in the house, it was small house, belong to the old Jew who live in one room.</span> <span id="s1012">And one little apartment block was rented by family.</span> <span id="s1013">I don’t reme -- I even remember name, his name was Buchman.</span> <span id="s1014">And that was elderly couple with a son.</span> <span id="s1015">The son used to be the teacher in high school.</span> <span id="s1016">And he was hiding, he didn’t go out at all.</span> <span id="s1017">He st -- was staying at home.</span> <span id="s1018">We build in the basement, it was the -- the entrance to the house was the -- went through the kind of patio, cover the how you call that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Porch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: -- porch, we cover porch.</span> <span id="s1021">And there was a basement and windows underneath the porch.</span> <span id="s1022">And of course, house didn’t have the bathrooms, you -- you went out -- outs -- the outside bathroom, which every family has a key from his own place.</span> <span id="s1023">So we built in one -- one part of the basement was so well hidden that we really couldn’t figure out what happened and so they built their own hiding place with the camouflage doors.</span> <span id="s1024">They put shelves you know, and you could just move those shelves and open it [indecipherable] this room.</span> <span id="s1025">And they had water in the place, and food stored, some dry food.</span> <span id="s1026">And it was kind of crawling space that you could get to the garden outside and escape.</span> <span id="s1027">So they were talking about hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Those two families, my -- my parents and Buchman and this old man.</span> <span id="s1030">That was common for this entire house.</span> <span id="s1031">The German used to inspect the house, the Jewish houses and of course they raided them, they took whatever was -- had the value.</span> <span id="s1032">So poor young Mr. Buchman used to stay always in this place because they were afraid they will grab him.</span> <span id="s1033">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Did they ever come to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1036">They used to come to our house.</span> <span id="s1037">It was funny thing because this Gestapo officer was -- I don’t remember his name, I could still see his face, used to -- they used to come with the dogs and with his soldiers and himself.</span> <span id="s1038">He, who had syphilis, and my father treated him.</span> <span id="s1039">So he used to come, my father used to treat him.</span> <span id="s1040">In one of the rooms he arrange his little office, and next day the same man with dogs officer used to come and take everything whatever we had.</span> <span id="s1041">Of course, he didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s1042">And they were always looking for something which was hidden, so when -- by the way -- when they left, the house was totally disordered because they always suspected we might have a lot of money or whatever, jewelry.</span> <span id="s1043">And was at least once a week.</span> <span id="s1044">I don’t know why they raided us all the time, probably some other people too.</span> <span id="s1045">And also Buchmans, and also this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So the young man, would he just be in hiding a lot of the time in anticipation of the raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, he could escape really, when they were banging on the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: He would escape and then sneak into the basement hiding place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: It was the entrance inside the house to the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did you ever hide there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Once, once.</span> <span id="s1052">It was terrible, I couldn't get to the basement, so I lay on the -- on those shelves.</span> <span id="s1053">But they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1054">They were upstairs, they didn’t come down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: You just laid on those shelves trying to be flat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Why -- why did you hide that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: …It was the -- they used to call it the aktion that when they rounded Jews, and these -- or kill them, or si -- took them with their cart to the forest.</span> <span id="s1059">Because on that time they did not really export anybody to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1060">Most of the time they used to take them to the -- to those big cars, we call them buda [indecipherable] the covered car.</span> <span id="s1061">And they take them to the forest and they killed them in massive graves.</span> <span id="s1062">And we already knew about it.</span> <span id="s1063">There were -- a lot of people were swollen from hunger, begging for food.</span> <span id="s1064">And you couldn’t give them any food because it was what you need to survive.</span> <span id="s1065">So when somebody told us it -- the German care -- buda is approaching, so everybody run to hide.</span> <span id="s1066">And bu -- I don’t know what really happened, how come I was along.</span> <span id="s1067">And I know they went to this basement, and they couldn’t open this door any more, and I didn’t now want it.</span> <span id="s1068">So I felt that I am so small and skinny, so I can fit on the shelf.</span> <span id="s1069">They didn’t come to our house.</span> <span id="s1070">So, you know, we were lucky, but was first time I really escape -- End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Can you tell us more about how things were going in Turka when the Germans -- once the Germans arrived?</span> <span id="s1073">You were no longer in school.</span> <span id="s1074">Did the Germans create any laws that you had to obey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1076">First they started with the -- the armband with the blue star, David star.</span> <span id="s1077">And I remember that we used to fabricate this at home.</span> <span id="s1078">And it was -- my father found kind of plas -- Plexiglas, you know, the ple -- it was not plastic on that time, that we used to embroider star, but it has the -- it was small, so you could turn it around if you need it, and hide it.</span> <span id="s1079">And that was very handy.</span> <span id="s1080">When they caught you, the game was, oh, I didn’t know it turned.</span> <span id="s1081">I didn’t wear it, from the first moment.</span> <span id="s1082">I don’t why I didn’t, and nobody ever stopped me.</span> <span id="s1083">But my mother used to wear that was made out of piece of fabric of this, you know, sle -- one which was made out of piece of Plexiglas.</span> <span id="s1084">So we had s -- entire collection, and it was very important I remember, to have this star done very precise and right, you know.</span> <span id="s1085">And then I learned how to make the triangle, which has same -- same lengths of arms, you know, so -- so e -- the second rule, which was the worse rule that I remember, was to cut the hair.</span> <span id="s1086">The men had to shave the heads, and the women supposed to have hair which are only three centimeter.</span> <span id="s1087">So my mother -- at the first she didn't cut my hair.</span> <span id="s1088">I had braids, long braids, but I wear the scarf on my head, and my hair was -- so every Polish girl used to wear a scarf, so I look really like a Polish girl with my hair st -- hanging.</span> <span id="s1089">And my fa -- my mother immediately made the permanent -- perm, you know, so it curls your hair, so she could have it longer, not three centimeter.</span> <span id="s1090">And my aunts also, they all wear with curls.</span> <span id="s1091">But that -- they were those terrible rules.</span> <span id="s1092">And then you couldn’t -- it was marshal law.</span> <span id="s1093">You couldn’t get out of the dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Why didn’t your mother cut your hair, wasn’t she afraid not to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: She didn’t want me to be marked.</span> <span id="s1096">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1097">It was a wise decision.</span> <span id="s1098">Also, I used to go and buy food for the family, and few people knew me.</span> <span id="s1099">Really, one that knew me, really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1100">So she was afraid, you know, the German way, you are marked right away.</span> <span id="s1101">I don’t really know, but I was very happy she didn’t -- decided not to cut my hair.</span> <span id="s1102">So I had this long hair which, I was unmarked, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Y-You could pass for a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1104">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I could pass for a Polish girl, Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s1106">I was not -- also my behavior, you know, was not very Jewish, because I grew in the Polish community.</span> <span id="s1107">My language was perfect, no accent whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1108">So when I open my mouth, no I didn’t -- I never spoke Yiddish, so I -- I didn’t have any accent in my Polish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Were you aware when you went out without the star and with your long braids, or your braids under a scarf that -- that you were passing for a non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: I tried to think about it.</span> <span id="s1111">I tried to believe that I am not pass -- I am passing, yes.</span> <span id="s1112">I used to go to stores, for instance.</span> <span id="s1113">I -- one of the doctors had friend who ran the milk -- how you call that?</span> <span id="s1114">When they collect milk from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: The dairy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Dairy, dairy.</span> <span id="s1117">And of course they took cream out of milk, and what was left is skim milk that nobody wanted.</span> <span id="s1118">Course today everybody wants it.</span> <span id="s1119">Nobody wants skim milk.</span> <span id="s1120">So he arrange with this friend of his that I could come and collect the skim milk.</span> <span id="s1121">So I was going there every day, and we had s-skim milk.</span> <span id="s1122">My father -- my mother used to give it to Buchmans, and we drank as a water, which is probably very good.</span> <span id="s1123">So that was my -- I used to stay in the long line, it was like -- I started very in the -- early in the morning before store opened for bread, a loaf of bread, and it was only for Polish people.</span> <span id="s1124">So I used to stay there, you know, and behave myself, that nobody in anger will suddenly recognize me and point it out, or s -- throw me out.</span> <span id="s1125">And I was lucky, I never had really problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: You said you were very aware, and you knew that you were passing, and that you tried to act a certain way.</span> <span id="s1127">What was that way?</span> <span id="s1128">I mean, when you were so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I tried to be unvis -- invisible.</span> <span id="s1130">I tried not to -- to be very polite, very, you know, on the same time, try to be secure, to feel secure.</span> <span id="s1131">I don’t know really, it was kind of natural probably, cause I -- I don’t know even if I act -- I try not to be afraid, that was the main thing, I try not to be afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: And wa -- and was that something you figured out on your own --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: No, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: -- or had your mother or father told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: No, it was kind of natural, I think.</span> <span id="s1136">No, they never told me anything.</span> <span id="s1137">No, we -- it was no discussion.</span> <span id="s1138">I just felt it where I have my hair, and nobody really knows me in this town, and I can pray, I can cross myself, and it is totally natural, because I did it from childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: At this point you’re 10, maybe 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: 10 - 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: 1940 - 1941, I was 11 in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Did you ever go to the hospital where your father worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1147">I went there every day because another source of food was whatever was left from my father.</span> <span id="s1148">And he used to get -- he stay in hospital later actually permanently, because he took -- he -- he stay on call, covering the Ukrainians and Polish doctors.</span> <span id="s1149">So he -- and actually, he lived in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1150">And he -- he used to get food and bread, and most important bread, and piece of meat.</span> <span id="s1151">So I collected it every day, and I used to bring it home to my parents, because food was something -- we never -- the hunger is something that you have to experience to understand.</span> <span id="s1152">When person is really, really hungry, and he -- we didn’t have any water, you know, no oil.</span> <span id="s1153">And piece of bread was something that you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s1154">My mother used to get grain, buy grain from the peasants.</span> <span id="s1155">And she used to grind it in the coffee mill, three or four, five times.</span> <span id="s1156">And of course grain has the left over hot skin that was grinded and she used to bake with mayb -- with pe -- with the -- make flour like that, and she used to -- if she had egg, she added egg, but most of the time it was water and saccharine as a sweetener.</span> <span id="s1157">And she used to bake on the plate kind of cookies, and yo -- if you ate these cookies, the -- this hard part of the grain sticks into your gums, and it was like ne -- they were like needles.</span> <span id="s1158">And we used to spit that, you know, you ate that and you spit those pieces.</span> <span id="s1159">And we used to call it pluey carli because you spit it.</span> <span id="s1160">Pluey, it is to spit.</span> <span id="s1161">And that was food that we had and the -- some soup.</span> <span id="s1162">I used to go out to the fields and collect -- you know, it’s funny how many field wheat is eatable, and is very good.</span> <span id="s1163">So she used to make spinach out of certain -- o-of certain grasses, which I collected, it was kind of sweet.</span> <span id="s1164">And she used to cook it, and s -- it was kind of spinach, with a little salt, a little bit sweetener, and we used to eat that.</span> <span id="s1165">And of course we had the garden, little garden whenever was place around the house, that she planted.</span> <span id="s1166">She liked to work in the garden when -- even before war, she always had a vegetable garden, she like gardening.</span> <span id="s1167">She used to plant whatever seeds she could get, and we ate that.</span> <span id="s1168">So food was something that you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s1169">Meat was absolutely inaccessible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: When you went to the hospital, did you have any interaction with people at the hospital?</span> <span id="s1171">Nurses, doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No, only this Dr. Gibywa was very gracious to me and he liked me, he was -- used to pick me up, you know, and I like him very much.</span> <span id="s1173">He was very friendly with my father.</span> <span id="s1174">And I used to know some Jewish doctors, which of course I used to say politely good morning, and they don’t -- didn’t talk to kids, you know, so -- and nurses, not really.</span> <span id="s1175">And at the beginning I went through the main entrance, which had guard always.</span> <span id="s1176">And later I discover the hole i-in the fence.</span> <span id="s1177">Ho-Hospital, like everything in Poland was fence.</span> <span id="s1178">So it was a big fence, and it was the hole under, so I used to go under in the -- through the hole, specially in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Why did you change your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: I didn’t want -- I was afraid of guard.</span> <span id="s1181">I didn’t want him to see me.</span> <span id="s1182">I didn’t want him to s -- to see me taking food.</span> <span id="s1183">So -- and my fr -- room that doctors used to stay, that my father slept, it was a room with two beds, usually two doctors, a big cupboard, actually big closet was separate more than cabinets that you hang your -- usually was locked, everything had a lock, everything was locked in Poland.</span> <span id="s1184">Apparently people were stealing stuff.</span> <span id="s1185">So the key were you -- it was key to everything, to every little drawer had the key, you locked everything.</span> <span id="s1186">And I used to knock to the window, it was pretty high, you know.</span> <span id="s1187">Maybe it was not high, but I was small.</span> <span id="s1188">Anyway, I had to step on something to knock to this window, to batter the window, and they used to pull me up, open the window and pull me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Who pulled you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Dr. Gibywa, or my father, you know, when I knock.</span> <span id="s1191">So, I didn’t want to go through the corridors.</span> <span id="s1192">And then -- oh, they used to lower, you know, the container with food or bread, usually there was paper bag that I took home.</span> <span id="s1193">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: And people were waiting at home for the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1196">Especially my grandmother, and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1197">They were first, the older in the family and that’s -- they should have.</span> <span id="s1198">They really couldn’t eat this grass and s-stuff.</span> <span id="s1199">My fath -- my grandfather had ulcer, you know, so he -- they were elderly people.</span> <span id="s1200">And everybody had waited for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Who was in the hospital?</span> <span id="s1202">What kinds of patients were in the hospital?</span> <span id="s1203">Were they German soldiers who’d been hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No, no, the Polish people, Ukrainian from nearby villages.</span> <span id="s1205">Some Jews from the town.</span> <span id="s1206">The local population.</span> <span id="s1207">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: So this point it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: -- fairly normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: -- it was a big outbreak of typhoid fever, because of hunger and dirt and the lices that everybody had.</span> <span id="s1212">And so it was separate pavilion in hospital of typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s1213">It was also [indecipherable] in winter, one winter I remember, the wolves came to the village and they bite some of the people.</span> <span id="s1214">From the forests.</span> <span id="s1215">There were big forests over there, and they had wild animals.</span> <span id="s1216">And people develop distemper.</span> <span id="s1217">And they br-brought to hospital.</span> <span id="s1218">The first time I saw person with distemper, and on that time I stay overnight because fa -- my father was taking care of the infection -- infected -- nobody wants to go to infect [indecipherable] my father was one, and I saw the person with distemper, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1219">Horrible, like wild animal.</span> <span id="s1220">The first time I saw it.</span> <span id="s1221">But mostly typho -- typhoid fever, and my father was infected, too, he was sick with typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s1222">I knew some nuns in -- the nurses were mostly Catholic nuns in this hospital.</span> <span id="s1223">They were, you know, al-always walking with a white se -- dress -- had this dress, and they were nurses in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1224">And they were very friendly with my father because when the Russians were in, they really wanted to get rid of nuns.</span> <span id="s1225">And my father suggested to this head nun that helped me later on, why didn’t you just dress?</span> <span id="s1226">Take off your dresses and dress normally, then they wouldn’t even notice.</span> <span id="s1227">So they did.</span> <span id="s1228">And they liked him.</span> <span id="s1229">They were very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1230">And he was always, you know, v -- working hard and very helpful and friendly.</span> <span id="s1231">He -- he was liked, my father.</span> <span id="s1232">He had this quality of the person that you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: At this point in Turka are -- what are your parents saying about how long you might stay there?</span> <span id="s1234">Is there a feeling that that’s a place that your -- the whole family will be able to stay for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: To the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1237">Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1239">All the time we secure.</span> <span id="s1240">We didn’t want to move.</span> <span id="s1241">All the time my father work, and you know -- we were expecting that war will be over, we all are going to go back and life is going to be the same as before.</span> <span id="s1242">But probably the human expectation.</span> <span id="s1243">And that what I felt, that it was no -- it was no place to escape, you couldn’t -- where could we go?</span> <span id="s1244">We didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1245">No -- nobody wanted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Some of the photographs in the collection that you donated to the museum are identified as the Turka ghetto.</span> <span id="s1247">Now, is that where you lived, or wer -- later were there -- was there a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: No, I think that is a mistake.</span> <span id="s1249">It was no ghetto in Turka.</span> <span id="s1250">The Jews concentrated most -- together most of the time.</span> <span id="s1251">If somebody had better apartment you had to move, to vacate this apartment to German, or to the kra -- Ukrainians or whoever.</span> <span id="s1252">But it was no defined ghetto like -- in Turka like it was in Lvov, or in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1253">It was no really -- real gathering of Jews in one place.</span> <span id="s1254">We had to move to the lesser pla -- apartment, or to one room only.</span> <span id="s1255">Or they combined families together.</span> <span id="s1256">They have to vacate those villas, or houses, or apartments which were once for prominent people.</span> <span id="s1257">But it was no ghetto in Turka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And so there was never one period where there was a big upheaval and people were moved here and there, wa -- it would just be one at a time, you have to move out of that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: It was -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Okay [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: It was now -- the only time the German really terrorize, when they deported people.</span> <span id="s1262">They used to catch men and take them to the camp, to work in camp.</span> <span id="s1263">Later on every man wanted to go to work in camp because they felt it is a way to survive; they need me, so they are going to protect me.</span> <span id="s1264">That was the feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: What was your understanding of what the Germans were doing?</span> <span id="s1266">At this point were y -- you hearing any inklings?</span> <span id="s1267">Well, what was your understanding of what the Germans were doing with Jews?</span> <span id="s1268">Were you hearing anything about other -- what was going on in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Probably my parents did, because they were so much afraid of transportation.</span> <span id="s1270">We heard -- later on I was, you know, the place was small, so I was more privileged to listen, they were talking about killing.</span> <span id="s1271">We are afraid to be around it, we are afraid to being taken by train to -- it was the camp, th-they didn't know what exactly are doing in this camp, bel -- in Belzyce, that was the closest camp, and was only camp they kill, so they -- we were afraid to go to Belzyce.</span> <span id="s1272">You have to completely give up all your property and go, and we didn’t know what they are going to do with us.</span> <span id="s1273">We knew about killings, they kill on the street.</span> <span id="s1274">They kill, you know, they -- we knew about being taken to the car and driven, and they kill by gas, gassing people inside the car, we knew about those cars.</span> <span id="s1275">But it was always somebody else, it was not us.</span> <span id="s1276">Everybody wanted to protect, you know, his family and his life.</span> <span id="s1277">And he -- it was so -- i -- I-I -- I think that it was psychologically so horrible that they did.</span> <span id="s1278">They simply immuned people by feeling sorry for other people.</span> <span id="s1279">You were worrying about your own life, your -- your family, and was -- we knew about others, but nobody cry or feel sorry for them.</span> <span id="s1280">It was one more day for us.</span> <span id="s1281">And nobody really -- people used to escape, probably -- I want to survive.</span> <span id="s1282">It was secrecy.</span> <span id="s1283">If we had a hiding place, nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1284">And we were afraid of Jewish, it -- it was Jewish police as well as, you know, the -- they had this Jewish police which supposed to deal along with Ukrainian and Germans, with the order, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s1285">So whenever was si -- they notified they have aktion that you have to pack 20 pounds and go to the train, the Jewish policemen used to go around and talk to Jews.</span> <span id="s1286">And he -- they collected furs, every fur that you have, you should be giving to German because they were freezing on the eastern front.</span> <span id="s1287">So they took fur from the coats, you know, every little girl had the fur collar, they took that and -- and the Jewish police -- police collected it.</span> <span id="s1288">And they were obliged to point out who hide the fur, and they did.</span> <span id="s1289">They did.</span> <span id="s1290">And we hated Jewish police, you know, they considered them horrible people.</span> <span id="s1291">But they were like e-every one of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: W-Was there a time that the Jewish police came for your mother’s furs or your fur collar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Well, it was the -- they came from house to house to let us know, and we all collected everything, and my father has the coat which was line -- it was fur, it was very elegant coat.</span> <span id="s1294">And he gave it to Ukrainian doctor, and this man wear this coat, and every time I pass by, I saw my father coat, and I was wondering, is he going to give it back to us after the war.</span> <span id="s1295">It was one that had friends, you know, in the da -- dairy place where he used to collect me, so he gave him his coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: When your grandfather was beaten and then died, did that shift anything in the family?</span> <span id="s1297">Or how did that shift?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1299">My grandmother was suddenly crying nonstop.</span> <span id="s1300">And I don’t know how the other people feel, but I was so angry with her.</span> <span id="s1301">I felt that she disturbed the peace in the family.</span> <span id="s1302">It was cruel of me.</span> <span id="s1303">But you know, child doesn’t -- I was very angry.</span> <span id="s1304">I didn’t feel sorry for her at all.</span> <span id="s1305">And she cry for si -- weeks and weeks when she cry.</span> <span id="s1306">I wanted her to stop.</span> <span id="s1307">It was so much going on on that time that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: W-Was the family able to have any sort of burial service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: It was something, but I was not there.</span> <span id="s1310">I know they buried him in Jewish cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1313">Yes, they -- he die in hospital, so he was buried, yes.</span> <span id="s1314">I don’t even know where is his grave, but probably my father knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: At this point di -- do you think that your mother and your father are making preparations in case something happens?</span> <span id="s1316">Do you th -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Well, I think they were trying to obtain the false papers.</span> <span id="s1318">But I don’t think they have any source that they could do it.</span> <span id="s1319">And on this point they didn’t yet.</span> <span id="s1320">When things in 19 -- end of 1941, it was a really -- a t -- horrible -- the -- the German probably decided to get rid of Jews whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1321">And the terror start -- was really unbearable.</span> <span id="s1322">Every time they were rounding people on the streets they -- there were more and more killing, and e -- and there were two big aktions.</span> <span id="s1323">They wanted to -- that everybody need to -- needed to report to railroad station with 20 kilograms, or whatever it is, for deportation.</span> <span id="s1324">And every time -- probably some people went and were deported.</span> <span id="s1325">But we always managed to get postponement, because my father was in hospital, and he -- so we stay.</span> <span id="s1326">The family stay, the same [indecipherable] you know, the dentist, they stay.</span> <span id="s1327">And he -- only in -- it was before cri -- after cris -- after Christmas or New Year, on fr -- ’41 - ’42, Christmas ’41 and New Year ’42 that it was this final aktion and he -- I remember the -- my father was on the hospital on that time, and the po -- [indecipherable] Jewish policeman came over and talked to my mother.</span> <span id="s1328">He -- I don’t know if he was his patient, or he like him, or -- he gave -- tel -- he told her in secrecy that in the morning, early in the morning, go and hide, because Germans going to round everybody and that is end of us.</span> <span id="s1329">And that was a time when my mother spoke to my grandmother, you know, and -- and Buchmans, and she send me at night, send me to hospital to notify my father that she doesn’t know what to do, that we are going all to die.</span> <span id="s1330">And that was a night that she really -- it was late, it was maybe one o’clock at night that I went.</span> <span id="s1331">And I remember the day, it was seven of January, 1942, it was Ukrainian Christmas.</span> <span id="s1332">Because they were walking, you know -- they had a tradition also in Poland, they walk with the star and with the -- with the Bethlehem marionet -- you know, little dolls and they go from house to house and they play and they get money for showing, you know, having the show, marionette show, the doll show.</span> <span id="s1333">And they were still walking on -- those young, young people, on the roads.</span> <span id="s1334">So when I run to hospital, I went through the fields to avoid them, to -- if -- I didn’t want to meet everybody, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1335">And when I heard voices, I used to just lay down in the ditch.</span> <span id="s1336">It was a road, and every road has a ditch for water.</span> <span id="s1337">So I was just laying down in the ditch, waiting for them to pass by.</span> <span id="s1338">And you feel like trying to go underground, you know, to the tunnel, to hide.</span> <span id="s1339">And he -- of course, when I reached the hospital, the lights were on, so I had to really knock and Dr. Gibywa, that was the one that pull me up to the -- and she gave me this little bag to give it to my father, one that I found which had papers and money left over, his diploma, my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1340">The marriage license of my parents.</span> <span id="s1341">The insurance policy from Italian, you know, insurance firm that my father took before war.</span> <span id="s1342">She felt that it’s very important, we have to have it after war.</span> <span id="s1343">And -- and pictures.</span> <span id="s1344">Were loose, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: She put these in a bag, and locked the bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: It was not a bag, it was like her cosmetic bag.</span> <span id="s1347">It was like little -- little suitcase, leather, very heavy leather and had a very heavy lock.</span> <span id="s1348">It was completely locked, and had the little handle, and the -- she always used to lock it, that was her safe.</span> <span id="s1349">And she gave it to me, said give it to Father, because I don’t know, they might steal it, they might take it.</span> <span id="s1350">It was always hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Go back to before, when she sent you out and what -- what did she tell you was happening when she gave you the case and told you to go to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: She didn’t tell me anything, I knew.</span> <span id="s1353">I knew.</span> <span id="s1354">She didn’t have to explain anything.</span> <span id="s1355">On that time I was, you know, I was privilege to all the discussions.</span> <span id="s1356">I knew.</span> <span id="s1357">We didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1358">She said, just give it to your father, and be careful.</span> <span id="s1359">And tell him what’s happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: So you ran from the house, did you -- did you encounter anybody?</span> <span id="s1361">Were you dodging -- you were dodging the young people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I was -- no, I didn’t, it was night, it was really nobody around.</span> <span id="s1363">I was afraid of Germans, I was afraid of Ukrainian police, and I was afraid of the youngst -- young people that might spot me and really take me to Germans, so -- because we were not allowed to walk after dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: A-And once they pulled you up into the hospital, Dr. --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Gibywa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: -- Gibywa pulled you up, what -- what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Well, he hide me.</span> <span id="s1368">They knew already.</span> <span id="s1369">They already knew, you know, the news were spread all over, probably somebody who was friendly with them notify.</span> <span id="s1370">They knew, and he was very concerned, and he locked me in this big closet.</span> <span id="s1371">So I -- and said, “Stay quietly here, I don’t want you -- anybody to know you.”</span> <span id="s1372">And he went for my father, and then they went, and they -- when he came back, it was this nun who took me and she took me from this closet, and it was the bathroom, men bathroom.</span> <span id="s1373">And one of the compartment was used for the other clean -- janitor closet.</span> <span id="s1374">So she opened this compartment, she had a key -- I told you, everything has a key.</span> <span id="s1375">And she said to me, you have to sit on -- that was the -- no, lavatory over there, so she said, you have to pull your legs, and you have to sit there quietly because -- and I’m going to fetch you [indecipherable] and get some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: So you were in a locked lavatory stall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: With your legs pulled up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: With my legs pull up, and it was a little louver -- o-only on this stall, it was window above, but I couldn't raise the window, it was a louver outside, that I could see what’s going on outside.</span> <span id="s1380">But it was night, so I was sitting there, when s -- when I heard the door open, somebody went to use the lavatory, I used to pull my leg up, you know, and sit there and I was just sitting there, trying not to sleep, and trying not to -- til morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: So you would be in there and people -- men, came in and used the lavatory a few times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Yeah, yes, yes, the patients, that was patient -- they didn’t have -- they had only one place, you know, so the patient used the -- or they use the [indecipherable] or whatever, or they -- it was a man lavatory [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: And what was the name of the nun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: [indecipherable] Sister Jadwiga, I -- she was -- I don’t really know, I -- I don’t even know her last name.</span> <span id="s1385">She was a older person, but she was the head nurse, she was a head nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Did your father come visit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1388">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1389">Nobody even -- it -- nobody visited me.</span> <span id="s1390">I had to stay there and behave.</span> <span id="s1391">But was the worse, it was already night, so probably three or four o’clock, and at six o’clock I heard the German cars, you know, those trucks, big trucks, you could hear that, and they have [indecipherable] for I -- I was familiar with the sound of those trucks, and dogs and Germans shouting, and Ukrainian police, and so I looks through the louver, and they were on the yar -- on the hospital grounds, and yelling and shouting, and they knock to the -- they have the main entrance, which was always locked, everything was locked in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1392">So they open -- the doorman opened this door, and they run upstairs and to get all the Jews out.</span> <span id="s1393">So I saw those patients, some on the -- they were taking and loading them to the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: On stretchers?</span> <span id="s1395">Laying down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Some on stretchers, some si -- you know, in the gowns, undress, in the gowns, sick people, loading them to the truck.</span> <span id="s1397">And infectious one they used to kill and throw on the truck.</span> <span id="s1398">And then I saw some -- Dr. Rebach was a Jewish with a white coat, he was loaded, and my father was loaded to the truck.</span> <span id="s1399">And, you know, some nurses which were helps -- people working with Jews were on the truck.</span> <span id="s1400">And apparently somebody called this doctor, what was his name?</span> <span id="s1401">I s -- Garbovsky, so he came from the house, and Dr. Gibywa was standing and talking to Germans and -- and when this director hospital came, they unloaded doctors.</span> <span id="s1402">So I saw my father -- because on this point I wanted to go, I didn't want to stay there, I wanted to be with him.</span> <span id="s1403">I was afraid to be completely alone.</span> <span id="s1404">So they unloaded the doctors, and I saw, you know, let them know -- apparently he said he doesn’t have doctors, it’s a typhoid fever, he needs to have doctors.</span> <span id="s1405">If not it will be total disas -- so they unloaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: And you saw that?</span> <span id="s1407">A: I saw that, yes.</span> <span id="s1408">And it’s funny, you know, you [indecipherable] things, and you know you don’t and you are totally helpless, and you are afraid, and you don’t want to be a hero, and you’re trying to just hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: But were you considering leaving and running down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yes, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1411">The door was lo -- I -- I did consider it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: I believer you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1414">I wanted, and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1415">I was there and they -- I was petrified what will happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: So how long was it before someone came to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: When that was over, she came and she took me from this place.</span> <span id="s1418">And she hide me in one room which was empty, she put me to the beds.</span> <span id="s1419">And later on she locked me in another closet, and then I was in the basement.</span> <span id="s1420">And then I was on -- on the attic.</span> <span id="s1421">Every time she used to take me some other place, you know, and -- and finally, after week or two -- I haven’t seen my father at all, and [indecipherable] Dr. Gibywa, she used to take care of, she used to hide me.</span> <span id="s1422">And he -- then one day she took me to the tower and I stay in the nun’s apartment.</span> <span id="s1423">And also I stay in the clo -- I was not allowed to walk, because they could hear the steps, and to make sure that I won’t walk, she locked me in the closet again.</span> <span id="s1424">So I was staying there til she comes back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: You would be in a -- a dark closet all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: What did you -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1429">You are numb, nothing.</span> <span id="s1430">In evening she used to come back and you know, [indecipherable] and s -- nuns that used to live with her, we both knew.</span> <span id="s1431">And then maybe -- I don’t know how long it was, it was -- my time was just -- when things were quiet -- I was told that my mother is fine and my father is fine, my grandmother is fine and I shouldn’t worry.</span> <span id="s1432">That I was told.</span> <span id="s1433">And he -- one day she -- it’s -- she came and she took me to railroad station, there was evening train to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: This is Sister Jadwiga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1436">And Sister Blanche waited for me on the railroad station, a second, another one that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1437">And she was such a sweet, young, with smiling face, and I feel very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1438">Before they took me, they braid my hair differently, they dress me differently in poor, you know, long skirt, because I used to wear those short coat and they gave me diff -- dress me differently, and she gave me prayer book to my -- you know, to my little bag, and she -- and rosary, and I -- probably she had some papers for me too.</span> <span id="s1439">And I went with her with -- to Lvov, and nobody really bother us on the way at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: But before that, that -- I had understood that at some point when you were staying in the apartment with Sister Jadwiga, was she teaching you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1442">She was teaching me prayers, which I knew, practically, and she was si -- talking to a [indecipherable] she was ta -- teaching me who I am, my new name, where I was born, my mother maiden name.</span> <span id="s1443">And that was kind of -- she -- she used to do that every day, I had to repeat that and tell her and she used to wake me up, what’s your name?</span> <span id="s1444">To make sure that I really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: D-Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1447">Marisha Borofska.</span> <span id="s1448">I was born on 29 of different -- February 1929.</span> <span id="s1449">[indecipherable] and my mother was Laguinsky, and father -- and my father left her, she -- she die and sh -- he die and she die and I don’t know anything about the family.</span> <span id="s1450">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1451">And I was in orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: So what -- you would get up in the morning and she would make you recite prayers in front of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: No, not prayers, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: -- I knew prayers, but I have to give my immediate who are you, what’s your name, just to make sure that I really know what is my name, that I won’t hesitate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: So she was teaching you your new identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: My new i -- identity, yes.</span> <span id="s1458">She wanted to make sure that I am not going to hesitate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: And did your father come visit you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1461">In that point I haven’t seen my father and I never saw my mother again.</span> <span id="s1462">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Do you know if your mother knew what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1465">She knew because they even knew where I am even I was in Wamina, because she used to send me, though the nuns, she used to send me some cookies that she bake.</span> <span id="s1466">It must be -- I don’t know how much she paid [indecipherable] to cook them, to do that.</span> <span id="s1467">Or melted butter, I remember.</span> <span id="s1468">You know, in the [indecipherable] she melted the butter, because it holds longer, and she send it to me.</span> <span id="s1469">And of course, I couldn’t have that, so sist -- Sister Sophia call me at night, late at night to her room and she used to give me piece of bread that she brought from her supper, and she put this butter on, and she said that’s from -- from your mother.</span> <span id="s1470">And I couldn’t say to anyone, nothing.</span> <span id="s1471">So she knew where I was, and she -- later on I met someone from Turka and the person said that my mother told everybody that I was killed, I was taken by Germans.</span> <span id="s1472">So she didn’t want anybody to know [indecipherable] question.</span> <span id="s1473">And it was such obvious things, that nobody questioned.</span> <span id="s1474">But what happened, when I arrived to Lvov, this Sister Blanche let me loose, she didn’t want me -- she was afraid that I might -- somebody might see me.</span> <span id="s1475">And to make long story short, this Ukrainian girl with her mother was on the railroad station in Lvov and they saw me, and they look at me, and I pretend that I don’t know who they are.</span> <span id="s1476">And they didn’t even get close to me.</span> <span id="s1477">But when they came back, the mother went to my mother and said, “Don’t worry, she’s alive, I just saw her in Lvov.”</span> <span id="s1478">So -- but they didn’t know, you know, I was alone because they ask me to leave station alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: I mean, your -- your father never came to you and said this is who’s going to take care of you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: -- it was just th-the -- the nurse came and then another nun, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: -- you just trusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: I had no choice.</span> <span id="s1485">I knew that he -- that was arranged.</span> <span id="s1486">I knew that.</span> <span id="s1487">Without him, probably nobody would take care of me.</span> <span id="s1488">But he didn’t -- we didn’t talk, y-you know, we didn’t have any explain -- they never explain anything to me, it was like that to the end, when I was grown up.</span> <span id="s1489">It -- we had to -- my father and myself, he expect me to know.</span> <span id="s1490">It was -- he -- we never talk about personal things at all, it was absolutely obvious.</span> <span id="s1491">There was no explanation whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Y -- you talked about the last time you saw your mother, from what you learned later, what happened to your mother?</span> <span id="s1493">Did she stay in Turka for awhile, was she actually deported in the aktion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No.</span> <span id="s1495">When I -- when I left, I was totally [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: I was not there.</span> <span id="s1498">My parents tried to escape to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1499">In Hungary apparently it was simpler to -- to stay alive, and probably they -- they knew somebody, I have no idea why to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1500">And they left with widow of one of the doctors and her son.</span> <span id="s1501">I was told that by her son.</span> <span id="s1502">I don’t know how true it is, but I met him in Germany later, after the war, and -- and he -- actually, he didn’t know who I am.</span> <span id="s1503">I remember him when I was a little girl, and he was like 20 on that time.</span> <span id="s1504">So when I introduce myself, suddenly he con -- I said, well, you know, I -- we used to escape with your mother and your father to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1505">And I know they were escaping.</span> <span id="s1506">And he told me story which shaked me.</span> <span id="s1507">I have no idea if this true or not, but why should he lie?</span> <span id="s1508">That they were escaping and they were caught by Hungarian patrol, border patrol.</span> <span id="s1509">And they wanted to return them to Gestapo, to Germans.</span> <span id="s1510">That was like death sentence.</span> <span id="s1511">That my mother kneeled in front of these people and they told -- she told them, please don’t do that, I have a daughter and she is waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1512">And they let them go, but they had to return.</span> <span id="s1513">So they went back to Turka.</span> <span id="s1514">I-It was very close to Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s1515">And he -- so he -- this man and his mother somehow were hidden and they survived the war.</span> <span id="s1516">He’s still alive, he’s -- he lives in Germany.</span> <span id="s1517">My father never mentioned that and I never talked to him about it.</span> <span id="s1518">He didn’t talk at all.</span> <span id="s1519">Whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: So he didn’t tell you what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: No.</span> <span id="s1522">When I ask him once, he said just, I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1523">Is over.</span> <span id="s1524">Is nothing to talk about, is over.</span> <span id="s1525">So i-it was unsuccessful.</span> <span id="s1526">So later on my father managed to find -- hide this place for his mother from aunt -- from my grandmother, and he -- papers for my mother that was sent from Lvov, and sh -- the only thing that she needed to reach the place.</span> <span id="s1527">And on the way she was recognized by someone, or suspected by someone, we have -- we have no idea.</span> <span id="s1528">And she was taken off the train in Druhobich and taken to the prison.</span> <span id="s1529">And she insisted that is not true, that she’s not Jewish, and she is so and so and so and so.</span> <span id="s1530">And my father got news from Jewish committee over there that he -- they can arrange for her release if he pays so much money.</span> <span id="s1531">So apparently my father sent the money.</span> <span id="s1532">Somehow he managed to get bribe, but money was gone, but he was told he’s too late.</span> <span id="s1533">So we really didn’t know what happened, if they killed her over there, or they send her to the camp, or -- but we know that she was -- she died.</span> <span id="s1534">But all my aunts die.</span> <span id="s1535">They were taken to concentration camp from Lvov, they went to Lvov.</span> <span id="s1536">Their husband were killed before.</span> <span id="s1537">And two daughters, my -- each of -- we -- it was only single child in every family in our family.</span> <span id="s1538">So one, Zula, that I mentioned to you, she was hidden by my grandmother and my aunt’s maid.</span> <span id="s1539">She was wonderful, and we -- we loved her, she was such a -- she like family member in our house, in their house.</span> <span id="s1540">And second one, which was older, she was 18, and she was blonde with blue eyes, Irena Trepper was se -- somehow arranged for the papers and she went straight to Germans and she said she was to go to work in Germany because on that time Polish people used -- were taken for work in Germany, taught organization.</span> <span id="s1541">So she went -- they sent her to Hamburg and she worked for German family as a maid.</span> <span id="s1542">And these people loved her.</span> <span id="s1543">I don’t really know because she never talk about it, she lives in Israel, she’s still there.</span> <span id="s1544">And after war she decided not to go back to Poland, and she went through Cyprus to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1545">She knew language, she used to go to Hebrew high school in Nowy Sacz, her father was a Zionist, but it was very important.</span> <span id="s1546">She was not the religious [indecipherable] not the same, but they were determined to go to Palestine one day.</span> <span id="s1547">That’s what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: I want you to talk a bit about leaving Turka with Sister Jadwiga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: With Sister Blanche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Blanche.</span> <span id="s1553">Tell us -- tell us that story.</span> <span id="s1554">At this point you have gone home with the nurse from the Turka hospital.</span> <span id="s1555">You’ve been given your life story, your false identity, and if you could just sort of walk us through what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Well, she took me to Lvov, and they had hom.</span> <span id="s1557">It means an orphanage near Lvov, on Korkova Street in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1558">I -- I -- they had two orphanages, one on Swidova, and one on Korkova, and [indecipherable] which I went to.</span> <span id="s1559">But it was this orphanage and he -- many children, we had the -- our bedrooms were like 20 beds in one bedroom, one next to another, the old s -- open space, big open space and beds.</span> <span id="s1560">So I got to one of them, and he -- actually I didn’t go to school at the -- what we did -- I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1561">We work in, you know, in the kitchen and I didn’t go to school over there.</span> <span id="s1562">It was some kind of fe -- they had some kind of activity.</span> <span id="s1563">And I went -- I was there a very short time, because the first what happened, that somebody, one of the girls came to me and said, well you are Marisha Borofska, we had Marisha Borofska here.</span> <span id="s1564">It was the name of the gir -- one of the girls, probably they pick out those papers which existed.</span> <span id="s1565">So nuns got scared.</span> <span id="s1566">So Sister Blanche came again.</span> <span id="s1567">She was a courier actually.</span> <span id="s1568">She used to bring children from those -- children with -- Polish children without the parents, orphans from the charitable organization to the orphanages.</span> <span id="s1569">And probably they were paid by those organizations some money because you have to -- they didn’t have money to -- to support those kids, but they really took care of those kids.</span> <span id="s1570">So she came, and when she came back with the new papers, and she change my name to Marisha Vorshinska and she took me away from there to Wamina.</span> <span id="s1571">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Hm, one question.</span> <span id="s1573">When the little girl said oh, we know maris -- Mariasa -- the first identity --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Marishka -- Mari --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Did you -- did you sort of immediately run and tell the nun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: No, I didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: So -- so how did it sort of come out that this little girl was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Apparently it came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Apparently it came out, because I didn’t say anything, I didn’t react it.</span> <span id="s1581">I didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1582">I didn’t react it.</span> <span id="s1583">And he -- probably they felt insecure.</span> <span id="s1584">Later on the Mother Superior of this convent in -- she became Mother Superior of entire convent, you know, those nuns, Franciscan nuns, but in that time she was simply in charge, Mother in charge in the convent in Wamina.</span> <span id="s1585">She knew -- actually, she was one that agree -- send -- send up [indecipherable] to take me.</span> <span id="s1586">And he -- apparently she was -- it was just taking place for me, Lvov.</span> <span id="s1587">But later, after war when I spoke to her, she said to me that in Lvov they were afraid to keep me because apparently they were in the middle of the town and they were simply afraid.</span> <span id="s1588">So she decided to take me to Wamina.</span> <span id="s1589">Wamina was close place, it was little Ukrainian village.</span> <span id="s1590">The only Polish place was this monastery, and orphanage.</span> <span id="s1591">And they have some fields and gardens and cows and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1592">They have a farm.</span> <span id="s1593">The nuns were running this farm, which support them a little.</span> <span id="s1594">But he -- I was really the first -- maybe not me, because it was another girl, she was the daughter of the judge from Sembor or Druhobich, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1595">Her name was Ursula Piper.</span> <span id="s1596">She was the Jewish girl, and she was very, very Semitic.</span> <span id="s1597">Very dark, olive skin and very, very dark hair.</span> <span id="s1598">So -- and I was actually the second Jewish girl that came to this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: This is in Wamina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Wamina, yes.</span> <span id="s1601">It was beginning on ’42.</span> <span id="s1602">It was somewhere in February ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: So you went from Turka to the second orphanage in the space of about a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: In -- in Lvov, what do you -- why do you think the little girl said that, and if she was making noises, what was her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: No, because it was another girl by this name, that it was -- that once used to be in Lvov, and later on she would transfer somewhere else, so they remember that girl.</span> <span id="s1607">No, she didn’t try to -- she didn’t have anything in mind except that it was another girl like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: When you were in Wamina, when you were introduced with your -- tell us about your new identity again.</span> <span id="s1609">The second identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Well my -- second identity was ma -- Maria Vorshinska, and they call me Maryla because it was so many Marias that they have to change those Marias a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: And when she brought me to Wamina, I felt very comfortable because they have the nun which was in charge in school and children, was the wonderful, wonderful person, Sophia -- Sister Sophia.</span> <span id="s1613">She was full of talent, she was running the chorus, she play on organs, she dance, she organize theater.</span> <span id="s1614">We -- you know, she was very artistic, and also she was tremendously good pedagogue.</span> <span id="s1615">So everybody was in love with her.</span> <span id="s1616">On the same time she -- everybody was afraid of her because she was very rigid.</span> <span id="s1617">And she took me after -- under her wings.</span> <span id="s1618">I don’t know if she was -- felt pity for me, you know, and she was really extremely good to me.</span> <span id="s1619">The -- years later when I met someone from Wamina, the girl says to me, oh you were the favorite of doct -- Sister Sophia, and I think I was.</span> <span id="s1620">She really like me.</span> <span id="s1621">It doesn’t mean that sh -- I have any privilege, but I felt that she is really my friend, and I needed it.</span> <span id="s1622">So I felt very, very comfortable about that.</span> <span id="s1623">And I loved her, you know, I could kill for her.</span> <span id="s1624">She was just wonderful person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: You mentioned that one girl looked very Semitic, but did you think that she was Jewish, or perhaps even know that she was Jewish with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Oh, I could -- I took one look at her and I knew who she is.</span> <span id="s1627">You know?</span> <span id="s1628">You don’t -- you just take one look at the person and you -- you know she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1629">It is a way I recognize others later on and I’m pretty sure they did, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Recognize you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1632">And we never talk about it.</span> <span id="s1633">We never even get close one to another.</span> <span id="s1634">It was something strange, you know, the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: So you might feel fairly comfortable with the other girls, but if there was another Jewish girl in the group, you’d keep your distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: I kept my distance.</span> <span id="s1637">Yes, I kept my distance.</span> <span id="s1638">So we -- we all did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: And would the nuns ever tell you that little girl over there is in the same situation as you?</span> <span id="s1640">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1642">No, there was no discussion whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1643">Even nuns really, the only two that knew who we were, except some could suspect, because that was sus -- was Sophia and Blanche and Sister Budnofska which was the -- she made the decision whom she should take, she was authority in this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Is Sister Blanche Blanka Pigwaska?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Pigwaska, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Blanka Pigwaska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: And she was the one who was very, very young and she was the courier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1650">She was a courier, she was a secretary, she was always -- she used to arrange money, you know, and she run errands and travel to Warsaw and -- and deal with authorities and she was one which was representing.</span> <span id="s1651">And she work for the mu -- superior, the Sister Superior which was in charge, and it was Sister Budnofska, Tekla Budnofska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Di -- di -- just -- so when you’re in Wamina, the -- it’s Sister Sophia and Sister Tekla Budnofska --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: -- who you’re having the most contact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: They knew exactly who I was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1657">And would they ever acknowledge it to you in the kind of maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yes, well, she used to give me news about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: S-Sophia.</span> <span id="s1661">Budnofska didn’t talk to anybody, she was above everyone.</span> <span id="s1662">We used to kiss her hands.</span> <span id="s1663">You know, she was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: She was the Mother Superior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: -- Mother Superior, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Is it Sister Sophia then, who shared the butter with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1668">I was very thin, and she used to bring soup from her supper, and I’m pretty sure they didn’t have too much, and call me at night and ask me to eat her soup, extra food.</span> <span id="s1669">I don’t know, maybe she did it to others too, because everything was kind of secretive.</span> <span id="s1670">But she used to feed me, you know, just because I was extremely, extremely thin.</span> <span id="s1671">I have the -- it was a period of time that I have the lack of vitamins and food, so I develop boils all over my body including my face.</span> <span id="s1672">Here, and nose, and -- of course I am not talking about lice and that stuff which live after this -- under the skin.</span> <span id="s1673">It was horrible, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1674">And whenever I cut myself it was immediately boil, you know?</span> <span id="s1675">So that was the -- probably lack of vitamins and I didn’t have anything at all for -- for awhile ye -- also.</span> <span id="s1676">So it was -- in some times -- it was winter on ’42 already, end of ’42, when one day she walked me out and she -- I don’t know what was first, when she told me about my mother when she die?</span> <span id="s1677">No, that was first.</span> <span id="s1678">She walked me out at night and she let me -- asked me to dress [indecipherable] and took me to the second -- the con -- it was church in the middle, school and girl’s quarter was on one wing, and second wing was nun wings, and guest wings.</span> <span id="s1679">So she took me to nun wings, and it was a tunnel underneath the church that you could -- in the basement that you could walk through.</span> <span id="s1680">And she opened the door in one of the guest room and it was my father.</span> <span id="s1681">Apparently he was sent by German with group of Jewish doctors to the nearby villages to immunize against typhoid fever, because it was again out -- outbreak of typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s1682">And he managed to contact Sister Budnofska and she asked him to come.</span> <span id="s1683">And he -- so he saw my boils and he gave me something, I think.</span> <span id="s1684">They were suspecting that maybe I have syphilis or whatever, what the hell I [indecipherable] I had that stuff on my face.</span> <span id="s1685">So she gave me some kind of medicine which I don’t know it helped me, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1686">Finally it went away.</span> <span id="s1687">But they fed me a little bit better so it went away.</span> <span id="s1688">But I saw him on that time, and he -- later on in that morning I saw him in church.</span> <span id="s1689">He probably -- and he -- I don’t know how long he stayed.</span> <span id="s1690">And wa -- what was the reason, but he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Tell us about that meeting, when you -- the door was opened and your father was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Yeah, and I didn’t react.</span> <span id="s1693">I didn’t react at all.</span> <span id="s1694">You know, you see those [indecipherable] kissing, no, I didn't react.</span> <span id="s1695">Okay.</span> <span id="s1696">Well, apparently he knew where I am, yes.</span> <span id="s1697">And second experience I had, I think it was beginning ’33 -- ’43, I dreamt that my mother died.</span> <span id="s1698">It’s funny because I probably cry.</span> <span id="s1699">And, you know, we have this big bedroom, 20 beds, you know, and so somebody, one of the children wake me up, and then s -- and I couldn't wake up.</span> <span id="s1700">So when I wake up I saw Sister Sophia stand -- and it was night, and she took me away.</span> <span id="s1701">And she told me that my mother die, was killed.</span> <span id="s1702">So they knew everything about the family, they follow it, you know, they were attached to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Going back to when -- when you did see your father and you didn’t react, how long were you and your father together?</span> <span id="s1704">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Eventually -- do you remember anything about what was spoken or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: -- what he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: No.</span> <span id="s1710">The Sister was -- were in the room, and you know, we didn’t have any secrets with S-Sophia, and Superior, and later on I left and they still stayed, probably talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Did he say anything to you about what was going on, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: No.</span> <span id="s1713">He asked me if I behave, he asked me to be a good girl.</span> <span id="s1714">And Sister Superior complained that I am too daring, that I -- you know, when I -- we have these German inspections and -- and probably I was too visible, they should stay.</span> <span id="s1715">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: And then you saw him the next day in church, did you have any contact at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: No, no, no, I pretend I don’t know he was here.</span> <span id="s1718">Cause we used to go to church every day for morning prayers, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: So what was it like to have your father appear out of nowhere?</span> <span id="s1720">Did it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: I don’t know, I cannot -- I’m afraid to think back.</span> <span id="s1722">I was numb.</span> <span id="s1723">I didn’t express any emotions or anything like that, I didn’t cry.</span> <span id="s1724">Now I am crying more than that.</span> <span id="s1725">Now.</span> <span id="s1726">Probably I was happy that he is fine, but -- it gave me certain security that he exist, you know.</span> <span id="s1727">I didn’t ask what happen with rest of family, nothing.</span> <span id="s1728">I didn’t know what to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: And is that how you normally were at the orphanage?</span> <span id="s1730">Were you very quiet and numb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1732">Yes.</span> <span id="s1733">One of the girls later on is -- much later told me that I was very reserved.</span> <span id="s1734">You know, I didn’t want to lie, so I didn’t want to get close, really.</span> <span id="s1735">I didn’t want to talk about anything which personal.</span> <span id="s1736">So we talk about, you know, everyday stuff, but I was not -- I couldn’t -- I didn’t want to tell them, you know, about family and stuff like that, so I was -- I never wanted to get close to anyone.</span> <span id="s1737">I was kind of waiting.</span> <span id="s1738">It was time when we had in -- we didn't go to s-school, school is in orphanage.</span> <span id="s1739">They have certain classes, but priority was work.</span> <span id="s1740">So whenever was a field work, we had to do that, the washing, you know, the laundry.</span> <span id="s1741">It was done by girls, and there was plenty of, you know.</span> <span id="s1742">And they were small, they used to have very small children, they wet beds, you know, so you have to wash every time all those huge sheets and -- and laundry was a good place to work because you got extra bread, and don’t forget we were hungry, all of us, was no food.</span> <span id="s1743">So -- and also I was older than my real age, my papers were that I am older, so I belong to older children.</span> <span id="s1744">And also, older children used to hide when German came because they tried to take Polish children to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s1745">So we used to hide, and we had this hiding place, they have a big [indecipherable] stage and under the stage it was the -- and we used to crowd there, and whenever was German inspection, we lay one and next to another in this little corner, which was invisible even if you light, and later on Sister Sophia used to go up and just knock, and everybody crawl out.</span> <span id="s1746">And there were older children, Polish girls, and there were some -- not children, but youngsters, 18 years old that work at the orphanage, and they were hiding as well because nobody wanted to go to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s1747">In -- so I was -- they ask us to -- every morning Sister Sophia used to either read names of girls which go to kitchen to peel potatoes, or they -- another group goes to the laundry, and another group goes to the garden, and another group cleans, you know, rooms, we have to -- they were parquet floors, that you have -- they a need -- needed to be absolutely, you know, shining, so that was a lot of work to -- to [indecipherable] you know, to -- to polish those floors.</span> <span id="s1748">So there were groups working, depends how old you are, and -- and sh-she used to rotate those groups so not everybody -- so quite often I used to go to laundry, and was a great place because you have this extra bread with cheese, with bowl of cheese on top for -- for second breakfast.</span> <span id="s1749">And of course I had to have a chair because I couldn’t reach, you know, and you didn’t have the washing machine, but you have to use those, you know, how you call that stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: The washboard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Washboards, yes.</span> <span id="s1752">And I couldn't twist that.</span> <span id="s1753">I was practically left handed, except that I was forced to work with my right hand, so I was twisting with left hand and the Sister in laundry used to say, “Maryla, don’t twist like a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1754">Because it’s different, left hand.</span> <span id="s1755">It was the -- and I used to fake, because I couldn’t get rid of those stains.</span> <span id="s1756">So you wa -- that was a white laundry, you have to wash it, and then you -- she -- look at that, is absolutely [indecipherable] now you have to do it again.</span> <span id="s1757">And then you -- they used to boil it, it was big boiler, and you used to -- and it boils, and after it was boiling, you wash it again, it was white.</span> <span id="s1758">So I was waiting for her to turn so I could throw it into the boiler.</span> <span id="s1759">And somehow I was pretty successful doing that.</span> <span id="s1760">Probably somebody else di-did the same.</span> <span id="s1761">Someone very strong and they washed well, and they were very proud of it.</span> <span id="s1762">But -- and then we used to peel potatoes and work in the garden, and they didn’t like it very much.</span> <span id="s1763">And the fo -- on the fall we used to pick up potatoes, you have to -- in the field, that was very hard work, extremely hard.</span> <span id="s1764">It was a machine that you have to go and pick up everything.</span> <span id="s1765">Today probably people are leaving that stuff.</span> <span id="s1766">And so we -- we work very hard, you know, in addition to goin -- going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: A question about the ner -- the -- the nun who said don’t twist like a Jew.</span> <span id="s1768">Did she know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1770">She wouldn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: And so h-how did you understand her comment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1773">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1774">But I -- even today I am doing it with left hand, I cannot do otherwise.</span> <span id="s1775">And I didn’t mention anything to the nuns.</span> <span id="s1776">I felt that it’s much better when I am going to be quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Do you think she was sending you a message?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1779">You know, they were different people.</span> <span id="s1780">The only thing they were -- kept extremely under control by Mother Superior, so they wouldn’t do anything to -- you know, to misbehave, and they could be punished or sent away, you know, the -- it was tremendous power of Superior over the nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: In the time that you were there, or in any of the different orphanages, w-was someone in hiding ever discovered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: No.</span> <span id="s1783">No.</span> <span id="s1784">And they were daring.</span> <span id="s1785">On the end it was many, many Jewish children in this.</span> <span id="s1786">She used to admit quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1787">And not only older one, but also boys in orphanage, th-the small, little one, we used to call them [indecipherable] the little one, which were like two years old, three years old, there were some boys.</span> <span id="s1788">And I -- when things were worse, I saw much more children.</span> <span id="s1789">And we could recognize them, they were absolutely [indecipherable] different.</span> <span id="s1790">And also the children my age, and older people -- younger, they came, it was several names that I can mention, were saved by those nuns.</span> <span id="s1791">Later on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Do you want to mention those names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1794">The [indecipherable] it was a girl from -- probably older than I was, very smart, and definitely hiding.</span> <span id="s1795">And it was Teresa Branoff, she came and she was shaved, you know, that -- and sh -- probably -- she used to dance pretty, probably she used to go to ballet school when she was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1796">And it was the girl with a brother, a brother was a little one, and he sh -- her name was Kovalska, Teresa Kovalska.</span> <span id="s1797">Let’s see, Teresa Rogashinska, and few more girls.</span> <span id="s1798">And I didn't know except wa -- oh, Janka Davidovich that I have still contact with her.</span> <span id="s1799">Her name was on that time Markofska.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: The girl whose head was shaved, now what did people make of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Didn’t that just identify her as Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: I knew.</span> <span id="s1804">I don’t know if the other people knew.</span> <span id="s1805">She looked very well.</span> <span id="s1806">She didn’t look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s1807">But I knew.</span> <span id="s1808">She’s -- she lives in Poland, she stayed in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Di-Did Sister Sophia or any of the nuns ever say anything to you about why they were doing what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: No.</span> <span id="s1811">After war, Sister soph -- Tekla wrote -- well, I wa -- used to correspond with her, and this letter is amusing that she wrote me because I sent her a letter and I said, I don’t know how I should thank you for what you did.</span> <span id="s1812">And she send me a letter that she didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1813">That was her mission to do what she’s supposed to do, and she was guided by God.</span> <span id="s1814">And from her I thi -- I learned that was like fa -- 500 children saved by this -- not by her, but entire -- this nun organization.</span> <span id="s1815">So -- and I also kn-knew some other people, it was the professor gynecology in [indecipherable], Professor Justaporsky who was save by them, and many, many people, I am pretty sure that they help my father as well, as much they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: You -- you called it a nun organization --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Those --</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: -- was it a fra -- did it have a name?</span> <span id="s1819">That -- it was a Franciscan --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Yes, they were Franciscan -- I think Polish [indecipherable] I don’t know how to translate that.</span> <span id="s1821">Franciscan order of -- Sister of Maria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Go ahead and say it in Polish also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: [speaks Polish here] -- I have mental block.</span> <span id="s1824">I have mental block, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: If you think of it, just say it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Yes, I will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: I know it by heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Is the question about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: [speaks Polish here] now that’s what is, yeah.</span> <span id="s1831">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: You described yourself as very reserved, afraid sometimes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Well, I was conf -- constantly with the -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1834">I had this -- I was numb.</span> <span id="s1835">I couldn’t express anything, I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: W-Was there anything that you did for yourself, or in your mind, maybe late at night, in a way to kind of reassure yourself or reaffirm your own identity, who you were, Lidia, in -- anything that you did, in your mind I suppose it would have have to have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1838">It was something probably that I behave like -- like -- like a moron sometime, because I was so uptight.</span> <span id="s1839">Then, quite often, Sister Sophia, who was such a good friend of mine, she called me, Maria, you ha -- how you call the child of cow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: A calf?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Calf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: You dumb calf, she used to call me.</span> <span id="s1844">You know, this used to be the calf.</span> <span id="s1845">In Polish it sounds horrible, you know.</span> <span id="s1846">Maria [indecipherable] you si -- Maryla [indecipherable], you stupid calf.</span> <span id="s1847">Because probably she wanted me to react somehow, and I wa -- had always delay reaction.</span> <span id="s1848">And I know she was wonderful friend of mine, but even so, you know, she was -- she wanted to stimulate me somehow, and I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Did you sleep well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1851">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1852">I was tired.</span> <span id="s1853">Oh, I was overworked and tired, I could sleep anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: And wh -- how much did you think about your father or the rest of your family, your mother, until you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: I didn’t really.</span> <span id="s1856">I was hoping that I am going, when everything’s over, I’m going to end up staying forever in -- over there, because all the children, you know, the -- they have, the Polish orphans, they didn’t have parents, or they have dysfunctional family, or they were children they never had any parents.</span> <span id="s1857">They’re all orphans.</span> <span id="s1858">And they were actually, as far as parents condition, they were in the same situation.</span> <span id="s1859">And the way they raised those children, we didn’t have -- they didn’t have any vacation.</span> <span id="s1860">So they supposed to be na -- nannies, or maids, cooks, or whatever, you know, the lowest of the lower.</span> <span id="s1861">And actually, they -- most of them got education because of the Communistic parliament.</span> <span id="s1862">You know, they -- they were taken away from them when Communists came in.</span> <span id="s1863">And it was always freedom to get the communa -- education, that’s actually what Communists did, to one that didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1864">So I didn’t want to be a maid, and I didn’t want to be -- so next step, if you learn a little bit, you could be a teacher.</span> <span id="s1865">So when they ask what do you want to do, I always write I want to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s1866">I don’t know if I want -- probably not, but then I was thinking, what happened?</span> <span id="s1867">Where I am going to go?</span> <span id="s1868">I was sure that it is no Jew left in the world except this little, you know, clique that we are hidden.</span> <span id="s1869">And I was not sure of my parents.</span> <span id="s1870">I knew my mother was -- die, and I didn’t know anything about my grand -- the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1871">And I was sure that it was no Jew left in Poland, everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s1872">And in Wamina, it was very close to Turka, and it was in the village, and there were big forests over there, and we heard those shots.</span> <span id="s1873">They used to bring Jews and kill them, you know, they dig their own grave, and from the roof of the -- you could see, you know, this -- what is going on.</span> <span id="s1874">Not close, was pretty far.</span> <span id="s1875">And it was every day going on, and I was sure it’s -- no one is left.</span> <span id="s1876">So what I am going to do?</span> <span id="s1877">I’m not going to be a Jew, I don’t want to be a maid, I don’t want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1878">I didn’t know what’s -- what might happened.</span> <span id="s1879">When even -- when we went to Warsaw already, during the Warsaw op -- uprising, Sister Sophia used to guard me against the -- they was -- they were underground Polish organization, and they organize hospital exactly, and [indecipherable] Jews to help him.</span> <span id="s1880">And I was not allowed to show my face, but they were afraid that they might kill me.</span> <span id="s1881">They were not Germans.</span> <span id="s1882">But she asked me to stay in the basement.</span> <span id="s1883">She arranged -- they arranged the little chapel in the basement and we used to pray 24 hours, you know, novena for the safe [indecipherable] from Warsaw because we were under shells, and i-it was horrible, horrible time, and the bombs, you know, Germany used to bombs, and American used to bombs, and everybody, you know, and we were there, you know, in the middle of this shooting.</span> <span id="s1884">So i -- 24 hours somebody should pray, and I was one that it was 24 hours in the chapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Now, I want to talk more about that, but just tell us how you went from Wamina to Warsaw, and apparently the -- the Germans were involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Yes, so one night, it was end of, I think ’43, the Ukrainian band, you know, the troops, whoever it was, in [indecipherable] was name of the group, they invaded monastery, and they wanted to -- they were after Polish people working for Germans to register cows and pigs.</span> <span id="s1887">And so they were after these people, and of course they found them, they kill some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: But just -- before you go on, th-th -- these people had been given the job of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Going from the -- from the farm to farm, and tried, you know, register cows and pigs, and they used to put marks on them.</span> <span id="s1890">So the peasant couldn't pi -- kill those pigs, they had to give them as a conthing -- condint -- give them to Germans, It was for German army.</span> <span id="s1891">They wanted to have ready -- registration, and whoever killed the pig was severely punished.</span> <span id="s1892">So they hated these people because they wanted -- they raised those pigs.</span> <span id="s1893">And he -- so they deci -- they came, and they really didn’t want to have Polish group, a Polish settlement over there.</span> <span id="s1894">So they killed some of the civilian workers, and I think some nuns, and they set fire in the building, and the German saw the fire --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: In your building, in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Some of the buildings, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Nearby where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: The buildings that belongs to.</span> <span id="s1901">And they came from room to room, I remember, I -- I -- I hide under the bed, be -- some -- some kids run away, you know, and the German ca -- saw the fire -- actually it was Gestapo, I think, and they came, and it -- this band run away, but she -- Sister Superior was told, you better get out of here, because we will get you, so they decided to leave the place.</span> <span id="s1902">They knew that they are going to -- if not they are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1903">They left only one sister to guard, you know, the place, and German supply the cars, you know, the big trucks, and we simply took everything.</span> <span id="s1904">Everybody was worrying about his possession, so we took as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1905">And we moved to Lvov, and later from Lvov we moved to near Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: W-Were you carrying anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah, everybody got his belongings, and so I got my little suitcase, and I have couple of -- I used to write diary.</span> <span id="s1908">So I have my diary, and I have my w-we -- I didn’t own anything, really, except this little suitcase which had my name on, so she gave it to me and everybody -- because everybody had to guard his own stuff.</span> <span id="s1909">And that how we got -- went to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: I-Is this the same suitcase --</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Yes, yes, with picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: -- that your mother gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: And he -- so we went to Warsaw by -- to Lvov by car and later train, and he -- German in -- and we were disperse in different homes.</span> <span id="s1917">I was i-in [indecipherable], they have homes in [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: But I remember before I went there Sister Sophia called me and said to me, listen, is a priest over there and you have to go and take Communion and he -- you know.</span> <span id="s1920">So when he’s going to ask you if you are baptized, or you are Jewish, you should tell him -- y-you are Jewish, you should tell him no, and is not a lie.</span> <span id="s1921">Because then -- i-inside you should say no for you.</span> <span id="s1922">And that for you, you should s-stay quiet.</span> <span id="s1923">So it was like look [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1924">So she simply told me, you just have to lie.</span> <span id="s1925">And is not going to be a big sin, God will understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Did the lying ever bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: No.</span> <span id="s1928">Oh, I was a perfect liar.</span> <span id="s1929">I could lie, too.</span> <span id="s1930">I could lie and I could steal.</span> <span id="s1931">Didn’t bother me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: When did you steal, you haven’t told us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: It was in Warsaw, we were very hungry, so we used to go to market, and we used to distract the -- you know, the -- the -- the stable keeper and we used to steal tomato, onion, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1934">Like crazy.</span> <span id="s1935">I didn’t need anything else.</span> <span id="s1936">The only thing that I steal was food.</span> <span id="s1937">We were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: After the priest, what -- what happened when you did meet the priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: He didn’t ask me.</span> <span id="s1940">He never asked me, he never bother.</span> <span id="s1941">He didn’t -- probably he didn’t suspect, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s1942">I didn’t have this problem, but she told me to lie.</span> <span id="s1943">She said is not a lie because now I’m -- not for you, not for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Be-Before we move on a little bit more to Warsaw, there -- there was a Father, and I’m not sure if it was in Wamina or Lvov, Franz?</span> <span id="s1945">Father Franz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Caesar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: C -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Oh no, that was much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: He didn't know anything about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: We met him when we -- after Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Okay, well then let’s -- let’s just touch on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: -- that one when we get there.</span> <span id="s1956">So when you arrive in Warsaw, where -- where are all the orphans and the nuns located?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Well they -- we were dispersed to different houses, and I was on the outskirt, in the orphanage outside of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1958">And -- but later on e -- Sister Budnofska made his point that he wanted all her children with her.</span> <span id="s1959">So she -- and the first the Jewish children, she wanted them -- you know, to guard them.</span> <span id="s1960">And she took me i-in -- they got the place in section of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1961">A house which was -- used to be a ghetto hou -- belonged to ghetto.</span> <span id="s1962">So we had to -- she got everybody back, we had to clean this building.</span> <span id="s1963">We got few floors on this house because -- and we have to clean the building completely, and that was a hard thing to do because it was so many papers and photographs on the floor.</span> <span id="s1964">When they took these people away, you know, those papers were -- and later on somebody plundered the house.</span> <span id="s1965">They didn’t have use for photographs and papers and documents.</span> <span id="s1966">And I remember cleaning that, and we used to read those documents, and it was very hard for me, at least.</span> <span id="s1967">In -- and he -- so we settled there til Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s1968">And more childr -- Jewish children came on that time.</span> <span id="s1969">On that time she -- we had the yon -- Janka Markofska, Janka Davidovich, and s -- a few more children, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: But what was it like being in the ghetto, was -- was it basically empty, that area of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: It was empty already, totally empty.</span> <span id="s1972">Some building were occupied by Poles which moved in, because Warsaw was very crowded, and it was -- there were building available, so they moved in.</span> <span id="s1973">But basically it was empty.</span> <span id="s1974">And they moved the wall of the ghetto, so exactly in, behind this building it was the wall, which street was divided by the wall, and it was backyard of the building, became backyard.</span> <span id="s1975">So it was a wall of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1976">I don’t know if ghetto was still, but it was -- there was still some activities over there, sho -- the shooting, and German were looking for people that were hiding, you know, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: So it -- it was right next to the ghetto, it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Next to the -- it -- it used to be once ghetto, and they move, you know, but when ghetto became smaller, they used to move --</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: The walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: -- the walls, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: And what did you -- how long did you stay there, and what -- what was a normal day like there?</span> <span id="s1982">I mean, what -- what was going on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Well, it was the same.</span> <span id="s1984">It -- we learn a bit more, it was a school because we didn’t have a guard then and -- and we have to wash the clotheses and we had to clean and we had to peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s1985">And also -- what we did also, the n -- it -- nuns found they -- they were -- were shorted of money, so we used to make the buttons.</span> <span id="s1986">You know, the buttons that you make out of thread?</span> <span id="s1987">They were some steel rings, and you just thread those buttons, so we used to make those buttons and they s-sewed the buttons.</span> <span id="s1988">Used to paint the pictures and they sold the pictures.</span> <span id="s1989">The older children used to go and clean in Polish’ people houses, so we used to have jobs like that.</span> <span id="s1990">I was never sent to clean other people house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Was Sister Sophia still waking you up sometimes and giving you food at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: No, no, no, she didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s1993">She didn’t.</span> <span id="s1994">It was the -- I was older a little bit, and more, you know, familiar with everything.</span> <span id="s1995">I was the part of the establishment already.</span> <span id="s1996">I was a oldtimer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: We stayed in Warsaw til the Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s1999">And he -- they organize hospital [indecipherable] you and we stay like a month during the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Oh, the nuns organized the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Yes, inclu --</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: In -- in the -- in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Apparently they had something to do with underground -- Polish un -- underground activity.</span> <span id="s2004">So they probably knew something.</span> <span id="s2005">There were some preparation for uprising.</span> <span id="s2006">You really were much more free to walk, when I was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2007">For instance, we used to go to clinic.</span> <span id="s2008">I suddenly si -- I lost my vision.</span> <span id="s2009">It was a period of time that I couldn’t see anything, I hardly could see.</span> <span id="s2010">So Sister Sophia took me to eye clinic.</span> <span id="s2011">They discover that I have a shortage of vitamin A, and I have night -- I have the night blindne -- blindness, I couldn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s2012">So they gave me a little bit more vitamins and then my teeth were terrible, so I used to go to dentist, it was on [indecipherable] it was in different part.</span> <span id="s2013">They -- I -- she used to take me around, it was no real problem, and I really didn’t have any problems, I was kind of lucky, I -- we used to ride the tram, because everywhere you --

be dressed.</span> <span id="s2024">So we had those uniforms, you can see on photographs, which we’ll wear over, and again you try, it is too long, or is too big, and whatever fits you is yours for -- for an hour of day, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: But when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: I didn’t have anything which was my own.</span> <span id="s2027">I didn’t have shoes.</span> <span id="s2028">The coat -- for instance, if I used to go out, I got a coat.</span> <span id="s2029">But next day somebody else needs to wear this coat.</span> <span id="s2030">We didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2031">We used to mend, and sew, you know, holes, and in addition we were extremely dirty.</span> <span id="s2032">You know, lice, ha -- everybody has the lice.</span> <span id="s2033">In the head, on the body.</span> <span id="s2034">It was just horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: H-How old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span

id="s2039">You just wash, and if you have too many lice, we used iron them.</span> <span id="s2040">You know, they were in the seams.</span> <span id="s2041">The only thing that you could use iron, or you c -- you could use the neft on your hair for a night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Neft?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: It’s horrible, you know what is that?</span> <span id="s2044">That

id="s2046">Poisoned lice and poisoned skin as well.</span> <span id="s2047">It was something that we lived every day with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: I wonder if you could just talk a bit about Jewish identity and that situation when you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: Well, I didn't consider myself Jew, and I would not admit to anyone that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2052">I remember when I was -- I went to Lvov first time, and the nuns talked to me in her house.</span> <span id="s2053">She told me, even if they will kill you, you cannot -- if they catch you, you cannot admit you are a Jew, because that is a death sentence for us and for yourself.</span> <span id="s2054">If they want to -- they want to kill you, they should kill you as a non-Jew, and you cannot admit that to anyone.</span> <span id="s2055">And remember that if you admit that, it will be death sentence for whoever is helping you, and for you.</span> <span id="s2056">So I -- it was just -- I don’t know if I remember even that, but I became non-Jew.</span> <span id="s2057">And I wouldn’t admit to anyone, ever, who I am.</span> <span id="s2058">And after -- worrying haunted me for a long time.</span> <span id="s2059">This not being -- no problems.</span> <span id="s2060">I have no Jewish problem, I am not a Jew.</span> <span id="s2061">I remember that I didn’t have this identity.</span> <span id="s2062">I knew I am a Jew, but I didn’t have this implanted identity or religious background, or -- or national background when I was a little child.</span> <span id="s2063">I came from very assimilated house.</span> <span id="s2064">So that was the -- I didn’t have problem who I am, I was Polish.</span> <span id="s2065">I was not Catholic, but I was Polish.</span> <span id="s2066">And that’s how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Did it make you anxious that s-some people did know you were Jewish, for instance, the nuns?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: No.</span> <span id="s2069">I just didn’t want to have -- I didn’t want to -- I didn’t want to think about it.</span> <span id="s2070">I -- I identify myself as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s2071">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2072">I lie to myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: And then it took time to stop lying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2075">It took quite a long time.</span> <span id="s2076">It was a fear involved when I stopped lying.</span> <span id="s2077">I felt uptight.</span> <span id="s2078">Like you change your skin color, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Tell us what happened during the Warsaw uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Well, we were mostly hiding in the basement, praying 24 hours novena, you know, we change and pray to -- I don’t remember what saint it was.</span> <span id="s2081">I think that’s Thaddeusz, Thad, so whatever.</span> <span id="s2082">He is supposed to be saint of whatever is save you.</span> <span id="s2083">And he -- we were mostly waiting things to stop.</span> <span id="s2084">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s2085">You couldn’t go upstairs because we were bombed constantly.</span> <span id="s2086">So, there were no -- it was no glass in the windows any more.</span> <span id="s2087">The bomb came so close that some of the walls fell off.</span> <span id="s2088">So the only safe place was this basement.</span> <span id="s2089">So we were mostly downstair in basement with nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s2090">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s2091">I remember somebody found the sack of the beans, dry beans.</span> <span id="s2092">We used to keep those beans in the mouth that it soak completely, and it was so delicious, raw.</span> <span id="s2093">Com -- and he -- it was really end -- that wi -- was this hospital and I was not allowed to show my face.</span> <span id="s2094">So some of the girls used to go there to help, I was not allowed to show my face, so I didn’t, and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2095">Finally, the German capture the section that we were in, it’s Volnush, Ritza Volunush, it was corner of Volnushti and Jelazinna, where this house was located.</span> <span id="s2096">And the German came in, they chase everybody from the house, from the bi -- from the building.</span> <span id="s2097">And he -- the way of walking through the street, they used to make holes from building to building and walk on the first floors through the apartments to the end of the block, because the very tight building in European.</span> <span id="s2098">But they chase everybody.</span> <span id="s2099">Whoever wanted to escape, escapes through the holes and to the canal, and from the -- through the canal, but nun didn’t -- they didn’t feel they need to escape, it was nowhere to escape.</span> <span id="s2100">So the home army people escaped, but they -- we stayed.</span> <span id="s2101">And they took us to the street.</span> <span id="s2102">They immediately pour gasoline in the building and set building on fire.</span> <span id="s2103">So here we are on the street, and all the buildings are on fire.</span> <span id="s2104">It was -- and they f -- when they got everybody from the buildings, old people, and then people with children, and -- we walk -- they walk us through those burning streets, it was -- I still have that in front of my eyes, just burning streets, and terrible smoke.</span> <span id="s2105">They walk us to the railroad station which was -- I don’t remember, it wasn’t a main railroad station because in the city that was gone.</span> <span id="s2106">Some side railroad station.</span> <span id="s2107">And then we st -- and when we walk -- and Germans on both sides, you know, and he -- with the dogs and he -- and the machine guns, and he -- on some of the building which were still burning, we could see the people with the -- funny, you know the -- when you have the handkerchief and you tie four corners and you make a cup, they have those cups with handkerchief with tied four corners.</span> <span id="s2108">And they were taking bodies from the burning buildings.</span> <span id="s2109">So they have those flat cars full of bodies, black, black, burned bodies.</span> <span id="s2110">And he -- so that was on the way when you walk.</span> <span id="s2111">And we finally went to railroad station, and was group of Gypsies the German found somewhere.</span> <span id="s2112">They were guarded, and they gave us soup.</span> <span id="s2113">It -- it was made from this horse.</span> <span id="s2114">And doesn’t matter how hungry I was, I couldn’t eat this meat, it was sweet, and I just couldn’t eat that meat.</span> <span id="s2115">And they pack us on train, which was like -- it was not regular train, it was these freight wagons, parked one next to another, we climbed there, they took us to the railroad station, they set camp in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2116">And he -- they -- some of the -- they kept us for awhile, and finally the -- the Sister Superior, the -- Tekla, which spoke perfect German -- she spoke non-accented German because she was raised by her family in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2117">Her father, or whoever it was, she told me, worked for Polish embassy in Berlin and she was raised in Berlin and she went to school in Germany, so her German was totally untouched by accent.</span> <span id="s2118">She managed to work our release.</span> <span id="s2119">And we walk later on by foot to -- no, we walked, I think, 10 kilometers or more to the nearby forest.</span> <span id="s2120">It was -- nuns used to have their retreat and school, and we stayed there to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2121">And she -- they said, you know, in -- one of the classroom they gave us, and we slept on the floor, all next to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: So was it -- how did Mother Superior Tekla, how was she able to get you released from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Well, apparently she had power on persu -- of persuasion, and they were extremely polite to her when she opened her mouth in -- you know, the -- she was a nun, and she was not very pretty nun, very stern, you know, type of person.</span> <span id="s2124">And she was -- she had this power of persuasion.</span> <span id="s2125">So she decided she has children, orphans, Polish orphans and who happen to be in Warsaw, and we want to go to our retreat, and you have to let us go.</span> <span id="s2126">Because what they are going to do with children, you are going to send them to work camp.</span> <span id="s2127">And she managed to arrange that, and -- and that was when we met this Father Caesar, he also escape from Warsaw and he supposed to go to the man monastery, which was somewhere else, but she changed his direction and he went with us to Kostovitz.</span> <span id="s2128">And we stay in Kostovitz from -- it was in ’44 yes, til end of the war, which was actually when German army passed by, because -- German -- Russian army -- because you know, during the uprising, the army was on opposite side of Vistula, and they didn’t want to take any action because it was different group fighting, that was London group fighting in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Which army was on the other side of the Vistula?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Russian army, with the Polish army, which was fighting with Russian army.</span> <span id="s2131">And they simply waited for Warsaw to bleed to death.</span> <span id="s2132">And after uprising actually, they move -- you know, they have invasion, they moved with new invasion and they pushed the Germans away.</span> <span id="s2133">So it took til January, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: And where exactly is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Kostovitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s2138">It’s like 20 kilometer past Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2139">Very close to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Was it a -- a full town, or just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: No, it was a village, and it was the big farm which belong to -- to the Polish prince over there, the noble [indecipherable] it was -- it -- the big farm, and nearby was a little village which was -- name was Kostovitz, I don’t know how -- and nuns used to run school and orphanage in Kostovitz.</span> <span id="s2142">So they have this school building which they converted to the orphanage for other orphans which escaped from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2143">So they -- and they were -- it was more orphanages in Warsaw and they all came to Kostovitz.</span> <span id="s2144">It means that were the same nun organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: And when you got there, you say they gave your group a -- a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Every group got couple of school rooms, which we used to convert to the -- to our living space during -- at night, and we used to take all those -- we didn’t have mattresses, so it was a straw mattress.</span> <span id="s2147">So you put the straw on the floor, and some kind of cover over it.</span> <span id="s2148">And during the day we used to move this straw against the wall and our tables, you know, school tables back in order so we could have the class.</span> <span id="s2149">And at night we used to move everything back and have a straw.</span> <span id="s2150">And was funny, I remember we moved the straw, it was plenty of fleas jumping up.</span> <span id="s2151">So, in addition to our lice, we used to have fleas as well.</span> <span id="s2152">We felt like dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Where would you go to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: It was a clou -- i-it was -- they had the bathrooms, main bathrooms which we went to.</span> <span id="s2155">I remember -- I don’t remember it was outside or inside.</span> <span id="s2156">I think it was inside they used to have those bathrooms wash space.</span> <span id="s2157">They had electricity over there.</span> <span id="s2158">It was electricity and we had the regular water, running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: Now you were 13, are you maybe going on to 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Yes, I was born in May, so it -- I was 13 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Did any of the other girls, or did you at the point begin menstruating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Oh yes, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: And did you know what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2165">Well, it was the trouble, because we really were not prepared, and we didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s2166">So I remember that when it happen, I went to Sister Sophia and she gave me fact of life.</span> <span id="s2167">That was -- I -- that was very embarrassing for me, but she talk, and she was very obvious and she did it very well, so -- apparently she did that with all her girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: An-And was it difficult to -- to just take care of yourself, to have a -- a way to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: -- menstruate and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: No, we had the pads.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: -- use napkins?</span> <span id="s2173">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Napkins, and we had to wash them.</span> <span id="s2175">It was not like a disposable.</span> <span id="s2176">So it was kind of -- everybody did it very discreetly, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: So you didn’t ask any of the other girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: -- you went right to Sister Sophia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2181">We didn’t talk about it, it was a sin, deadly sin talk about sex, and that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: And at this point is your hair still long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2184">My hair were cut when I have those terrible boils and lice.</span> <span id="s2185">I have so much boils that -- and they decide to cut my hair because they couldn’t comb -- take away the lice.</span> <span id="s2186">So I had already shorter hair.</span> <span id="s2187">But I was still growing it, and I had some pony tails.</span> <span id="s2188">I have to look at the pictures, I should have -- no, I have a shorter hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: And wh-what can you tell us more about Father Caesar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Oh, he was -- it was kind of accident, he s -- he -- he glue to me after war, really.</span> <span id="s2191">He knew me during the -- from Kostovitz.</span> <span id="s2192">I’m not sure if he knew who I was.</span> <span id="s2193">He wanted to be some kind of mentor, you know.</span> <span id="s2194">And he was kind of funny, we all laugh at him.</span> <span id="s2195">He used to take a lot of photographs and he was trying to play with us.</span> <span id="s2196">It was kind of embarrassing.</span> <span id="s2197">And nuns didn’t like us to [indecipherable] very much with him.</span> <span id="s2198">But he was a decent person, very s -- helpful, and he became also teacher, he used to teach us Latin and til today I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2199">And he -- so he organized the school, really, with another priest which was our chaplain.</span> <span id="s2200">And he was actually -- he was not -- he was priest, but he was the francis -- from Franciscan convents.</span> <span id="s2201">He was a monk, that what he was.</span> <span id="s2202">And after war, when he really learn who I was, and he came west to visit me [indecipherable] was my father, he tried to keep contact, which for me was very uncomforta -- I don’t know why, I just didn’t want that any more.</span> <span id="s2203">But he -- he was not one that I -- he help me out, he help anyone.</span> <span id="s2204">I don’t know, I don’t know if he really was any help for Jews, or for any -- anywa -- body.</span> <span id="s2205">And he -- later on after war he tried to make [indecipherable] and he used to -- he -- he was very resourceful.</span> <span id="s2206">He helped to rebuild the monastery -- Franciscan monastery in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2207">And he used to also collect money, you know, donations, and stuff like that, so he was very visible man.</span> <span id="s2208">And he then visit me in Israel once, it was funny because on that time, it was before six year war, so Jordan and Jerusalem was divided.</span> <span id="s2209">And suddenly I am getting phone call fro -- in my office from this secret agent in Israel.</span> <span id="s2210">And he ask me, listen, it is somebody in Jordan asking for you on Mandelbaumgate, and he want to come to Israel [indecipherable], he’s with group of Pilgrims.</span> <span id="s2211">And he -- who is this man?</span> <span id="s2212">And he is trying to spell his name, and I couldn’t figure out what this man is talking about.</span> <span id="s2213">So before I left the phone it was -- the agent was already in my office, waiting.</span> <span id="s2214">And I said, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”</span> <span id="s2215">And he said, “What kind of contact do you have with people in Jordan?”</span> <span id="s2216">So the agent was in my office, and he again ask me, and I said, “Can you write it down?”</span> <span id="s2217">When he wrote it down, I saw Barron, that is th -- and I said, “Oh yes, I know him.”</span> <span id="s2218">And of course I have to say, well I knew him during the war, when I was a child in convent and he’s priest, and he -- you shouldn’t worry, he’s not a spy, he’s not the Arabic agent.</span> <span id="s2219">He is so and so and so.</span> <span id="s2220">So I invited him to Tel Aviv, he came, he stayed with us few days and then he left back.</span> <span id="s2221">And he was very resourceful because it was communistic Poland.</span> <span id="s2222">Tho -- he -- he went to Rome.</span> <span id="s2223">In Rome, he got the papal passport, separate.</span> <span id="s2224">Well, he got Israeli and Jordanian visa.</span> <span id="s2225">So when he was back in Poland, his passport was totally clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: How long are you in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Which one?</span> <span id="s2228">In Kostovitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Kostovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: Oh, I -- we were til probably spring, early spring of ’45.</span> <span id="s2231">And he -- there were already some parents [indecipherable] picking up Jewish children, and nobody picked me up.</span> <span id="s2232">And finally nuns decided they need to settle somewhere, you cannot live in the classroom, so e -- they got the building, a house from authorities, which was in another town.</span> <span id="s2233">It was Lubon Kwiofsky.</span> <span id="s2234">We got the house, which was once mansion of one of Polish noble, which was empty, and we moved there with all the belongings and -- and there where my father found me, it was May, May third.</span> <span id="s2235">Apparently he -- he was moving with the army, Polish army, from eastern Poland, and he was -- he knew the nuns, and the nuns told him where I was.</span> <span id="s2236">He also lost track of me because we were moving so much, but they told him a possibility that I might be in Lubon, and he suddenly, one day he just appear.</span> <span id="s2237">And -- and his clotheses were torn, he took his army uniform off because actually he left the army.</span> <span id="s2238">He didn’t continue in the corps with the army.</span> <span id="s2239">So -- and he looked like a bum.</span> <span id="s2240">He was unshave.</span> <span id="s2241">Terrible.</span> <span id="s2242">I didn’t -- never seen my father looking like a bum, dirty.</span> <span id="s2243">And nuns, of course, help him [indecipherable] and he -- I remember they -- I was doing something, so su -- Sister Sophia as -- one the girl said that I have to go to Mother Superior, so I went in, she took me and it’s -- that was my father.</span> <span id="s2244">And again, I didn’t feel anything.</span> <span id="s2245">And he said, well -- she ask him to rest for a few days, and then we took off.</span> <span id="s2246">He just hija -- you know, hiking -- hijacking, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: In some Russian truck because it was no transportation whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Hitchhiking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Hitchhiking, hitchhiking, yes.</span> <span id="s2251">The Russian truck took us to [indecipherable] and then it was the train, which went to another town.</span> <span id="s2252">It was still tremendous army movement.</span> <span id="s2253">And we ended up in Warsaw, it was nine of May, which was my father’s birthday, and then that was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2254">That was the same day.</span> <span id="s2255">So he managed to get to -- again to army train to medical corps, and we went to Kraków.</span> <span id="s2256">And in Kraków my father had a friend, same architect Felibook, Jan Felibook.</span> <span id="s2257">We stayed in his house for a few days, and then he took me to Wanska to his friend priest, and he left me in Wanska with him til

id="s2298">The name of wi-willage -- village was Washinitz, I learn it aft -- from my cousin after the war.</span> <span id="s2299">And he -- the way Germans acted, they kept-- they kept the doctors over there, and when epidemic was over they used to kill these doctors.</span> <span id="s2300">And they got the new one.</span> <span id="s2301">So my father was in one of the group.</span> <span id="s2302">And somebody run and said, well Gestapo is in that town.</span> <span id="s2303">So he knew that when the Gestapo came to the town they are going to liquidate it.</span> <span id="s2304">So he run.</span> <span id="s2305">He run to the Ukrainian church.</span> <span id="s2306">It was Ukrainian church, the -- not Roman Catholic, but Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s2307">And he hides in this church.</span> <span id="s2308">And the pope, Ukrainian priest came over and saw him.</span> <span id="s2309">So he said, please save me, I am a doctor in the village.</span> <span id="s2310">And Gestapo came and -- so he opened the -- the -- one of the block in the floor, said, go down.</span> <span id="s2311">But my fa -- it was totally pitch black and my father said, later on when they came i -- it was a woman sitting in -- in this cave.</span> <span id="s2312">Apparently she was a doctor from previous time.</span> <span id="s2313">So he saved my father, and this woman, young doctor, it was another seven months when army came back.</span> <span id="s2314">And my father said -- he was a funny man, he used to drink a lot.</span> <span id="s2315">So my father said, we used to get drunk, totally drunk every evening.</span> <span id="s2316">Totally drunk, and he had the daughter and son-in-law who was extremely unhappy about the situation.</span> <span id="s2317">And also he had very sick wife.</span> <span id="s2318">So my father treated this wife.</span> <span id="s2319">She was very sick and he -- he -- that how he survive.</span> <span id="s2320">And he like the old man.</span> <span id="s2321">After war, he die.</span> <span id="s2322">The ji -- Russian wanted to immediately prosecute him, but my father testify, so that was -- they left him alone, but he was a old man, and he die, his wife die.</span> <span id="s2323">But when we [indecipherable] already [indecipherable] in Yagura, one day my father told me that his son-in-law and his daughter came in, and they very Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s2324">And his son-in-law was immediately arrested, and he was sentenced, I don’t know for what.</span> <span id="s2325">So my dad again went and testified that he saved, blah, blah, blah, but actually the old man did it.</span> <span id="s2326">And he s -- his son-in-law was lawyer, or some kind of judge once.</span> <span id="s2327">It was Ukrainian family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: What -- what was written on the paper that you threw away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: What happened, my father was not alive any more, and hi-his wife, some co -- somebody came from [indecipherable] Yagura and this Mr. Yanofich or Yanofsky told him that he saved my father, and they started that I should do something about it.</span> <span id="s2330">You should do something about it.</span> <span id="s2331">So I wrote to Yad Vashem -- and there was another lawyer in Israel who was nagging me about that, and they knew very little about it.</span> <span id="s2332">I knew very little as well.</span> <span id="s2333">So I wrote to Yad Vashem, and I wrote them what I heard from my father, that this man Rostoski, saved my father, and his family saved him.</span> <span id="s2334">And I didn’t realize that name of this man, not his father-in-law, came, he got the awa -- paper from Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s2335">But I just decided not to do anything about it, I just want -- few years ago he wrote me a letter, the old man, very angry letter, that he supposed to get some kind of money from a claim [indecipherable] whatever, because everybody who got this award gets money.</span> <span id="s2336">And I was kind of shocked.</span> <span id="s2337">So I wrote him a letter that it’s true that I testify, but actually I testify for your father-in-law, not for you.</span> <span id="s2338">Cause I heard from my father that not you, but your father-in-law saved him.</span> <span id="s2339">[indecipherable] and he was a pope.</span> <span id="s2340">So he wrote me a long story, how it happen, how my father, you know, came to this place, and what happen that he run without breath and blah, blah, blah, and he used to pick up the -- you know, his dirt and -- and see that he has a child, and he had to -- afraid the German, somebody might discover it.</span> <span id="s2341">I’m sure he was afraid.</span> <span id="s2342">It was very brave.</span> <span id="s2343">But it was a long, long story, full of anger.</span> <span id="s2344">And also he was angry about this woman doctor, that she never really k-kept contact, and she’s well off, and she said, when your father left Poland the German pay him a big reparation and it shoul -- part of the money belongs to us.</span> <span id="s2345">You know, it was kind of -- and I was so angry that I didn’t responded at all.</span> <span id="s2346">I did show it to someone and I decided, let’s get rid of that.</span> <span id="s2347">It’s not a document, it’s just angry letter.</span> <span id="s2348">But the story was that his -- this drunk man really save him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: I -- I want to turn to the case that you had with you all the time, which I’m presuming from the story that you’d never opened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: No, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2351">It was -- it has the lock, a very strong lock, I didn’t have any key.</span> <span id="s2352">And I simply couldn’t open it.</span> <span id="s2353">I could s -- so this case, when I was in Wamina, was in with nuns, you know, with the -- in the storage place, and later on they couldn’t keep that because everybody was moving.</span> <span id="s2354">So I kept that, and it was dirty.</span> <span id="s2355">And it has the cover, and I used to keep my books and everything between the cover, in between the space so you can’t [indecipherable] out.</span> <span id="s2356">So when I left, the nuns gave my father -- it was something else that my mother sent to them, that they gave her back some kind of tablecloth, part of that they sell.</span> <span id="s2357">My mother used to have beautiful, beautiful hand embroidered tablecloth, and some from Italy, and so -- whatever they sold, they sold, but rest they gave to my dad.</span> <span id="s2358">And of course I have this case, and when we were at home, he just pry open the lock.</span> <span
