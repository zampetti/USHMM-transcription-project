your father.</span> <span id="s27">What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My father was a worker in a hydroelectric plant in Rjukan.</span> <span id="s29">My -- my mother, she was a very energetic woman, so she started a -- a little sewing thing.</span> <span id="s30">She was a very clever, so she put up a little business because my father’s salary wasn't too big.</span> <span id="s31">He was there for -- he had been there, came from Oslo because most people came into Rjukan from different towns in Norway, or Sweden, or England, or Germany.</span> <span id="s32">Could come from many places, so it’s the only place in Norway where you have no dialect, none at all.</span> <span id="s33">People in Norway are not aware of this, so now I’ll tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: No dialect at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Not at all, so I speak in Norwegian, I speak an Oslo dialect.</span> <span id="s36">They -- and when I was interviewed with my program, [indecipherable] said, “Oh I’m looking forward to hear your dialect.”</span> <span id="s37">“Well, I’m sorry, I haven’t got any dialect,” I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So is this the only place in Norway where it’s a sort of -- is it -- would you call it a kind of pure --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I -- I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: -- nor -- Norwegian.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: It came from everywhere, and then they had a common language.</span></p> <p><span

in 1918, after 1918, in -- in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: We were very lucky because Rjukan, the people that started up industry there, they were very foreseeing.</span> <span id="s50">They put up an -- think that some of the workers living quarters is today occur -- even today look like salaried people [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s51">It was very good, from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s52">So we were very lucky, and we had free schools.</span> <span id="s53">It was just -- books and everything was free.</span> <span id="s54">So it was extremely well done from that --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Now, is that unusual in Norway that the schools were free?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, at that time it was unusual all over the world.</span> <span id="s57">So they were very ahead, I must say.</span> <span id="s58">The hydro, it’s -- it was shortened to hydro, hydroelectric company, but hydro, and I think they had a wonderful personnel department, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What did you like in school?</span> <span id="s60">Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I was lucky in way -- later on, you know, I needed to be an average looking fellow, and I was also, when I had speeches in schools, they say I was also average in schools, and the peop -- the people that liked to hear that, average in everything, also in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I liked history.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: And math, not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: [indecipherable] was -- we were -- we were always -- when we were not in school, we were in the mountains, so it was very important to -- to have that role the [indecipherable] physical activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Were you a skier?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">We had to be, when we were in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: At those times, it was always snow enough.</span> <span id="s73">Today it’s sometimes scarce.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Were you close with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, I would think so.</span> <span id="s76">I am -- when I left, 18 years old, to go into military service, and to university later on, was a little strange, especially for my parents, of course, and my sister.</span> <span id="s77">But to me it was future.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And your sister remained in -- in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, they -- she remained there, and married to one of the people in the hydro again, they were all there, and he was later on taking care of personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: My brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s83">Were your parents politically con -- active, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">Not -- not active, but they had their opinions, and -- but it was not very radical, because they belonged -- as a worker he belonged to the Labor party, but wasn’t very active.</span> <span id="s86">He was [indecipherable] and then he was trying to become a sculptor.</span> <span id="s87">So he was very interested in books and all that.</span> <span id="s88">So sh -- he should really had gone on the sculptor way.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: So, I always felt that.</span> <span id="s93">But he was very fond of books.</span> <span id="s94">So in 1935, he came with a book to me, and I was there sixt -- roughly s -- six -- almost --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: And he came with a book written by a German called Wolfgang Langhoff.</span> <span id="s99">That was, in German, Moorsoldaten, it means Moor soldiers.</span> <span id="s100">It was from a concentration camp in Germany, the first one.</span> <span id="s101">And that book opened my eyes for Nazism.</span> <span id="s102">And my father came to me with it, he said, “Read it.</span> <span id="s103">You understand a little more.”</span> <span id="s104">And then -- from then on, I was an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s105">When I was in s -- the second grade, it were col -- a kind of college, then we had the discussion always in the class, it was 28 people in our class, was -- four were very hard against Nazism, but -- and the others were, of course, not Naziists at all.</span> <span id="s106">But they said Hitler is -- everyone has a job there.</span> <span id="s107">Roads best in Europe, so -- so what.</span> <span id="s108">But if you had been through that book from Oranienburg, when they built up right at the station there -- later on it was moved a little, the concentration camps were moved a little, but at that time it was right in Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s109">I think it’s -- was the first in Germany, in ’33.</span> <span id="s110">They say maybe -- they mention another place too, but I think it was the first, and I think I’m right in that.</span> <span id="s111">And he got away in -- so he could --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: -- flee to Switzerland, and he wrote the book immediately.</span> <span id="s114">It was very important that we knew more about it, and h-he -- he more or less described it so what help -- was later, that we saw later.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did you discuss the book with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Oh, very much.</span> <span id="s117">No, I didn’t need to discuss it in that way because he said, you read it, so you know a little more about this.</span> <span id="s118">So when -- that -- we discussed it in school, but most people un -- was another thing, the German propaganda came to Norway already at that time.</span> <span id="s119">In 1936, before the Olympics, th-the terrible propaganda, you know?</span> <span id="s120">They had more -- they had sent out young boys from Germany into Norwegian schools, that were called wunder -- in German wunderfagrin.</span> <span id="s121">And they had been educated, they were just 19 - 20, they were educated in German propaganda.</span> <span id="s122">They were going into schools, and who knew that?</span> <span id="s123">They thought they were very nice to have German, young Germans here.</span> <span id="s124">But they were all specially trained people, right -- put right into schools in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So was the government of Norway in some way sympathetic that they allowed this, or they --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, they didn’t -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: -- they were no sympathetic, they just didn’t -- we didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s129">We were fooled, already that -- at that time, by the Gestapo methods, and the propaganda machinery, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: But you in some sense understood because you read the book, so did you say things to these people when they came into your class?</span> <span id="s131">Did you ask them?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh yes, we discussed it, and we -- we were -- hard discussions between us.</span> <span id="s133">But it was talking -- to some people it was just im -- they just wouldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s134">Was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So as it got closer to when the Nazis took over, you -- you finished high s -- is it high school gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And -- and when?</span> <span id="s138">In 1937 - ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes, was all -- in ’38, and I -- from 1939 - ’40, I was in the u -- at the University of Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: In Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: So now I studied economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: And at the same time, of course, I had a job.</span> <span id="s144">But at that time you would not -- I could -- my parent couldn’t pay any education, so I started as an accountant.</span> <span id="s145">I was trying to become a chartered accountant, which was [indecipherable] and at the same time I studied economics.</span> <span id="s146">So when the war came in ninth April, ’40, I was writing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You were writing your thesis?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeah, in my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Why was it economics?</span> <span id="s150">Why were you want to -- want to do economics?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Well, I -- I thought -- I liked it in a way, and I -- I thought the combination of chartered accountant and economics would do as a good future, give you a good future.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Interesting future.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Did -- did you have a sense that Germany would attack Norway?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: None?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh no, didn’t believe it, it couldn’t be done, and so -- so was the rest of Europe.</span> <span id="s158">France?</span> <span id="s159">They didn’t believe that the Germans would attack.</span> <span id="s160">And the same with the British, you know, Chamberlain?</span> <span id="s161">Peace in our time.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Lasted a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So there was no warning.</span> <span id="s165">You had no -- when they --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, it -- it wasn’t, but of course the -- how they treated Germans in general, the very brutal dictatorship, we heard about that, and we thought it was terrible.</span> <span id="s167">And of course, we heard about the Jews that were -- but nobody could really believe what later came.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So what was it like when the Germans occupied?</span> <span id="s169">What was -- what were those first few week --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Was a shock to all Norway.</span> <span id="s171">And then -- but you know, Hitler sent an ambassador to Norway, called Dr. Bräuer, and he came with a ultimatum, and that said, he came up to the [indecipherable] in the morning, ninth April, 4:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s172">And then he said, it’s an ultimatum.</span> <span id="s173">You give in or we start war.</span> <span id="s174">And the government, I think they withdrew for about quarter of an hour, they came back, we take the war.</span> <span id="s175">So then it was on.</span> <span id="s176">And it had almost start -- it had started a little before, because Germans sent in -- the Hitler’s pride was a very big warship, and that ship was stopped, it came almost into Oslo, then it was stopped by [indecipherable] fortress, fortress just before Oslo, near -- near the town of Jerbok, and that big ship was hit by -- they had some big guns there, German guns, by the way.</span> <span id="s177">And that ship was sank.</span> <span id="s178">That ship had 2400 people on board, and they had an orchestra, because [indecipherable] going into Oslo, to take Oslo in the morning.</span> <span id="s179">And it was sank at the place there, that fortress.</span> <span id="s180">And then the king -- the government and part of our congress people or parliament, they could get out to Oslo, because that’s -- ship.</span> <span id="s181">They had 800 specially trained troops to take over -- to take the government, arrest them in the morning.</span> <span id="s182">But they didn't have the chance, so the government, the -- the king of course, and the family, and part or most of Parliament members came out to Oslo.</span> <span id="s183">I could -- they were saved, so they could meet outside Oslo to discuss the situation.</span> <span id="s184">So they had -- they got a little time.</span> <span id="s185">If not, they would have been taken in Oslo for 4:30, five o’clock in the morning, they would all be arrested, and then we had, of course, it had been [indecipherable] fighting for the government.</span> <span id="s186">Now they could get out, king, and then later on, we fought for about two months, Norway, and then the government, they went on fighting in England.</span> <span id="s187">And one thing what was very important to see, we had -- at that time, you wouldn't believe it, but we had the third biggest merchant fleet in the world.</span> <span id="s188">We had the biggest tanker fleet in the world.</span> <span id="s189">Three million people.</span> <span id="s190">It was enormous.</span> <span id="s191">And the -- all the ships were out, on the world.</span> <span id="s192">Out in the world.</span> <span id="s193">And it was only five ships in Norway.</span> <span id="s194">And then -- then the war came and the government came to England.</span> <span id="s195">They sent out the telegram to all ships, and they said, we are now at war.</span> <span id="s196">You have to go into allied harbors, New York, London, and they all did.</span> <span id="s197">And then we put up a shipping company, the biggest shipping company the world has ever seen.</span> <span id="s198">Was thou -- thousand ships, and it -- you will never see that shipping company again.</span> <span id="s199">It was the world biggest, it was incredible.</span> <span id="s200">And of course, then the government had money.</span> <span id="s201">Now they could build up this small fleet, the Navy, they could build up a small Air Force in Canada.</span> <span id="s202">And they could up -- put up some specially trained paratroopers, for all the time, that could go into Norway and start fighting there, behind the enemy lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: S-So the -- the king and the crown prince, and the family and part of the government went to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: They came over there, and the family, royal family came over to America, luckily.</span> <span id="s207">And that was Crown Princess Märtha and her children, three children, one of them was -- is King Harald today in Norway, and they stayed in Washington there, and they were taken good care of by President Roosevelt and his wife.</span> <span id="s208">They were very close to them, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Now, did you know this as you were in Oslo, that you -- you -- you knew that the family --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: -- excuse me -- the royal family had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s213">And we knew that part of the family, the -- the children and the wife of the crown prince, they came out to the last ship from Finland.</span> <span id="s214">By the way, it -- what was an American ship that took them out, over Petcimal in Finland.</span> <span id="s215">They got out to the States that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s217">So they went from Norway to Finland.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: To -- right to America --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: And the royal fam -- the king and the crown prince, they ca -- came over to England and started there.</span> <span id="s221">And now the crown prince was later on commander in chief for the Norwegian part in England.</span> <span id="s222">They had to put up a ministry there, and -- within -- within the government, and they were leading i -- our troops there, Navy, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So what happened to you?</span> <span id="s224">School stops, or doesn’t stop?</span> <span id="s225">What happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I was in the insurance company, having a job there as a assistant accountant.</span> <span id="s227">And then I went into the office manager and I said, I’m sorry, but I have to go into the war, can I have free?</span> <span id="s228">Can you give me a -- so, it’s incredible, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s229">And he -- he just said, so, get out, get going, it’s time.</span> <span id="s230">But I thought I had to tell him, ask him if I had the admission.</span> <span id="s231">So I went -- then I went over and into the woods, north of Oslo, and joined a skiing company, with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s232">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And you were going to try to meet the military in the north?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yeah, so that -- and next day I was fighting with the German troops coming from -- they had been then -- some of them landed in Oslo at the airport, and then they came north, and we met them there, and we stopped them for about a good period, a day or two, but we had guns, we had rifles only.</span> <span id="s235">They had artillery, they had tanks, and they had all kinds of weapons which we -- you know, it was the strongest army in the world, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s237">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: But we kept going two months.</span> <span id="s239">You know, France fell in 14 days.</span> <span id="s240">So I think we did okay, expect what we could expect from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Now, had you been trained with guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, I had a very little training in the King’s Guard.</span> <span id="s243">But we had -- it’s really interesting this is not so well known in Norway.</span> <span id="s244">We had the volunteering, military service among the students.</span> <span id="s245">We put up that before the war.</span> <span id="s246">So in the -- li -- late ’39, just beginning 1940, we had the voluntary -- volunteers training there.</span> <span id="s247">So that was -- so you may have thought something could happen.</span> <span id="s248">So we were right.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And who started that, students started that?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: That was one of my friends, he was a student leader, Knut Moyen, he started that.</span> <span id="s251">And later on he became one of the leaders in a sec -- when we started building up small secret groups, military groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And were there boys and girls in this or only boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No, at that time it was only boys, but of course girls in -- in the resistance movement, when we should go for instance, into Oslo to look after what had happened [indecipherable] we used our girlfriends --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: -- because the -- they were not suspected, see?</span> <span id="s256">But th-they did fine job.</span> <span id="s257">Also, all the -- was girls in resistance movement did a wonderful job.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: So after Norway falls, after two months, where -- where are you?</span> <span id="s259">Have you -- have you met the -- the military in the north, or you never got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then we had to give in, and I went back to Oslo.</span> <span id="s261">And then already some [indecipherable] I got the very bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with some friends at the student’s hut, out in the wilderness, north of Oslo.</span> <span id="s262">We started immediately think, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s263">What can we do?</span> <span id="s264">It’s now two -- 200,000 Germans here.</span> <span id="s265">Where can we start?</span> <span id="s266">But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups.</span> <span id="s267">Maybe could be an invasion, and we hope for that.</span> <span id="s268">And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all rumors.</span> <span id="s269">The papers were censored, all the newspapers.</span> <span id="s270">Radios taken, so now it was all rumors.</span> <span id="s271">Anybody.</span> <span id="s272">It was rumors, rumors.</span> <span id="s273">So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to inform people.</span> <span id="s274">So then we started secret newspapers.</span> <span id="s275">It was about 350 newspapers in Oslo at that time, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of course, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000.</span> <span id="s276">The newspaper what was that, we had -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to Norway, every evening, 7:30.</span> <span id="s277">And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news from the free world.</span> <span id="s278">It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world.</span> <span id="s279">And they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you could have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you were working, at your -- it was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda was -- for them it was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s280">So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you are taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you could easily be shot.</span> <span id="s281">Or you were put into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s282">I think about 20,000 did this during the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, concentration camp, many, many died.</span> <span id="s283">And over 200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why?</span> <span id="s284">Because they fought Nazism with pencil and paper.</span> <span id="s285">And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about now.</span> <span id="s286">So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but I had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret police, security police, they were after people doing these newspapers, and building up small military groups.</span> <span id="s287">And of course they were after other groups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn’t -- didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s288">We couldn’t expect it at all, you know.</span> <span id="s289">They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians, they had Norwegian passport, they lived in Norway, had -- they were born there.</span> <span id="s290">That we couldn’t believe at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So let’s talk about these newspapers.</span> <span id="s292">Ha -- about how many different clandestine newspapers do you think there might have been during this period?</span> <span id="s293">A: I think it might have been 350.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s296">All over Norway.</span> <span id="s297">About the same as we had before, but of course not with that circulation.</span> <span id="s298">It’s just natural.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And they were distributed what, individually, you would pass them out to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let’s say 50, you had other coming, fetching them, and of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them.</span> <span id="s301">Could be old people, young people and schoolchildren, girls and boys.</span> <span id="s302">They were spread.</span> <span id="s303">But when they were grown up, they were taken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, it was seen by some traitors, some informers, they would inform on you.</span> <span id="s304">They had put up the same as they had in Germany.</span> <span id="s305">Security police and informers.</span> <span id="s306">You know, in any nation you would have one to two percent which are traitors to your country.</span> <span id="s307">And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the -- they were about 4,000 in Oslo.</span> <span id="s308">In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers.</span> <span id="s309">And when they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured.</span> <span id="s310">And of course, he had been to a place getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand the torture, it’s impossible with the torture.</span> <span id="s311">They came to Norway with Middle Age torture.</span> <span id="s312">Middle Age torture, which I had read about, it i -- was history, and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized Norwegian police.</span> <span id="s313">So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state, it was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they were as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer.</span> <span id="s314">So it was a very -- if you were in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be arrested, tortured and killed.</span> <span id="s315">Was a very great risk.</span> <span id="s316">We all -- they all knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: But it was e-equally as risky to take the newspaper and be seen with it, as it was to deliver it, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s319">Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get it from?</span> <span id="s320">Where -- where did you get it from?</span> <span id="s321">And, of course, they couldn’t stand it, and they -- then they were arrested, others were arrested.</span> <span id="s322">But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more and more newspapers, secret newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you write some of the stuff that went into the newspapers, or did you distribute them, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we had the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, ’40, and the -- well, I think it fall -- ’41, it was really started, on the -- the very good newspapers.</span> <span id="s325">So -- but it was written by our best brains, very good articles, and today you can read them in our resistance museum, they’re all there, you can read them, and very interesting to read now.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way, working at this -- as an assistant accountant still?</span> <span id="s327">Did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full time.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Full time.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about Hans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders.</span> <span id="s331">And then the -- a man was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then of course then the Germans went out and they couldn’t find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no telephone, he had no address, he had just nothing.</span> <span id="s332">So they -- I was there, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Was that your alias at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Jacobsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Then I was Hans Jacobsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name.</span> <span id="s339">And I really started to fake this myself.</span> <span id="s340">I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had no -- I had made [indecipherable] myself.</span> <span id="s341">So I believed them, I knew they were correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Was this easy for you to do?</span> <span id="s343">To fake yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Well, no, it wasn’t easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my passports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the head of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature, because I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K. A. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in Norway.</span> <span id="s345">So i -- i -- that was -- I hadn’t had it in school, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Tell me something, did you go -- during this period, the beginning period a-as you started in the resistance in -- did you go back to your family and talk to your parents and tell them what you were doing, so the -- that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: A that --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: -- they wouldn’t worry, or they would worry?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: That’s an interesting question, because in ’43, January, one man was tortured, and he knew my real name, Gunnar Sonsteby.</span> <span id="s350">I think it was my real name.</span> <span id="s351">Then they went right up to Rjukan and arrested my father as a hostage for me.</span> <span id="s352">But I talked with him, and I thought this would happen, that was the -- the way they did it.</span> <span id="s353">And we agreed he’d take -- said -- he said to me, “You take your job, I’ll take mine.”</span> <span id="s354">He was in prison -- concentration camp for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s355">But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept in Norway because they couldn’t send him to Germany, because then they couldn’t threaten to shoot him, you know?</span> <span id="s356">They would have -- liked to have in the neighborhood so they could shoot him if it was something with me.</span> <span id="s357">But he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So early on, in 1940, or ’41, you spoke to your parents, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: -- it was clear to them that this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: And my mother knew -- my mother knew about it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: And they -- I helped them, they were -- I was living in Oslo, and when all the [indecipherable] were taken.</span> <span id="s364">Then, she took a couple of these [indecipherable] up to Rjukan, it was used there as a secret [indecipherable] for the rest of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s366">And your sister, was she involved in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s368">Very little, because th-then it would have been too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: So, it wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: You mean it was too much to have two children --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s373">In the small town like that, it wouldn’t do, it had to be other people that took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s375">So did you get bored with working on the newspaper and wanted to do something more?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No, I didn’t get bored, because it was terribly interesting.</span> <span id="s377">But I h -- then, in ’41, I wanted to go to Sweden to report because I don’t -- I didn’t know what about our allies?</span> <span id="s378">What about our people in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in London.</span> <span id="s379">And knew -- I knew they had their office in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s380">So I went with one of my refu -- he was a refugee, over to Sweden, to report.</span> <span id="s381">And then they told me, we can use you as a growing -- as a career between Oslo and Stockholm.</span> <span id="s382">So I started that.</span> <span id="s383">So I had about 15 - 20 of these trips between the towns, to report.</span> <span id="s384">Then I knew a little more what they wanted with us, from England, wh-what the allied wanted, through the Norwegian government and our defense people in -- in England.</span> <span id="s385">So our -- after awhile, I think it was in ’42, ninth of April, ’42, then I was in touch with the British.</span> <span id="s386">And I said, we’re have an organization, I didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s387">It was a S.O.E., special operations executive.</span> <span id="s388">And then they asked me, are you willing to go back to Norway, put up an office in Oslo for us, secret of course.</span> <span id="s389">And I did.</span> <span id="s390">So from ninth of April ’40 to ninth of April ’43, I had an office in Stockholm -- in Oslo, and every fortnight it came a courier to me, and I had to report -- make a report, so that had be ready when he came, so I wrote the report every fortnight that year, about conditions in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s392">Prior to that, were you not taken to a refugee camp in Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Or -- of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: -- I had the -- I don’t know how I -- it was very se -- very special in Sweden, if you left the camp, you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I was -- I was wanted in Sweden very early.</span> <span id="s396">So when I was in Sweden later on, I had to be -- keep in Stockholm very -- I couldn’t go into hotels, so -- and I had some Swedes want -- could -- they dared to keep me in their small hotel, for instance, but when I -- the first time I was in Stockholm, I had to stay there three months.</span> <span id="s397">And then I spent my days going into different small coffee shops, because in daytime I couldn’t go to that place where I lived, so -- but it was very natural that I was wanted in Sweden because you couldn’t have Norwegian refugees running all around the country, in a war.</span> <span id="s398">So it was very natural.</span> <span id="s399">So I was put in -- prisoner for about three months, but then I got out again, under a false name.</span> <span id="s400">I put up a new name, a new family name, and I was put to court, and they all believed me.</span> <span id="s401">So then I got out to Stockholm, and then in secrecy back to Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And what was this new name?</span> <span id="s403">I think it’s rather significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Oh, that was the -- I picked the name, then I knew the British people in Stockholm, and the Norwegians, the army people, they wouldn't -- wouldn’t know exactly what happened to me.</span> <span id="s405">So I put up a new name this time, I s -- I call myself Gunnar Lear.</span> <span id="s406">And my father was a station -- gas station owner in Oslo, I -- my mother was Margda Lear, and all that, was a big family, and so they all believed me, then Swedish state [indecipherable] security police, and I got out, but then I put the name Gunnar Lear, that means in English, you know it’s Gunnar Liar.</span> <span id="s407">And when the British saw that, they really got a kick out of it.</span> <span id="s408">So they say, oh, this is Gunnar, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And the Swedes did not check to see whether this was a real person, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, they checked, you see, but I -- I did it in -- in Karlstar in Sweden.</span> <span id="s411">Then I called the authorities in Stockholm, and I say, do you know any Gunnar Lear?</span> <span id="s412">And then I had given up the name, it was a fellow, was Norwegian that was in Associated Press in nor -- in Norway.</span> <span id="s413">I -- and I -- I had taken him over the border, I had saved him.</span> <span id="s414">And then he said -- when he said -- I mentioned him, and he was a very well known man, of course.</span> <span id="s415">So it -- and he said [indecipherable] he said to himself.</span> <span id="s416">He was -- I knew he was brilliant.</span> <span id="s417">Oh yes, I know Gunnar L-Lear.</span> <span id="s418">Oh, certainly I know him.</span> <span id="s419">He was very quick, and that helped me.</span> <span id="s420">Otherwise I would have been -- been in custody in Sweden for the rest of --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Rest of --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: -- for the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: So when you became involved with the S.O.E., is it a person named Daniel Ring who brought you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: That’s right, he -- he brought me in.</span> <span id="s425">And we discussed what my number should be, and I -- I wanted the number 13.</span> <span id="s426">That’s my lucky number.</span> <span id="s427">And he said well, you can’t have that, another fellow -- so you can have 24.</span> <span id="s428">From then on my cover -- call it number was 24, under which I was known in the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s429">Number 24 was -- then I knew who it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: So now, let me ask you this question.</span> <span id="s431">How -- how do you get money in these situations?</span> <span id="s432">You don’t get a salary from the resistance movement, how does --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s434">You got the money from the British and the Norwegian liaison, because they knew I was -- you know, all refugees coming to Sweden, they had money, Norwegian money, with them.</span> <span id="s435">And the -- they were -- then they were changed into Swedish money, and all this money could be used by us.</span> <span id="s436">So I had this Norwegian money back to Norway, it was sent back to us.</span> <span id="s437">We used millions of kroner.</span> <span id="s438">[indecipherable] Again, we had money in England, because o -- of our merchant fleet, and the tanker fleet.</span> <span id="s439">You know, our tanker fleet, they say the tanker fleet -- we -- England had to have fuel -- fuel.</span> <span id="s440">Fuel is a war.</span> <span id="s441">And they needed for billions of troops, everything.</span> <span id="s442">60 percent of all Jews coming to that island, came from Norwegian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s443">So they said -- Churchill said in parliament, this is about one million soldiers.</span> <span id="s444">[indecipherable] So that’s the -- the real effort was Norway -- that was the real effort of Norway, this fleet.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: When you were staying at different people’s ho -- I gather you had to move around a good deal, you didn’t have one place where you lived.</span> <span id="s446">Did you pay people?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No.</span> <span id="s448">But no, no, it couldn’t be paid, that -- that wouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s449">But of course, I had all kinds of connections, I had enough food, I had connections everywhere.</span> <span id="s450">So when I went in hiding and lived with the family, I had all s -- always -- I couldn’t sit there, eat myself, so I had all this food for the whole family.</span> <span id="s451">I couldn’t go into there with food for myself and the family didn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: So it was never difficult [indecipherable] that, and that meant so much to them.</span> <span id="s454">But they were anti-Nazi so they didn’t [indecipherable] that.</span> <span id="s455">They could offer you meals, which they almost -- it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s456">So it were -- they were all patriots and th-they took a very great risk.</span> <span id="s457">If they came there and I had to shoot myself out, the whole family would be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: So when you became part of the SOE --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: -- what was your -- what was your role?</span> <span id="s461">The SOE’s connected with the British, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, and later on, of course, with the Norwegian government in London, so it was all put together and coordinated, so they -- and I was reporting all kinds -- intelligence was first of all to begin with, in all kinds of intelligence, but they needed everything from Norway.</span> <span id="s463">For instance, pilots, books, to get all kinds of things, of the -- all kinds of information about nor -- Norwegian Nazi authorities.</span> <span id="s464">Was very valuable things for -- for the allied, and of course, all troop movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So you had to have -- did you choose agents in the field who would get this information and bring it to you?</span> <span id="s466">And were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yeah, I had friends.</span> <span id="s468">I made friends, of course, and you could si -- when -- when I came into -- outside Oslo and needed a contact for instance, and we -- I knew it was about four or 5,000 informers.</span> <span id="s469">I usually picked doctor.</span> <span id="s470">They were very -- there was very few [indecipherable] so I -- I took the chance to run and see the doctor and he could help me.</span> <span id="s471">Or I would go to the teacher, and sometimes the priest, they were all -- that’s an -- that’s a chance you took, and I was always -- I always was lucky, or -- or I picked the right people.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I was lucky, I had good parents, so my -- my psyche was -- my psyche -- is that right?</span> <span id="s474">M-Must have been very good, because I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s475">Th -- I must have been very, very -- back when God gave us the nerves, I must have been way ba -- way back in the queue.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What do you think in your background, in your t -- as you were growing up?</span> <span id="s477">Was there something you think that prepared you for this?</span> <span id="s478">It se -- it seems as if it was something just very natural to you, you just decided this was what you had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Well, in a way you are right.</span> <span id="s480">I just had to do it, it came naturally.</span> <span id="s481">So and that, of course, when you heard how the Nazis had gone, with -- when you -- what they did to the German population, the -- the Jews, and the same what they did -- did to all your friends.</span> <span id="s482">In a way it was not necessary to hate them, but you had to fight them.</span> <span id="s483">It was natural to feel so angry.</span> <span id="s484">How they treated i -- for instance, when they arrested women, it -- it -- it -- it was incredible that they tortured women.</span> <span id="s485">It was -- how could you believe?</span> <span id="s486">So we got very angry.</span> <span id="s487">And of course -- and that was with the -- the rest of my friends.</span> <span id="s488">I -- I -- they had nerves, of course, but I think this was -- that was really what made them fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So you were getting information and then you were encoding information to send it to --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: -- to England.</span> <span id="s492">And how were you doing that?</span> <span id="s493">What was the process?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: That was done -- I put my own system.</span> <span id="s495">I took a book in Norway, and I started it with a page in that book, and I took -- I counted syllables, both ways, and then you could -- it was a hell of a trouble, you see, so I got so angry and tired, this was like to be in school again, I sat nights and did that, so I had a -- then I had the man that could take over.</span> <span id="s496">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: So ex --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: So he did that [indecipherable] and it came to Stockholm, and I had the same book, the same page, and I could easily -- we coded only the names.</span> <span id="s499">The rest you wrote could be written, but the names were important, and the places, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: So can you explain the system?</span> <span id="s501">Was it by syllable, or by letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: By syllable.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: By -- by syllable.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yeah, you counted down in that page, on that top of the page, you find a e. Number five down.</span> <span id="s505">So that’s -- I think it was very simple, and I think it’s almost impossible to -- if you had the book and you didn’t know anything about that, you couldn’t solve it, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And did they send you messages back in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: To get -- to ask you to do things?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s510">But was names and places that were coded.</span> <span id="s511">That was the important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And not -- not the others, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, because you know, I was in Sweden, and reported every -- every quarter.</span> <span id="s514">So I -- I knew what I thought they knew, what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And how did you go back and forth from Oslo to Stockholm?</span> <span id="s516">A: Oh, I had good friends, and I knew the way.</span> <span id="s517">I had the good papers, so I usually took a train o -- up to border town called Kongsvinger, and from there, then I had that -- who did help me there?</span> <span id="s518">I found a man that was head of the -- then -- the state transportation system in that town.</span> <span id="s519">So he knew everything of course.</span> <span id="s520">He helped, he was my agent there.</span> <span id="s521">So then I -- from stock -- I-I -- in that period when I came on the -- and board a train, I had the control by Gestapo officers almost every time.</span> <span id="s522">So one of my passports, which you have seen, that has been going through about 40 Gestapo controls, I think.</span> <span id="s523">Then I was -- I was a stock worker, working in a stock up there.</span> <span id="s524">So they believed it, and I looked fairly in -- innocent, you know, don’t you think so?</span> <span id="s525">So it worked all the time.</span> <span id="s526">And then how to get into the border?</span> <span id="s527">It was about 25 miles.</span> <span id="s528">Then, in -- in summer I used to bicycle and in winter I used something I think you know in the States, called a kick sledge.</span> <span id="s529">Have you ever heard about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: You find it in some places, in Wisconsin, or some th -- they know it there, kick sledge.</span> <span id="s532">They know it in Sweden, Norway and Finland.</span> <span id="s533">And this kick sledge was -- took me there, and -- very quick --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: So what is it like?</span> <span id="s535">What is a kick sledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It’s a -- a sledge, which -- it’s a kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Do you stand behind them?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Exactly, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">And it built in that way so you can stand behind it.</span> <span id="s540">And then you --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: But who -- how do y --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: -- just kicked your way.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: You kick your way?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I see, so there are no dogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, you did it yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You did -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Keeping to that built up.</span> <span id="s551">So it was a very good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Did you have to change your na -- use different identities each time you went, or did you use the Liar name -- Lear?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, no, I had changed many times since that time.</span> <span id="s554">And it was so strict.</span> <span id="s555">If you came up to Kongsvinger, and you’re in -- you were controlled, then if you had a passport showing it was made out in Oslo, you would be taken.</span> <span id="s556">So I had to make new passports, which they did for me up there -- would -- and I did -- by the way, I did them s -- myself, but I got a form up there.</span> <span id="s557">And then I had the passport being issued by the Kongsvinger police.</span> <span id="s558">Then they wouldn’t say, oh gosh, he’s -- he’s living here.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: But if you -- if you had a passport issued by Oslo police, you would be interrogated.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Because you were suspicious then.</span> <span id="s563">You were man outside the -- the -- the German guard in that town, of course they had a couple of security police, and they said all strangers to Kongsvinger, be careful.</span> <span id="s564">They might be [indecipherable] they might be resistance workers.</span> <span id="s565">So that’s was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So when you -- when the police would look at your I.D. card, you -- you did -- you weren't afraid of anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, I had so good papers.</span> <span id="s568">I knew they were good.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: You knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I knew I would fool them.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Look at that smile.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: But of course, if you had some -- some stupid thing could stop it of course, but I was lucky, all the time.</span> <span id="s573">And I was from February ’43, I was wanted and they had nice pictures of me at the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo.</span> <span id="s574">Nice pictures, but wi -- an average looking man like me, I have a nose, I have eyes, and a mouth, ears, that’s -- you cannot pick up a man -- I think you can talk to the police here, it’s impossible to pick up a average looking man from a picture.</span> <span id="s575">I knew it was impossible, I -- and I -- I still, I believed it.</span> <span id="s576">That made me look just [indecipherable] I walked around in Oslo street without trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: We’re going to take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Good.</span> <span id="s579">If you -- End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Mr. Sonsteby, you were connected a little earlier on with the group, the resistance group Milorg, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Or are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: That’s correct [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So tell me how -- why it was that you did not stay with that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well, I did, because I followed it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen.</span> <span id="s587">He and I worked very closely together.</span> <span id="s588">And everything I could do to help him.</span> <span id="s589">Then all the SOE sent in instructors from Great Britain to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little difficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did another thing.</span> <span id="s590">It was the Norwegian independent company number one.</span> <span id="s591">But then, together with Knut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out.</span> <span id="s592">We were both a little unlucky because one of the people coming from England, he was arrested, he was tortured, and he became more or less an informer.</span> <span id="s593">Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the head, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many, many people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured.</span> <span id="s594">But otherwise, I took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents coming in from England, from the -- coming around the central part of Norway, and I took care of them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was all coordinated.</span> <span id="s595">It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with Norwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside Norway that built up the resistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you couldn’t talk to each other in that way in Norway.</span> <span id="s596">I-I-It was all secret, you know.</span> <span id="s597">Communications with England was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it was all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in England and also the home front people, the military central leadership in Oslo, it was all finally coordinated from I would say, ’43, it started.</span> <span id="s598">And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was over to England a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they understood in England that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow.</span> <span id="s599">He re -- he impressed them.</span> <span id="s600">That helped.</span> <span id="s601">And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn’t agree in that kind of leadership.</span> <span id="s602">But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans, that was the important part, whatever he was.</span> <span id="s603">That was the important part for me, so I was lucky.</span> <span id="s604">Had a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of course, to Stockholm, Moscow, than -- instead of to us.</span> <span id="s605">But they were not under Moscow, but to a certain extent they listened more to Moscow than London, which is -- was natural, you know.</span> <span id="s606">But it -- it worked fairly well in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And how would you distinguish the Milorg people from the Linge people, from the Communists?</span> <span id="s608">I mean, how -- ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: It was the same young Norwegian people, but with a different education, call it.</span> <span id="s610">Where -- when you came over to England, you were taken care of by the British on the -- went through all that training schools, and they were -- must have been the best instructors in the world, because when you met -- when you re-met Germans in the war, beginning of the war, the -- like all the soldiers and all that, you -- we felt inferior.</span> <span id="s611">But after being instructed and trained in England, we didn’t feel inferior at all.</span> <span id="s612">We knew we had the best weapons, we knew we had the best brains to train us, so now we could be equal.</span> <span id="s613">And being equal, I think we were the best.</span> <span id="s614">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: So wer -- were all these different groups, representatives from them, brought to England?</span> <span id="s616">The Milorg had people who were England trained also?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes, there were all kinds of people, schoolboys, and people without schooling.</span> <span id="s618">It could be carpenters, lumberjacks, everything.</span> <span id="s619">And they all formed these groups, they could go into the Navy, they could be pilots.</span> <span id="s620">They were trained in what’s called Little Norway in Toronto, Canada.</span> <span id="s621">They were sent over and they did very well, and the -- first of all, I think everybody want to be a pilot.</span> <span id="s622">So I remember when I was in Stockholm, I should go over to England, I said, can I be a pilot?</span> <span id="s623">No, he said, y-you -- you can, but I think we have another [indecipherable] for you, called the Norwegian independent company, we’ll put you in there, probably, send you back to Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: And why did so many people want to be pilots?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I don’t know, because they had done very well, I think in -- from -- you know, over London in 1941 and ’42, they did very well.</span> <span id="s626">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Were there any bad conflicts between these different groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s631">It could be, of course, when you’re immigrants, it can always be little small quarrels, but in nor -- to Norwegians, we had been very lucky, and it was -- when we came back to Norway, or when it started, at the end of the war, it was only one real body, and that was the resistance movement in -- under the leadership of the homefront people, and they were the only -- the Communists were -- didn’t put up a group like that, so it was all -- we had -- we had no, shall we say possibilities th-that they should start fighting each other in Norway.</span> <span id="s632">We were very -- extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s633">It may be that we are -- I don’t know why, really.</span> <span id="s634">But we agreed, or we had all -- one common emeny -- enemy, that was Nazis.</span> <span id="s635">And so that was the feeling all over.</span> <span id="s636">I think -- I would say that 95, we had 98 percent behind us in Norway.</span> <span id="s637">They tried whatever they could, they tried to make the pupils, they tried to make the teachers into nat -- Nazis.</span> <span id="s638">I mean, it wasn’t -- it was -- I think it was impossible in Norway.</span> <span id="s639">I think we had -- after five years hard propaganda, I cannot see that they had any Norwegian turning into Nazi.</span> <span id="s640">Only opposite, it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s641">So that doesn’t -- pure principle is nothing for us.</span> <span id="s642">We have democratic rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Tell me a little bit more about what the general population was doing.</span> <span id="s644">I understand that the bishops made statements all over the country when they resigned, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s646">That’s right.</span> <span id="s647">And also, our -- all of our -- they call it the -- what would you call it here, the top court in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Judiciary?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: The high court --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: The high court?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: -- people.</span> <span id="s652">The -- the Supreme High Court.</span> <span id="s653">They all withdrew already in ’41.</span> <span id="s654">So they all withdrew because it was no -- it was no freedom, it was no rights, it was all German propaganda, so they all withdrew.</span> <span id="s655">They were not arrested, by the way, but they disappeared into -- but didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And teachers, professors?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes, teachers and professors --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Wasn’t there a strike?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- they did a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s660">To begin with, from ’41 - ’42, then -- the little Nazi party, they wanted to have schoolchildrens into uniforms.</span> <span id="s661">They didn’t use the swastika, but they had now a new kind of a sign, it was a sun, course -- cross, sun cross.</span> <span id="s662">It was a kind of a cross.</span> <span id="s663">And -- and schoolchildren should now be put in uniforms.</span> <span id="s664">It was almost to that.</span> <span id="s665">And then they put up all teachers, professors were put in a new organization called some teacher’s association, Nazis.</span> <span id="s666">And they all refused.</span> <span id="s667">And then they took about -- arrested thousand.</span> <span id="s668">500 were sent up to concentra -- tra -- concentration camp up in the north, very north, at our northest town, and then th -- 500 were sent over to Trawnia to be shipped up to Trawnia, to this concentration camp up in the north.</span> <span id="s669">And they had a small passenger ship, and that -- on deck it was German soldiers and underneath, in -- in the room of the ship, it was put 500 teachers.</span> <span id="s670">And they were sent up to the -- in that little ship.</span> <span id="s671">It would take about 14 days to the very north, and then -- oh, course it was, when an allied plane saw that ship, it was all Germans.</span> <span id="s672">It was a small troop transported.</span> <span id="s673">It looked like that.</span> <span id="s674">That was the idea for Terboven, the chief Nazi in Norway, and Quisling.</span> <span id="s675">They thought that was a good idea, maybe allied planes would bomb them, and who had done it?</span> <span id="s676">That kill them all.</span> <span id="s677">And it was protested very hard from the who -- all the population to Quisling, and to Terboven.</span> <span id="s678">Please stop it, you cannot do this.</span> <span id="s679">They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: They stopped it?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, but the -- no, they sent them.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: They -- they didn’t listen to protests, they said, this is the way we want it, we want them to be gone.</span> <span id="s684">So we don’t care.</span> <span id="s685">And luckily, nothing happened, and they came -- but most of it -- I think it was many teachers that die on the way, it was very little water, very little food, and then they came up to the concentration camp, and the -- after about a year, the Germans [indecipherable] that little party, you know, Nazi party, they came in.</span> <span id="s686">So the -- they won this fight, the teachers.</span> <span id="s687">And it was women, and men of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: H-How do you account for this response on the part of Norwegians to refuse?</span> <span id="s689">I -- w-w-were the -- is Norway filled with heroes?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: In some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: -- it -- well, you saw all the troubles that -- I think that I’ve seen many Germans have seen the same, but it was penetrated completely by security police, and the informers, that had come so far in Norway, so -- but it was -- they were trying, but luckily we -- well -- well, they had -- they had a power, so we could just try to in a way sabotage it, that was the way, you know, and I thought it was just the way to do it.</span> <span id="s693">To try to help it, and they -- we are -- it’s very hard to get to know each [indecipherable] democracy, I think.</span> <span id="s694">Of course, it’s very hard to explain that it was only two percent, one and a half percent.</span> <span id="s695">I-It’s still hard to explain that there was so few.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So few who appr -- who --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: The Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Or who were belong -- believing in the Nazi.</span> <span id="s700">It’s really hard to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: In 1942, things got much worse for the Jews in Norway.</span> <span id="s702">There were what, 1700 or 1800 Jews in Norway, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: About 2,000 in all to begin with.</span> <span id="s704">And it was -- could have been a few Jews coming from other countries to come to that safe Norway.</span> <span id="s705">And like Willie Brandt, for instance, and others.</span> <span id="s706">I know, of course, many Jews came, very famous Jews, doctors and musicians.</span> <span id="s707">But then the -- in ’42, it -- the first thing that started -- you saw my passport, they put a J there.</span> <span id="s708">Of course that was awful.</span> <span id="s709">We didn’t understand it, how they could do it, because in Norway, one was a Methodist, another was a Baptist and another was a Jew, we didn’t think of that.</span> <span id="s710">Now they tried to make us -- a kind of propaganda against Jews, but it didn’t work, it -- not at all.</span> <span id="s711">It didn’t work in -- in Norway.</span> <span id="s712">We hadn’t had that impression at all.</span> <span id="s713">So then it started a little more, and the trouble was, now when I think back, y-you know that far -- that far -- all the -- all the ar-archives, you know, all Jews.</span> <span id="s714">They found that in [indecipherable] and in Oslo.</span> <span id="s715">Well, how could you help it, in a way, but then was when the trouble started, you know?</span> <span id="s716">[indecipherable] they wouldn’t know everyone, every family, and then s -- I was standing there again at the -- summer, July, August, ’42.</span> <span id="s717">Then I had a family called Rubinstein, and they -- they had a feeling that it was maybe worse than they thought, but the trouble was that if you left for Sweden, you lost everything.</span> <span id="s718">You were sure to lose everything.</span> <span id="s719">You lost your house, you lost the bank account, if you had any.</span> <span id="s720">If -- you lost everything, everything when you have left Norway.</span> <span id="s721">Your business was taken over by authorities, Nazi authorities.</span> <span id="s722">And if you didn’t, then it was about -- I took the family over, and I think it was good idea, but we didn’t feel that all sh -- all should be done, b -- because they had Norwegian passports.</span> <span id="s723">And then the rumors came -- I would say so very much, in October, ’42, but then suddenly they went there, and the -- remember, the police had been organized, reorganized somehow, it was Nazi police.</span> <span id="s724">And then that night, it was -- now it was about 700 left, about eight, I would say, 1200 had come out to begin with, and later on it was taken over by the resistance the people had wanted.</span> <span id="s725">Every -- in those years, everyone that wanted to go out, could be helped.</span> <span id="s726">I could easily take a family over, I had their o -- a-as I told you, I knew the people, I could take easily.</span> <span id="s727">And I had no trouble going into Sweden.</span> <span id="s728">But then the 700 in all families, older people, young people, and -- and children, old people.</span> <span id="s729">And then the -- then one day, one o -- why -- I heard it in this way, that one of my friends -- I knew a law -- a la -- a young lawyer, and his name was Hawkin [indecipherable] and he had a -- I didn’t know he was a Jew, or anything, of course.</span> <span id="s730">I knew he had the passport, he had shown me that.</span> <span id="s731">Then he was a young lawyer, then suddenly, six o’clock in the morning, I was to hear this, they came and they said, you are arrested because of the law so and so.</span> <span id="s732">He said, “I don’t know that law.</span> <span id="s733">I never heard about it.”</span> <span id="s734">He was a good lawyer, and he said, “It’s wrong, it must be wrong.”</span> <span id="s735">So -- but then -- well, you have to come with us.</span> <span id="s736">Your bank account is now taken, you lose your house and have you any jewels here, we have to have them now.</span> <span id="s737">Everything.</span> <span id="s738">And he was so bewildered, of course, and then that -- it was a shock to hear that new law, two days old, and the shock to hear he had no more things in life.</span> <span id="s739">They were all taken.</span> <span id="s740">And then he was taken away.</span> <span id="s741">I heard about this, and of course, then it started all -- all over Norway.</span> <span id="s742">A few were -- then, what happened to his wife, and a little daughter?</span> <span id="s743">Three days later, a man knocked at the door, five o’clock in the morning, and they said get away, soon.</span> <span id="s744">And so she moved from the second floor, up to the third floor, to -- and the family said please come in here.</span> <span id="s745">Six o’clock that morning the Gestapo came for her and her -- but she were -- they were saved.</span> <span id="s746">So many had --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: She was saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: She was saved, and with the la -- little girl.</span> <span id="s749">She was taken care of and sent home to Sweden, so she was saved.</span> <span id="s750">But another thing, you know, what was terrible, I had also knew about the young man in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s751">He was a -- a Jew, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s752">He told me afterwards that he was now in resistance.</span> <span id="s753">And then he got to know his parents had been told, if he doesn’t report to the police, they would all be taken.</span> <span id="s754">And of course, he gave himself up, and they took all of them.</span> <span id="s755">The Gestapo, security police, Nazis, lies, lies, and lies, that was all they had coming from that German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So, did the resistance warn Jews and say, things may happen, we want to take you out of Sweden, or did the Jews make contact with the resistance to ask for help?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No, I just -- for instance, we had a family, which I talked about, we discussed that openly.</span> <span id="s758">When I -- we had a -- a career, he -- they knew him very well, so they heard from Stockholm, they had news from the outside world.</span> <span id="s759">So they -- they heard about the Crystal Night, you know, all that, so now they started to think, maybe it can happen here.</span> <span id="s760">And about the 1200, they have started to think that way.</span> <span id="s761">But I talked to Jule Benko my friend that is here with me.</span> <span id="s762">He is one of -- in our parliament he was the speaker of our [indecipherable] parliament for 12 years, and we discussed this.</span> <span id="s763">He was a young Jew at that time.</span> <span id="s764">He was in resistance, ’42, so we discussed between ourselves now, we are discussed it now, what did you think -- what did I think.</span> <span id="s765">We had the same view on this.</span> <span id="s766">We had just thought the same in August.</span> <span id="s767">So he -- then Gestapo was -- had wanted him, so he went over to Sweden, of course, because we had to flee, because he was now wanted by the Gestapo, then you had to flee.</span> <span id="s768">And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So what -- what was your view, that it was so alike at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: That was that we didn’t -- we couldn’t believe that they would be arrested, or -- or w-we could believe that they would be arrested to a camp in Norway, but the rest we didn’t at all consider.</span> <span id="s771">And he went over to Sweden and later on he came over to Canada and joined the Norwegian Air Force, and all his family are lost.</span> <span id="s772">All of them.</span> <span id="s773">So he knows what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: So in 1942, you don’t know what’s happening in Russia, you don’t know that there are more than a million people who have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Well, in -- they -- how they treated -- when they came into Russia, of course.</span> <span id="s776">But coming -- going on into Norway, trying to keep them -- they tried to keep us as a civilized nation, but all the -- the rule there, it was harder and harder.</span> <span id="s777">Hitler had of course hoped that th-the Nordic types there would be drawn in, because -- so he was furious when they had this fight -- all the resistance in Norway.</span> <span id="s778">And we lost many.</span> <span id="s779">Also at this time of ’42 August, it was thousands of Norwegians that were waiting to get out Sweden, because Sweden were neutral.</span> <span id="s780">It was important to us that Sweden was neutral.</span> <span id="s781">Without the neutral Sweden I cannot see how we could have had a resistance at all.</span> <span id="s782">Because all routes towards England, over the sea, were stopped in ’42 for refugees.</span> <span id="s783">And it -- we could take 50,000 over to Sweden during the war.</span> <span id="s784">And we had them out at the same times, at -- this shocked us, the Jews, we had -- could have had two, 3,000 in Oslo waiting to get over to Sweden to save their lives.</span> <span id="s785">We als -- mixed together, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: W-Were the Swedes like the Norwegians in the sense of even though they were politically neutral, were they anti-Nazi in your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: In my opinion, I met only at the border in small town, Gottenberg, also, and even in Stockholm, I didn’t meet anybody that had a Nazi sympathy.</span> <span id="s788">I knew it was some, but I -- I didn’t meet any.</span> <span id="s789">And I had a wonderful -- but I -- it was difficult when I -- I had my headquarters at the -- at the farm, on the -- right on the Swedish Norwegian border.</span> <span id="s790">And then I understood that on the other side, the custom officer, I was pretty sure he was intelligence officer.</span> <span id="s791">Before I had been in army, lived in Sweden, I [indecipherable] custom official, with a officer -- intelligence officer, and I was right.</span> <span id="s792">So I got in touch with him, and from then on we worked together.</span> <span id="s793">But if it had been known, and the police, they came up and fetched me on the border, and took me in this sleeper to Stockholm.</span> <span id="s794">I was -- had a free way.</span> <span id="s795">And I -- I could tell them about all Norwegian -- all troops, German troops, were they difficult, or could they attack.</span> <span id="s796">I could tell them everything, and -- but if this had been known in Stockholm, in the Ministry of Justice, they would have been arrested, because if you ha -- re -- if you, in front of Germany, in front of Hitler, it’s only wer -- one way to be neutral, that is to be neutral.</span> <span id="s797">That’s -- that’s my view on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: You decided at some point, I believe it was in 1942, that a man named Swenson --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: -- might be willing to become part of the secret police so that he could be a -- I guess one would say a double agent in some way, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: You’re well -- very well advised.</span> <span id="s802">My -- I came to a small town called Notodden, very near to my hometown.</span> <span id="s803">Had a -- I came to a small town called Notodden.</span> <span id="s804">There was a policeman, he was a secret member of the military groups.</span> <span id="s805">I said to him, how are you liked in Notodden?</span> <span id="s806">Well, very good.</span> <span id="s807">Will -- will you try to be a little more, yo -- not rude, but be difficult to the population.</span> <span id="s808">And then I said to him, why don’t you try to come into the Nazi police in Oslo.</span> <span id="s809">And of course, he applied, and it was sent back for the police headquarters, Nazi, they send back, what kind of people to the -- to the -- the party members in Notodden, that -- the Quisling party members.</span> <span id="s810">And they said, “How is Swensen?</span> <span id="s811">Is he a -- could he be a resistance?”</span> <span id="s812">No, he is not.</span> <span id="s813">He is one of us.</span> <span id="s814">Of course it was very ba -- very sad for Swensen, too, because the population there, they more or less hated him because they thought he -- that he really was that.</span> <span id="s815">So then I said, you come in to the police, and he joined the police, state police, and the -- or the federal Nazi police.</span> <span id="s816">And then one day we had two people that was arrested, so we agreed that Swensen had to be offered, he had to -- now he had to take those people out and try to get out of Sweden, too -- over to Sweden [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s817">He had the right papers, and he went up to the -- worked together with the Gestapo people, the Germans, and they said okay, you can interrogate them.</span> <span id="s818">So he took them out from the prison, did not interrogated, put -- took them over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s819">And he had also [indecipherable] so we lost a very good spy of course, within federal state Nazi police.</span> <span id="s820">But he helped me that -- that time.</span> <span id="s821">I got go know -- got his passport, police passport, so I made one similar.</span> <span id="s822">So now I will -- had also the passport as a secret police line within federal police.</span> <span id="s823">And I could use that for special times, which I did.</span> <span id="s824">So it was good to have, to pretend being a -- a Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: So did you have -- just to be light a little bit, did you have a big wallet filled with all these different I.D.s, or did you keep them in your apartment and take one when you needed one?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, the reason -- you know, I came over to Sweden every fortnight -- every fourth month.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Then I took them over to Sweden and let them stay.</span> <span id="s829">And I had notes -- note, it was crosses and all that, and I left my books in Sweden every time I had new, new, left them over, new, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: So when the war was over, it was all in Sweden.</span> <span id="s832">So that’s why I have them now, I could show people.</span> <span id="s833">They’re very -- very few know this in Norway, I think, but I think they’re very unique, the whole collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Why would somebody like Swensen agree to be a de --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: He -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: -- it’s such a difficult position to be in, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: No, he was -- I knew he was a good man, and I knew he was in -- in the -- in a military group, he had started it in Notodden.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: So he was one of the very good people.</span> <span id="s840">So -- but he was one of the few that really could do this.</span> <span id="s841">Otherwise we’re taken as being in resistance, you know, and arrested and tortured.</span> <span id="s842">So he had been lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: So for how long was he acting as this secret --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Oh, it was a very short time, about three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did he have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: But they were not t-taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: They weren't?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yeah, well they stayed in Norway.</span> <span id="s851">That was difficult and different, very different.</span> <span id="s852">Some -- i -- some of the family would be taken, but very often they were -- well, maybe not -- they had not enough space in their prisons, so they had to realize, are they important, are they dangerous.</span> <span id="s853">So they let them out after many housewife, or wifes of the resistance workers were set free after two, three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: But that must have been difficult for him being in Sweden won-wondering what would happen to his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Could happen anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Anybody, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: They could have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Because that was very serious, what he had done [indecipherable] he was a real spy --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s861">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: -- within their outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s864">When you wrote your book, you -- you talked about this feeling of restlessness that you would get in a situation, a kind of sixth sense that something bad was going to happen.</span> <span id="s865">There was one evening when you’re with Baker Anderson, and his daughter, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s867">We ran --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: And in the middle of the night, you th -- you thought something --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah, we went to the mountains because they had a beautiful place up there, and um -- far up in the mountains in Telemark district, not far from Rjukan by the way.</span> <span id="s870">And we went up there, and it was also a courier from -- from Stockholm, which had alls -- all kinds of false papers, too.</span> <span id="s871">But we went up in the mountains there, and we sat discussing der night, and I had a feeling that -- it must have been -- I don’t know if a sense, sixth sense, but must have been kind of a computer, and I put that thought in my brain, maybe -- he is there, maybe he is under surveillance, what about his daughter?</span> <span id="s872">They had been arrested once, so it must have told me, get away.</span> <span id="s873">So in -- during the night, two o’clock at night, I left.</span> <span id="s874">I -- they -- they laughed [indecipherable] think I was very stupid.</span> <span id="s875">So I left.</span> <span id="s876">Six o’clock in the morning it was, 30 men with three leaders from different [indecipherable] coming for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: 30?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: 30 of them.</span> <span id="s879">And they were looking for Mr. Bloch.</span> <span id="s880">I had [indecipherable] got by the name Mr. Bloch, I thought that was a nice name.</span> <span id="s881">So it was the Bloch this time.</span> <span id="s882">They had heard that Bloch was with -- they were arrested, but they were let out after two, three months in prison.</span> <span id="s883">They didn’t -- they said, these people cannot -- they don’t know anything, so -- but that was a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And you biked --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes, I biked --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: -- to where, to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: -- over in the mountains, over to Rjukan.</span> <span id="s888">And was in a way a little stupid because in Sweden I had lost my real identity card for Gunnar Sonsteby.</span> <span id="s889">I had torn it to pieces so the secret police shouldn’t -- the Swedish sec -- couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s890">So I went up to Rjukan to the police there.</span> <span id="s891">I knew they didn’t know I had been in Sweden or anything, I knew that.</span> <span id="s892">I took the chance and I got a new, real passport, which is in my collection now, for Gunnar Sonsteby.</span> <span id="s893">So, I had luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And how did you explain that -- you just lost it, is that what you told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Oh yes, I just told them I lost it in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s898">So I was lucky, they didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Now, Anderson was a baker, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And did you not have something to do with his place in gro -- was it Groland Street in --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Oh yes, I had -- since that, when -- after they had been out again, we started again.</span> <span id="s903">That was -- I think it was one of my central places in Oslo, it was, actu -- matter of fact, but then he was -- later on he was under suspicion again, so then I had to take him over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s904">But his wife, and la -- daughter, they were standing, helping us for a year, and then finally we had to send them also over to Sweden as refugees because then the -- there was all blown, the Gestapo [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s905">Then we disappeared of course, from that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s907">And how did you use that place?</span> <span id="s908">Was this a -- a meeting place for the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Meeting place for all kinds of resistance workers.</span> <span id="s910">It had started -- he started in a way, but he had the bakery.</span> <span id="s911">The Germans came to Oslo and I said, you are putting your bakery at our disposal.</span> <span id="s912">He said, no, I don’t.</span> <span id="s913">And I took it.</span> <span id="s914">He didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s915">I said -- one of the very few.</span> <span id="s916">And then he started to send bread over to the prison.</span> <span id="s917">Was very near to his place, and he -- they got in some bread to the prisoners there.</span> <span id="s918">So he -- that’s how he started, and later on all the couriers came to him and we met there.</span> <span id="s919">So it was a real central place for resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Did you meet upstairs?</span> <span id="s921">The bakery’s downstairs and you met upstairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s923">Was very important because you had to be in places where you were not seen or mixed in to other people.</span> <span id="s924">The shop was downstairs, it was hundreds of people in and out all the time.</span> <span id="s925">And you can go in there, and you can just go up the stairs to the second floor.</span> <span id="s926">And when I came into the shop it was a very nice girl standing there behind a desk, and I had also eyesight with her.</span> <span id="s927">I knew if she had the usual way, she smiled and say hello, how are you Bloch, or -- she knew my different names.</span> <span id="s928">And then if she would say -- or just smile.</span> <span id="s929">If she had been something wrong, I would have known it immediately.</span> <span id="s930">I would have turned around.</span> <span id="s931">So that was my security sign.</span> <span id="s932">It was very simple and effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: So a -- a lot of your work really depended upon people who were not necessarily working in the resistance, but always supporting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s935">And you got supporters everywhere bac -- but you knew, among your supporters in Oslo, it could be f -- one of the 4,000 informers.</span> <span id="s936">So you had to -- a little luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Did you have a gun on you all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: It depended.</span> <span id="s939">When I had a sabotage to do, an operation in Oslo, I was armed.</span> <span id="s940">But when I worked -- walked around and organized and did all my resistance work, my intelligence work, helping -- taking people over to Sweden, then I would never carry a pistol of course, because it was controlled everywhere.</span> <span id="s941">I would run into control, I would be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Did you also have poison with you in case you were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: No.</span> <span id="s944">No, I didn’t want that.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: You didn’t want it?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I want -- I lived, and during the night I was sleeping behind a locked door, on the fourth floor, third floor, and I knew I would -- they would wake me up and I could start fighting them.</span> <span id="s947">Now I always [indecipherable] hand grenades, a couple of pistols, and the last six months I had also some explosives beside my bed.</span> <span id="s948">Because I couldn’t be taken.</span> <span id="s949">I knew -- they -- they knew, I knew.</span> <span id="s950">It wasn’t if they interrogated me, they could torture -- they didn't need -- they knew I knew.</span> <span id="s951">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: So you were simply going to fight.</span> <span id="s953">You were either going to get out or be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah, I had to because I would ruin the whole organization, if I was -- was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Because you knew too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: It was just natural thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: At one point in 1942 -- I don’t -- it was the late summer in August, I think you got some sort of a order to borrow the printing plates from the bank, from Norway?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Yes, that was a interesting job.</span> <span id="s959">I got the letter from the Minister of Finance in England that was -- they wanted to print money in England because they were scarce of money in Norway.</span> <span id="s960">So they asked me to go to the Bank of Norway, it’s like -- like Fort Knox here, is it?</span> <span id="s961">And the -- fetch the steel plates for 50 kroner and 100 kroner, that’s about five dollars and 20 dollars, roughly.</span> <span id="s962">That was very important to have, and I got to know some of the people, and of course their bank manager, he -- when he saw me, a young boy of 23, in with the -- was a very bad -- my clothes were a little filthy, and they said, this fellow must be crazy if I should believe him.</span> <span id="s963">And he said, I want -- first of all, I want a few words.</span> <span id="s964">The man that -- running the radio from Great Britain, the Norwegian radio with BBC, he was very well known in Norway, and he was a personal friend of the bank manager, and he said, I want five lines from him, five words with that and that.</span> <span id="s965">And then he said, now I got rid of that fellow.</span> <span id="s966">Three weeks later I came up to his office and I showed him, here it is, from your friend in England.</span> <span id="s967">And they saw it was, then he believed me, then that started the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: And this was real, you didn’t forge this letter?</span> <span id="s969">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: No, this was a real one.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No, it -- he knew it was the real letter.</span> <span id="s972">He knew that he wrote exactly what he had suggested.</span> <span id="s973">And he o -- or I -- he also could have had -- we talk -- we -- we talked about that.</span> <span id="s974">He could have a special from that fellow if I had asked him, you say on the radio from London that for instance somebody si -- a special sign that the weather is nice today, could be, but he could have got that.</span> <span id="s975">But we didn’t need it to do that, be -- but I could have d-done that easily.</span> <span id="s976">But then he -- the whole board, went into hiding.</span> <span id="s977">They had [indecipherable] court, they didn’t stay at home that night when I had the pla -- plates and took them over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s978">The next morning, eight o’clock, I could call him and say they’re all safe in Sweden and England.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: How did you carry them?</span> <span id="s980">In what -- what did you put them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I had, at that time we had no gasoline.</span> <span id="s982">I had a little, but the Germans didn’t, and they -- usually you can use gasoline, and we had a charcoal burner.</span> <span id="s983">And you had sacks with also charcoal to burn and make the -- the -- the car running.</span> <span id="s984">And on the bottom of that sack, I had the -- that little package of steel plates.</span> <span id="s985">And we took them up to Kongsvinger, and -- but you know, it’s always happening, something, it -- it was dark night, and the -- then the -- suddenly all the lights in the car disappeared, so we landed in a ditch.</span> <span id="s986">And I said to my friend the chauffeur, what the hell are we doing now?</span> <span id="s987">And then a car came in, a German car, a big car with about 20 Germans in.</span> <span id="s988">And they offered me to take us up again.</span> <span id="s989">And I said -- I said, oh, I said, please, come on, I said.</span> <span id="s990">And when I left them I was glad that they le -- left us, I said -- I say, Auf Wiedersehen, so nice, you know, Auf Wiedersehen.</span> <span id="s991">So then --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: So was this -- you were in a car, or you were in a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No, I was in a car.</span> <span id="s994">It was -- I used a -- a taxi driver.</span> <span id="s995">He worked for me in Oslo.</span> <span id="s996">They were all perfect, I must say.</span> <span id="s997">I didn’t find any taxi driver that was a Nazi, by the way, but my friend Hornbeck, he -- he -- he -- that was be -- before I had got my own driver’s license.</span> <span id="s998">But I found after that, that I had to get my own driver’s license.</span> <span id="s999">So I made one, and drove into the traffic, it went all right, in ’42 - ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Why did you decide that you had to have your own driver’s license and drive yourself?</span> <span id="s1001">A: Because I was all tra -- al-always a little -- you had to wait for the driver, you had to find one, and if you had your own car with false license plates, it’s -- you wi -- may need it very soon, you know, very quick.</span> <span id="s1002">You can’t wait for a driver, or a taxi driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So these Germans who helped you were not at all suspicious, were these soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: No, they were soldiers, and they were usually kind --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: -- of course, to the population, because after all, they were taught to be, try to be kind to them.</span> <span id="s1007">But when they were ordered to shoot 20 Norwegians, they would do it immediately.</span> <span id="s1008">That was the difference.</span> <span id="s1009">They were disciplined, and they -- all the leaders, SA -- SS troops, you know what they did.</span> <span id="s1010">They got their orders from Gestapo, they worked closely with Gestapo, all of them, all the leaders there.</span> <span id="s1011">And then you were just arrested, shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: So you got to Stockholm, you notified Oslo that the plates were there safely, then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: They were -- during the night, they were -- they were copied and they were sent back to Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Same way, you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yeah, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: In the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: -- put it -- put in the place, back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And did you go to the bank at night to return these, or during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: I -- I didn’t do that, because at that time I didn’t have -- I must not be seen in the neighborhood or any of those, it was too dangerous, where I had that -- it was one of the -- one of the business there or firms that supplied paper and other things to the -- he knew them very well, so I had that supplier go to them.</span> <span id="s1020">Teda Munsen, he was -- he knew -- he was one -- one of the -- he was one of the very few that [indecipherable] this.</span> <span id="s1021">He helped --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So did he go from Stockholm to Oslo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: He -- he didn’t -- no, he was in Oslo, only in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Okay, so you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: So he helped me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1029">And then you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: We had other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1033">That could be couriers and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Now, were you in a particularly dangerous situation at that moment, because you had gone to the bank originally and gotten the plates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No, there -- they hadn’t seen me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: They hadn’t seen you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, no, so -- and I was at that time Mr. Nilssen.</span> <span id="s1038">[indecipherable] Oh, he had a beautiful address, he was not there.</span> <span id="s1039">But what about Nilssen, have you -- they’ve never heard of any.</span> <span id="s1040">So I was -- I was not there.</span> <span id="s1041">No trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So what is this, your fifth or sixth or 10th name?</span> <span id="s1043">You keep --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Oh yes, it could now be number 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: It could now be number 20.</span> <span id="s1046">So the copies of the printing plates --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: That came to England, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: And then they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: -- at the same time, I had to go up to the paper mill in Bergen to get the right paper.</span> <span id="s1050">That I did, was sent over to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: And how was it sent to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: That [indecipherable] paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Special paper for Norwegian money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And was it flown to England or on a ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yes, taken over by courier planes from Stockholm to -- to Scotland.</span> <span id="s1057">You know, that was very strange that you had courier planes from Stockholm to England, and you had courier planes from Stockholm to Germany.</span> <span id="s1058">And in a way, they let it happen because they both needed this courier planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So the Germans didn’t si -- di -- did they check what was on the planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Oh no, they couldn’t check it in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: They couldn’t, because it’s a courier plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean, in Sweden, in neutral Sweden they couldn’t check it.</span> <span id="s1064">But [indecipherable] not at all that -- that we couldn’t check the Germans and the allied couldn’t check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: So you got the paper on this plane, and the plates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1067">I didn’t -- that was not my business, that was done by SOE in Stockholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: British, or Norwegians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: But you found the paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: They got the paper over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: I can’t recall how much it was, but it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: It had to be a lot, no?</span> <span id="s1077">Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yeah, but first of all, they could make similar in England with the paper, they had to have samples for all the paper [indecipherable] was very good paper in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: So now they forged million -- I mean much money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yes, but they -- I think they made about 20 million kroner over in England.</span> <span id="s1081">It was very little used, because as I told you, it was -- all the refugees came with money, so of course that was the most safe money to use, that was the real money from Norway, but they were so well done, of course, because the people, it was a very famous company in England, and they had been doing that for Norwegians before.</span> <span id="s1082">So they -- they knew exactly how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So they stockpiled this money in England waiting to see whether they would need it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: And you didn’t use very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: The 20 millions</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Yes, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: I didn’t use any, but I know some did in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: It’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Oh, it’s a interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1092">Why did you take the name of Nordstrom, Gunnar Nordstrom?</span> <span id="s1093">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: You know, I thought that was a nice name --</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Nice name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: -- and it was a name that was used up in the district.</span> <span id="s1097">Could be [indecipherable] i-it’s a good Norwegian name.</span> <span id="s1098">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1100">And did you ha -- you had a cover story for each of these names, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: You had to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: -- who the parents were, and what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: And you see, I didn’t dare to be lumberjack, because when I saw my hands, I say, oh this fellow cannot be a lumberjack.</span> <span id="s1106">I didn’t dare to do that, but I said I working in the stock -- some stock up there, some warehouse --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: -- by the way, was a warehouse worker.</span> <span id="s1109">That suited more to my hands and the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So let’s talk a little bit about this so-called ordinary look that you have, that you can sort of pass, that you’re not suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Well, as I said, my -- I had no special marks, I had ears, as I said, and a us-usual nose, eyes and it was no special -- if you should try to describe me it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s1112">When you go out now, I’m sure you -- if you should describe me in front of the police, you wouldn’t be able, I’m sure -- pretty sure, I’m so average.</span> <span id="s1113">Average looking, such an average man, so you have to -- not to behave, but you had to feel one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: But your demeanor is very quiet.</span> <span id="s1115">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Well, that’s what it appears to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Is that unusu -- was that unusual in the resistance?</span> <span id="s1120">Were people -- I mean, I suppose one often thinks about people who were in the resistance as very strong, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: -- sort of -- and you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Well, to begin with I thought that I had the big heavy people, lumberjacks, but after awhile of course -- they might be very brainy, too, of course, too, but they -- they understood that the most important thing was what did you have in your head.</span> <span id="s1124">That was a -- of course was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Did it surprise you how easily you -- you’re very innovative -- we -- yo -- do you know what I mean, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: It’s just -- it’s interesting that you ask that question because after the war, I thought everybody had -- had the -- my experience.</span> <span id="s1127">I thought that was usual.</span> <span id="s1128">I didn’t know that I had a very -- had -- had a very special job, or -- I thought everybody had the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: That everybody was doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yeah, I thought so.</span> <span id="s1131">So I was a little depressed when I found out that some things I had been -- wasn’t all done.</span> <span id="s1132">It was much -- I think that was maybe a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Well, clearly it was a very good thing.</span> <span id="s1134">But what did you think then when you realized that what you were doing was unusual?</span> <span id="s1135">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yeah, I felt it was -- ordinarily I knew that it was many saboteurs.</span> <span id="s1137">I knew they had been lucky and done lots of things.</span> <span id="s1138">So I knew I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1139">So, easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: When you were in Stockholm in autumn of 1942, you were then made a liaison for all the new agents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: In Oslo, is that right, and what did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: In Oslo, er --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: You know, the most important part of our Norwegian independent company number one, was not to be saboteurs in Norway, also but first of all instructors in a secret army.</span> <span id="s1146">So most of them came, for instance, when I came by boat, into this west coast, I didn't -- was not in touch with them, but when they came, very often they came through Oslo because it was -- you had all the refugee routes, so you could come easily to -- over to Sweden at that way.</span> <span id="s1147">When I had finished [indecipherable] I had to get -- go out to Sweden, and flown back to England.</span> <span id="s1148">So then I had -- they knew I was in Oslo, so to me Oslo became such a small town.</span> <span id="s1149">It is, but -- so I knew, and many people knew where I was -- I could tell [indecipherable] some people knew.</span> <span id="s1150">And then they got hold on me, I could help them going out to Sweden, I could help them with a bicycle, I could help them with food, I could help renew his passport, anything.</span> <span id="s1151">And I had country -- I had a couple of men with me.</span> <span id="s1152">So we had the -- we had the -- all kinds of connections.</span> <span id="s1153">A doctor, anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: If you would count up the number of connections you had in Oslo, how many people, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: I-I think I met -- every day I met new people, up to 10 - 15, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: It was incredible.</span> <span id="s1158">When I came to England, I was interrogated by this [indecipherable] security police in London, outside the London.</span> <span id="s1159">And I s -- some people, they voiced their opinion.</span> <span id="s1160">Everybody is arrested, but not 24.</span> <span id="s1161">He is a spy.</span> <span id="s1162">And I was very glad, I -- I knew, I had a feeling that they -- they had to control that.</span> <span id="s1163">So the policeman was put -- wi -- interrogating me and he said, write down all the names, you know, all leaders.</span> <span id="s1164">I put 200 names on the paper.</span> <span id="s1165">And he started.</span> <span id="s1166">Why did you deal with that man?</span> <span id="s1167">Because they had hundreds reports from many of these leaders already in England, so he could control.</span> <span id="s1168">What did you -- why did you meet Petershim?</span> <span id="s1169">What about the lawyer Hansen?</span> <span id="s1170">What about Dr. So and So.</span> <span id="s1171">And I could explain everything, naturally, how they were arrested and not me.</span> <span id="s1172">So they finally said, okay, we let him go back to Norway.</span> <span id="s1173">He -- we are hundred percent that he is good.</span> <span id="s1174">But to me, when you are a sus -- when you are suspect and all that, it’s very good that they -- I was so glad that they looked into this</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: We’re going to take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Mr. Sonsteby, in October of 1942, a couple of agents were executed by the Gestapo, was that -- is that r -- let me ask it another way.</span> <span id="s1181">Th -- w-was it very often that agents would get caught and tortured and executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1183">If you take our -- this company which I mentioned to you, the freedom company in England, it was about 200 when the -- in the middle of the war, and -- and about 55 were taken and shot.</span> <span id="s1184">Was quite a high percentage.</span> <span id="s1185">Twe -- nearly 20 percent, maybe 250 boys.</span> <span id="s1186">And sometimes you didn’t hear any, but suddenly they were caught, it was an informer very often, and then they were taken to custody.</span> <span id="s1187">First of all, to begin with they were tortured and they were sitting there in the prison.</span> <span id="s1188">But later on it came an order, a Hitler order that they should be tortured and shot within 24 hours [indecipherable] the last -- from ’43.</span> <span id="s1189">Der Fuehrer bifel, it was called.</span> <span id="s1190">The Hitler’s bifel, or the Hitler’s order.</span> <span id="s1191">But it could happen.</span> <span id="s1192">And of course, not only people from -- agents from England, but in the resistant groups, in Milorg for instance, if a man was taken there, he was very badly beaten and -- and that could happen once a week.</span> <span id="s1193">Could be one that was taken and the whole -- and sometimes you could get -- arrest many who were tortured, and then they could give up, up to in one, two nights, and also it could have been almost 200 arrested.</span> <span id="s1194">Some will be -- but most of them were taken into custody, and -- or -- or sent for new interrogations, and later on to Germany, to concentration camps to die.</span> <span id="s1195">To work for two, three years and then off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Do you -- were there any particular incidences that come re -- that re -- you remember?</span> <span id="s1197">Friends of yours who were working with you who were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Yes, it was one very bad, I think, actually on t -- here was arrested in an apartment in Oslo, and he was sent down to [indecipherable] shoes, where we had our machine.</span> <span id="s1199">At that time it was a very, very tough prison, and it was German guards everywhere [indecipherable] escape, to escape was sum -- almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1200">But we tried to get them out, but we thought we couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1201">So I had cook -- the cook there, they had a good cook, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1202">And I asked him, if my friend wants a poison pill, how can he do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: “Well,” he said, “he can stand by the window and be pretending that he’s cleaning the window and he loses the little cloth piece, and then I can take it out, I’ll put the pill in there.”</span> <span id="s1204">They did.</span> <span id="s1205">So it worked, but some Germans had seen it, but the -- they couldn’t prove it, so the cook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget about it.</span> <span id="s1206">But my friend got a pill.</span> <span id="s1207">When he understood that we had given up all hope, he then thought to himself, now I try to flee from here.</span> <span id="s1208">And he really almost made it.</span> <span id="s1209">He came to the wall, and the -- jumped over the wall, he had come all the way out.</span> <span id="s1210">Then a German soldier -- by the way it wa -- he was an under -- he was a [indecipherable] or something, and he took his rifle and shot him.</span> <span id="s1211">So, it was very sad, but he had made it, but it was a very -- an ordinary thing, a -- a soldier wouldn’t do that, but this time he did it.</span> <span id="s1212">So it was very un -- unhappy thing.</span> <span id="s1213">He was -- we were very close.</span> <span id="s1214">That could be, of course, several -- actually we had also when I was in England, two of my best men, they wanted to do some anti-propaganda.</span> <span id="s1215">It was a school in London what they called the anti-propaganda school, it’s another English name for it, but they did some of that in Norway, trying to make the Germans believe that it was a secret opposition between German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1216">I tried to pretend that.</span> <span id="s1217">It was -- and then they got hold of, from one of the districts, the Milorg had taken to -- had hid two German soldiers, but their -- they pretended to be -- didn’t want to do any more, they were getting out of the army, trying to get over to Sweden, they pretended.</span> <span id="s1218">And my friends, they believed in it.</span> <span id="s1219">And when I met these two guys, in Oslo, the Gestapo was there, and they were Gestapo people, so they were both shot, shot in the -- in a restaur -- in a café.</span> <span id="s1220">So there’s one le -- one died immediately, and the other one, Taloxen, he survived, but very -- hardly wounded, but then he was taken to hospital first and then to prison, and then he -- he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s1221">He -- he knew he couldn’t take it, he knew he would give in, give up some names, so he didn’t want to take the chance.</span> <span id="s1222">I was in England when I heard this through the -- we had the wireless operators, they wired it over to me, so I heard it.</span> <span id="s1223">So then I had to pick up new people, two new people to take them back to Norway.</span> <span id="s1224">That happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1226">Tell me, did -- did the agents, other than you, who had hundreds of names in your head, did most of the agents only have a few names --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Yes, usually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: -- because they would give -- oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: They were not in my position, they were just coming in from England, doing their jobs, and back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: So that was a big difference.</span> <span id="s1232">But they had names, of course.</span> <span id="s1233">They could say, how did you come to Norway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, we came by ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Ship, okay, that was [indecipherable] but who helped you when you came ashore?</span> <span id="s1237">What was his name?</span> <span id="s1238">Was it [indecipherable] who could it be?</span> <span id="s1239">That was very dangerous, of course.</span> <span id="s1240">So they knew enough names to make trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Did a lot of agents use aliases and keep changing their names, so -- so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No, they ha -- they were given a name in England, before they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: So that was another thing, I -- I had to send over to Stockholm, I had to send different forms for different passports, that was also a thing.</span> <span id="s1245">And they were very well done in -- in England, but if you had taken a name, and that man had been a policeman in that district, then he would be shifted out.</span> <span id="s1246">If you came after two years, then suddenly -- and those names hadn’t been checked, one of the groups came right into [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1247">He was [indecipherable] by a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1248">It was a new man, and it was a -- a small shopkeeper that they also could use.</span> <span id="s1249">He was a Nazi at that time.</span> <span id="s1250">So all na -- everything, all information had to be very up to date.</span> <span id="s1251">So that was always -- when they made out the forms, passports in England, it would -- could be a little more chance.</span> <span id="s1252">I didn’t have that chance in Norway.</span> <span id="s1253">So our papers, they were more dependable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Let me ask you another question about sort of your everyday life.</span> <span id="s1255">Where were you eating?</span> <span id="s1256">Where did you eat lunch, where did you eat dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Tha-That’s a ver-very interesting question.</span> <span id="s1258">When I stay at a place, I didn’t want to be seen in daytime, so I usually went out in the morning, well, say nine o’clock, then I didn’t come back until 10 - 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: At night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1261">Because I didn’t want to go in and out from that building.</span> <span id="s1262">So then I had my luncheon for instance, down at the bakery.</span> <span id="s1263">I had my dinner with a -- an old lady, a widow, where I could come.</span> <span id="s1264">I -- but then when night came I always went back to my hiding place, and I knew it had to be shifted in, for instance, three months.</span> <span id="s1265">Then the people could have seen me, and it was some -- after the war, some of the members of the Nazi party, they said, we didn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1266">No, but when they saw a man going in, out -- for instance with a rucksack every night, they reported it, and they had to report it.</span> <span id="s1267">If you were a member of the party you had to report it, and that could be disastrous for us.</span> <span id="s1268">Well, they didn’t understand it, and you can explain it to them, but that’s the way of a traitor.</span> <span id="s1269">Sometimes they are forced when they are in the organization.</span> <span id="s1270">That was the same in Germany.</span> <span id="s1271">When you were in the party, you were forced to be -- more or less to be a -- an informer.</span> <span id="s1272">We had the same in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: And what were you doing from early morning until 10 o’clock at night?</span> <span id="s1274">Were you actually going someplace to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Oh -- meeting people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: All day.</span> <span id="s1278">And we -- a couple of times my second in command, we had a apartment which we used in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable] so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and talk and do our passports.</span> <span id="s1279">We had a small -- we had a small office, which we had hired, so we have spent some time there.</span> <span id="s1280">And then when we had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also -- they used, very often -- the night, of course.</span> <span id="s1281">Sometimes it was daylight when we did our operations, but some -- usually nights.</span> <span id="s1282">And then the -- the place where I lived in for about a year, then the -- the lady there, she understood because whenever it was some noise in the town, I had been away.</span> <span id="s1283">So she said to me after the war that she thought that I maybe have carried -- carried the -- the -- the case for -- or the rucksack for the saboteur.</span> <span id="s1284">She thought I had been a helper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Helper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: But she never believed that I was the man, you see.</span> <span id="s1287">So it -- if -- she did never think that I was able to do any sabotage operations.</span> <span id="s1288">So I was an ordinary man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Tell me about your conversations when you would sit with your -- with your colleagues.</span> <span id="s1290">Were they practical conversations, were they political conversations, a combination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Well, it was very often not so -- I would say funny things, we were joking very often.</span> <span id="s1292">We had the -- the humor, very good.</span> <span id="s1293">And all kinds of jokes were very popular and for instance, when I should meet with the whole group of let’s say six, seven, altogether, then we usually met at one of the big graveyards in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1294">There was no money -- n-no people there, you know.</span> <span id="s1295">And that could be a very good way.</span> <span id="s1296">It’s -- for instance, we never met in restaurants.</span> <span id="s1297">We didn’t never meet in cafés.</span> <span id="s1298">It was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s1299">We met in the open, and I can’t recall that the whole group ever met in one apartment.</span> <span id="s1300">Would be disastrous.</span> <span id="s1301">So sometimes then, communication between us could be difficult, because of that.</span> <span id="s1302">And that could -- could easily be some misunderstandings.</span> <span id="s1303">So when we had one operation, we -- the first time the man that should help us, he had -- he had overslept.</span> <span id="s1304">So he didn’t show up, and we couldn't go because he had the fuse.</span> <span id="s1305">Next time, he forgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with him, I’ve never been so angry in my life, I think.</span> <span id="s1306">So, things like that could happen [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1307">But was -- then made it more -- more simple, more so the nerves could help out with -- they would have -- some had difficulties with their nerves, of course, but I had the -- we had about 15 operations in ’44, and then one of the fellows, he said, well, he s -- what will happen here?</span> <span id="s1308">Can we come into trouble and get shot, or something.</span> <span id="s1309">Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with us.</span> <span id="s1310">I had had so much luck, every time, and th-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 15 successful operations.</span> <span id="s1311">So in a way, it was dangerous to think that way, but I had the luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1313">So how would you communicate when you were going to do an operation, or you had a task that someone should do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: -- how would you get the word out so that people would know to meet you in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Oh, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1317">Telephones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Telephones were not tapped in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1320">I think the reason why they couldn’t tap all telephones, they had the -- the -- Germans had the technicians, they had it, but they were dependent on Norwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all over you know.</span> <span id="s1321">They call all -- these telephone boxes were different places.</span> <span id="s1322">I don’t think they found any technician that was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1323">So they didn’t think of it, and they had thought they should do it, but they never did.</span> <span id="s1324">So you could use the telephone, but of course you wouldn’t say, now we are going to have sabotage.</span> <span id="s1325">You didn’t say that, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a shop because I got any more bread, or maybe a little goat cheese.</span> <span id="s1326">That’s Norwegian usually.</span> <span id="s1327">So, telephone was very much used.</span> <span id="s1328">Then, that day, they were [indecipherable] then we met, and I had all the information, all the intelligence, because I had been round there.</span> <span id="s1329">I -- I could be always in the open, I was there [indecipherable] it.</span> <span id="s1330">So what important in any military operation is intelligence before, and -- and intelligence very often can be wrong.</span> <span id="s1331">But I could go there and see with my own eyes that it -- it was like that.</span> <span id="s1332">So that was a ve-very important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: But made out on the telephone, very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Let me go back to January 1943.</span> <span id="s1336">The -- apparently the -- the Gestapo was hunting for you, and you -- there was an incident when you came back to the apartment in which you were staying.</span> <span id="s1337">Could you describe that incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes, how -- how would I know that I was wanted?</span> <span id="s1339">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1340">For -- when they had the -- when that fellow had given up my name, real name, I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1341">So I had, at that time, about seven different hiding places.</span> <span id="s1342">I had -- in the town, so I could use several -- several around the town.</span> <span id="s1343">And then at one of these places I had a small house I had hired, or my friend, as a matter of fact, in -- small house in the gas station, you know, slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of the police, and -- and then the -- I didn’t know a thing, I came in from -- I’d been in the woods, I think had the little weekend, which I had in the middle of the week.</span> <span id="s1344">So I came in, it was dark, and then when I came to the house, I thought -- everything had to be blinded at that time, every house, everything that no light should come out because of air raids, so on.</span> <span id="s1345">So -- but I thought it wasn’t well done in a way.</span> <span id="s1346">I felt something must be wrong.</span> <span id="s1347">So I didn’t put the key in the door, then I would just be shot, because there was some people waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1348">And I r-read about this afterwards, because Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he wrote the report about this.</span> <span id="s1349">And he was very, very angry with the people sitting there, because I dis -- I just -- they didn’t catch me.</span> <span id="s1350">I -- I rang the bell.</span> <span id="s1351">Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do.</span> <span id="s1352">And the -- the door was thrown open -- open immediately and I -- there was a -- I got a pistol right in my face.</span> <span id="s1353">And the -- h-he asked me to come in, and I said, to hell I don’t want to come in here.</span> <span id="s1354">And I saw two Germans, in -- gendarmes wer -- they were, and with gun -- with rifles, and then he -- I tried to get my pistol, but then he -- that pistol was right in my face.</span> <span id="s1355">So I just -- when he yell at me to come in, I said to hell I want to, and I hit the pistol, and the -- he -- the shot went in the air and then the -- I jumped out in the dark, and the two Germans shot, they all missed.</span> <span id="s1356">So then the -- I knew it was people there, that -- I knew it was people that didn’t like me.</span> <span id="s1357">So then I went to the second, it was only a hundred yards away, my second place.</span> <span id="s1358">Then started shooting there, then I got away there, and then the -- my es -- taxi driver who drove me at that time, he said -- he said, “I-I don’t think you should go to any of these places.”</span> <span id="s1359">I said, “I have to see at least one more, then I know they are sitting everywhere, but I have to.”</span> <span id="s1360">And when I came down to that flat, they had put a safety chain inside, so I was warned.</span> <span id="s1361">So I got away there.</span> <span id="s1362">But then he -- my -- my taxi driver ans -- he said, no, no, no, please no more.</span> <span id="s1363">So I then found an -- a new -- brand new place, and had a good night’s sleep, no trouble.</span> <span id="s1364">So -- but that -- that night, many, many people are arrested, because it was [indecipherable] all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Why wasn’t two times enough for you?</span> <span id="s1366">Why did you have to try the third?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Well, I had to know, are they sitting everywhere?</span> <span id="s1368">What about the rest of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: And -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: I had to.</span> <span id="s1371">I tho -- I had thought so, I had to be safe, that they were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1372">Then I was pretty sure they were.</span> <span id="s1373">And this guards, they were -- got into very big trouble in front of the Gestapo chief.</span> <span id="s1374">They really got hell, because they had the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Because they missed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1377">And h-he said in his report, the worst thing isn’t that they missed him, but they didn’t report to me, so I lost -- I lost the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1378">If they had reported immediately, we could have gone to some other places and got him, but they didn’t dare to tell me that they had lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: So it was a good thing [indecipherable] frightened by the Gestapo chief, and they got hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: So tell me a couple of things.</span> <span id="s1382">How did you find a hiding place that night?</span> <span id="s1383">You had seven beautiful --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah, I knew -- I knew about the merchant -- haberdasher, by the way, and I knew he was good -- or a good man, so I went up to his place, and I said I wanted to -- I was welcomed immediately.</span> <span id="s1385">So you would all -- in a country like ours, we know all -- most people, anti-Nazis, you would be supported.</span> <span id="s1386">But it was also a chance that they could have been all of -- arrested before that.</span> <span id="s1387">You could go right into the place.</span> <span id="s1388">But you had the -- you needed luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Was this a circumstance where you dropped a book?</span> <span id="s1390">Your diary, or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Oh yes, I -- I lost that in that little house, and -- but I s -- I knew I had put na -- two names on that notebook, so I put on some other clothes and after half an hour I went back there.</span> <span id="s1392">I knew they wouldn’t start over again, lost -- they lost track of me.</span> <span id="s1393">So I just went right in -- almost outside and found it.</span> <span id="s1394">Two days later, they -- it -- you had to try to think rationally, to say, why -- why should I keep staying there?</span> <span id="s1395">I had disappeared, why should I -- well, then you could be safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Did they chase you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yes, but that would be done in that minute.</span> <span id="s1398">But I disappeared in the darkness, it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Were you afraid at all that -- at that moment when they shot -- shot at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Well, I was -- I was angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: You were angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1403">I -- of course, yes [indecipherable] stupid people.</span> <span id="s1404">They started up this.</span> <span id="s1405">And I had no respect for that fellow that came up there, I -- and we’re -- I -- I saw he was nervous, could see it immediately, he’s standing with a pistol like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1406">Very few people are quiet in that moment, I’m pretty sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: So is that why it was so -- easier for you to hit his arm --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: -- because he in fact was shaking [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yes, a-and it was within my reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: That’s not a good thing to do when you’re try to hold up a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Now, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1414">You were suspicious when you walked -- this wasn’t outside, you were -- you have to go inside to the apartment, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: No, no, the stair --</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Or was it outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: -- it was a small house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: The stairs, right into the open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: So I was standing in front there, it was a little opened, just a little wa -- jump down three stairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: So if you were suspicious, why did you ring the bell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Well, I wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s1424">I had a feeling, and you couldn’t stop there, you had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: You had to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: You had to know.</span> <span id="s1427">I could have been wrong, I could have been -- I was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: So, did this mean -- this set of circumstances mean that Fehmer, the -- the Gestapo head knew more than you had thought he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: So you have -- so now you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: But he knew -- he knew more or less that I knew most people in the -- the leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: He knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And he now had your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: But he called -- he called me a -- he thought I was a spy, no, and -- an English spy or -- or from the government that had left Norway, which was bad enough for him.</span> <span id="s1436">So -- but when he lost track, he -- he -- then he had my father, he thought that was good enough to stop me.</span> <span id="s1437">But I don’t know if he -- but I -- he didn’t have any [indecipherable] about me really, until we met after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1439">Were you able to keep track of your father when he was sent to the concentration camp and hear how he was, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Yeah, and the thing was that he was sent to a concentration camp in Oslo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: -- outside Oslo.</span> <span id="s1443">So I knew when the car -- they were put to some work in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1444">So I knew he was coming with that car, but with German guards, of course.</span> <span id="s1445">I had to be way out of sight of it.</span> <span id="s1446">So I knew that.</span> <span id="s1447">And my -- I had to try to convince my mother that I was in England.</span> <span id="s1448">So I corresponded with her through Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1449">So she got letters from a relative in Stockholm, saying that she used another name -- name for a girl.</span> <span id="s1450">And she -- I wrote her, she knew it was from me, from England.</span> <span id="s1451">I was in Oslo, but I pretended so she -- I tried to make her believe that I was in England.</span> <span id="s1452">But at one time she came to the bakery.</span> <span id="s1453">I almost met her in the stairs, but she was sitting in this next room in the bakery [indecipherable] face, all the time.</span> <span id="s1454">Sh -- I was in the next room.</span> <span id="s1455">But that was just what could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: And you didn’t want her to know because you didn’t want her to be afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Exactly, exactly, and get mixed into it.</span> <span id="s1458">But first of all, they were afraid, you know, what will happen.</span> <span id="s1459">So that was an idea to keep that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: And the Nazis never picked up these letters, the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: They’d never detected anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Well, they had the -- the first night she was in the -- when I worked these different places, they were there -- she stayed at one of these places, and the Gestapo came there during the night, and so he met my mother.</span> <span id="s1464">He knew it was my mother, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Fehmer met her, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Yeah, Fehmer himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: The Gestapo chief, he came himself to that place, and -- i-in the night.</span> <span id="s1469">Early -- usually like came three, four o’clock in the morning so they could do that, p-people wouldn’t wake up, and her -- the friend that she was with, she was taken to the -- the concentration camp for about two years, but because Fehmer asked her did I ever come there, and she said no.</span> <span id="s1470">And then he -- for that lie, you will be -- come to prison, he said.</span> <span id="s1471">But my wife was -- my -- my mother was left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Why do you think that was the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Well, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Do you think your father was enough for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Yeah, he -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1476">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: And what was the name of the camp, was -- wa -- that your father was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: That was Grini.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Grini, G-r-i-n-i, Grini.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Concentration camp, a -- right outside Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Now, when did you figure out that this man named Monsen was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: An informer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: An informer.</span> <span id="s1486">Was that around this time?</span> <span id="s1487">After your father was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1489">He was sent out, and was done in a very smart way by the security pol-police.</span> <span id="s1490">They were -- the Germans were all afraid of all kinds of sicknesses, so they put people in showers, to have bath or showers, always.</span> <span id="s1491">So they had a man, wa -- one of the prisoners were heading in a bath, taking care of all that.</span> <span id="s1492">They put in an informer who took care of all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1493">And of course prisoners would think [indecipherable] why don’t you talk to my -- he’s also a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1494">So they gave him two, three, names.</span> <span id="s1495">A friend of mine was given up, a-and he -- then he was -- came out from prison, pretended they were releasing him.</span> <span id="s1496">So he came up to that [indecipherable] that he had heard that from other prisoners, of course, because they believed in him.</span> <span id="s1497">He was just one of them.</span> <span id="s1498">So they got a telephone, and he telephoned my friend, and he wanted to meet my friend, and we had to meet him, because it could be very valuable information from other prisoner friends.</span> <span id="s1499">So we had to take a chance.</span> <span id="s1500">Of course, we didn’t know exactly how it was, but it could happen.</span> <span id="s1501">So we met him in the evening, outside in Oslo, about eight o’clock in the evening, very dark in winter.</span> <span id="s1502">And he started to tell us greetings from two people, which were -- later, by the way, died in Germany, in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1503">One was a [indecipherable] manager in Shell company, and then -- but we -- we just didn’t -- we had a feeling that he was not in the resistance movement, we had a -- the way he said it, then we understood that -- we were pretty sure that he was an informer.</span> <span id="s1504">So Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he was reporting this afterwards, we have it in his report.</span> <span id="s1505">And he -- he said that the -- the man was stupid, and my -- my man, he was stupid enough to give up his telephone number.</span> <span id="s1506">And that cost him his life.</span> <span id="s1507">So we won at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: So you had Monsen killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: And who did -- who shot him?</span> <span id="s1511">[indecipherable] I don’t know whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: What a</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: -- was he shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yeah, he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: He was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Part of the group.</span> <span id="s1517">Some other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: And is this in the open, or do they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: No, at night.</span> <span id="s1520">They went into his bi -- apartment at night, because they had -- had his telephone number, they could find his address.</span> <span id="s1521">Otherwise he had -- could have told -- he didn’t get any names from us, but he was very, very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: How does one make a decision as to who will assassinate the informer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Well, if he hadn’t been taken that evening, it had been too late, next morning it would -- he would report to Fehmer and he would say maybe and maybe could come with some tracks, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: No, what I mean is how do you decide who’s going to kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Oh well, that was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Is -- there’s a volun --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: -- oh, it had to be one of the -- they were disciplined, they had -- they knew what it cost.</span> <span id="s1528">So one of the group would get that order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: But they -- it wouldn’t be voluntary necessarily, it would be, you should be the one to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: -- yes, it could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Of course, if you had said, but th -- I knew.</span> <span id="s1535">This was part of the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Of the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: That was our enemies.</span> <span id="s1538">When you are in -- at the front, you see the enemy over there, but here is -- you don’t see him, you just feel him, you -- it’s much more difficult.</span> <span id="s1539">So it’s just a -- a s -- German soldiers fire at American soldiers, just that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Did you -- was it -- was there ever a circumstance where -- where people doing that -- it was -- afterwards they suffered a great deal, even though they knew they were killing someone who was an enemy, it was -- was it difficult for people to do it, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Well, I think for Norwegians it was.</span> <span id="s1542">And after the war, when I have been sitting in a -- in a official bureau, taking care of all the disabled veterans, and when we discussed this, if a man had -- had a very bad destiny, and needed a pension, for instance, a disabled person pension, then this would mean something, because of his nerves, that he had been through that.</span> <span id="s1543">It was mentioned as a very hard thing to do.</span> <span id="s1544">On the front it’s maybe a little different, but -- but you were also face to face in the front in a war, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: But this is more face to face, you’re going into somebody’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: -- apartment, into a living --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: -- it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: So, it was considered a very tough thing [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: In May of 1943, you’re -- you’re sent to Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Yes, for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Now, have you been trying to get to Britain for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: No, I hadn’t -- I hadn’t time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: I had no time.</span> <span id="s1559">I had to do my ossage -- office job for them in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1560">But then when it was during the dark hours and days, it was easier, but then I was warned by the -- our secret -- we have also secret police agents, few of them, they ha -- they were a group, and they warned me, and they said, you better get out this summer.</span> <span id="s1561">They are after you all the time, so please get out of Norway for the summer.</span> <span id="s1562">Then I went over to Stockholm, and I was asked inter -- invited to come over to this special operations executive training camps, trained in that company, so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: That’s the SOE group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: -- yeah, and we then reached the independent company, number one, that was the name.</span> <span id="s1565">Also under Norwegian control.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: But when you go over there, they do a very heavy security check.</span> <span id="s1567">This is when you describe you’re writing down the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Yes, and I -- I could -- they -- they said to me, don’t use your name over here, it could be German spies.</span> <span id="s1569">So that -- they asked me to put ano -- another name, the Erling Fjeld name.</span> <span id="s1570">So I came over as Erling Fjeld, it was only two people in the British secret service that knew it -- security force, that knew who I was, and I -- so I had to pretend to be Erling Fjeld for six m -- four months.</span> <span id="s1571">Born in ’16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: 1916?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: So you’re a little old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: First March 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: That was the -- the date, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s1578">That wasn’t my real birthdate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1580">And where -- where was Erling born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: I was born in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: And my father, he had a -- a small shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: And I think his -- his wife -- and my mother was Margda, I thought that was a nice name, so I built up the whole thing there.</span> <span id="s1586">So I had to go back to swe -- to Norway, and then when I came to the border, Swedish border, I came there as a refugee called Erling Fjeld.</span> <span id="s1587">And then I was given the papers in Stockholm, and then I was wanted also in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1588">So that’s why I, in one of them, that Erling Fjeld picture, I put in -- on the scarf, and a couple of window glasses, and -- just to be safe, and I went through that control in Sweden without being discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Tell me, when you were in this training -- wa -- a few things I would like to know.</span> <span id="s1590">When you have this new identity, and you can create my father, my mother, where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: When people ask you things about your life, do you make up everything?</span> <span id="s1593">Wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: No, no, that you could use your ordinary life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Take -- pick another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: For instance, you could pick a town on the west coast, which was also industrial town, could have been just the same.</span> <span id="s1599">So you had to pick things that’s real so you -- you didn’t need to -- to make it up.</span> <span id="s1600">You tried to find things tha -- that was there.</span> <span id="s1601">So you couldn’t always -- that was the way to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Tell me about the training.</span> <span id="s1603">After a few weeks, you passed the security check, right?</span> <span id="s1604">And then in June, you go to Scotland, I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Yeah, and we had a training camp with only Norwegians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Only Norwegians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yeah, on that -- that camp.</span> <span id="s1608">The others were all people coming from all Europe, from occupied countries, but here we were together, and about 30 men for two months, very hard, tough training, day and night.</span> <span id="s1609">And we had learned all kinds of sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: That was the -- that was the point of the training --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: -- sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: -- by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: I had difficulties over there because I hadn’t the right discipline to be in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yes, can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: -- I had a little trouble there.</span> <span id="s1618">Well, I -- they didn’t know that I had been in the resistance movement for two, three years as one of the leaders.</span> <span id="s1619">They didn’t know that, they thought I was a young fellow coming.</span> <span id="s1620">Erling Fjeld, they never heard about him, so they tried to make him be a little more disciplined.</span> <span id="s1621">But I had difficulties.</span> <span id="s1622">I -- but a -- first of all, so I didn’t do very well in the s -- that school, but I had the best marks in sabotage.</span> <span id="s1623">I knew that was what I needed.</span> <span id="s1624">The rest of them, I could actually teach them.</span> <span id="s1625">So that’s why, between the leader and me it was a little trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: But your main purpose was to learn explosives --</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: -- anyway, so that you could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: The rest I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: I knew they couldn’t -- he couldn’t learn me anything.</span> <span id="s1632">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1633">And he didn’t know I had been in resistance for two and a half year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: And does he want you out of there?</span> <span id="s1635">Does he try and sort of flunk you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Yes, he said I wouldn’t -- I -- I couldn’t be used.</span> <span id="s1637">But when I came to London, I knew, of course, so -- so it’s not often that it -- it -- it -- use -- useful man can be a good -- good pupil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: And who -- you had a friend, how -- Haugland is his name, Knut?</span> <span id="s1639">Who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Yes, I had a very good friend from my hometown.</span> <span id="s1641">He was later on the wireless operator on the Kon-Tiki fleet, the raft.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: A -- a what kind of operator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: He was wireless operator together with [indecipherable] later on, because he needed some relaxation after the war, because he had so much headache.</span> <span id="s1644">So he joined [indecipherable] on the Kon-Tiki.</span> <span id="s1645">He lost all his troubles with -- after that trip with the raft, Kon-Tiki.</span> <span id="s1646">So Knut and I, we were close friends from Rjukan, and then he knew me, of course, he knew my name and everything.</span> <span id="s1647">So he helped the leadership in England to get me over, because to send people back, it cost lots of money, you know, it -- it -- you had to send what they pretend to be the best.</span> <span id="s1648">So -- but the leadership in London, they -- they knew, so they wanted me to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: It wasn’t so easy to get back though, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: No, it was -- you had to really -- you know, they put up a plane, it was terribly expensive, was a big thing, you know, a four engine bomber, Halifax bomber, or could be an [indecipherable] American, and sent back to Norway.</span> <span id="s1651">So they had to try to find the best to send, or the ones they knew could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: So you parachuted back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yes, back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: -- after a couple tries, back into --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: And you parachuted with weapons, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: With all kinds of weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: And I had Knut, we came together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: You and Knut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Knut Haugland, and we had in our planes, we had a -- almost two tons of weapons with us, in small parachutes that was dropped together with us, two tons of weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: And where in Norway would they be dropped?</span> <span id="s1663">Towards the coast?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: That was the very -- in the middle of Norway, called -- a very neat place called Kongsberg.</span> <span id="s1665">And then I dropped right there in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: And there there were people -- agents who were picking these things up, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yes, we did that, we had some of the farmers came with sledges, you know, in winter and picked them up by horses, sledges.</span> <span id="s1668">And they had them down to -- to the road, the main road, where we could pick them up.</span> <span id="s1669">For instance, in my way I -- I had the very close friend in the -- in the gas company, and we had their truck, their tank truck, and we filled -- put all the weapons in that truck -- tank wagon, and people -- when we came running, came on the road, they didn’t believe it could be weapons on the tank, you know, in the tank.</span> <span id="s1670">Thought it was gasoline, so now we could be fooling the Germans, not the opposite.</span> <span id="s1671">So some fun -- sometimes we’re -- we’re the cat, and then they’re mices.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: So when you ga -- came back, once -- did you go back to Oslo after you had parachuted into Kongsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yes, I go -- went immediately back, and I did nothing in the first two weeks.</span> <span id="s1674">I want to get to know a -- all -- to be -- find out what had happened, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: So were you away for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yeah, then I had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Almost a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: No, I had been away for -- for five months, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1681">So now I was back where I could -- I really liked to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: So after a couple of weeks, did you make the first decision about the first sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Yeah, I stayed two -- two weeks before, so I get used to the climate.</span> <span id="s1684">A clam -- a clam -- a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1685">So I knew then I could start again.</span> <span id="s1686">Met my people, what’s the situation now, where are the controls, how can you -- where can you stay, where -- what can you do?</span> <span id="s1687">I was -- so I was just relaxing there for 14 days, then I could start over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: And where did you stay?</span> <span id="s1689">Did you get a new set of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: You know, then I stayed with a -- a doctor at one of the hospitals, big hospitals.</span> <span id="s1691">And then I -- I was to find a place for my friend, Knut Haugland as a wireless operator.</span> <span id="s1692">So he’s put -- came to that same hospital, a -- he took over my place, and he was in -- sending all his messages on the top floor of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1693">And then I found some other places, new places, another five, 10 new places where I can disappear completely, and -- under some name, some new name, could be Knutsen too.</span> <span id="s1694">That’s why one day we were very, very -- little stupid, because we had both put the name Knutsen.</span> <span id="s1695">So when I met my friend, he said to me, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s1696">I said, “I’m Knutsen.”</span> <span id="s1697">“And I’m Knutsen.”</span> <span id="s1698">I said.</span> <span id="s1699">So then it was Knutsen one and Knutsen two.</span> <span id="s1700">But in -- in two months we had different names again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Was your first operation the bombing of the labor office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: No, it’s -- yeah, yeah, I would say so, it was the first where I was -- had that chance, and that was in open daylight.</span> <span id="s1703">You had --where they had conscripted the [indecipherable] meeting the next day, next morning, about nine o’clock and they wanted us to blow up the place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Can you expla --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: -- in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Can you explain why it was so important to -- to do something at the Labor Office?</span> <span id="s1707">What were the Nazis trying to do at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: See, they were trying to deal with a lot of Norwegians, several thousands, could be quite a percentage for all the youngsters.</span> <span id="s1709">And they wanted them to be conscripted for labor.</span> <span id="s1710">But it was a concealed conscription for army, for German army.</span> <span id="s1711">And the long week -- it was very hard to stop it, it was, of course that was sent over the radio, BBC radio, Norwegian broadcast to Norway, please don’t go in there, don’t -- don’t report.</span> <span id="s1712">But if they didn’t report, they -- all the youth, 18 -- between 18 and 22, they would be fetched -- they would be taken by the police, would -- could be shot or put in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1713">So it didn’t help them to refuse.</span> <span id="s1714">But in Oslo they were supposed to meet 3,000 in ’44, spring ’44, 19th May, they were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s1715">18th, the day before, I was asked -- it was my first job, I was asked to -- they ene -- in the evening, same evening, blow up the office, and it was in -- in Norway it’s very light in May, it’s -- almost all night.</span> <span id="s1716">So about eight o’clock in the evening we went up there, and had a -- some explosives, 14 pounds of explosives.</span> <span id="s1717">And then we just -- in a small parcel.</span> <span id="s1718">And then th -- we thought it was very easy to do this, but it was about 20 people working overtime, because they should have 3,000 people next morning.</span> <span id="s1719">So I said to my friend, I cannot kill these people, I don’t -- we cannot do that, that’s not our job.</span> <span id="s1720">Our job is to ruin it.</span> <span id="s1721">So I shouted -- went up to -- in the house, and I shouted as high as I could, get the hell out of there.</span> <span id="s1722">Two minutes the house will be -- the whole thing will be blown up.</span> <span id="s1723">And they all got out in a split second, more or less.</span> <span id="s1724">All of them.</span> <span id="s1725">And when we came out, it was only less than one minute before it exploded, so -- then the next morning, nobody could meet there.</span> <span id="s1726">I had a feeling that the -- I’d heard from some historians that three people went instead of 3,000.</span> <span id="s1727">And they had troubles because the stairs wasn’t there any more.</span> <span id="s1728">So we were lucky.</span> <span id="s1729">And this helped.</span> <span id="s1730">Next day they knew three -- 3,000 should meet, but they had no place to meet.</span> <span id="s1731">So that was start, we made several sabotage operations s-so we could help this, and it was stopped, finally.</span> <span id="s1732">After six months, they gave up.</span> <span id="s1733">So we -- we sent a ti -- sent in 5,000 youngsters [indecipherable] means quite a lot to people [indecipherable] three million.</span> <span id="s1734">Quite a big percentage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Were there a number of sabota -- was the Labor Office in Oslo the major --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: -- center?</span> <span id="s1738">But there must have been centers all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: No -- yeah, that was always done.</span> <span id="s1740">But no -- Oslo was so terribly important, because everything was centerized.</span> <span id="s1741">The politicians today say -- they complain that we are centerized today, but at that time it was all centerized.</span> <span id="s1742">Every town in Norway, if they needed even change their house, you had to go right to the -- to the headquarters in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1743">So it meant so much.</span> <span id="s1744">So this was mostly done in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: So it meant very much for the whole country.</span> <span id="s1747">You could use a telephone all over the country.</span> <span id="s1748">So it spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: That somebody was now hitting the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: And they were disappearing, hitting, ruining for them, and disappeared, all the time.</span> <span id="s1753">So of course it was -- was not very nice for the Gestapo, really.</span> <span id="s1754">They got into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Okay, we’ll take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Mr. Sonsteby, before we go on and talk about some other sabotage operations, let’s get a picture of how many Germans there are to every Norwegian in -- in the country at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: We were, at that time, three million people.</span> <span id="s1760">And we had in from ’42 - ’43, we had about 250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops.</span> <span id="s1761">It was 10 percent of all the population.</span> <span id="s1762">And if you take the age of -- the military age, which was an important 17 - 18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in southern Norway it was about three Germans to a Norwegian.</span> <span id="s1763">And in north Norway, very little -- it was not so many people, we had -- it could be about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age group.</span> <span id="s1764">So [indecipherable] swarmed in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: So when you were walking around in Oslo during your daily meetings --</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: -- did you always see a lot of troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Oh yes, all the time.</span> <span id="s1769">But I didn’t care, I thought that they didn’t touch me, and I didn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s1770">So, just like that, especially you were always -- all the controls, you know, and when you consider Norwegians, they were being traitors, they had the -- some of them had the control.</span> <span id="s1771">They were one man with a machine pistol, and it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with rifles.</span> <span id="s1772">And then you were stopped, they looked in your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what do you call these small things you have?</span> <span id="s1773">Suitcases, and briefcases and looked through them, opened.</span> <span id="s1774">And if you saw them, and you tried to get away, and you didn’t stop, you would be shot.</span> <span id="s1775">They shot immediately these youngsters, young Norwegians.</span> <span id="s1776">That was very bad to see, you know.</span> <span id="s1777">And they were Nazis and they didn't understand what they did.</span> <span id="s1778">So it could even be on the [indecipherable] gosh that man -- if you then just moved another, they would stop you.</span> <span id="s1779">And if you didn’t stop immediately, got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: A -- A few weeks after you bombed the Labor Office, you were supposed to blow up an insurance company building, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Well, they used some kind of a -- in order to call in people, they had to use what you call -- I won’t -- I don’t know what you call it in English, but all the insurance companies had -- is a kind of starting up of data system.</span> <span id="s1782">They could sort out things on new machines from the States.</span> <span id="s1783">And it was, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM.</span> <span id="s1784">At that time in Norway, it had another name, the company, and they had these machines.</span> <span id="s1785">And these machines were now put in to sort out people to find the addresses.</span> <span id="s1786">They were sorted like anything is.</span> <span id="s1787">It was a first kind of data -- data machine, I think, data.</span> <span id="s1788">And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government, they wanted to use this.</span> <span id="s1789">I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start.</span> <span id="s1790">So the first -- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice shop in Oslo, and one morning we heard that it -- they will be taken over by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1791">So the day before, we came there, and we had a big stone through the window, and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no more after a minute.</span> <span id="s1792">Then we disappeared completely.</span> <span id="s1793">The next day they -- we had forgotten a big machine up in the insurance company.</span> <span id="s1794">And then we had got the new order to go up there and take that.</span> <span id="s1795">And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog.</span> <span id="s1796">Now they were sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody could come there.</span> <span id="s1797">So it was impossible, but we found a new way.</span> <span id="s1798">If it had been now we would have maybe used a helicopter, but you didn’t have helicopter at that time, so we had to crawl over three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the -- there we knew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the room where the fella -- the employees had their meal.</span> <span id="s1799">And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive, that would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then went into the streets about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over town during the night.</span> <span id="s1800">Also because of these sabotage operations.</span> <span id="s1801">If we came into the street, we would be arrested immediately, our age.</span> <span id="s1802">So we wen-went into the next building and had a fine view to where the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn’t want to take lives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you’d better get out.</span> <span id="s1803">And they knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1804">And next morning they couldn’t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was a very important thing.</span> <span id="s1805">We didn’t lose people, I didn’t lose any of my men, and it was a -- should called a success.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: You must have driven them crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: I think it was not so easy to bear.</span> <span id="s1808">Not to find a track, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1809">And of course it meant that the people also, they didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1810">They knew they had -- shouldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1811">Of course it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in the district and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that’s done this.</span> <span id="s1812">So -- but it was very popular, of course, within the population because they knew it was a fight towards the Gestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young persons.</span> <span id="s1813">So in -- in the course of ’44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped.</span> <span id="s1814">They gave up.</span> <span id="s1815">And another thing, politically, Germans sometimes found that these Norwegian Nazis weren't always so good.</span> <span id="s1816">So they were -- they were now annoyed that they didn’t make it and put [indecipherable] Gestapo in trouble.</span> <span id="s1817">So they were -- it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between the Germans and the Nazi Norwegians.</span> <span id="s1818">That could also be a point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Now, I guess it was about a month later, in the Lysaker factory, there -- you -- you blew up, was June 28th, 1944, there was another bombing that you did.</span> <span id="s1820">Was it following that that the Nazis retaliated in terms of the ration cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Yes, every Norwegian over 16 years old had to have a ration card.</span> <span id="s1822">And then these youngsters, they were all -- they were all refused to fetch the cards.</span> <span id="s1823">And then we -- I was asked to steal a few, to real -- make it a hold-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Now wait a minute, wait a minute, ex -- go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: What were -- what were the Nazis doing with the cards that if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: They refused to give the cards to -- to the youngsters of 18 - 19 - 20 - 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Because they wanted to conscript them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Then they would have to report.</span> <span id="s1832">If they didn’t get a card, they had to report, that was the way.</span> <span id="s1833">\</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: And then I was asked to -- to put up a hold up, to take over 75,000 ration -- ration cards, and that was one and a half ton.</span> <span id="s1836">So it was not a pocket theft, it was a real [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1837">So we -- it was coming out from the printing shop with guards, the whole truck, and we stopped it.</span> <span id="s1838">In Norway y-you have a han -- it’s right driving you know, we have left and right, Norway was right.</span> <span id="s1839">And then you can stop the car.</span> <span id="s1840">My car came and stopped the other one, because it had stopped because of the right of way.</span> <span id="s1841">So then we -- I took over the car.</span> <span id="s1842">I just opened the front door of the truck and said, let me have a place here, I don’t want to sit here in front.</span> <span id="s1843">So I put my gun in the side of the watchman, of the guard, and he moved immediately.</span> <span id="s1844">And at the same time, two of my friends went up on the -- on the platform, on the truck, where it was two other guards, so the car was ours.</span> <span id="s1845">We took it over, the whole thing, with the one and a half ton of ration cards.</span> <span id="s1846">That was -- then we met another car, which I didn’t know the number plates, I didn’t know anything, I knew exact at 9:30 we will meet another car, I stopped there, and i -- all ration card got taken over to the other truck, and that disappeared.</span> <span id="s1847">If we were now arrested or taken, we didn’t know where to find the cards.</span> <span id="s1848">They could have tortured us, but we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1849">That was also important at that time.</span> <span id="s1850">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: So then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Then the -- some of our leaders, they had a telephone to the authorities, one way line.</span> <span id="s1853">And the-they told the authorities, now we have -- we have the cards, we want to make a deal with you.</span> <span id="s1854">And they say, what’s your -- what’s your address?</span> <span id="s1855">Well, we haven’t got any address.</span> <span id="s1856">What’s your telephone?</span> <span id="s1857">We haven’t got any telephone.</span> <span id="s1858">But we want you to give a new order that the youngsters should have the cards -- have their ration cards.</span> <span id="s1859">And th -- how -- why did they give in?</span> <span id="s1860">Yes, they gave in because at this time, Germans were building up that most important fort in Europe.</span> <span id="s1861">That’s the strongest fort in Norway -- Norway from this time on.</span> <span id="s1862">So if it had been an invasion, had been terrible to take back Norway.</span> <span id="s1863">Would have cost millions, maybe.</span> <span id="s1864">And then we said, we are going to send these cards all over, sell them to make the black market way and it will ruin your situation, the whole station here.</span> <span id="s1865">What about people working on your fortress, and all that?</span> <span id="s1866">They would have no -- no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s1867">It would be terrible.</span> <span id="s1868">It would ruin the whole situation here.</span> <span id="s1869">And then the Nazi government, Norwegian, they had to give in, because the Germans would be furious if their laborers, all those, didn’t get any food at all, it will stop all work.</span> <span id="s1870">So they gave in.</span> <span id="s1871">We had won.</span> <span id="s1872">That was in September ’44.</span> <span id="s1873">They tried once more to conscript the lady -- the women, but that didn’t work at all.</span> <span id="s1874">So we didn't hear any more.</span> <span id="s1875">And our office, without address, without telephones, just disappeared from the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1878">Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them.</span> <span id="s1879">I didn’t do that part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: But that giving back process could also be dangerous because they could then catch the group</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000 cards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up outside the bank, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous explosives.</span> <span id="s1884">And it was put round in Oslo and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi police, and they didn’t dare to touch them.</span> <span id="s1885">So they sent for a company outside, an -- German specialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration -- ration cards.</span> <span id="s1886">So we had a little fun also.</span> <span id="s1887">But of course we were -- man -- many people into this, and -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Now, in s -- in August of 1944, there was a bombing at Korzewall, with the airplane parts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Yes, that was an important place, it was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it with a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in Norway.</span> <span id="s1890">And half of it was put into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for fighter planes, Messerschmitt.</span> <span id="s1891">And they had also a-about -- about 20 fuselage that was there, to put -- put up to the airport later on, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we had to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it.</span> <span id="s1892">So then we went in there, and the part -- the Norwegian part was no guarded, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s1893">Was one guard, which I by the way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him.</span> <span id="s1894">And then we went in there and then went into the German part in the basement, through three fences, and put down about 300 pounds of dynamite.</span> <span id="s1895">We blew up the whole place.</span> <span id="s1896">And I think it wasn’t very nice for them to use their spare parts in Norway.</span> <span id="s1897">And the same had to be done with ball bearing.</span> <span id="s1898">Ball bearing was terribly important for any nation.</span> <span id="s1899">And Swedish -- Sweden had the best ball bearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in Oslo, which was also blown up.</span> <span id="s1900">Another thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk about submarines.</span> <span id="s1901">Submarines use batteries.</span> <span id="s1902">Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid.</span> <span id="s1903">And we had two of them in Norway, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the submarines was to ruin these two acid factories, and they were stopped.</span> <span id="s1904">So they couldn’t produce any more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, because at the coastline in Norway, during the war you could hide every nation’s fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords.</span> <span id="s1905">You could have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords.</span> <span id="s1906">And they did, of course, all those submarines, they disappeared in Norwegian fjords.</span> <span id="s1907">So they were -- it was very important to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries.</span> <span id="s1908">Then you had to have experts to help you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1909">But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless operator on the heavy water operation, and on my hometown.</span> <span id="s1910">And so he had a [indecipherable] experience.</span> <span id="s1911">Two s-s-small town -- two small town boys were also there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: You said you pacified the guard.</span> <span id="s1913">Is that another word for killing him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Just to hold him up, and just keep watching him, or one man had to watch him all the time.</span> <span id="s1917">But the trouble with that, of course, if he doesn’t start screaming.</span> <span id="s1918">And people maybe done that, without helping it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: So that could be a -- then, when you hear about guards being -- you can shoot him, because of the noise.</span> <span id="s1921">So when you hear about that, it’s a -- a necessity, because they can give a noise, scream or something like that, but he -- luckily he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1922">So he was a -- sent out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Afterwards.</span> <span id="s1925">So we tried to be very careful with the civilian at all.</span> <span id="s1926">It was not our -- we were no terrorists.</span> <span id="s1927">The Germans called us, of course, terrorists, but I -- I -- I don’t know any type or [indecipherable] which was terrorism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: And in that operation at the air -- at Korzewall, there were cleaning women who used [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Yes, that was another difficult thing, of course, when you come into a place like that, if you had -- if you had the cleaning womens and I had pacify them in a way that -- I said that we were now -- you know, on all buses, you have different advertising, and I said I was a painter, so I should paint some of the buses with the -- and they believed me.</span> <span id="s1930">I -- I looked very innocent, and they said, he’s a nice painter.</span> <span id="s1931">So then I -- then I -- when I saw all the explosives being carried in, I said, this is meat.</span> <span id="s1932">So this is -- go to your -- your people in the -- with all the buses [indecipherable] it will be fine.</span> <span id="s1933">So they believed me, but when they talked, and -- but then I had to tell them, I’m very sorry, but it -- now it will be blown up, you come with us.</span> <span id="s1934">So -- but they could stop the whole operation, you know, if they had started.</span> <span id="s1935">So that was not a way to be innocent, try to make people believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: And what was their response when you said to them, essentially, I was lying to you, it’s now going to be blown up, get out.</span> <span id="s1937">Were they angry at you, were they frightened of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Oh no, they were frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: They were frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: Like hell, of course, which is understandable, under -- but they got out.</span> <span id="s1941">They couldn't -- nobody hurt them afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: They couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1944">But people, when they see and hear about explosions, you know, fuses burning, it’s very understandable that they are frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: It’s -- it’s a good thing, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Were you with Haugland at the heavy water operation, or no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: -- was he alone?</span> <span id="s1950">I mean, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: I was then in Oslo, and they were trained in -- specially on that target in England, by some Norwegian professors that had really installed the heavy water plant at Rjukan.</span> <span id="s1952">It’s part of the electr -- electrolyses.</span> <span id="s1953">That’s part of it, you get the heavy water from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: And was he hurt at that operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: No, no, he just -- he -- he was -- the operat -- operator [indecipherable] to keep the [indecipherable] London advised all the time, do they go in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: And then he had to keep away so he could, if they had been lost, he had the report, so he was keeping in touch with the -- England all the time, during operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: I wanted to ask you about one more sabotage before we went back to England, which -- your group became known as the Oslo gang --</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: -- right a-around this time, in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Or also detachment, I said the name then, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Detachment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Yeah, in Norway it’s a gang, see, which is -- can be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: -- misunderstood, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: But in England it was known as the Oslo detachment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: Yeah, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: -- was the British name for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: But you -- there was a decision made to destroy thousands of gallons of oil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary because -- especially the special oils for -- could be lubricating oils, which was very important, very scarce.</span> <span id="s1972">You know, the Germans, they really, in the last part, they had no lubricating oil, they had no gasoline, it was just -- some part of their Panzer, you know, couldn’t work because they hadn’t any more -- so that, it was very scarce.</span> <span id="s1973">So to ruin any gasoline tanks, or lubricating, was very important, that was part of how you could hit the Germans.</span> <span id="s1974">But as I said before, the real effort in Norway’s war was the sailors and the -- or that was the real thing, but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in Norway would, of course help -- help out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: So you destroyed about 50,000 gallons of oil in that operation, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Well, it could be, but it was more from the small groups, they did many, all over Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: On that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Not -- not on that day, but [indecipherable] occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: That was done by several groups.</span> <span id="s1983">So I -- I don’t know how much it would be, enormous.</span> <span id="s1984">It was ruined, especially all the stocks in Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Now why did you leave Oslo in November of 1944?</span> <span id="s1986">You went back to be more highly trained than you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in England, in London.</span> <span id="s1988">So I -- then I went over with a n -- third name.</span> <span id="s1989">My name was this time Harald Sorensen.</span> <span id="s1990">When I came to England I had good papers, when I came to the security police -- in England you can think in a wartime, security police, and I got in now a-at the thi -- in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s1991">So then it was a very few people that, of course -- in there, so we [indecipherable] that I was let in.</span> <span id="s1992">Could be a dangerous [indecipherable], I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1994">So you took a cour -- an STS 17 course, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Yeah, that means -- no, I didn’t, I -- I went up there because my course that had been before, so I just reported over there, to -- to try what happened, what about the experience did I have, with the things I had learned in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1996">So that was a special course in sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Now at -- during that period of time when you were in London, you met with the crown prince, and the king?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: That the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: And what was that meeting about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: The sa -- the king heard about this country, and of course he had not been in Norway for four winters now.</span> <span id="s2003">And when he heard that I was there for the -- number 24, he knew.</span> <span id="s2004">And then he asked me to come up to there to see him.</span> <span id="s2005">Of course, it was very nice to meet them.</span> <span id="s2006">And then the king said to me, “What’s your name today, Erling Fjeld?”</span> <span id="s2007">They laughed a little, you see, and then I said, “Now today, your majesty, my name is Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer.”</span> <span id="s2008">And he -- I -- if I had invite him to go back to the resistance in Norway, he may have followed.</span> <span id="s2009">But he was a tall man, so it would be really strange if you had seen the Norwegian king up and down the main street in Oslo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: But he -- he had really en-enjoy this, of course.</span> <span id="s2012">But on the other hand, if -- when we talk about Oslo and all, he was nearly crying.</span> <span id="s2013">It was very serious to him, but he couldn’t go back, and then -- but then after six months, in June ’45, he could go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: What was that like for you to sit with the king of your country?</span> <span id="s2015">Was that extraordinary?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Oh, very, very special, of course.</span> <span id="s2017">So I then didn’t realize it, I think, because all things were quite serious, so -- but it -- it was -- it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Was the crown prince there as well, during that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Not at that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: The other day.</span> <span id="s2022">I met him with the others.</span> <span id="s2023">Then he was commander in chief for all forces --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: For all forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: -- Norwegian forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: From that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Then you went back to Oslo in December of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Yes, with two new men, two new --</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: And is this a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: -- members from the Oslo detachment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: And what’s the situation for resistance when you come back?</span> <span id="s2033">I mean, is it harder, are the -- are the Germans being --</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Oh, it -- it was harder, and the Gestapo was very hard, it was -- it was terribly hard, terribly tough.</span> <span id="s2035">Many, many people are shot, many people are put in concentration camps and now we heard more than rumors what happened to them in Germany, but not exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s2036">We knew it was tough, but even in December we didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s2037">It wasn’t realized before the Americans came to the first camps.</span> <span id="s2038">So we -- we couldn’t believe it, and in, of course, summer, it was not easy because they knew I was one of their leaders, and I very often got telephones, have you heard from my s-son, have you -- have you -- my father, and -- and the -- it was about 10,000, you know, that’s -- for a nation of three millions, it’s quite a lot.</span> <span id="s2039">But it couldn’t -- some people -- some countries in Norway -- in Europe was worse, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Am -- am I correct that one of your last sabotage operations was March 1945, you call it the Operation Cement Mixer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: Yes, because the Germans really had a counterattack in the Ardennes [indecipherable] that often [indecipherable] it was called on, it was really tough, because it cost the allied -- I think one place you lost 75,000 Americans in that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2042">And lots of people, and then this will be reinforced by troops.</span> <span id="s2043">We had -- Hitler had fresh troops in Norway.</span> <span id="s2044">And he -- they had some of the troops that had left Finland -- you know, Finland turned around and kicked the German out, you know.</span> <span id="s2045">They came over to Norway, all of them, so it was some of the best armies in Germany, still, and now they shipped them down to Oslo, and shipped them over to -- soon as possible to Germany, to reinforce this offensive -- the [indecipherable] that offensive.</span> <span id="s2046">But then the order came out that try to ruin -- stop the railways, north - south going railways, try to sabotage it, try to derail trains and all that.</span> <span id="s2047">And then the [indecipherable] all the repair thing was done by -- by as -- the central office in Oslo.</span> <span id="s2048">To repair the railroads, there were all the people there, so then I was asked to blow up the whole administration building.</span> <span id="s2049">So it would ruin their effort to repair and build it up again.</span> <span id="s2050">And that was done, blown up, completely destroyed, all of it.</span> <span id="s2051">And then the [indecipherable] the gar -- it was guarded usually very well, it was about six, 10 guards there.</span> <span id="s2052">One man was sitting behind a glass door, but we got -- we got hold of him, and -- but he s -- started shouting, as I told you before, so I -- so we had to -- I was going to take him out -- outwards, but he shouted, tried to -- to warn the rest of the guard, but he -- then you had to -- of course, to shoot him, and the guards, you couldn’t think of those guards.</span> <span id="s2053">They had th -- but they were our enemies, all of them.</span> <span id="s2054">We hadn’t invited them to Norway.</span> <span id="s2055">So they say that we stopped about -- it was four divisions trying to be sent to Germany, and I think, I’m not sure historically that we stopped about two and a half division coming to reinforcement in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: And around the country they were blowing up railroad tracks and offices --</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: All the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: All over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: Yeah, all over, especially a train where railways were, so they derailed and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: And I guess timing here was very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Yeah, it’s true --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: -- significant, because whe -- of where the w -- the allies were coming, so they can more quickly stop --</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: -- and there was no chance to rebuild.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: And of course, the Germans, they came as a shock to the Germans because it was all done eight o’clock in the evening, 14th March ’45.</span> <span id="s2066">And by the way, on my father’s birthday.</span> <span id="s2067">So I -- it was a good gift, when he was in prison, it was a good gift to give.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: And did he find out about it while he was in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: -- I -- I doubt it, at that time.</span> <span id="s2072">He may have, a little later.</span> <span id="s2073">Rumors were going all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: The war ends May eighth, but on March sixth, the Oslo detachment or gang, and Milorg, go and get the archives, yes?</span> <span id="s2077">Two days before the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Yes, and then I was again, because a -- it -- German Gestapo and a Norwegian Nazis, that are burning all archives, started wi -- two, three days before the -- Norway was taken over, and then -- then we got the -- the order -- it was a order, we were under orders from the -- I got the order to try to -- try to st -- not to stop it, but to get hold of the archives, before they burnt them.</span> <span id="s2079">We were lucky, we went to the police department, and to the justice department.</span> <span id="s2080">And we had some secret agents there.</span> <span id="s2081">They picked up the most important and we took it all out on a big truck, four days before the -- Eisenhower said it’s over.</span> <span id="s2082">So it -- it meant quite a lot when we -- we had the names, all the Gestapos, we had the names of the -- many of the traitors, otherwise, they had been burned.</span> <span id="s2083">So they are still the archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Are they in the resistance museum, or are they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: No, they are taken over by the National Archives.</span> <span id="s2086">We have some very specially deep in the -- in the cellars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Now, on May eighth, y-you are made a captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Of what?</span> <span id="s2090">In the army, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: -- because our outfit, the Linge company, the special -- as I said, the -- the independent company, number one, and then the -- I talked to my friend in the -- that was head of the -- all the Milorg groups all over the country, 40,000.</span> <span id="s2094">And I said to him, “What shall I -- what am I now?”</span> <span id="s2095">You know, in England, they had the record, they didn’t know of Sonsteby.</span> <span id="s2096">They didn’t know any Sonsteby had been in the company.</span> <span id="s2097">They couldn’t do anything to him, they couldn’t give him a rank, you cannot give a false name the rank.</span> <span id="s2098">So Erling Fjeld didn’t get the rank.</span> <span id="s2099">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Sorensen didn’t get a rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: No, sor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Nordstrom didn’t get --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2104">So then the -- Haugland said okay [indecipherable] my friend, the leader.</span> <span id="s2105">Said, well I think you’re -- you’re a captain.</span> <span id="s2106">And then the -- afterwards the military off -- authorities, they had to find out what -- this Sonsteby has never been here in England, never been in this company.</span> <span id="s2107">So -- but, of course that was -- the result was that I was given that rank, but it had to come six months later, because they had to find my name, they had to do it all properly.</span> <span id="s2108">So I kept the title.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: So tell me, there are 40,000 men in Milorg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Not -- not in uniforms --</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: -- but they had all on [indecipherable] and when the Germans should give up, even in Norway, they said, we cannot surrender here, we cannot surrender our weapons.</span> <span id="s2115">It’s no allied [indecipherable] here, not one.</span> <span id="s2116">Then they got the message from Eisenhower personally, directly.</span> <span id="s2117">You can rest assured, you will meet 40,000 young men, they have no uniforms, but they have an [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2118">And then the German general said, what’s -- why [indecipherable] like this, we cannot give away our weapons to this.</span> <span id="s2119">Then Eisenhower sent a new message.</span> <span id="s2120">They are all disciplined, I can guarantee it, they have all weapons, they are very disciplined.</span> <span id="s2121">And then general, in the -- at the Lillehammer in Norway said okay, we -- then 300,000 Germans surrendered to 40,000 [indecipherable] all their weapons, artillery, everything.</span> <span id="s2122">So they had their -- it was necessary.</span> <span id="s2123">They were -- as we say in Norway, they were en -- on ort en stellar, as they say in German, they were in the right place at the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: And what about the other resistance groups, the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: Well, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Or the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: -- some of them went to the Milorg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: So -- so they had some sort, but it was very few, so they did -- I must say they did a very good job at trying to hurt the armies when they were there.</span> <span id="s2130">And -- but it was at this time, the whole leadership in the home front, I said, after four days, when the government delegation is here, you take over.</span> <span id="s2131">We withdraw.</span> <span id="s2132">And they all withdrew.</span> <span id="s2133">No trouble whatsoever in Norway, the government came and took over all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: And took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: They had never any trouble, no -- never any groups that didn’t follow orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Now, you guarded the crown prince when he came back on May -- in May -- June -- no, it’s May.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: Yeah, in -- in June, yeah, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Both -- both the crown prince, and the king when he came back later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Yeah, it’s a -- first the crown prince came back in 13 May in ’45, because he came back with the government delegation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: Half the government, because that had to take over as soon as possible, we wanted that.</span> <span id="s2144">And then they -- it was 10,000 Germans in Oslo, and the crown prince come -- came in there, and I was asked to -- was responsible for his life.</span> <span id="s2145">So then I put the whole group, this detachment, or gang, they were his bodyguard, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: We were about 20 of bodyguard, all the way -- when the royal family came back, they had the same.</span> <span id="s2148">So we were about 20 people having that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: And you were in the car, I believe, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Yes, first of all, when the Crown Prince came, we had another friend called Max Manus, which I thought was a little quicker than me, because I could be maybe -- he -- he was like a -- like a good horse, he was -- so I thought that -- we were so afraid there were hand grenade landing in the car, because the Germans were all around, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: And the crown prince wanted to come back in an open car, right, he didn’t want to have the closed car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Yes, yeah, and I had the discussion with him, but he -- just did -- didn’t -- only wanted an open car, but he sat on the top there, on the -- so he just didn’t care, but the fellow I had -- th-the chauffeur and Max Manus [indecipherable] they were both there, and the boys around him, so we knew we could stop it, hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: I understand that when Quisling, who was prime minister, yes?</span> <span id="s2154">Or a minister under Terboven?</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2156">An-anyway, called himself prime minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2158">But he didn’t have very much power.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: No, it was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: It wasn’t a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: And the Germans, they -- some -- when -- I think some of them laughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: And -- but when you knew Hitler, you had to be careful to laugh about somebody.</span> <span id="s2164">So they were very -- for instance, Terboven, that [indecipherable] he was very careful, because that’s -- Hitler like him.</span> <span id="s2165">That had been the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2166">If Hitler liked him, Terboven would be kicked out instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: So it was very important to be friend of Hitler, I think, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: I understand that you took him -- accompanied him to his trial, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Yes, when he was t-tried, he was sitting in one prison, and it was a little too far to the place where we should -- he should be tried, courthouse.</span> <span id="s2171">So I fetched him.</span> <span id="s2172">And in a way I -- he was alone.</span> <span id="s2173">I-I thought, how terrible, poor man.</span> <span id="s2174">In a way.</span> <span id="s2175">But of course, we knew what he had done and all that, he had been terrible, all the things.</span> <span id="s2176">So I had a Black Maria you called that, and I put him in there, and -- and then I said to a friend of mine who had been in all the prison camps, three of the worst, and he had survived, and I said to him, Mr. [indecipherable] you sit in with Quisling.</span> <span id="s2177">Tell him what you have experienced.</span> <span id="s2178">But he said afterwards, wasn’t very -- very many words talked between us, he said.</span> <span id="s2179">So I thought it was a very good thing that now he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Interesting, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: But it -- one thing, I have never seen any soldier, Norwegian resistance spitting or even show anything in front of the Germans, never.</span> <span id="s2182">So, and of course Quisling was a little different, but nobody came near to him, of course.</span> <span id="s2183">They couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: So there were no revenge attacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s2186">Of course, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s2187">Some people are -- can be crazy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: But it was nothing, and we kept an eye all the time, so he should have a trial, a fair tria -- well, as fair as possible, which we think we gave him.</span> <span id="s2190">They -- he had his lawyers.</span> <span id="s2191">But you know, when a man is trying to overthrow your government, if you got in a situation like here, that you had a man trying to overthrow the government here.</span> <span id="s2192">You had to shoot him, you had to get rid of him.</span> <span id="s2193">And death penalty is the only thing.</span> <span id="s2194">When a man is taking a whole country, being a traitor with the whole country, then, at that time at least, it was no discussion at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: Pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: So he was sentenced to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: He was shot 24th of October ’45, after three, four months of trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Did he say anything that was signif --</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Oh yes, he tried all the time, he didn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: He didn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: He pretended maybe.</span> <span id="s2203">He pretended, I guess.</span> <span id="s2204">H-He must have understood, but he was a strange fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: And you met Gestapo -- the head of Gestapo, February.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: And did you want to meet with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Well, actually, not so much, but when I saw he was there, I just said hello to him.</span> <span id="s2209">But I had no -- nothing to tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Does he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: I -- I’ve nothing to speak with -- I couldn’t -- what shall I talk to him about?</span> <span id="s2212">So -- so just a few words, said to my o-old opponent.</span> <span id="s2213">But he had been -- he -- he really organized the torture in Oslo from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s2214">And I knew he had, for instance, tortured women.</span> <span id="s2215">He did it in a way that put them in a cold room, and then they were naked, and they were put in cold water, and they were just -- tried to put them under water, almost til they died more or less, that was the terror, real.</span> <span id="s2216">So he had been a terrible fellow.</span> <span id="s2217">All the people that I’d been torturing, the -- all the torturists, were shot in Norway.</span> <span id="s2218">There was about -- people that -- they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s2219">These people had the death penalty.</span> <span id="s2220">But when be -- when the war was over, I turned around with the Germans, the war was over, no more war.</span> <span id="s2221">So I went to Germany already 1950, started discussing paper buyings from our paper mill in Norway.</span> <span id="s2222">So we had forgotten -- we had not forgotten, but we knew we had to change, and saw -- I saw Germany built up as a democracy again, through those years.</span> <span id="s2223">I was in Germany from 1950 to 1970, one, at least a month.</span> <span id="s2224">Every month I was there.</span> <span id="s2225">I saw the whole democracy being built up, and I knew Willie Brandt, the chancellor, later.</span> <span id="s2226">And I think, luckily, it was -- succeeded, in my opinion, hundred percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: H-How do you explain your ability to -- the war is over, it’s over, and now we start anew.</span> <span id="s2228">Is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Well, it’s natural, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s2230">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2231">A lot of people don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2233">Well, it’s rational, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s2234">You had to be rational, you have to be [indecipherable] no way -- no way.</span> <span id="s2235">And they were enemies, and no more because they done their best to become -- but we have people in Norway, they try -- why don’t you take it into the [indecipherable] can say that?</span> <span id="s2236">And then we said, okay, if you realize that you’ve done a mistake, that you did a mistake when you joined the -- the Nazi ideas, or the Nazis, Holocaust and all that.</span> <span id="s2237">If you don’t say that, that you -- you -- you were wrong, we still -- you are still my enemy.</span> <span id="s2238">I’ll never understand that.</span> <span id="s2239">You have to regret it.</span> <span id="s2240">When the -- you regret it, and you have your punishment, okay.</span> <span id="s2241">But we have some people, they will never regret it, they still think they were right.</span> <span id="s2242">And that’s incredible, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s2243">That’s what’s strange, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s2244">They have a few in Norway also, but we were very few in -- I think all in Europe, I think.</span> <span id="s2245">Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: When did you find out about the gas chambers and the genocide, and the mass killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: Well, immediately, when -- it was like [indecipherable] the troops, right?</span> <span id="s2248">It was really, really real, you know.</span> <span id="s2249">American troops, they just didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2250">Russian troops, French.</span> <span id="s2251">And so the real thing we -- we had, of course, in the last part it was a -- when -- what -- it took a long time til we heard that -- what happened to the Norwegian Jews.</span> <span id="s2252">[indecipherable] not before the war was over, really, that you had the -- the truth of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: So did that make you more angry, that -- that make you hate?</span> <span id="s2254">It’s -- I have a sense that you don’t hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: No, it -- no way.</span> <span id="s2256">[indecipherable] help at all, and I talked to my friend, very close friend that’s here with me, Jule Benkel, he was -- was -- as I said, in the resistance and later on he became a -- th-the leader -- the speaker of the house, and we talk about it.</span> <span id="s2257">I -- I feel that he is -- he lost all his family.</span> <span id="s2258">It’s hard for him -- it’s hard for me to go to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2259">But I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: To the Holocaust Museum, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Yeah, here, and then everywhere.</span> <span id="s2262">In Germany.</span> <span id="s2263">And then my wife has taken young people down to Auschwitz, I think it’s many thousand schoolchildren, she has been with one of the groups, and she said, they have changed when I have been there.</span> <span id="s2264">They changed.</span> <span id="s2265">It’s really hard.</span> <span id="s2266">So when I first came into a remarkable [indecipherable] here, I -- I had to -- I couldn’t take it, I had to stop.</span> <span id="s2267">I’d been through it halfway, I say, well I’m sorry, but I don’t feel that.</span> <span id="s2268">The same with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2269">And we have been [indecipherable] Norwegian authorities, our foreign ministry, I think it’s a good idea that we go out and inform people.</span> <span id="s2270">Inform them in Norway, inform them everywhere where we have listeners.</span> <span id="s2271">Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much.</span> <span id="s2273">Is there -- is there anything more you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: No, I don’t think so, what -- I think you have covered a little of the sto -- of the story [indecipherable] a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Well, thank you so much for coming today and sharing your story with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: Well, it’s very nice to listen to me.</span> <span id="s2277">I like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Now can you tell us what we’re looking at here?</span> <span id="s2282">What does this represent?</span> <span id="s2283">What does -- what does this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: -- what does this represent, all of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Yeah, you see up on the left corner, that’s some of my different names, aliases which I had during the war.</span> <span id="s2287">This is part of it.</span> <span id="s2288">I think I had about 25 dif -- different.</span> <span id="s2289">And this, in the middle there, that’s my real passport under Gunnar Sonsteby, which of course couldn’t be used after ’42, when I was wanted.</span> <span id="s2290">That’s the one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: That’s the one -- yes, that’s his real one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2293">And these others are at different times, from 1941 til ’44 - ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: And they’re actually different photographs --</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: Yes, I -- I -- and I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: -- I mean different si -- angles, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: It’s a very strange, but every picture was -- I didn't try it, but I went to these small boxes, you know, you find in the railroad station, where you look at -- as a criminal anyway, when you are photographed.</span> <span id="s2298">So that was the case.</span> <span id="s2299">And you see in the sign there, that’s the police sign, which you had on the back o -- of the jacket.</span> <span id="s2300">I think they did that to police here, they back -- they had in Norway at that time.</span> <span id="s2301">So I had -- it had a number, a nu -- number, if you go down there, you see the police.</span> <span id="s2302">I had also a secret police membership.</span> <span id="s2303">The card shows that.</span> <span id="s2304">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: That’s the card on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Yeah, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: -- that’s being shown.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: -- now I am a member of the secret federal police, and -- the Norwegian one.</span> <span id="s2309">There were -- I was a spy, so I could use that in case I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s2310">Very few times we -- I -- it usually could be used and help me.</span> <span id="s2311">This is an ordinary police -- and this -- this is bri -- driver’s license, the fuehrer court, fuehrer court.</span> <span id="s2312">That’s the driver’s license, I had the made up driver’s license like the name I had, so I also changed the driver’s license, all of them, and then it’s maybe a little one of the -- the last I had, I had it renewed in 1945, so I never -- I shouldn’t tell that to the police because I never had an exam.</span> <span id="s2313">And here, you see, that’s the one there, if you go back a little, that’s Erling Fjeld as a soldier in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s2314">So it shows, you could give him any rank, Erling Fjeld, he was a -- he was a fake name, so -- but it’s incredible, it’s all original soldiers [indecipherable] for duration of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Now that was when you went to Britain in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Yeah, and then a [indecipherable] yes, where they advised me, the British security police, to use a false name because of the spy risks in -- because I should go back into Norway.</span> <span id="s2317">If you go a little on the side there, that green card there, then I was -- that card has been through about 50 Gestapo controls between Oslo and the border, and I had no difficulties.</span> <span id="s2318">It’s very -- I look innocent, and the passport was ideal.</span> <span id="s2319">You had to have that kind of passport when you came up to the border.</span> <span id="s2320">The border district had special passports with -- which I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Now, there you’re wearing a beret for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: No, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: -- it’s actually a cap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: It looks like a beret, but it’s a cap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: But the -- because of the pictures.</span> <span id="s2329">And that’s an ordinary passport which I got in Stockholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: The red one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yeah, that’s a -- a real one under a false name.</span> <span id="s2332">That was made up by Norwegian authorities in Stockholm, and it was used only when I was going to England.</span> <span id="s2333">And it had -- this has all stamps from British authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: And that’s -- that’s not a forged one, that’s for real.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: That’s real one, made by Norwegian authorities outside Norway, of course, not the inside Norway.</span> <span id="s2336">I could do because I had the garment and everything else [indecipherable] Norway, here in the war.</span> <span id="s2337">Here you see some of the stamps which I had -- was made for me.</span> <span id="s2338">And I used them, and I had stamps, I have a -- about 50 of them [indecipherable] papers, because when you had a car, you had to have a license plates, they were false, you had to have a control sign on your pay -- on your window, or it said that you -- you could run a car, you could run through the night.</span> <span id="s2339">You had all -- I had all kinds of -- when I came into, four o’clock in the morning, I had a sign showing from the Gestapo cho -- top chief that I could do it.</span> <span id="s2340">So everything was -- and I also had to make up a book.</span> <span id="s2341">So when you were out, I had to say -- I had to know what kind of job have you had tonight with the control.</span> <span id="s2342">And I -- I -- I did all that.</span> <span id="s2343">It was -- could be with a car, and all that, could be three, four, five [indecipherable] you need -- they were all there.</span> <span id="s2344">It was a -- in my opinion, it should have been a little strange that you had a routine, you were -- and there were to -- you were too good.</span> <span id="s2345">[tape break] -- they put in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Wait -- you want to repeat --</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: -- the hands from the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Why don’t you repeat that about the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: Handcuffs --</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: -- the handcuffs were used by you in the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: Oh yes, those handcuffs there was used, and I handcuffed the hands on the back when I trol -- tried to control the guards.</span> <span id="s2352">So -- but you had to be very quick to put the handcuffs on a man [indecipherable] bigger than you, and you had to be very quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: And those big keys?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Yeah, that’s the -- for that [indecipherable] prison, those keys there, it was for the cells.</span> <span id="s2355">I could have got right in there when we tried to get out my friend, who was later shot and who we tried to give that poison pill.</span> <span id="s2356">It must be very hard for him, instead of we taking out, he just got a pill.</span> <span id="s2357">Please take it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2358">It was terrible to -- for us, too, to do that.</span> <span id="s2359">But he was terribly tortured.</span> <span id="s2360">Could have helped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: And those brass knuckles, whose are those?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Yeah, that -- is that a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Yeah, that could be used if you are a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: Did you use those?</span> <span id="s2366">Did you have those?</span> <span id="s2367">A: No, I ha -- I didn’t, but I knew exactly, I was trained how to use it.</span> <span id="s2368">If you hit a man just behind the ears you can kill him always.</span> <span id="s2369">They are terribly -- they are very -- and if you hit the man on the nose like that, he wouldn’t talk to you for some hours, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s2370">So it’s a very dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s2371">For German and Norwegian, I’ll tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Yeah, this is a passport which we used when you are nearing the border.</span> <span id="s2374">When we were about 25 from the border, 25 miles, then you would have a special passport.</span> <span id="s2375">Every citizen there would have this kind, so you can -- you are allowed to be in that district so near the border.</span> <span id="s2376">And it was necessary to have this.</span> <span id="s2377">If you haven’t got them, you would be arrested when you -- it was a restricted area alongside a border.</span> <span id="s2378">And that’s a picture that I usually -- when you take a picture in that box in the station all that, they’re all different.</span> <span id="s2379">Look like criminal anyway, don’t you, when you have these pictures taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: It’s a nice picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: And it’s in German and Norwegian.</span> <span id="s2382">So you can see the German, now you would read the German, so the -- the German guard would see immediately that you were supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s2383">And you -- you would be arrested co -- if you hadn’t a good reason to be visiting there, and even if you should go 30 miles in Norway, you had to have a permission.</span> <span id="s2384">The written permission.</span> <span id="s2385">And here is that passport of Thor Hansen.</span> <span id="s2386">Then -- this I very seldom used, because you see in the signature th-that is from the general -- Nazi general Martinsen who was the most -- that’s my handwriting, but on the we -- left side, you see it’s signed by Martinsen, he was one of the worst men we had in Norway.</span> <span id="s2387">He was a leader of the -- all these state police, all the federal Nazi police, and I used to -- I know his handwriting so well now, so I can -- if you want me to sign it, I may be able to sign it even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: So when would you use that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: I would use it in -- for instance when I had to go to a special district in Norway with a -- to try -- if it was a real hurry, to get to tol -- tell people, give them some idea, then I could use this.</span> <span id="s2390">And in the car, I had a car, it was the same state police car, federal -- could be a Chevrolet, could be a Chrysler that I -- that I had, and that -- I had a driver’s license with the same name, Thor Hansen, and that -- on the -- I -- plate there, it said -- the state police, federal police.</span> <span id="s2391">So it could be three, four documents which you had to have in order to go through that control, Gestapo control.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: And you didn’t have to wear a uniform in that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: No, no, it’s all civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: We’re all civilians.</span> <span id="s2396">All Gestapo, they were ordinary civilians.</span> <span id="s2397">Very seldom they show that they were all S -- SS, they had high ranks, but they were -- to do that job, they had to be all, as in Germany, they were all civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s2398">So I had -- I didn't need the -- and that’s an ordinary passport, which every Norwegian had to have, with the number and everything.</span> <span id="s2399">Luckily, if you see the number on top there, if they had stopped me, and had the lightest suspicion that I was lying, then they would call that number, that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: And I was finished.</span> <span id="s2402">So -- but I never -- they never did, luckily.</span> <span id="s2403">But if they did so, you would be taken immediately.</span> <span id="s2404">Then you are -- then you would be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: But this is when you were Erling?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Af --</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Yeah, that’s Erling Jacobsen, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: Erling -- oh this is Brul, that’s my -- bull.</span> <span id="s2411">Chicago Bulls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: No, this is Erling -- Erling Johannes Brul --</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: -- you see, on the top there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: I see, so it’s another --</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: That’s the family name on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: And down to 16 years you had to have these passports, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: When you had that passport and you -- no, when you had that passport, on the left side you had a J printed when you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s2422">And that came in, I think it was in ’41 - ’42, it was terrible, of course, when we saw that in Norway.</span> <span id="s2423">We had never thought of it, that he was -- was he -- that [indecipherable] was he we didn’t ever think about it, so we thought it was awful, all Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: I have a question to ask you.</span> <span id="s2425">Do you dream about this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s2427">When I leave here, I put the drawer inside again.</span> <span id="s2428">Now, I have taken the drawer out, when I leave this room, I put it in again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Do you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: No.</span> <span id="s2433">But I have to think about it tomorrow, because then I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: You have to speak, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: -- meet my friend, and we have to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2436">Then you have to put it in again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: So how -- when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: No, I am lucky there.</span> <span id="s2439">I am just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Well when you look --</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: -- tonight --</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: [indecipherable] think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: It’ll -- it’ll be gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2446">Why shouldn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: So when you think about your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: It’s in here -- it’s in -- time now, I don’t need to think that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: But when you think back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: -- at that time, are you amazed at what you did, or it’s just well, this is what I did?</span> <span id="s2452">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: You’re not amazed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: No.</span> <span id="s2456">It was so long ago, you know, so -- no, don’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: And do you see yourself as a hero?</span> <span id="s2458">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Do you see yourself as a hero?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: No, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s2463">Well, we were many, you know.</span> <span id="s2464">And some of the small people here, which helped us, could be the hero, for instance, any of them, gave us the right intelligence.</span> <span id="s2465">And if we were taken and you know, I could get away because I was quite clever, you know, and the others, they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2466">So they, the helpers were usually the heroes.</span> <span id="s2467">That’s quite clear.</span> <span id="s2468">Oh, that’s quite clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Well, I think you’re a hero.</span> <span id="s2470">You don’t have to.</span> <span id="s2471">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: You have the rest of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span
