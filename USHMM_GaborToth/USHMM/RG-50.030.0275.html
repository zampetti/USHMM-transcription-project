id="s24">I had a big family.</span> <span id="s25">I was the youngest of nine children, very spoiled.</span> <span id="s26">I was a happy child, and I was in school.</span> <span id="s27">I was a good student, not a perfect student.</span> <span id="s28">Had the help from all my sisters, everybody wanted to teach me.</span> <span id="s29">And everybody told me, "You can read that, you cannot read that.</span> <span id="s30">It's not for you at that time."</span> <span id="s31">You know that we couldn't do everything.</span> <span id="s32">And then I had quite a good life, and then I studied and I had good friends.</span> <span id="s33">And I was involved with Israel, with Zionism, and what can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What was the profession of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: A businessman.</span> <span id="s36">My mother was a mother of nine children.</span> <span id="s37">She had a good life.</span> <span id="s38">We all had a good life till the trouble came.</span> <span id="s39">And my brothers were studying, my sisters were studying, and they were married.</span> <span id="s40">And they left the house, and then in '39, the trouble came.</span> <span id="s41">I mean, we were Rumanian and then we were liberated by the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s42">And in the beginning we were okay, but then started -- when Hitler started to move in, the business was my father had a refinery, an alcohol refinery.</span> <span id="s43">It was taken nearby, and we started to feel the pressure and the troubles and -- but in school time I never felt that -- you know, with good friends and my very best friend was from an Hungarian officer, the daughter.</span> <span id="s44">And when Hitler came, she told me, "You should know one thing.</span> <span id="s45">If the Russians will come, you help me.</span> <span id="s46">And if Hitler will come, I come to help you."</span> <span id="s47">And then on Friday afternoon, they started to tell we have to move that building the ghetto, and we had to change our -- I mean, our house and street fell in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">But on a Friday afternoon, they said this side, one side, this outside will have to move out, so we had to move out.</span> <span id="s49">And our neighbor from opposite house, a very fine lawyer, I went to and I asked him to change.</span> <span id="s50">He gladly did it.</span> <span id="s51">He got everything from our house, and we left there just some luggages and whatever.</span> <span id="s52">In our house in the ghetto, all the family came to us from other streets.</span> <span id="s53">We were about 50 people, and when we went to the other side, we couldn't be so many together.</span> <span id="s54">And my friend, Olga, did come once asking if I need something to help me, and I said, "Listen, if I need some help, I'm sure you will be able to do it."</span> <span id="s55">And then over a weekend, I'm telling you very fast -- it goes too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: I told you I want to -- I understand you will chose your words.</span> <span id="s57">I want to ask you only a very short question.</span> <span id="s58">When did they enforce this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: It was probably 1944, you know.</span> <span id="s60">And we had to go, but it was '44 the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s61">We couldn't go out the windows to the street at all, they made it so we couldn't see anything.</span> <span id="s62">And we lived the life just what we had, left over food, as well was very short of everything.</span> <span id="s63">But I tell you, nobody was complaining.</span> <span id="s64">As around everybody was together.</span> <span id="s65">And we heard a lot of troubles, a lot of stories, and we just couldn't believe that.</span> <span id="s66">One Friday afternoon, I think that was Friday -- I don't remember the day when they came and said you be ready in the morning.</span> <span id="s67">That we are going away, and you can take only a small luggage.</span> <span id="s68">Everybody was taking a small luggage, and my father and my mother were both very upset but very, very brave.</span> <span id="s69">We all together, you know, went, being nearly and we went on the street.</span> <span id="s70">And the Hungarian soldiers were down -- you know, with the big feather and they were standing and waiting.</span> <span id="s71">It was very, very troubling and frightening.</span> <span id="s72">And they took us, there was big line, a big crowd on the streets.</span> <span id="s73">This part of the ghetto probably was empty, and we went to the temple and we stayed there overnight.</span> <span id="s74">In the morning, it was still dark, in the morning they started to take us out in -- is that ?</span> <span id="s75">You know, outside from the temple, and they started to see what we have, but we throw together and they threw out everything what was not supposed.</span> <span id="s76">I had a little ring and, you know, souvenirs; it was all taken.</span> <span id="s77">And we went to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: I want to interrupt you for one second.</span> <span id="s79">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And to ask you if you remember in the ghetto wearing a Yellow Star of not.</span> <span id="s81">A: No.</span> <span id="s82">No, we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, I don't think.</span> <span id="s85">No, we didn't have the Yellow Star.</span> <span id="s86">We went to the train, and all the group, the family -- my brother was there and my sister, and my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s87">Some cousins, some friends.</span> <span id="s88">And we tried to stay all together in the same train, you know.</span> <span id="s89">And we were lucky that we would get in, that they pushed us, you know, that we were all together.</span> <span id="s90">And we arranged to -- I don't want to make it too frightening and -- you know, I just tried to be strong now that I can talk about it.</span> <span id="s91">And I don't remember when this train started to move.</span> <span id="s92">Everybody started and tried to arrange a corner on the floor, and I remember that we had to choose, talking if we will stay together.</span> <span id="s93">If my parents need, we will work for them, and we should stay together.</span> <span id="s94">I had some shoes, ski shoes, and some summer shoes.</span> <span id="s95">And I remember I wanted to put up the summer shoes.</span> <span id="s96">My mother said, "Don't do that.</span> <span id="s97">Put up the good shoes.</span> <span id="s98">You never know when you need it."</span> <span id="s99">And I was lucky enough to come home with that shoe.</span> <span id="s100">For that I will tell you another story.</span> <span id="s101">And we came to Auschwitz after very hard road.</span> <span id="s102">I don't have to tell you that people were not very happy with each other, but screaming.</span> <span id="s103">They were looking for a corner and my father said, "I'm not eating.</span> <span id="s104">Let the children have the food."</span> <span id="s105">For two, three days, he didn't touch almost anything.</span> <span id="s106">We got to Auschwitz, we didn't know what Auschwitz is, but we got to a stop after three days and nights.</span> <span id="s107">We got out seeing only soldiers and big dogs.</span> <span id="s108">And we tried always, and we stayed together -- my father, my mother, my sister, my brother, myself, and a cousin near us.</span> <span id="s109">And then a lot of men in the striped suits, they who were walking, you know, they were prisoners of the thing.</span> <span id="s110">And they started to separate us, so the men stayed together, the women together.</span> <span id="s111">We were young and we stayed near my mother and my sister, and right away when the officer came and they cut us off, thinking and being assured that we see each other later, you know.</span> <span id="s112">And then we started to march, and we got into the camps.</span> <span id="s113">It was very, very horrible.</span> <span id="s114">We didn't know where we are or what it is.</span> <span id="s115">We just -- big SS soldiers with the dogs near us.</span> <span id="s116">And they took us to a sauna, and I didn't see my mother anymore, but my sister was with me.</span> <span id="s117">And they took us in and they told us to take everything off.</span> <span id="s118">We were very embarrassed, very young, and just couldn't do it, you know.</span> <span id="s119">And we had our pocketbook, and in the pocketbooks was very important, our papers, our identities.</span> <span id="s120">And I remember I had a little chain on my neck with a picture in it.</span> <span id="s121">And we were standing there, and the SS men came with the dogs.</span> <span id="s122">And one of the SS men -- no, as matter of fact, it was not an SS man.</span> <span id="s123">It was a young girl from Slovakia who were already the kapos.</span> <span id="s124">And she said, "You don't need that," and took it off from my neck.</span> <span id="s125">This fell and I wanted to pick it up, this was very dear to me.</span> <span id="s126">And then one of the soldiers with the big boots, then I looked up and there was the dog and the soldier.</span> <span id="s127">I never saw that again.</span> <span id="s128">Again, but this was not so important than the identity card.</span> <span id="s129">And we both looked at each other, and my sister said, "What we will do?</span> <span id="s130">What will we do without them?"</span> <span id="s131">Anyway, when we went to another corner and they started to cut our hair.</span> <span id="s132">They cut our hair and -- you know, it was just unbelievable one part of my hair came down.</span> <span id="s133">The other part of my hair came down.</span> <span id="s134">And till I got out, my head was like that, you know.</span> <span id="s135">We don't know anything, and we just didn't know where to put our hands.</span> <span id="s136">We were so ashamed and embarrassed.</span> <span id="s137">And let me not cry.</span> <span id="s138">And then we went to another room, and they gave us -- they gave us to put on, it was made from -- it was like a dress, you know.</span> <span id="s139">Gray.</span> <span id="s140">I don't know what it's called in German.</span> <span id="s141">A sack, I don't know this in English.</span> <span id="s142">And we were all in the same dresses, and yes, I forget to tell you.</span> <span id="s143">When we came after the sauna, after we were cleaned and cleaned, you know, after they had -- we find our shoes.</span> <span id="s144">It was a lot of shoes there, and my sister and I, we looked.</span> <span id="s145">When we left, we put them in a corner, so when we came out we saw the shoes.</span> <span id="s146">And this was lifesaving situation, you know, to have your own shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Anyway, yeah, they put us in 925, I was always near my sister and my cousin.</span> <span id="s148">We started to march, and there's hundreds of women and hundreds of people, it was incredible looks to see something like that.</span> <span id="s149">But when we started to march mainly an SS man with a big German dog, and outside where already the other prisoners were standing in a line and seeing us coming in.</span> <span id="s150">And I was marching and I was crying, and one of the people, one of the women screamed to me, "Don't cry, you cry.</span> <span id="s151">You cannot cry here.</span> <span id="s152">You are not supposed to cry here."</span> <span id="s153">I don't remember the face, but it was a young girl, I remember that.</span> <span id="s154">But she screamed at me, and she said, "Don't you ever do that."</span> <span id="s155">To , you know there's an expression in German.</span> <span id="s156">And I never cried after that for a long time.</span> <span id="s157">When we came to the camps, we were looking for our parents.</span> <span id="s158">And they were already the kapos, and they said, "Move, move.</span> <span id="s159">You have to arrange yourselves."</span> <span id="s160">And we said, "Where should we move?</span> <span id="s161">We wait for our parents."</span> <span id="s162">"Your parents, what are you talking?</span> <span id="s163">Your parents are dead."</span> <span id="s164">And they showed us the chimneys, and we said to them, "Are you crazy?"</span> <span id="s165">And we were so sure that they want just to give us back that we still home and they were already such a long time there.</span> <span id="s166">And then we went in in the camps, and we got in our blocks, you know, and we got to be arranged.</span> <span id="s167">I will make it short, and then come back to that.</span> <span id="s168">And in the beginning we were not so lucky, then we had the place on the bottom and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s169">The rats and mouse and dirty.</span> <span id="s170">Then later on when they moved us, we got already on the top, and this was okay.</span> <span id="s171">It was tolerable.</span> <span id="s172">And then we stayed about like that in what do you call that?</span> <span id="s173">, a couple of weeks, till they adjusted.</span> <span id="s174">We got adjusted, and you probably know already from so many other interviews, the zahlappell, the getting up in the night.</span> <span id="s175">The 3 o'clock coffee and then a piece of bread and then -- you know the other stories from other people probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Well, you know we know, of course, about Auschwitz, but . . . A: This was Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: . . . but you can chose to tell us whatever you want about . . . A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: . . . the concentration camp is Auschwitz, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Thinking about other, it was we were not sent away in the factories.</span> <span id="s180">We were staying there, and in a way, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s181">And after a couple of weeks, we started to war.</span> <span id="s182">To go to war was in the morning, we marched with music.</span> <span id="s183">And I had very nice little kapo near me, and she liked me.</span> <span id="s184">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s185">And she said, "I want you to help me when we go through the main door" -- not door.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Gate.</span> <span id="s188">"You should tell me when it's right, when it's left.</span> <span id="s189">I don't want to get in trouble."</span> <span id="s190">So she was always staying near me and I was always saying loud, " , " so adjusted their feet after my feet and after my voice, and she was very sweet to me.</span> <span id="s191">Very nice.</span> <span id="s192">She didn't beat me, she didn't make me troubled, this was good enough for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Outside we were working just to make us work, to keep us busy carrying stones.</span> <span id="s194">The stone was almost bigger than myself.</span> <span id="s195">And I remember it was a -- this was in the summer, July, and it came the SS people, I think the SS lager came to see how we are doing.</span> <span id="s196">And we were carrying the stones, and we had the kapo, a German woman, who wanted to show off that's she's very strict with us.</span> <span id="s197">And our Slovak people, not a very strong girl and carrying the stone, she came over me.</span> <span id="s198">She said, "Fast, ."</span> <span id="s199">And she hit me with a stick, so that the stick broke on my back.</span> <span id="s200">And near me was a very strict little Holland woman, she was much older than me.</span> <span id="s201">And she was very nice to me, she said, "Get up fast.</span> <span id="s202">Take your stone and walk."</span> <span id="s203">This was my -- you know, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s204">So I did and a couple of things like that happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s205">And this was in the summer in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">And the other thing happened, once we were walking and doing some -- in the fields some work, and the airplanes came and we were all looking up, hoping that they will bomb the camp.</span> <span id="s207">And we're looking up and seeing the camp, and an SS men saw us and he started to scream, "Do you think your help is from there, from the plane?</span> <span id="s208">No.</span> <span id="s209">Your help is from that.</span> <span id="s210">You see the chimneys?</span> <span id="s211">You don't go out from here.</span> <span id="s212">You go there."</span> <span id="s213">But remember we do what we have to do.</span> <span id="s214">And then for punishment he told us, "You will be punished now."</span> <span id="s215">What is the punishment?</span> <span id="s216">So when they give their lunch this soup, we have to walk kneeling with our cup for the soup.</span> <span id="s217">And to think we kneeled, and we all walked kneeling till we got the soup.</span> <span id="s218">And this was the punishment of that lunch.</span> <span id="s219">And since then -- and I have a girl who works for me and she wants to leave, [inaudible] I tell her . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: It's okay.</span> <span id="s222">And then this happened.</span> <span id="s223">This was so many now -- and then in August another thing happened to me.</span> <span id="s224">One of my friends told me, "You know, after this soup, you can go wash your cup."</span> <span id="s225">This was a very big thing.</span> <span id="s226">There is a bathroom, and we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Nobody saw us.</span> <span id="s228">"You just to there and wash your cup."</span> <span id="s229">So I told my other friend, "Come and go.</span> <span id="s230">Let's go wash our cup."</span> <span id="s231">You know, the food stays until evening.</span> <span id="s232">It's hot , so we went in, and we saw a bathroom.</span> <span id="s233">We didn't tell, we didn't see soldiers.</span> <span id="s234">We didn't see nobody.</span> <span id="s235">We went in, we washed our -- to wash our cups.</span> <span id="s236">And suddenly, from the side, two soldiers that was not SS, was Verma (ph) soldiers who were better than SS, came in.</span> <span id="s237">And they stayed like that, and they started to scream at us, " ?"</span> <span id="s238">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s239">And I spoke German, the other would not.</span> <span id="s240">And I told him that my friend told me I can come here and wash -- "Who told you that?</span> <span id="s241">This is not your place."</span> <span id="s242">And he started -- we're standing near the wall, and he started to hit us.</span> <span id="s243">He hit once for me, and once hit me out here, a tooth, and I fell and he hit me here.</span> <span id="s244">And the kapo was looking for us, she didn't see us coming out with my sister.</span> <span id="s245">And that was on a Saturday and then the kapo was a German woman.</span> <span id="s246">Her name was Annie, she as quite decent, you know.</span> <span id="s247">Very decent, and she came out.</span> <span id="s248">She saw us standing there from me with blood already, and she said to the SS man, "Give them to me.</span> <span id="s249">I finish them off."</span> <span id="s250">And the SS men threw us out, and she had sticks and she started to hit us, the SS men should see that she takes care of us.</span> <span id="s251">And all the girls were very upset having us back, our life was saved.</span> <span id="s252">And this was a Saturday before the big holiday for the Jews there, a holiday.</span> <span id="s253">And they told me, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s254">This is a good sign.</span> <span id="s255">You'll be all right."</span> <span id="s256">This was the sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Anyway, then what happened -- what happened after that?</span> <span id="s258">Yes, this I like to tell you that story.</span> <span id="s259">I was working outside carrying the stone with another friend of mine.</span> <span id="s260">We had such from wood made specially, and near me was a woman, a young girl.</span> <span id="s261">And my good shoe started already to fall apart, and came off the bottom and I had to fix it with something.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">And she said to me, "From where are you?"</span> <span id="s263">And she said, "I just came here from the other group.</span> <span id="s264">I should be able to see somebody from my home town.</span> <span id="s265">The men were working there, too."</span> <span id="s266">And I said, "From where are you?</span> <span id="s267">She said she's from Poland, and she's from Kraków.</span> <span id="s268">And you've probably heard Kraków from Poland.</span> <span id="s269">Did she live there now?</span> <span id="s270">And I said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s271">My sister-in-law was from Kraków.</span> <span id="s272">And I told her who she was, she said, "I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s273">I knew her very well, the family."</span> <span id="s274">And she said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s275">If you are from that family," she said, "I work for the shoe department.</span> <span id="s276">Bring me the shoes, and I will fix it for you."</span> <span id="s277">And she told me what number she is, and when I came back I had to bring the shoes and I had to have other shoes to wear.</span> <span id="s278">My sister found for me other shoes, and may I take my pocketbook?</span> <span id="s279">My handkerchief.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: And I brought her the shoes.</span> <span id="s282">It's okay?</span> <span id="s283">Sorry.</span> <span id="s284">And she said, "You'll see, tomorrow night I bring back your shoes."</span> <span id="s285">Meanwhile, it was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s286">You know what it is?</span> <span id="s287">It is Holy Days, and we promised ourself that we will not eat, that we will fast.</span> <span id="s288">Maybe we fasted anyway almost every day, but we will fast maybe somehow we get some help.</span> <span id="s289">And I remember I had a very sweet friend.</span> <span id="s290">She was from my home town, and we were in the same class.</span> <span id="s291">She was very pretty blonde, brown eyes.</span> <span id="s292">And she had some wounds on her knee and they didn't let her go to work, and they put her in a separate block.</span> <span id="s293">And I asked her, "Would you please keep my soup, and in the evening I come to pick it up?"</span> <span id="s294">She said, "Gladly."</span> <span id="s295">And in the evening, I picked up the shoes, she was still there.</span> <span id="s296">And I picked up the soup, and we were standing in line, and this lady, this young girl came.</span> <span id="s297">And she brought me the shoes, my shoes, and it was the holiday evening.</span> <span id="s298">And she said, "I'm glad you have the shoes.</span> <span id="s299">Every day shoes you have to go home," she told me.</span> <span id="s300">And I said to her -- and I was crying, I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s301">And then the summer in August my sister found somebody in the cell a small scroll, must have been you know when the Jews put in the morning prayer.</span> <span id="s302">And it was written in -- we knew Hebrew.</span> <span id="s303">We learned at home in my parents' house.</span> <span id="s304">It was written "When God will take us out from here."</span> <span id="s305">And when my sister saw that, she said, "You see that?</span> <span id="s306">We are going home.</span> <span id="s307">We will go out."</span> <span id="s308">And I said to her, "Look, don't be stupid.</span> <span id="s309">People read the numbers.</span> <span id="s310">Don't ever go out.</span> <span id="s311">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s312">They won't let us out.</span> <span id="s313">They don't want the world to see us, the numbers.</span> <span id="s314">It's impossible."</span> <span id="s315">She said, "Don't be like that.</span> <span id="s316">Don't be like that.</span> <span id="s317">I want to talk to you, but this we have to say and with that, we have to go home."</span> <span id="s318">And you know what?</span> <span id="s319">Through all the troubles, all the saunas, all the places we kept it in our mouths.</span> <span id="s320">We came home with that, and we came home with the shoes.</span> <span id="s321">We said to -- from Auschwitz that made the transport, yeah -- how was it?</span> <span id="s322">We came back from war, and the whole lager was under -- outside.</span> <span id="s323">And we said this is some trouble that we cannot go to our places.</span> <span id="s324">And it was -- first, yeah, this was once that they were hanging a girl who tried to escape, and the whole camp had to see that.</span> <span id="s325">She tried to commit suicide, she cut her hand.</span> <span id="s326">That didn't work.</span> <span id="s327">And they hanged her, and we had to see.</span> <span id="s328">Everybody had to watch that.</span> <span id="s329">And the next day they said the orchestra is sold, they don't play anymore.</span> <span id="s330">And we knew when the orchestra is taken - - is off, then they must take us away, too.</span> <span id="s331">And that happened.</span> <span id="s332">The next day we stayed in the zahlappell in the big place, and they said we are not supposed to go back to our blocks.</span> <span id="s333">We all go to the sauna.</span> <span id="s334">And we went, we gave up our clothes; we gave up our shoes.</span> <span id="s335">We were sitting there on the stone floor, hundreds of girls, and we all started and tried to be together from home town or friends.</span> <span id="s336">And one of the girls was singing beautifully, she was singing and then the SS men heard her sing.</span> <span id="s337">And he asked she should sing again, and the whole block, the whole group was standing on the floor.</span> <span id="s338">It was cold, it was already October, November.</span> <span id="s339">October, November.</span> <span id="s340">And she was sitting there, she was singing.</span> <span id="s341">People were crying, and -- but, you know, we didn't think this was our end.</span> <span id="s342">Somehow we didn't, you know, believe it.</span> <span id="s343">And then after a while, we had the sauna and we started going out from the sauna.</span> <span id="s344">And we are getting our stuff back, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">We were saved, we were singing.</span> <span id="s346">And we had to go to selection, you know.</span> <span id="s347">So one side we carried our stuff and we are naked.</span> <span id="s348">In one hand, we had to be like up, and we were checked if we are clean, or we don't have some wounds.</span> <span id="s349">You know, things like that.</span> <span id="s350">They were taken away right away.</span> <span id="s351">And my sister went through, my friend went through and I came.</span> <span id="s352">And when I came Mengele was on the commission, you know.</span> <span id="s353">Mengele, another doctor, another nurse, you know, were a group who selected who should stay and who should go.</span> <span id="s354">We didn't know where we go or we go, but Mengele stopped me and hold me, you know, with my hand.</span> <span id="s355">And started to turn me, he wanted to see me.</span> <span id="s356">Meanwhile, the doctor spoke to him, and he turned around to answer her.</span> <span id="s357">And when he turned around, I run.</span> <span id="s358">And meanwhile the others came.</span> <span id="s359">Otherwise, I wouldn't tell you none of the stories, probably.</span> <span id="s360">And then it was wonderful, very, very well organized, who went through.</span> <span id="s361">And we came and then who couldn't come and who was selected, they were put in another place.</span> <span id="s362">And we just heard the screaming: mother from daughter; sister from sister.</span> <span id="s363">It was a terrible, terrible frightening situation.</span> <span id="s364">Still we were not sure that we will go.</span> <span id="s365">And when we march, we saw the train already there, that train.</span> <span id="s366">And we went, the group was always tried to be together.</span> <span id="s367">I'm almost finished.</span> <span id="s368">And we went to the train.</span> <span id="s369">We sat, and everybody had his piece of bread.</span> <span id="s370">And everybody wanted to keep whatever they had.</span> <span id="s371">And they were fighting with each other.</span> <span id="s372">The girls, "I want to sit here.</span> <span id="s373">I want to sit here."</span> <span id="s374">And then one SS man, it was not an SS man.</span> <span id="s375">It was a Verma (ph), a young man who came in, and who said to them, "Don't get upset.</span> <span id="s376">Sit down.</span> <span id="s377">Find your place."</span> <span id="s378">He came and gave everyone a piece of bread with margarine, the Verma (ph).</span> <span id="s379">And he said to us, "Be quiet.</span> <span id="s380">You don't know if you go or you're to stay here.</span> <span id="s381">You will know you are almost safe when the train will move."</span> <span id="s382">And that made them little bit, you know, quiet waiting the train should move.</span> <span id="s383">And after a while, it really moved.</span> <span id="s384">And we went -- I don't remember how long -- we went to Germany, to Hannover.</span> <span id="s385">We came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s386">Bergen-Belsen was a terrible situation, there was no crematoriums, but people were just dying and the typhoid.</span> <span id="s387">I make it short, and I see it's a little bit too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Take your time, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And it took forever to tell.</span> <span id="s390">And we went there, and we didn't do anything in Bergen- Belsen.</span> <span id="s391">There was no work, no nothing.</span> <span id="s392">And I have another story, but my sister was in the one camp near -- in Bergen-Belsen, but she was in the camp with her husband.</span> <span id="s393">You know, Eichmann was supposed to get medication and drugs, and for this group of people, they were deported from Prus (ph) now in a Kastner situation.</span> <span id="s394">My sister was in that group from Kastner, my father used to give money for Israel.</span> <span id="s395">So she used to live in Prus (ph), and she was supposed -- she went to -- instead to go to Israel, they turned to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s396">Well, you probably know that story.</span> <span id="s397">And we were in Bergen-Belsen, and Bergen-Belsen was very bad.</span> <span id="s398">Typhoid broke out.</span> <span id="s399">The Hungarian transport came, the last transport from Budapest.</span> <span id="s400">And then we said, they asked us where are your parents and where -- we said, "Our parents?</span> <span id="s401">From where are you coming?</span> <span id="s402">Who has parents?"</span> <span id="s403">And they spit on us and they didn't believe it, just like people don't believe it here either.</span> <span id="s404">And they said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s405">You don't have a God.</span> <span id="s406">You don't believe in God if you talk like that, you know."</span> <span id="s407">And this group of people died very fast.</span> <span id="s408">They were very upset, very desperate.</span> <span id="s409">They didn't go to the saunas, they didn't wash themself.</span> <span id="s410">And right away, they brought in the lice and the typhoid to Bergen-Belsen, and they died like no other.</span> <span id="s411">Like flies.</span> <span id="s412">And then I myself got the typhoid, and I was in the and the shoes and it was still in my mind I have to keep them.</span> <span id="s413">My sister kept this little scroll, and I didn't know what's happening to me, but the shoes were under my head, you know.</span> <span id="s414">And in the morning, this very sweet Hungarian woman was near me.</span> <span id="s415">She was dead, and you know what?</span> <span id="s416">I saw her soup still there, I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s417">I was drinking her soup.</span> <span id="s418">And then from the typhoid, I didn't hear very well.</span> <span id="s419">I was quite sick.</span> <span id="s420">My sister was told from one of the girls, "I don't think you should wait for your sister.</span> <span id="s421">I don't think she will every come out."</span> <span id="s422">I came out.</span> <span id="s423">And then they liberated -- yeah.</span> <span id="s424">It was the liberation, and the night we heard screaming.</span> <span id="s425">And I didn't -- people told me, "Don't you hear something?</span> <span id="s426">Some screaming?"</span> <span id="s427">And I was deaf from typhoid.</span> <span id="s428">And in the morning, my sister came.</span> <span id="s429">She was swollen, very swollen from hunger.</span> <span id="s430">And like her face was like very big, and she couldn't close her shoes so very swollen were her feet.</span> <span id="s431">But she brought me a soup, and she said, "We are free."</span> <span id="s432">So I said, "What are you talking?"</span> <span id="s433">And I remember she said, "I made you a soup, a potato soup."</span> <span id="s434">Her whole face was black from the cold, but from the tears -- so two days later when I started to be able to walk, I went to the fence and I saw, then I believe.</span> <span id="s435">And I saw the English soldiers coming in.</span> <span id="s436">There was a group of Yugoslav soldiers, there were very nice and very kind.</span> <span id="s437">And I couldn't walk, he took me and he said he put me on the bus, that we've changed the place.</span> <span id="s438">We were very sick, very full of lice.</span> <span id="s439">And the man, the English man came dressed with the DDT to help us.</span> <span id="s440">Not too many were helped, many died after the liberation.</span> <span id="s441">They started to eat fast.</span> <span id="s442">They were liberated from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s443">My sister, who was in another place, looked for her husband and while she find us on the list.</span> <span id="s444">And she took us from Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: From Bergen-Belsen I went to Gelsenkirchen.</span> <span id="s447">I don't know if you heard about it.</span> <span id="s448">That's a rule , she was working there, you know, and she knew the place.</span> <span id="s449">She had another story, but she's not here anymore.</span> <span id="s450">She died.</span> <span id="s451">She cannot tell her story.</span> <span id="s452">It was a very, very special story, hers, too.</span> <span id="s453">And she took us there.</span> <span id="s454">What I told Sarah before that I wanted to work and I started to go to learn to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s455">And I stayed in Gelsenkirchen, I went to eat at the .</span> <span id="s456">And I met there the kapo who was -- who helped me, but she looked worse than me.</span> <span id="s457">She had, you know, blonde hair.</span> <span id="s458">She didn't have teeth, and she came to eat there and I recognized her.</span> <span id="s459">And I said, "You were my kapo."</span> <span id="s460">And then she was suddenly very frightened, and she said, "But I was good to you."</span> <span id="s461">So I said, "No, you were not good to me."</span> <span id="s462">And then I told my sister that I didn't give her any -- I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s463">I said, "She won't be helped, and I won't be helped.</span> <span id="s464">Let her" -- my sister was very -- almost killed me that I let her go.</span> <span id="s465">And after that we stayed in Gelsenkirchen for a while, and I went to Israel on the boat for three weeks.</span> <span id="s466">I stayed in Italy, very hard, too.</span> <span id="s467">And after three months I had to stay the rest, you know, from England.</span> <span id="s468">It was Palestine.</span> <span id="s469">And then in Palestine, I got out, it was not easy but I was very happy there.</span> <span id="s470">I used to have a very pretty voice, and I had to sing for the girls in the evening, about 70, 80 girls.</span> <span id="s471">And it was quiet and I would sing, and the English man came and courted us there, too.</span> <span id="s472">And then after three months, I left, came back.</span> <span id="s473">And I had cousins and a year later I met Conrad, and my good lifestyle to begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So when did you come to this country?</span> <span id="s475">A: In this country, we came in '57.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And you never went back to Secuiesc?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s478">This is what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s479">But my sister went back, and she went to the ghetto to the house.</span> <span id="s480">And she find there my diary; she find there letters who are really documents, and I have to do something about it.</span> <span id="s481">I never went back, I never wanted to go back to the stores, to nobody.</span> <span id="s482">But now that I'm almost more dead than he is, I said I have to go.</span> <span id="s483">Have to go to see.</span> <span id="s484">It takes a lot of energy, and it's not so easy.</span> <span id="s485">All my friends went back, but the rest -- they went back.</span> <span id="s486">They went to our street, they brought me the pictures of our house and our places.</span> <span id="s487">I have it here, but somehow I really have to go.</span> <span id="s488">I think I will if I have the energy.</span> <span id="s489">I don't know, we'll see what's happening.</span> <span id="s490">And thank you so much . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: . . . for listening.</span> <span id="s493">It's
