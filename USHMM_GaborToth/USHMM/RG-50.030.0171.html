Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Ah, that was a little uh village by the name how pronounced Skrzynce (ph).</span> <span id="s20">This is the county of Dabrowa (ph) and the state of Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: In the state of Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your uh childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s25">I was grow uh grow up on the country, up to sixteen.</span> <span id="s26">When I was sixteen years old, I go to the big city by the name Tarnow (ph), and I start working as a dishwasher in a very elegant Jewish club by the name Musa on Siberski Square, right in the center of the city of Tarnow.</span> <span id="s27">I was there for some</span></p> <p><span id="s28">01:02: time as a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s29">Then after I decided to go and learn to be baker and that's not quite two years, about two years I was learned to be baker.</span> <span id="s30">And that's 1939 the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What was your first recollection of the German invasion of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes, that was on Friday, September 1st.</span> <span id="s33">Early in the morning I was delivered as usual out back to the groceries and I was in a city and I find out from one of the grocer that the Germans invade Poland and that was a shock to me.</span> <span id="s34">I was about eighteen years old that time and then right away you see those sirens sounds and the megaphone sounds through the megaphone speakers.</span> <span id="s35">You know, they announce that the German attacked Poland and they break out the border, you know, and they are already going in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: How far was your...the town of Tarnow from the German-Polish border?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I should say about two hundred kilometer.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And how long before the Germans came to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I can't tell you exactly but that was about another week or so they marched through the Tarnow and that was scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What was...what impact did them coming to the town have on you initially?</span> <span id="s41">How did it change your life at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, at that time my life was changed.</span> <span id="s43">The bakery was closed.</span> <span id="s44">I have to go back to my mother on the country and the</span></p> <p><span id="s45">01:04:30 Germans put the posters all over.</span> <span id="s46">They explain why they are there and everything going to be now under the German rules and when you break the law, there be a death sentence, Totesstrafe.</span> <span id="s47">That was very scary.</span> <span id="s48">And you see how they start arrested.</span> <span id="s49">First of all they go...they come to another small, small town by the name Strutch(?}</span> <span id="s50">.</span> <span id="s51">This is on the Vistula River and first day that the German comes, they pick up twenty-seven Jewish people, those Jewish we know like some...one of the Jews I know very very good.</span> <span id="s52">He had a tobacco store.</span> <span id="s53">The other one had a restaurant.</span> <span id="s54">Another one, he was a cabinet maker.</span> <span id="s55">Many of my friends learn how to make cabinets by this Jew who was very nice man and a photographer, I remember his name Pilschnik.</span> <span id="s56">They took him.</span> <span id="s57">Twenty-seven Jewish people they take.</span> <span id="s58">They bring to the church there.</span> <span id="s59">They give them the shovels and they dig out their 01:06: own graves and they was executed right there the by the church, and that was scary.</span> <span id="s60">That we see what that means and what this going to be like, and that was really...that was something, you know, something I never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And you were back on the farm with your parents and your brothers and sisters after the bakery closed down, and what happened...what did you do after you went back to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">My parents, I beg your pardon...my father stays in this country.</span> <span id="s64">He didn't go to Poland.</span> <span id="s65">My mother pick up three of my brothers...Matthew, Bruno and John.</span> <span id="s66">Matthew was thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s67">Bruno was seven years old and John was five years old and after she arrive Poland, two months later on July 31st, I was born, 1921.</span> <span id="s68">Yes.</span> <span id="s69">So before the war, each my brother come back to this country and the last one, John, he come back to this country in 1938, just a year before the war broke out, and I was a little bit jealous see, because I didn't have chance to come back to this country, so actually I stay only with my mother.</span> <span id="s70">My mother didn't have much land.</span> <span id="s71">She had about three or four acre, not quite four acres land.</span> <span id="s72">There was plenty food for us and that time after the Germans come, there was not much to do and we wouldn't know what do to and what to expect, so I was arrested 01:08: because I tell you why.</span> <span id="s73">As the Polish soldier back up, there was so many weapons and happened in the woods I find a beautiful new rifle, Army rifle, and I bring it home and I hide the rifle in a barn, in a haystack and that time if you're hiding any weapons...the posters was all over, you know...that means death sentence.</span> <span id="s74">There was no question about that.</span> <span id="s75">But they give us time up to I forgot...November 10 or something like that.</span> <span id="s76">Anything belongs to the Army, government, any weapons, ammunition, even blankets, we should turn to the Germans.</span> <span id="s77">After that if you keep something like that and they find out, there be a death sentence for that.</span> <span id="s78">So but that rifle, I didn't...I didn't give it back.</span> <span id="s79">Now I thought maybe someday I going to use it, but somebody somehow squeal on me to the German Gestapo and they come.</span> <span id="s80">They arrest me, right there in the village, next village and they kept me there for three weeks, in November 1939, and they treat me very rough.</span> <span id="s81">If I tell you I get seventy-five on my rear end...they tied me to the bench and they tell 01:10: me...they tell me if I won't bring that weapon, they going to shoot me, and I tell them I haven't got no weapon and somehow somebody from the village...I think there was some people, you know, had me out and they talk from me I am innocent.</span> <span id="s82">I just come from the city.</span> <span id="s83">I was a baker, you know.</span> <span id="s84">I had nothing to do, but the chief of the Gestapo says now you too danger for me.</span> <span id="s85">The next week, on Wednesday, I want you be here and we assign you in for the work, for the farm working the German, and you got to be here about nine o'clock Wednesday.</span> <span id="s86">I forgot what day was it.</span> <span id="s87">I believe that was December 6th, on Wednesday somewhere as far as I can remember, so I sign a paper and they took us to Germany.</span> <span id="s88">Happened by good luck we landed in Austria, which was much better.</span> <span id="s89">We go through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s90">We stay overnight in Vienna.</span> <span id="s91">We come to Austria, to Linz and from Linz we come to the little town, a little city I should say, by the name _??</span> <span id="s92">______ in Austria, and we come to the place, unemployment office and the 01:12: farmers was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s93">If I tell you the story you wouldn't believe.</span> <span id="s94">From my village there was a friend of mine with me by the name Frankie (ph) and both of us we was assigned to the big, the biggest farm in that area, in that county I should say, and guess who picked us up.</span> <span id="s95">My wife Frieda.</span> <span id="s96">She was at that time...gosh, nineteen...nineteen years old, twenty.</span> <span id="s97">Father sent her to the unemployment office and she bring us home.</span> <span id="s98">Matter of fact they give us the taxi like about short before the house there was the kind of hill and the taxi couldn't make it because was quite a snow there at that time there in Austria, so at that place...oh, about a half a mile, we have to...half a kilometer I should say...we walked, and here we come on that farm and by gosh two big dogs because the father of the farmer...he was more than a farmer you see.</span> <span id="s99">He was a very wealthy, wealthy man...the biggest in the area.</span> <span id="s100">He had also hunting area.</span> <span id="s101">I don't know how many thousands and thousands acres of hunting, and that hunting was in that house for over a hundred years, so he had the two big hunting dogs.</span> <span id="s102">They greet us, you know, first.</span> <span id="s103">(Laughter) I look at them if either one of them going to bite me, and we and friend of mine Frankie, we come over there and here they greet us.</span> <span id="s104">Right away they show us the room where we're going to sleep.</span> <span id="s105">There was two beds.</span> <span id="s106">We put the suitcases there and we wash ourselves...hands...and they invite us for the big supper, and I remember that first supper in that house.</span> <span id="s107">There was a heavy, hot stew, like an Irish stew, see.</span> <span id="s108">Half and half with the meat, you know...very good...and we was hungry though and was tasting good, and here comes the whole family.</span> <span id="s109">There was four daughters and the parents and probably about four...that time...three or four workers.</span> <span id="s110">They work for that big farm.</span> <span id="s111">There was almost winter time you see.</span> <span id="s112">Summer time they hire fourteen, fifteen people they hire for the work, and that's what our...my job begin in Austria on that farm.</span> <span id="s113">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s116">Well, the next day we didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s117">They show us, you know, what we're supposed to do and I think on Monday we work on the manure, see.</span> <span id="s118">We loaded the manure on a 01:15: wagon.</span> <span id="s119">There was a one pair ox(en) and one pair horses, and they wanted their daughter, Frieda, which is my wife now...we're going to talk about her (laughter) later on...she was working with the horses.</span> <span id="s120">Big horses.</span> <span id="s121">Oh my God, and a friend of mine Frankie...they give him the pair of oxes.</span> <span id="s122">Oxes.</span> <span id="s123">Right...I pronounce alright oxes...yes.</span> <span id="s124">And we was working with them, you know, and they put the manure on...we put the manure on a _??</span> <span id="s125">___.</span> <span id="s126">Then after that they had also about twenty acres of forest belong to that farm, so during the winter time we was cutting the woods, you know, piling, sending to the saw mill, you know.</span> <span id="s127">Yeah.</span> <span id="s128">And food was good I must say.</span> <span id="s129">Plenty food, yes.</span> <span id="s130">If I tell you there was meat twice a day you wouldn't believe even that time, and they treat us pretty good.</span> <span id="s131">You got to work.</span> <span id="s132">So long you work, put your twelve hours a day, you're alright.</span> <span id="s133">So they treat us pretty good, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: How long did you stay on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Not very long.</span> <span id="s136">See, it's happen...it's hard to explain how this happen.</span> <span id="s137">Now that Frieda, the one of the daughter...I use to help her and oh for some reason we liked each other.</span> <span id="s138">You know...I was young that time.</span> <span id="s139">She was young and we liked each other, see.</span> <span id="s140">And I think this is little bit too far gone, so the family notice something too close friendship here in between us.</span> <span id="s141">01:17: So that was on November...or before November 1941, the father had a speech to me and to Frieda.</span> <span id="s142">We know you two close together.</span> <span id="s143">You know what it is.</span> <span id="s144">She go to the concentration camp and you going to be dead man.</span> <span id="s145">One of you got to go.</span> <span id="s146">You can't stay together, so which one going to go?</span> <span id="s147">Leave the farm.</span> <span id="s148">One of us.</span> <span id="s149">Either Frieda or me.</span> <span id="s150">I says my gosh.</span> <span id="s151">This is your daughter.</span> <span id="s152">She should stay.</span> <span id="s153">Well, it's up to here, up to her.</span> <span id="s154">I don't care.</span> <span id="s155">So Frieda decided to leave the house, and I stayed.</span> <span id="s156">Yeah.</span> <span id="s157">That was something from a big house, you know, like that for a big family, very well-known family.</span> <span id="s158">She go to the unemployment office and they sent her off I should say about ten, fifteen kilometer away on a smaller farm, but soon I find out where the farm is and once a while on Sunday we meet again.</span> <span id="s159">Was nothing in between us except a very close friendship.</span> <span id="s160">OK.</span> <span id="s161">And then not long after that somebody squeal on us, so I was arrested from the Gestapo and Frieda was arrested and we was brought to 01:19: that very well-known Gestapo in Linz on the Donau in Austria.</span> <span id="s162">There was...all foreigners who was working there in Austria, they know what...what it is Gestapo in Linz, you know.</span> <span id="s163">There was the toughest Gestapo in in in Austria I should say.</span> <span id="s164">So they keep us for eleven days.</span> <span id="s165">They keep me eleven days.</span> <span id="s166">I don't know.</span> <span id="s167">Frieda I think she was thirteen days, and they couldn't prove anything because actually it was nothing between us except a good friendship so what happened they call me in one day and they says OK, we believe you.</span> <span id="s168">You had nothing to do with Frieda Greinegger (ph)...that's what her name was.</span> <span id="s169">We let you go, but 01:20: before we let you go you got to sign this paper, and there was the whole so many points, you know, what is against the law, and the very last one was to any friendship with German or Austrian girl...that sentence by hanging.</span> <span id="s170">They tell us this.</span> <span id="s171">They tell me, so you remember this.</span> <span id="s172">If you see Frieda again, you're going to be hung.</span> <span id="s173">Understand?</span> <span id="s174">Understand, OK.</span> <span id="s175">But he says here you go on the unemployment office and the unemployment office going to send you different direction where I was before...different direction of about I should say about fifteen kilometer from Linz or as by the railroad there as you go to Vienna, you know.</span> <span id="s176">Different directions, see.</span> <span id="s177">Now you go back where you were, pick up you belongings and you go on that on that farm.</span> <span id="s178">They know about and you going to work over there and remember, behave yourselves.</span> <span id="s179">Yes sir.</span> <span id="s180">I says yes sir.</span> <span id="s181">So I go to Frieda's parents where I was before, pick up my suitcase and everything and then I think that was on Monday I was going back.</span> <span id="s182">Come back to Linz on a railroad depot and waiting for my train go to that direction where I was assigned for the new farm, and you wouldn't believe how this happen.</span> <span id="s183">You you might call it coincidence, but that's what happened.</span> <span id="s184">Here I walk in a third class in Linz on a railroad and here comes the Frieda.</span> <span id="s185">But we didn't stop.</span> <span id="s186">We just go by and she told me something like follow me, so we go in a place and you got to be careful because you don't know...maybe they watch you, you know.</span> <span id="s187">Who knows.</span> <span id="s188">And then she told me she's assigned to another farm, not home.</span> <span id="s189">They didn't send her home.</span> <span id="s190">Different direction on the other side of the city, again you know.</span> <span id="s191">They try to keep us as far apart as possible see, and then she told me OK...not this Sunday, next Sunday I meet you on a Landstrasse by __??</span> <span id="s192">___.</span> <span id="s193">This is a little city _??</span> <span id="s194">__ between Linz and that farm where Frieda's parents where I was working.</span> <span id="s195">I meet you on a highway.</span> <span id="s196">Highway means, 011:23: you know, Landstrasse.</span> <span id="s197">I meet you there on certain time.</span> <span id="s198">I forgot what was it...one o'clock or two o'clock afternoon.</span> <span id="s199">I going to be on a bicycle there and I meet you there.</span> <span id="s200">I says Frieda, my gosh, suppose somebody watch us.</span> <span id="s201">You know what that means.</span> <span id="s202">She says that's alright.</span> <span id="s203">Whatever happen I want to see you then, you see.</span> <span id="s204">So good enough.</span> <span id="s205">I think there was two week after I did borrow a bicycle from my new farmer, you know, from that new farmer and he was a very fine man.</span> <span id="s206">Even so, he was a member of the party but he was just a member for of the party so he get the machineries, you know, and this and this, and they discover him after, you know, by the end.</span> <span id="s207">They find out he was fooling and and they they they draw him to the Army and he was a prisoner in English...the English took him, yeah.</span> <span id="s208">Anyway, he was a fine man.</span> <span id="s209">He says well, OK.</span> <span id="s210">You want a bicycle.</span> <span id="s211">Go.</span> <span id="s212">Now tricky was there if you want be not recognize, you got to dressed up the same as the Austrian you know, wear their suits.</span> <span id="s213">So I had a nice grey suit with the green stripes on the side, you know, how those Austrians are and their short jacket, you know.</span> <span id="s214">I don't know...Eisenhower you call it...(laughter)...the jacket and I had a green hat with a big brush (ph) in the back, you know.</span> <span id="s215">I looked like an Austrian see.</span> <span id="s216">So when I ride the bicycle nobody pay attention, you know.</span> <span id="s217">You know what I mean....you have to be dressed like that because actually for the Polish workers...first of all, you're supposed to have that P.</span> <span id="s218">There 01:25: was a square, yellow square made out of the cloth ___ and there was a purple...purple P. Ugly.</span> <span id="s219">And you have to have this, you know.</span> <span id="s220">You have to wear all the time, all the time this over here.</span> <span id="s221">Yes, I did have.</span> <span id="s222">I have on this side, see.</span> <span id="s223">If I see the police, you know, I was no way...where's your P. Yes, I got it here.</span> <span id="s224">I I got it here, yeah.</span> <span id="s225">Well, says now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s226">That's supposed to be on this side.</span> <span id="s227">Yes, it's OK.</span> <span id="s228">I put it on this side, see.</span> <span id="s229">Well, anyway and happen after two weeks I meet Frieda or whatever and she told me, she told me, you know, where the farm is.</span> <span id="s230">Matter of fact we ride over there and she show me and says next time when you come there's a woods over here.</span> <span id="s231">We're going to meet over here.</span> <span id="s232">I says Frieda, what are we doing?</span> <span id="s233">They're going to kill us, both of us.</span> <span id="s234">Maybe not you, but (laughter) they're going to hang me anyplace you know.</span> <span id="s235">And says well, Julie (ph), I like you so much.</span> <span id="s236">Tell you the truth I can't live without you.</span> <span id="s237">I says Frieda, you know what you're talking.</span> <span id="s238">This is a death sentence.</span> <span id="s239">I don't care.</span> <span id="s240">To me it's worth it.</span> <span id="s241">There you are.</span> <span id="s242">So that was going fine.</span> <span id="s243">There was a small farm which to Frieda was working.</span> <span id="s244">I was happy.</span> <span id="s245">She was happy.</span> <span id="s246">I was doing the whole work.</span> <span id="s247">I had a nice pair of horses there.</span> <span id="s248">I take care of the whole farm because the farmer, he was a little guy, you know, and he didn't want to work hard see.</span> <span id="s249">He had a new tractor there.</span> <span id="s250">Well,when there was anything to do with the tractor, he was sitting on a tractor, you know, but with the horses the most job, you know, I was doing, you know.</span> <span id="s251">He was 01:27: very glad and I was working hard and same thing Frieda was working on that little farm where she was.</span> <span id="s252">She was working fine.</span> <span id="s253">Everything was there fine, but meantime the Gestapo told the farmer where Frieda was working...look and watch it because she had something to do with Polish guy.</span> <span id="s254">If you know anything, if you notice anything, let us know.</span> <span id="s255">And good enough...how long you can hide.</span> <span id="s256">Sooner or later they found...they did find out...I don't know how...that that we was together, and he didn't make any report to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s257">So long Frieda was working there, fine.</span> <span id="s258">But Frieda make one mistake.</span> <span id="s259">She want to quit that farm and go work in a city for the airplane factory, more money, more time, you know.</span> <span id="s260">And that was the biggest mistake Frieda make.</span> <span id="s261">And that's what the trouble start right then.</span> <span id="s262">So when the little farmer where Frieda was working find out she going to quit, she call up...he call up the Gestapo and Frieda was arrested first.</span> <span id="s263">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s264">And we had a..</span> <span id="s265">.</span> <span id="s266">we had a date at that time, you know.</span> <span id="s267">That was on end of the week, yeah.</span> <span id="s268">I go over there and where we usually meet, Frieda wasn't there.</span> <span id="s269">So I had a bad feeling.</span> <span id="s270">Something happened.</span> <span id="s271">Is she sick?</span> <span id="s272">But there was no way to find out.</span> <span id="s273">But I no have to wait long to find out what happen.</span> <span id="s274">So good enough...that was I believe was on a Friday, September 19, 1941.</span> <span id="s275">We was digging potatoes.</span> <span id="s276">I was working on on my farm.</span> <span id="s277">01:29: I mean on that farm where I was working.</span> <span id="s278">I was working with the horses.</span> <span id="s279">I had that machine, you know...dig out the potatoes, and we was working afternoon.</span> <span id="s280">At noon we bring some potatoes home and we go for lunch.</span> <span id="s281">Good enough.</span> <span id="s282">We was in a dining room.</span> <span id="s283">We was eating and here to the kitchen from the other side comes the policeman and he talk, because the farmer and his wife and the old parents, they was eating in the kitchen and we was eating the workers...there was two girls and a one Frenchman, a prisoner, prisoner from the French army...Louis...he was with us.</span> <span id="s284">We was eating there and I hear in the kitchen...I hear my name and what I hear what the farmer was answering, he's very good.</span> <span id="s285">He's a hard worker.</span> <span id="s286">He's a good man, yeah.</span> <span id="s287">And he was putting down.</span> <span id="s288">Then nice, not rush, the policeman was waiting till we finish and then he come to the living room and says, Julius Noga...I was called by Julius in German.</span> <span id="s289">Julius Noga.</span> <span id="s290">I want you to dress up and pick up whatever you want to pick up and you go with me to Linz.</span> <span id="s291">I says sir, is that Gestapo?</span> <span id="s292">Yep.</span> <span id="s293">Ah...to live or not.</span> <span id="s294">I was speechless.</span> <span id="s295">I says yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s296">Come on.</span> <span id="s297">Dress you up.</span> <span id="s298">Wash you up.</span> <span id="s299">Dress you up, yeah.</span> <span id="s300">I wait for you.</span> <span id="s301">So I go to my room.</span> <span id="s302">I go to my two horses, you know.</span> <span id="s303">I clap them.</span> <span id="s304">I give them some more oats, a little more 01:31:30 hay.</span> <span id="s305">I clap them.</span> <span id="s306">I know...I know I no going to see those horses any more.</span> <span id="s307">Then I dressed up.</span> <span id="s308">He says whatever you need like shaving or equipment or whatever you need, whatever...toothpaste, brush, whatever you think, take it.</span> <span id="s309">But don't take too much.</span> <span id="s310">You don't need it.</span> <span id="s311">I know I don't need it.</span> <span id="s312">So here was another very important...I don't know how much did help.</span> <span id="s313">Now Polish worker not supposed to drive the bicycle and not supposed to ride a train.</span> <span id="s314">Now the Polish people was treated very...you know, Polish worker, you know...they're worse, you know.</span> <span id="s315">Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">Like Czechoslovak, they cannot ride their bicycle.</span> <span id="s317">They ride a train, but not Polish people.</span> <span id="s318">There was strict, very strict.</span> <span id="s319">So but many times when I go see Frieda on the other side of city, there was...I forget...oh probably what was it...forty, fifty...no, forty kilometer, so ride the bicycle was a little bit too far for me you know.</span> <span id="s320">What I was doing I go with the bicycle on a on a depot and put the bicycle in the box car, the first one always was box car there.</span> <span id="s321">Put the bicycle on the train and go to the last city, take the bicycle...you know, pay extra...it was cheap, you know, that time.</span> <span id="s322">Take the bicycle and go wherever you want to go.</span> <span id="s323">But here we come on that depot with the policeman and we supposed to go by train to the Linz what was only sixteen, eighteen kilometers, ____??</span> <span id="s324">_______, and this is close to the concentration camp Mauthausen there, that direction.</span> <span id="s325">So first thing he come to the window where they sell the tickets and that was the guy by the name Schottinger (ph).</span> <span id="s326">He used to be very good friend to my farmer and every day as I delivered the milk on six o'clock train, I delivered for him a little canned milk, see, and each time I go somewhere when he was there, he sold me the train tickets, you see.</span> <span id="s327">So the first thing the policeman asked him, did you ever sell the ticket to this to this Pole.</span> <span id="s328">He looked at me and I see in his eyes.</span> <span id="s329">He look at me.</span> <span id="s330">He understand.</span> <span id="s331">He says never.</span> <span id="s332">I says God bless you.</span> <span id="s333">I never...if I live through, you're going to be my friend.</span> <span id="s334">So OK.</span> <span id="s335">So we go outside by the track.</span> <span id="s336">We're waiting for the train and here comes the train from Vienna, and I was thinking my gosh, suppose when the train come, you know...I long before study??</span> <span id="s337">and I lay myself on a rail.</span> <span id="s338">I was ready to commit suicide, but you know, when you come to something like that, you always somewhere in the back you always had hope maybe miracle happen.</span> <span id="s339">Maybe it's too soon.</span> <span id="s340">OK.</span> <span id="s341">So we go on the train and we come to Linz and from Linz Bahnhof, railroad station.</span> <span id="s342">We walk to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s343">Straight to the Gestapo offices.</span> <span id="s344">Not to the jail.</span> <span id="s345">To the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s346">Four hardy, strong Gestapo men was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s347">Ah, you are come.</span> <span id="s348">Julius Noga.</span> <span id="s349">Ah.</span> <span id="s350">Hum.</span> <span id="s351">We're waiting for you.</span> <span id="s352">Yeah.</span> <span id="s353">Now you're not going to tell us this time.</span> <span id="s354">You remember 01:36: you sign that list you no going to have...I mean you're not going to have nothing to do with the Austrian girl.</span> <span id="s355">You remember that.</span> <span id="s356">Here it is.</span> <span id="s357">Did you sign that?</span> <span id="s358">Yeah.</span> <span id="s359">Now, and you're still with her, right.</span> <span id="s360">I says no.</span> <span id="s361">What?</span> <span id="s362">You no see Fraulein Greinegger?</span> <span id="s363">No.</span> <span id="s364">Hmm.</span> <span id="s365">Hey, Hans, he says he didn't see her.</span> <span id="s366">You know what the guy...one talked to the other one.</span> <span id="s367">Well, you know...he's liar, you know.</span> <span id="s368">He says you son of a so-and-so.</span> <span id="s369">You Sau (pig).</span> <span id="s370">Pow.</span> <span id="s371">Pow.</span> <span id="s372">Pow.</span> <span id="s373">And there was standing those four guys...they were standing around.</span> <span id="s374">I was in the middle, you know, and I bouncing off on one on the other one.</span> <span id="s375">Oh my gosh...one of them hit me in the nose.</span> <span id="s376">Blood come out.</span> <span id="s377">OK.</span> <span id="s378">Yeah.</span> <span id="s379">Wash yourself.</span> <span id="s380">There was a sink there.</span> <span id="s381">Wash yourself.</span> <span id="s382">Sit down.</span> <span id="s383">Now don't be foolish, he says.</span> <span id="s384">We're going to beat you.</span> <span id="s385">You're going to be black.</span> <span id="s386">Tell us the truth.</span> <span id="s387">Are you with Frieda Greinegger or not?</span> <span id="s388">I says no.</span> <span id="s389">Oh my gosh, look at you.</span> <span id="s390">Oh, they make a joke, you know, how they had a fun with me.</span> <span id="s391">Then two other guys go and, you know, they hear...they heard somebody, you know.</span> <span id="s392">They open the door.</span> <span id="s393">They in that office...there are so many offices.</span> <span id="s394">Says well you got tough customer over here huh.</span> <span id="s395">Well, maybe we'll help you.</span> <span id="s396">Pow, pow, you know.</span> <span id="s397">And oh right away, you know, I start swoll up, you know, on this.</span> <span id="s398">Are you going to tell us the truth?</span> <span id="s399">I says I told you the truth.</span> <span id="s400">What?</span> <span id="s401">I have nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s402">He says oh my gosh...then they give me some more.</span> <span id="s403">Then one of the interpreters...he was a 01:38: Gestapo man and he speak fluently Polish, and he told me in Polish language, look, we got all evidence.</span> <span id="s404">You meet her so many times in Ginskirchen.</span> <span id="s405">Ginskirchen means where Frieda was working there on that small farm, and we also know Frieda come to your place too, and you tell us you you have nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s406">I says no.</span> <span id="s407">He says don't...you know...they they try to help me, you know, in this time.</span> <span id="s408">Says oh, OK.</span> <span id="s409">We don't want to hit you no more.</span> <span id="s410">Wait.</span> <span id="s411">And says go get the Frieda.</span> <span id="s412">She was there in a different office.</span> <span id="s413">My gosh.</span> <span id="s414">I open my eyes.</span> <span id="s415">She was crying when she come.</span> <span id="s416">Sit down, Fraulein Greinegger.</span> <span id="s417">Would you please told this guy here you see each other many times by many occasions and they already they already get it from her, you know, how the woman is soft, you know.</span> <span id="s418">They tell her look...if you won't tell us the truth, you'll never come out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s419">You're going to die in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s420">You better tell us the truth.</span> <span id="s421">Maybe we can help you.</span> <span id="s422">And how did you come out from that big house with the rich, very well-know family?</span> <span id="s423">How did you come to have something to do with a guy, a Pole worker?</span> <span id="s424">He was working for your parents.</span> <span id="s425">How did you come?</span> <span id="s426">What you got to do with him?</span> <span id="s427">You're beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s428">And this is true, because she was...she was beautiful.</span> <span id="s429">01:40: I got the picture.</span> <span id="s430">She had three sisters and all of them was beautiful.</span> <span id="s431">And she start cry.</span> <span id="s432">She didn't answer, but they say OK, you tell him, and she says yes.</span> <span id="s433">We meet.</span> <span id="s434">How many times?</span> <span id="s435">I don't know how many times.</span> <span id="s436">OK.</span> <span id="s437">Now, what you got to say, they ask me.</span> <span id="s438">You see, if you tell us from the beginning we wouldn't hit you that much.</span> <span id="s439">OK.</span> <span id="s440">So that's all what they want to know.</span> <span id="s441">We talk some more tomorrow to you.</span> <span id="s442">Go outside and face the wall close.</span> <span id="s443">One of them bring me there and when you go on a on a wall, you stay close to the wall and face the wall, see.</span> <span id="s444">Face the wall like this.</span> <span id="s445">And don't turn, you know.</span> <span id="s446">And you stay there, and they took Frieda there.</span> <span id="s447">I don't know where they took her and then I see this is it.</span> <span id="s448">And then next day they ask some more question.</span> <span id="s449">They take the pictures from three sides...from the front, from this side, from this side...they took the picture.</span> <span id="s450">They took us to the...of course, there was more prisoners...they took us to the doctor.</span> <span id="s451">They weighed us.</span> <span id="s452">They measure us.</span> <span id="s453">You know, I don't know why they did it, but they did it.</span> <span id="s454">Oh, when we come to that doctor that was something.</span> <span id="s455">That was a private doctor, a private practice this doctor.</span> <span id="s456">And the Gestapo man...there was four of us and we was...we had that what you call it...that chain, handcuff and there in the office there was a a window or there was a bar on the window, bars, and he chain us to that bar and here was civilian people sitting, you know, and they shake their hand you know, and he looked at it, you know.</span> <span id="s457">He probably...they feel good so he unchain us there 01:42:30 and he keep the eye on us.</span> <span id="s458">Yeah.</span> <span id="s459">Well, from then there was more and more question.</span> <span id="s460">They didn't hit me no more after that.</span> <span id="s461">Yeah.</span> <span id="s462">OK.</span> <span id="s463">And good enough.</span> <span id="s464">When they finish...when they bring me to that jail on in Linz on Mozart Strasse, Polizei Presidium that's the name was... there was a very modern jail, built in 1938.</span> <span id="s465">Everything push button.</span> <span id="s466">Clean.</span> <span id="s467">Very very tough.</span> <span id="s468">There was no way to run away from that jail.</span> <span id="s469">No way.</span> <span id="s470">So from my previous...from my last year experience I know that cell Cell Number Five...they peel the potatoes, and I knew they had enough food, so in our office before they give me the cell, I asked the inspector would you please put me on cellar...on Cell Five.</span> <span id="s471">He says well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s472">I think Cell Five is crowded, but he call up that guard there, ask you got room on Cell Five for one more man, and I remember that guard name...Rollinger (ph)...blond guy, tall guy.</span> <span id="s473">He says oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s474">I have room for another guy.</span> <span id="s475">They put me on on Cell Number Five, and good enough.</span> <span id="s476">We peel the potatoes.</span> <span id="s477">Before noon we peeled boiler potatoes and we had a salt and boiled potatoes you can eat how much you want, you know, and then afternoon whatever left over, they give us the leftover too, so that was plenty food there.</span> <span id="s478">So that was good.</span> <span id="s479">That was good.</span> <span id="s480">That was in November.</span> <span id="s481">Short before Christmas, the Gestapo...I don't know for what reason take us, about thirteen guys, put us in a black van and bring us to another city closer to the previous farm where Frieda's parents are.</span> <span id="s482">Was the next city though, pretty 01:45; good sized city and they put us in an old jail and I remember the the street, SA Strasse.</span> <span id="s483">And there was a very small jail, very old prison and we stayed there over the Christmas and during the winter two guys come from Linz, from the headquarters, a prisoner, Polish guy, and they tell us what the Gestapo do.</span> <span id="s484">They hanging people in the woods and they send to the concentration camp and you...it's going to happen same thing to us.</span> <span id="s485">So what should we do?</span> <span id="s486">My gosh...this is occasion over here.</span> <span id="s487">We might have a chance to run away from this, from this jail see.</span> <span id="s488">There was two old guards and the inspector and that was the ??</span> <span id="s489">_____ how many prisoners there.</span> <span id="s490">They coming and going oh maybe twenty, thirty prisoners, you know.</span> <span id="s491">They coming for short time, you know, like those guys don't want to work on a farm or do some something wrong, you know, and they give them for the...they give them for the few...jail for the few days.</span> <span id="s492">You are no bread, nothing and no food and they keep them three, four, five days hungry, you know, and they give them good advice, you know.</span> <span id="s493">Go back and work.</span> <span id="s494">Next time when you come, we going to keep you here two weeks without the food or we're going to send you to the concentration camp, so they they scared the people.</span> <span id="s495">OK.</span> <span id="s496">So now here what we're doing here...what's the what's the reason they bring us over here.</span> <span id="s497">Nobody knows, but those two guys tell us we better run away if we got chance.</span> <span id="s498">OK.</span> <span id="s499">So how we going to run away?</span> <span id="s500">There was thirteen guys all together, all Polish.</span> <span id="s501">We was on that cell, so one of them was shoemaker.</span> <span id="s502">Walter was his name.</span> <span id="s503">He was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s504">He says you...that bar in the window, if we cut just one of them and we lifted it, we can go through, and there was a screen, thin screen.</span> <span id="s505">If you cut just the one, you you you can make a hole.</span> <span id="s506">You can open it, see.</span> <span id="s507">Yeah.</span> <span id="s508">But where we going to get the saw.</span> <span id="s509">He says well, we got to figure out something, so next morning we go...in the morning we go on a on a hall for.</span> <span id="s510">.</span> <span id="s511">there was a big sink where we washed ourselves and then you can go toilet there and there was a guy and he had those high boots.</span> <span id="s512">A guy...he was just a short for one week.</span> <span id="s513">He had 01:48: those high, high boots and then Walter looked at those boots and he says my gosh, I know...I'm shoemaker...I know this...in those boots, you know, there's strip of metal, of good steel.</span> <span id="s514">He said maybe we can make a saw out of this.</span> <span id="s515">So Walter go and talk to him...how long you are here.</span> <span id="s516">Oh I'm here already third day.</span> <span id="s517">You hungry?</span> <span id="s518">Oh my gosh, I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s519">I didn't eat for three days.</span> <span id="s520">He says look, you want to sell those boots?</span> <span id="s521">Yeah.</span> <span id="s522">Yeah.</span> <span id="s523">Look, we give you ...we exchange.</span> <span id="s524">We exchange, or something like that.</span> <span id="s525">We exchange the shoes...you you need the shoes, yeah, and we give you half a loaf bread for the...good, good.</span> <span id="s526">OK.</span> <span id="s527">So we give those pieces, make a half a loaf, and we get them.</span> <span id="s528">You'd be surprised.</span> <span id="s529">He pull out those steel plates, you know, narrow one, steel.</span> <span id="s530">This is a good steel.</span> <span id="s531">Now, how we going to make a saw now?</span> <span id="s532">OK.</span> <span id="s533">Figure out.</span> <span id="s534">Walter says why don't we break the shoe and call up the guard.</span> <span id="s535">Maybe they got the hammer and some nails, you know, fixed up the, you know, sole, you know.</span> <span id="s536">Good enough.</span> <span id="s537">Pushed the button.</span> <span id="s538">The old guard come...Austrian with their big mustache...yeah...he smoked a pipe, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">What is it?</span> <span id="s540">Oh I says Herr Wachmeister, Wachmeister 01:50: you call him, the guy...look, my shoes is broke.</span> <span id="s541">You you got hammer and something we can fix?</span> <span id="s542">Well, yes.</span> <span id="s543">I look.</span> <span id="s544">I think we got something upstairs, yes.</span> <span id="s545">So he go upstairs.</span> <span id="s546">He come not only with the hammer and nails, short nails, but he bring us that what you call that steel stand like for the shoes, you know, ___??</span> <span id="s547">______.</span> <span id="s548">I don't know what you call that ...like you fix the soles...you you you put on that steel plate like, you know, made like a lace (ph) or something, you know.</span> <span id="s549">Steel lace I should say.</span> <span id="s550">OK.</span> <span id="s551">So Walter...Walter says look.</span> <span id="s552">How we going to make it?</span> <span id="s553">So we put those two plates close, right?</span> <span id="s554">Another guy hit with the hammer and we go like this.</span> <span id="s555">We go like this, and when they get two saws in one.</span> <span id="s556">How whether the saw going to cut now?</span> <span id="s557">Now we're going to try out, and that that was the week before Palm Sunday in April 1942.</span> <span id="s558">OK.</span> <span id="s559">So the very first night we start...we tried that saw, and by gosh, you'd be surprised how that saw was cutting the bar.</span> <span id="s560">We couldn't...we couldn't cut just like that, you know, steady.</span> <span id="s561">No.</span> <span id="s562">They upstairs.</span> <span id="s563">Maybe somebody hear, so we tied the bar with the blanket and go just a little bit, slow you know, and believe me...about four o'clock in the morning...we start about nine o'clock in the evening to cut little by little.</span> <span id="s564">About four o'clock in the morning we got that through and there was a square bar, I should say one inch by one inch thick.</span> <span id="s565">And good enough there was not so tight together, so we cut the second one on the bottom.</span> <span id="s566">There was only one cross bar in the middle, so we figured out when we cut it on the bottom, so we grab it and bend it up and this was big enough...what we had to do just to the thin screen was outside...just cut the once you know, and then we run away.</span> <span id="s567">Then...but before we did it, we swear, we make a promise...we go all of us, thirteen guys.</span> <span id="s568">We go out, and we all decided to run away.</span> <span id="s569">OK.</span> <span id="s570">And that that night going to be Palm Sunday, Saturday before the Palm Sunday, so Palm Sunday we going to be 01:53: out.</span> <span id="s571">OK.</span> <span id="s572">Good enough.</span> <span id="s573">Then that night comes, the Saturday, and we pray as usual.</span> <span id="s574">We had a supper.</span> <span id="s575">We go a little bit early to the sleep but meantime I forgot to tell you...the very same day one of the guard come and he says he needed two men for some kind of work there, for short time, so he took two guys and they were there oh I'd say for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s576">Then they coming back, and that bar was already cut, so when they come back we ask, did the guard ask you something?</span> <span id="s577">Did he notice...notice anything?</span> <span id="s578">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s579">He didn't say...he didn't ask no question, no no.</span> <span id="s580">They don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s581">OK.</span> <span id="s582">So tonight we're going to go.</span> <span id="s583">Good enough.</span> <span id="s584">So that that that evening, after the supper, we go a little bit early and we're going to start around ten o'clock.</span> <span id="s585">We're going to go out.</span> <span id="s586">And we already had plans, you know...I go with you and you go with him, you know...all different direction and we make agreement we going to walk, run away only by night.</span> <span id="s587">If we have to go by the by the day, we have to have either shovel or fork or something carry, you know, make believe you go to the work so you won't be stopped by the by the policemen when you go far, and the first night we got to go as far, as far away, and there was a river over there and we should pass that river.</span> <span id="s588">It wasn't very deep.</span> <span id="s589">We should pass that river for one reason...when they chase us with the dogs, when the dogs come into the water...that's what we understand that time...they going to loose their tracks, see.</span> <span id="s590">Good enough.</span> <span id="s591">So that night we go early bed and we wasn't...it wasn't long we hear the guards come, open our cell and the inspector was with them, and first thing he ask why you guys going so early sleep tonight.</span> <span id="s592">Nobody says nothing.</span> <span

and the two other prisoners were transferred to Cell One?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s636">That was a cell called in German Korrection (ph) cell.</span> <span id="s637">Now, what is correction cell?</span> <span id="s638">This is windowless cell, dark, concrete on the floor and there was three of us...me, Walter _____ and John Jachinsky...Yachinsky, and for three of us they give us only one blanket and that was the Holy Week before Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s639">We spent the whole week over there and Easter over there.</span> <span id="s640">That was very sad because we couldn't see much, but you after you stay so in a dark cell for a while, you know, you beginning to see (laughter)...right.</span> <span id="s641">So after Easter...that was on Tuesday... they send a Gestapo man, happen he was photographer.</span> <span id="s642">That's the guy make those pictures, first one when we was arrested, and he come and pick me up.</span> <span id="s643">That was on Tuesday, and he chain my hands.</span> <span id="s644">He want to chain my hands in the back and I beg him to chain my my hands on on on the front, handcuff.</span> <span id="s645">And we go on a railroad depot and I remember there was so many German soldiers was going on a east front, Russia, was ____ there, but we come with the regular train from ____ to Linz what is like I said fifteen kilometer, something like that 02:02: and that was a third class train.</span> <span id="s646">There was a one lady sitting there and he excuse her...would you please leave this compartment or what you call that part of the train and there was a window open.</span> <span id="s647">He closed that window and I was sit there vis-a-vis with him.</span> <span id="s648">And that time I was in a good mood for some reason.</span> <span id="s649">I know this is my last days, you know.</span> <span id="s650">I know what they going to do me.</span> <span id="s651">I was so sure, hundred percent sure I was, but I was wrong.</span> <span id="s652">And I say ...I look at it through the window from from the from the train.</span> <span id="s653">I see how they work in the field.</span> <span id="s654">Somebody was plowing there with the horses, you know, and it reminds me how I use to plow the ground there on the last farm where I was.</span> <span id="s655">How much I would give to change the place with that guy who was plowing that that land, that land there, and then I start joking with the Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s656">I..</span> <span id="s657">.</span> <span id="s658">I didn't care whatever they going to do.</span> <span id="s659">I know what they going to do to me.</span> <span id="s660">I says hey Inspector.</span> <span id="s661">So I know the Gestapo going to hang me or they probably going to hang hang me or they going to shoot me, so which...what they going...you can talk to me, you know.</span> <span id="s662">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s663">I know you going to kill me anyway.</span> <span id="s664">He says who told you that.</span> <span id="s665">I says there was a two guys come over there in a ___ in the cell and they tell us how many already you hanged and 02:04 how many already you shoot.</span> <span id="s666">I was so open I I didn't give a damn, you know.</span> <span id="s667">I was _____.</span> <span id="s668">He says no, you not going to be hanged and you you not going to be shot.</span> <span id="s669">Gestapo want to see you and ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s670">I says what Gestapo want to know more.</span> <span id="s671">Gestapo knows everything about me.</span> <span id="s672">He says well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s673">Don't ask me.</span> <span id="s674">I don't know what they want to ask you.</span> <span id="s675">He says yeah.</span> <span id="s676">So was sitting there, sitting, you know.</span> <span id="s677">Then again, you know, I asked hey Inspector, so when this going to be?</span> <span id="s678">Today or...it's early in the morning, you know, you still got time when...today or tomorrow?</span> <span id="s679">And where they going to go?</span> <span id="s680">Where I was working there, because usually what they did in a cases like that, they take the guy they want to hang.</span> <span id="s681">They...day before they call up all foreigners on certain day.</span> <span id="s682">Next day certain day in the woods where they going to hang that man, you know, in the woods.</span> <span id="s683">So they show...so they scare him, say you no work.</span> <span id="s684">If you not listen, that's going to happen same thing to you, see, so I says you going to probably...you going to bring me to ____?</span> <span id="s685">Sankt Florian, that's the place was the __?</span> <span id="s686">___ and probably and go somewhere in the woods you going to hang me.</span> <span id="s687">Then he was little bit upset.</span> <span id="s688">He says now listen.</span> <span id="s689">I no want to hear that from you.</span> <span id="s690">I tell you once you not going to be hanged and you not going to be shot.</span> <span id="s691">We go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s692">Well, good enough.</span> <span id="s693">So we come to the Linz on the same very familiar railroad station, yeah, and from the from that station to the Gestapo, not to the jail on Mozartstrasse.</span> <span id="s694">We was walking.</span> <span id="s695">So I come to the office and in the office they open a book and they 02:06: look at my name.</span> <span id="s696">Says oh...that's the one was involved in boycotting in Vels?</span> <span id="s697">____.</span> <span id="s698">He's danger.</span> <span id="s699">Ah ha.</span> <span id="s700">It says you guys cut the bar.</span> <span id="s701">You want to run away, what you heading...which you was thinking.</span> <span id="s702">Where you turn wrong...where?</span> <span id="s703">Where?</span> <span id="s704">How can you hiding?</span> <span id="s705">I says well, we try...you know...I I don't care.</span> <span id="s706">I know I'm dead man anyway.</span> <span id="s707">So I says hey Inspector, would you please do me one favor?</span> <span id="s708">Yes, what is it?</span> <span id="s709">Would you please put me on on Cell again Number Five?</span> <span id="s710">He says, ah you hungry.</span> <span id="s711">Not quite.</span> <span id="s712">I like to peel the potatoes before I die.</span> <span id="s713">What?</span> <span id="s714">Before you die?</span> <span id="s715">Who told you you going to die.</span> <span id="s716">I says I got that feeling.</span> <span id="s717">Ah, forget it.</span> <span id="s718">So they call up the guard and they put me on Cell Five, and thanks God, because from April after the Easter up to August 1st I believe, I was on Cell Five.</span> <span id="s719">We had plenty food.</span> <span id="s720">Nothing special...potatoes, carrots, carrots, beets, whatever we had, you know, but we fill up the stomach, you know, and matter of fact I I gained some pounds, you know, in that cell.</span> <span id="s721">On August 1st, on the evening, I remember, again the _____, you know, that tall guy, the guard come with the pink sheets and says Julius Noga.</span> <span id="s722">Sign this here.</span> <span id="s723">We already know pink sheets what means...concentration camp.</span> <span id="s724">I said so I says OK Herr Wachmeister, when?</span> <span id="s725">Tomorrow?</span> <span id="s726">Yeah, tomorrow you go Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s727">And we hear something about Flossenberg, that that's supposed to be tough concentration camp.</span> <span id="s728">I thought they going to send me in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s729">No, but for some reason they send me in Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s730">So next day, OK.</span> <span id="s731">They pick up...I believe there was forty-six of us.</span> <span id="s732">I was the only one Pole, Polish guy in this transport.</span> <span id="s733">They cuff our hands two and two, and they bring us down to the garage down below and they put us on a bus without a top, that bus what they usually bring the prisoners from the from the jail to the Gestapo building what was in a city there, a new building, yeah.</span> <span id="s734">They bring us on a rail depot and they put us on a on a railroad car and that was small compartments you call it... three men or four men to the one compartment, yeah, and two of them can sit and two of them stand and then we change, you know.</span> <span id="s735">So we come as far as Salzburg in 02:09: Austria.</span> <span id="s736">Then in Salzburg we stay overnight...some kind of old jail, big cell, all of us was laying there.</span> <span id="s737">There was some mattresses on the floor and we stay over night and this is very interesting because all documents in a concentration camp and on the Gestapo, all documents from the foreigners was destroyed, but Salzburg, that jail for some reason I don't understand even when you go today, when you call up, they keep that record and says Julian Noga stay over night here in a on the way to concentration camp to Flossenberg, and this is the only evidence there in Austria where is I was sent to concentration camp Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s738">I got some other witnesses, but that's what is still, you know, the the the best proof, you know, I was on the way to Flossenberg, so the next stop was we stay overnight from Salzburg in Munich.</span> <span id="s739">Also in some kind of jail, and this what I meet...how should I say...my good luck.</span> <span id="s740">As we was there was late in the evening.</span> <span id="s741">They bring a tall guy, brunette, tall guy, strong guy by the name Hans Bauer (ph).</span> <span id="s742">Now Hans Bauer was in a German jail for ten years.</span> <span id="s743">He served his term and the and he was free, but the Gestapo was waiting for him and pick him up and put him in a concentration camp like they did with all others, criminals were told that.</span> <span id="s744">So always you serve your term in a jail like Hans Bauer ten years, but the Gestapo, they decided, you know, he's too dangerous to be free so they put him in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s745">Now he was poor, that guy.</span> <span id="s746">He didn't have nothing and happen when I was there in Linz on Cell Five some of those guys will clean up on the Gestapo there and pick up the cigarettes, you know, butts, you know.</span> <span id="s747">We had plenty tobacco and we...those newcomers come and they had some cigarettes and from the office we had one guard so he bring the cigarettes on the cell, you know, because what you say black marketing was when going all over, so I had plenty cigarettes and I had a nice bag of tobacco, so I give...he was a heavy smoker that Hans Bower.</span> <span id="s748">I give him one pack of cigarettes and he was appreciate it so much and he says what is your name.</span> <span id="s749">I says Julius, because they usually call me Julius.</span> <span id="s750">OK.</span> <span id="s751">I remember this.</span> <span id="s752">Now what it was soon after we come to the concentration camp, but before we come to that, now then from Munich we go to a little town, the last 02:13: railroad station by the name Floss (ph).</span> <span id="s753">It is close to the concentration camp Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s754">Now there the SS with the black vans, they was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s755">And how they greet us when we step out from the train...with the whips, the long whips and they call us all kind of names.</span> <span id="s756">Lauese (ph), lice...and they pack us, you know, in that black vans there and shut the door and we was standing so packed, you know.</span> <span id="s757">And we come to the concentration camp and when they open the door, you couldn't see nothing when we was...and that was probably from Floss to concentration camp wasn't that far...was maybe three kilometer, not more than five kilometer and here they open the door and we looking around.</span> <span id="s758">We had not much time.</span> <span id="s759">My gosh...we see the watch towers and the wires and those guards there, and and right away they put us in a washroom which was few stairs...I don't know...about five, six stairs down.</span> <span id="s760">They put us there and they push us and they hit us with the whips and that's when we take the clothes off and they give us nice cold shower.</span> <span id="s761">Of course, that was summer.</span> <span id="s762">That was beginning of the August, but (laughter) you take a really cold shower, you feel it, and they put the hose, you know, they had a big hose with the water.</span> <span id="s763">They put the hose, you know, just like the animals, you know.</span> <span id="s764">OK.</span> <span id="s765">And they give us the striped suit what I going to show you later on, but some are striped white and blue, thin.</span> <span id="s766">Thin fabric.</span> <span id="s767">Yeah.</span> <span id="s768">OK.</span> <span id="s769">And then they bring us on a on a newcomer so-called, new-comers barrack and they keep us there for fourteen days, for two weeks.</span> <span id="s770">The only thing they didn't give us the shoes those fourteen days and every day in the morning they call us to the Politische Abteilung, means to the political bureau, and they ask us...everyone of us...you know, one by one, all questions, you know...where you was born, where, how, this, how come, how you come over here, and they had this all reported.</span> <span id="s771">But they ask you, see.</span> <span id="s772">Then I remember just a short ...I give you example.</span> <span id="s773">There was a guy asking question.</span> <span id="s774">Ah he was not even high officer.</span> <span id="s775">He was some kind of like a corporal, SS, and he was sitting on a table, you know, and play with the feet, you know...he look at me.</span> <span id="s776">He asked me question like this...you know why you are here?</span> <span id="s777">I says yeah.</span> <span id="s778">Why?</span> <span id="s779">Well, because I was too close friend to the Austrian girl.</span> <span id="s780">He laugh at me and he says no.</span> <span id="s781">You here to pay for those all German soldiers was killed in in a in a city by the name Bedgost??</span> <span id="s782">in Poland.</span> <span id="s783">I know that's 02:16:20 later on I find out because I asked so many people why, why, why he ask me questions.</span> <span id="s784">Bedgost.</span> <span id="s785">Who is ____?</span> <span id="s786">I know that _____ they had a big factories, clothing factories, something like that.</span> <span id="s787">I don't even know where is ____ you know.</span> <span id="s788">Far away from from Tarnow.</span> <span id="s789">I says sir, I never was in Bedgost_.</span> <span id="s790">What?</span> <span id="s791">Macht nichts.</span> <span id="s792">But you pay for those German soldiers was killed in Bedgost.</span> <span id="s793">Now after I find out, yes.</span> <span id="s794">There was a ____.</span> <span id="s795">Even before the war start, there was so many Germans living there in the ____ and Germans started it.</span> <span id="s796">When the people come out of the church, you know, there was some shooting, you know, something like that, so the Polish people go after, after those German and after the Germans come, the soldiers, you know...that was something very unusual and that's what he probably was there and he remembered this and that's probably...that's what he told me.</span> <span id="s797">OK, sir, if you say so...fine.</span> <span id="s798">OK.</span> <span id="s799">Raus.</span> <span id="s800">He chased me out and good thing he no even slap me, you know.</span> <span id="s801">But other guys, some of them, he beat.</span> <span id="s802">He kick, you know.</span> <span id="s803">Mean, mean bastard, you know.</span> <span id="s804">Oh mean, mean.</span> <span id="s805">So what we was doing after that...OK.</span> <span id="s806">After they asked...so they had a kapo.</span> <span id="s807">Kapo was like a foreman.</span> <span id="s808">Kapo comes from an Italian word, language...kapo, which means foreman.</span> <span id="s809">He had a long whip and he let us run five...five men in one row.</span> <span id="s810">How many was there?</span> <span id="s811">Oh gosh...I don't know.</span> <span id="s812">Maybe fifty, maybe hundred.</span> <span id="s813">He let us run, run there, on Appellplatz which means the roll call square, in a meadow, and there was no blacktop.</span> <span id="s814">There was just a like a rough gravel.</span> <span id="s815">Pretty smooth but not too smooth, and you imagine...no shoes.</span> <span id="s816">And we had...we had to run all way around, you know, and he play with us, you know.</span> <span id="s817">He hit us with the things you know.</span> <span id="s818">So they keep us for fourteen days and teach us all those rules in a concentration camp and the best thing what they tell us, you know, one of the guy...he was a prisoner, a German prisoner, criminal, the kapo.</span> <span id="s819">I remember his number.</span> <span id="s820">He had a green triangle and his number was very low...number 14.</span> <span id="s821">And I think his name was Paul.</span> <span id="s822">Big man.</span> <span id="s823">He say now while you are here, you're going to work twelve hours.</span> <span id="s824">See that quarry over there.</span> <span id="s825">You're going to work in that quarry.</span> <span id="s826">Most of you.</span> <span id="s827">Twelve hours a day.</span> <span id="s828">Here is the eighth what you call commandment of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s829">I forgot how you name it, you know, but those you know, you you got to work.</span> <span id="s830">You got to be good, you know.</span> <span id="s831">You got to listen this and this and 02:20: this.</span> <span id="s832">And if you not listen to this, for stealing, stealing bread was death sentence.</span> <span id="s833">For the little thing you get twenty-five whips on your rear end.</span> <span id="s834">And then he says oh yes, you can go free from this.</span> <span id="s835">Of course, you go...you had the on the entrance you had that writing arbeit mach frei (ph)...just the baloney, you know.</span> <span id="s836">Nobody go free there.</span> <span id="s837">He says but yes, you can go free.</span> <span id="s838">You see that chimney on the crematorium there?</span> <span id="s839">That's the way you go to freedom.</span> <span id="s840">So I thought my gosh...and you look at those all wires, double wires.</span> <span id="s841">You know, the first first was I don't know...three, four meter high, barbed wire and on the bottom there was a big rows you know, the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s842">And the second one probably oh about thirty inches, three foot.</span> <span id="s843">There was the electric wires.</span> <span id="s844">Smooth electric wire, pretty close together.</span> <span id="s845">Five thousand volts, so if you touch it, you burn, and I saw that too, you know, what can happen when the person start turn blue and black, you know.</span> <span id="s846">OK.</span> <span id="s847">Thanks God...my gosh, you know, now that's the life supposed to be so I start...somehow I start thinking now it's going to be impossible.</span> <span id="s848">I got to prepare myself to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s849">OK.</span> <span id="s850">So after fourteen days they one morning...oh, by by the way...you get up four o'clock...four thirty in the morning.</span> <span id="s851">That's get up.</span> <span id="s852">Aufstehen, you know.</span> <span id="s853">Hear the whistle somewhere.</span> <span id="s854">Aufstehen somebody screamed somewhere.</span> <span id="s855">Then you got to get up fast, make your bed, go in the washroom, take your shirts off up to here, wash yourselves and make ready and go out.</span> <span id="s856">Go out by the barrack and the block man...block man...that's the German prisoner.</span> <span id="s857">He was responsible for the block, for the barrack, barrack.</span> <span id="s858">He count you.</span> <span id="s859">There on the SS fuehrer, block fuehrer you called it...one of the SS take care of the...for instance, by block was number nine.</span> <span id="s860">He come and the block man make a report to him, so many men go ready go to work, so many men is sick, so many die over night.</span> <span id="s861">We say four, five, six men die over the night, so he make this report.</span> <span id="s862">OK.</span> <span id="s863">Then the block nine was way high as you go...in the middle the blocks was on both sides and there was hundred two stairs.</span> <span id="s864">There was few steps and there was a level ground and there was one barrack on one side and the other one on the other side, and again few steps up and two barracks and a few steps up, so I was pretty block nine on the right hand side was I think second or third before the last one on the right hand side, so when you looked from block nine, when you looked down to the square, to the roll call, you see everything.</span> <span id="s865">You see the cremation building, you know.</span> <span id="s866">I had a very few view from block nine, so OK.</span> <span id="s867">So after fourteen days they took us early in the morning and they bring us to the 02:24: quarry.</span> <span id="s868">They give us shoes too, with the wooden sole and that's why I got the original picture because as I show here and I going to leave that picture, my picture from the first day in the concentration camp hangs there today in a museum in Flossunberg and this is a big format of the picture, so when I was there two years ago, when I saw myself on that picture, I thought I going to faint.</span> <span id="s869">My legs go down and I call my wife.</span> <span id="s870">My wife was with me, my daughter, my son and I show them that, so that was something...excuse me...and I remember exactly that time when that picture was taken.</span> <span id="s871">It was the first day in a quarry and that was at noon when we get the soup.</span> <span id="s872">We was waiting for the soup.</span> <span id="s873">You're going to see that picture.</span> <span id="s874">We are going to show later on, and there was a little SS, red hair with a big black camera like a like an accordion I should say (laughter).</span> <span id="s875">And why I remember so good because we was joking from that guy.</span> <span id="s876">How come they pick him up for the SS because usually when they pick up a man for the SS they got to be tall...you got to be perfect, see.</span> <span id="s877">But somehow (laughter) they pick him up.</span> <span id="s878">He was a little guy, red hair.</span> <span id="s879">Anyway, he make that picture and I remember that day and that picture was made as I can remember as I come to Flossenburg on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us there.</span> <span id="s880">It must be around August 18, 19 or maybe 20th that picture was made.</span> <span id="s881">How this picture survived, how they get it, how they put it there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s882">But I'm there see, and then on a in a quarry they put me in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando.</span> <span id="s883">Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't remember...was four of us, six of us, few gangs like that...our job was going in a quarry way deep with a dynamite that granite night before, and those big blocks granite...we put the chain around and the big crane was on top of it.</span> <span id="s884">He pick up those big blocks and bring on a level and then those blocks, they was cut again for the smaller pieces.</span> <span id="s885">So I was there for few weeks and that was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s886">Some time the whole block slipped, you know.</span> <span id="s887">We didn't put the chain right, you know, somehow, and there were so many accidents there.</span> <span id="s888">That was that was very danger(ous).</span> <span id="s889">Now why I say this picture was made in a first day in a quarry.</span> <span id="s890">Because on that picture I got the shoes with the wooden sole and after a while I was assigned for those Kette Kommando...put the chains on...what was so much climbing, they give me leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I remember that that was the first day in a in a quarry.</span> <span id="s891">OK.</span> <span id="s892">So after a few weeks they...for some reason one morning they put me on a barrack...they take me off from this kommando.</span> <span id="s893">We call it kommando...you know, the gang.</span> <span id="s894">And they put me on on cell number 12 to learn how to work out and make pieces out of the granite, so my first teacher there was another prisoner, old prisoner, a Czechoslovak.</span> <span id="s895">I remember his name.</span> <span id="s896">Very nice man.</span> <span id="s897">Franco Cerevani_ and he teach me how there do this granite.</span> <span id="s898">What we was doing we was making the stone for the corpse, for the sidewalks and for the kilometer posts, for the streets those... in Germany you got though made out of the granite, little squares, you know.</span> <span id="s899">When you see sometime those streets in Germany made out of the granite, you know in different designs, see...those kind of squares we was making and also we was making stones for the buildings.</span> <span id="s900">For instance, many buildings in Germany, they're made out of granite.</span> <span id="s901">Matter of fact the Politische Abteilung building there, later on we put there.</span> <span id="s902">Pol.</span> <span id="s903">Abt.</span> <span id="s904">means the all political bureaus was there, the whole concentration camp commandant, wheels...they had offices there, and matter of fact I got my probably...I can't remember exactly...four or five stones underneath the roof and they're in a shape like used to call them cocquils...special made.</span> <span id="s905">They stick out on the ____ roof and they're in a shape like half-rounded, you know, and two years ago I was there and I show my wife, my daughter and my son, look...I don't know which one but I know this is four or five of them, those stones, I make it, see.</span> <span id="s906">And also we was making stones for the bridges.</span> <span id="s907">That time they build up the autostrada (ph)...the big way you call it...and by each bridge on the side, those walls, they was using those big blocks.</span> <span id="s908">We...there there was a name Soldaten Steine.</span> <span id="s909">Yeah.</span> <span id="s910">That's the name was, and that's what the work was.</span> <span id="s911">First few 02:30:30 weeks that was terrible, you know.</span> <span id="s912">I thought I not going to make it see.</span> <span id="s913">My hand...you...that was all hand-work, you know.</span> <span id="s914">Point chisel and s flat chisel, you know, ________, _________, (tools in German)________ and mash (ph) hammer number one, number two, you know.</span> <span id="s915">You smooth it up with the with the mash hammer.</span> <span id="s916">So you start with number one what is rough, see, and you pound and pound and you got the brush, you know, and you brush that dust.</span> <span id="s917">There was no fan, nothing.</span> <span id="s918">In the evening after twelve hours when we're finished, we was full white, you know, like a bakers.</span> <span id="s919">Remind me in a bakery, you know, I wasn't that much white that time.</span> <span id="s920">And then...now if you make that stone, each stone had it own term, you know...how long takes it to make.</span> <span id="s921">If you make that stone on on time, you have extra bonus.</span> <span id="s922">We say in a week, one mark, two mark bonus, so you can buy something in the canteen.</span> <span id="s923">They had a canteen in a concentration camp, so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine told me, look Julie, if you want to survive, you got to show them something what you can do and don't go down.</span> <span id="s924">If you go down, you come to the stage of mussulman...what we call mussulman, mussulman...they going to kick you.</span> <span id="s925">They going to kill you.</span> <span id="s926">You're gonna swell up.</span> <span id="s927">You going to die he said.</span> <span id="s928">All the prisoners told me that, you know.</span> <span id="s929">So I really pay attention and thanks God by gosh, somehow I I did my work the best and I finished some of those stones most of them on time, getting better and better and I become professional stone cutter, and that's probably was one reason...as a good stone cutter, you know, as a low number...1623, those kapos they somehow somehow they they like you, you know.</span> <span id="s930">They kick you any time, you know, but no respect, you know.</span> <span id="s931">He's a good stone cutter.</span> <span id="s932">He's got low low number, you know, so sometime they skip you.</span> <span id="s933">They no kick you, you know.</span> <span id="s934">But that doesn't mean (laughter) you're safe.</span> <span id="s935">OK.</span> <span id="s936">So you know, might want to know how what kind of a life was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s937">You hear so many stories.</span> <span id="s938">What should I say?</span> <span id="s939">Gosh, that was miserable.</span> <span id="s940">No matter what I going to tell you, you probably...half of that you're not going to believe it because I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s941">If I think back right now, if I think, you know, it's hard for me to believe, you know, how this possible could be how I survived.</span> <span id="s942">Yeah.</span> <span id="s943">And there is so many, so many bad things happen in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s944">The life, daily life was terrible.</span> <span id="s945">You get up four thirty...quick, quick, quick, quick.</span> <span id="s946">And go to the quarry, work twelve hours, six days a week, twelve hours a day.</span> <span id="s947">Sunday...Sunday before noon we do the chores, so called, you know...clean out the your lockers, clean out the barrack, clean up yourselves and everything.</span> <span id="s948">Then we had inspection, you know.</span> <span id="s949">If you had button missing or something like that, you was punished for that, see.</span> <span id="s950">So it was clean.</span> <span id="s951">That time from the beginning was clean, I must say.</span> <span id="s952">Yes.</span> <span id="s953">Oh...they cut our hair every month, and every week they cut with the clippers in the middle, you know.</span> <span id="s954">Yeah.</span> <span id="s955">And then you work 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s956">The food was not to survive no matter how strong you are for six months, you know.</span> <span id="s957">The stronger people I saw, in a six months they die.</span> <span id="s958">Like in the morning you get only half a liter, what you call a liter, black coffee, ersatz coffee so-called, made out of a bark, burnt bark.</span> <span id="s959">Then when you was working in a quarry, around nine o'clock they give you two slices of bread with margarine, as a heavy worker.</span> <span id="s960">Yeah.</span> <span id="s961">At noon, as you see on this picture what I got, we had soup.</span> <span id="s962">Soup.</span> <span id="s963">Cabbage, red cabbage.</span> <span id="s964">I thought I never going to eat red cabbage in my life.</span> <span id="s965">Spinach.</span> <span id="s966">Spinach.</span> <span id="s967">Spinach...I says my gosh, spinach again, and that was watered, you know.</span> <span id="s968">There was no fat to it, see.</span> <span id="s969">So I thought as long as I going to live I never eat spinach.</span> <span id="s970">But I tell you something.</span> <span id="s971">I like spinach, Once in a while (laughter) I eat spinach.</span> <span id="s972">Yeah.</span> <span id="s973">And then after you come from the work here on the roll call square, they count you again and son of a gun...you know, every day somebody was missing.</span> <span id="s974">No matter what.</span> <span id="s975">And they count and count and count till they find out what happen.</span> <span id="s976">What would happen sometime guy die or was killed in a in a quarry.</span> <span id="s977">Many of them was killed and they forgot to to take his name off, so they find out in a..</span> <span id="s978">.</span> <span id="s979">we had a hospital.</span> <span id="s980">We called it ambulance.</span> <span id="s981">They find out the guy is in the ambulance or they find out he is on a pile there by the crematorium, you know, but it's happened, many times happen somebody want to try run away, and that was death sentence.</span> <span id="s982">My gosh.</span> <span id="s983">Yes.</span> <span id="s984">Don't you try to do that.</span> <span id="s985">If you try that, you...but I know, I know at least three guys.</span> <span id="s986">.</span> <span id="s987">they run away and they didn't catch them.</span> <span id="s988">Why they didn't catch them?</span> <span id="s989">Because anybody run away, either death or life, they bring them back right in the middle in in that square.</span> <span id="s990">They put them there and says look, we we caught him.</span> <span id="s991">And when you people want to run away, we'll bring you back like that, you know.</span> <span id="s992">That's was, you 02:38: know, the lessons, you know, for for this.</span> <span id="s993">So the worst...one of the guy from this ___...this is very interesting...there was a Ukrainian guy.</span> <span id="s994">He was smart on one hand but he wasn't so smart on the other hand.</span> <span id="s995">What he did when we was working in a quarry...I make the story short, we had some civilian bosses there.</span> <span id="s996">Usually those guys set the dynamite there in the evening, and those civilian bosses, they had some kind of suit which you call uniform or or...there's a name for it, you know...the pants and the all together.</span> <span id="s997">At noon...that's right...at noon the the boss hang out this suit in his shack, and that Ukrainian guy sneak in and put that on and put his cap and he go on a side there there was a small gate, yeah.</span> <span id="s998">And the guard salute to him, you know, and he let him go, and he go only about thirty kilometer.</span> <span id="s999">We find out after he go about thirty kilometer and he come to the farm and he says, he told the farmer he just come from the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1000">He start on a station...he don't know what station and he want to drink the water.</span> <span id="s1001">He was thirsty, and the train go away and he lost everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1002">He lost the paper.</span> <span id="s1003">He lost the suitcase.</span> <span id="s1004">He had a suit over there and everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1005">The farmer need a worker.</span> <span id="s1006">He says don't worry about that.</span> <span id="s1007">You know, that guy is a Gemeinde Buergermeister, he's friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1008">I make a paper for you, so he make a paper for him, you know, and everything, even the clothes you know...was everything alright.</span> <span id="s1009">Now three months after...I don't know, not even three months...he was too fresh and for some reason that farmer was fresh too, and the farmer hit him and he hit the farmer back, so he call up...the farmer call up the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1010">The Gestapo come.</span> <span id="s1011">Ah...yeah...he had a different name already, but listen.</span> <span id="s1012">What a coincidence.</span> <span id="s1013">So Gestapo keep him there and give him good, you know, and this and now we're going to send you to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1014">Would you believe where they send him...to the Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1015">There is now...that be alright.</span> <span id="s1016">Nobody would know nothing, but after fourteen days as a newcomers, they sent him to the quarry and they sent him to the same gang where he was before and the kapo recognize him and he call up the camp and two SS come with the with the rifle, with the bayonet, and they bring him over there.</span> <span id="s1017">So in the evening when we come, when we come to the camp, he was standing there by the pole in the center and he had a big sign in three languages...I think that was in German, in Polish and in Russian...Ich bin wieder da.</span> <span id="s1018">That means I come back.</span> <span id="s1019">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1020">OK.</span> <span id="s1021">So they keep him for a few days in a jail.</span> <span id="s1022">We had a jail, bunker we called it.</span> <span id="s1023">See.</span> <span id="s1024">They keep him there for a few days, and one evening we come back from the work...usually they make a show...almost every week they hang somebody...and here they carried...we had a..</span> <span id="s1025">.</span> <span id="s1026">they had (laughter) portable gallow, gallows.</span> <span id="s1027">Portable.</span> <span id="s1028">Two men carry them, you know.</span> <span id="s1029">They bring the gallows.</span> <span id="s1030">Nothing new...we know.</span> <span id="s1031">Every week they bring the gallows...you know, they hang somebody and they hang that Ukrainian fellow.</span> <span id="s1032">Now when they hang the guy, no matter winter or summer, he had only pants.</span> <span id="s1033">Barefoot.</span> <span id="s1034">No shirts, nothing, and the hands was tied in the back.</span> <span id="s1035">They bring that guy and we find out who that guy was.</span> <span id="s1036">Now that was the unforgettable moment.</span> <span id="s1037">I saw so many people was hanged there and feel sorry for them you know, but for this guy particular I feel sorry be...because this is a unbelievable story, so they put him on the gallows.</span> <span id="s1038">There was...the gallows was a box with the floor cut in the middle and there was a handle on the side.</span> <span id="s1039">When the guy pull out that handle so the floor goes in, you know, and the guy fall in that box and and was hanged.</span> <span id="s1040">And that's what they do to that Ukrainian fellow.</span> <span id="s1041">First they read the verdict, you know.</span> <span id="s1042">The verdict, and no matter what it was, they always says for the sabotage.</span> <span id="s1043">Everything for them was sabotage.</span> <span id="s1044">So what they did...and we stood there, everybody still, you know.</span> <span id="s1045">You got to stay there and and watch it, see, and they pull out the handle and the guy fall in that box and would you believe the rope breaks.</span> <span id="s1046">The the the the rope broke.</span> <span id="s1047">Now somebody told me because we got all kind of people in a concentration 02:43: camp...lawyers and judges, you know...that was an international law...I'm not sure about that but they tell us, if the rope break when they hang somebody, the man supposed to go free.</span> <span id="s1048">Those criminals...they make a knot, you know...they put that rope together and they hanged that guy second time and he was crying.</span> <span id="s1049">He was...he was begging them...he's going to be good worker.</span> <span id="s1050">Just keep me in this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1051">They hang him second time, and that was the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Can we go focus a little bit more on some of the things that happened to you while you worked in the camp...some of the situations that that you were the victim of while you were at Flossenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s1054">Like for instance this was...I think that was well, I was working in a in a quarry, as I tell you before and what happened to me and forgot about think to me personally, once I was sent to the kommando...in a in a concentration camp kommando means gang...and we was pushing a wagon on a small tracks with the dirt, you know.</span> <span id="s1055">They was building something, another barrack or something, and on that job I had a different foreman and he hit me with the stick over the head and he split...I still got the got the scars over here.</span> <span id="s1056">He split my head, and I was...he was a German foreman, and I was so furious I don't care what happ...what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s1057">I take the stick from him and I hit him so hard so the blood come from the ears, you know, from him, and they catch me, the kapos, the other kapos catch me and there they give me a..</span> <span id="s1058">.</span> <span id="s1059">oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s1060">They beat me so bad on there in the quarry and they bring me to the first aid in the quarry, and again the Hans Bauer find out about that because that was something, you know, that the the Polish guy hit the hit the German foreman, you know.</span> <span id="s1061">That was death sentence right there.</span> <span id="s1062">I didn't care, you know.</span> <span id="s1063">He hit me for nothing, you know, you know, and I was so mad I didn't know what I doing, you know.</span> <span id="s1064">That was my reaction, and the Hans Bauer...at that time, you know, he saved me.</span> <span id="s1065">He grabbed that foreman and he says if anything happen to this guy, I going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1066">So he said, because he says that guy...I had a knife.</span> <span id="s1067">Knife...this is death sentence, you know.</span> <span id="s1068">You...besides the hankerchief, you not supposed to have nothing on a..</span> <span id="s1069">.</span> <span id="s1070">in a quarry, just a hankerchief.</span> <span id="s1071">And a and the dish what you was eating and a spoon...that's all.</span> <span id="s1072">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1073">So that was...that was something, you know, that Hans Bower saved me right there, you know.</span> <span id="s1074">The second time why I got that number on my arm, four.</span> <span id="s1075">Up today I can't explain how this happened and what they had in mind, what they want to do with me.</span> <span id="s1076">There was a group of us.</span> <span id="s1077">There was some officers come and we find out they was from Auschwitz, Oswiecem, and they pick up so many prisoners and happen, you know, they pick me up too.</span> <span id="s1078">First of all, we have to take the shirts off and they put my 1623 with the red chalk (ph) on my on my chest.</span> <span id="s1079">Then they took us to the extra barrack there and they tatooed our our numbers, you know, like I have 1623.</span> <span id="s1080">Well in Flossenburg we had no numbers, you know, and we was ready to go for the transport, and we find out for Auschwitz, _____.</span> <span id="s1081">And I don't know why they tatoo us there.</span> <span id="s1082">Then we was ready to march to the to the truck...there was several trucks, you know, pick us up and bring us on a on a railroad depot.</span> <span id="s1083">Again Hans Bauer comes somewhere, and he check up...he was already...he was already big wheel in a concentration camp, so-called you know...big wheel.</span> <span id="s1084">He was lageraeltester number two at the...yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">And he look at me.</span> <span id="s1086">He recognize me.</span> <span id="s1087">He look at me and he go to the officer.</span> <span id="s1088">He say something to that officer and then he come back and he says ___________1623 austreten, and he pull me out, and he says go on your barrack quick.</span> <span id="s1089">And he saved me that time.</span> <span id="s1090">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1091">What can I tell you my personal...that was hard.</span> <span id="s1092">Many times comes, you know, I was ready to commit suicide because I didn't believe what they was doing, what I saw every day would happen in the quarries, how many people die in the quarries, how many people they kill, from nowheres, and I tell you after that what they lay out the bomb for Hitler, you know, in the bunker, you know...they want to kill Hitler.</span> <span id="s1093">You want to see how many Germans, officers, all kind of men, they bring to the Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1094">And they kill them right there.</span> <span id="s1095">What it was today people look for other people they disappeared during the war, during the war.</span> <span id="s1096">They don't know how they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: I'd like to stay back on on where you...what was happening to you at this time.</span> <span id="s1098">After Hans Bauer saved you from the transport...</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: ...what events occurred while you were still at Flossenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: OK.</span> <span id="s1102">I still was working in a quarry, do my stones, and till April 20th.</span> <span id="s1103">On April 20th, the the concentration camp was evacuated from Flossenburg to Dachau, so you want to know some more about the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1104">My gosh.</span> <span id="s1105">You know, you hear so many stories there.</span> <span id="s1106">Unforgettable.</span> <span id="s1107">OK.</span> <span id="s1108">I give you another example, what I witnesses and what bothers me...</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: You?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: What happened to me?</span> <span id="s1111">No.</span> <span id="s1112">What I saw.</span> <span id="s1113">What I saw.</span> <span id="s1114">Now we had a very interesting Christmas Eve in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1115">Every year they put us...they put the big Christmas tree by the entrance and that evening when we come from work, there was a gallows hand-made... long log was and five loops and they hang up five men on the front of that Christmas tree, and they had a guards...yeah...nice present isn't it?</span> <span id="s1116">And the officer that report officer had the guards to come wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and we wish you be free in the next year.</span> <span id="s1117">We couldn't put this together, you see.</span> <span id="s1118">And that's...this is something unforgettable...unforgettable for me.</span> <span id="s1119">There was a time...there was a time it did help me.</span> <span id="s1120">You know many people ask me how I survived.</span> <span id="s1121">It did help me, because that time when I was arrested I had three hundred eighty marks.</span> <span id="s1122">That was a lot of money though.</span> <span id="s1123">I was doing a little bit black business before I was arrested, you know.</span> <span id="s1124">I'd buy something like shoes, you know.</span> <span id="s1125">I had a a place where I can buy shoes, you know.</span> <span id="s1126">I buy them for ten marks.</span> <span id="s1127">I used to sell them for twenty marks, you know, for other people, you know, because that time was everything, you 02:51:30 know, you have to have Bezugschein card, you know, to buy anything, you know.</span> <span id="s1128">So I I I saved quite a money.</span> <span id="s1129">I had about three hundred eighty marks that time when I was arrested, and that money from the Gestapo to the concentration camp was follow me, and they deposited that money and that was honest, you know, at least that much honest.</span> <span id="s1130">I'm surprised.</span> <span id="s1131">So from that money I can wiggle...every week, anytime, I can wiggle some money.</span> <span id="s1132">I give you, for instance, like how much you pay, how much I pay for the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1133">Cigarettes was very important.</span> <span id="s1134">Hundred cigarettes was only two marks.</span> <span id="s1135">For the cigarettes you can buy everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1136">You can buy bread.</span> <span id="s1137">You can buy soup.</span> <span id="s1138">You can buy anything, you know, and that helps me to survive, you know.</span> <span id="s1139">I tell about myself now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Tell me about how...what happened to you during the evacuation?</span> <span id="s1141">Your your evacuation from Flossenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: That was the worst experience for for all because I thought this going to be the end.</span> <span id="s1143">They no let us...they no let us live through and be witness like today so I can tell to everybody what happened, see.</span> <span id="s1144">So we we we believed they going to liquidate us.</span> <span id="s1145">OK.</span> <span id="s1146">That was on Friday, April 20th in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1147">Maybe I should go a little bit back, thirteen days.</span> <span id="s1148">There was a one night the guards and the SS left the concentration camp and we was free.</span> <span id="s1149">Let's see...that was about a week or a little bettter than a week before the evacuation, so one day, one night, we was free.</span> <span id="s1150">We already put the flags, white flags you know...we surrendered, you know, please.</span> <span id="s1151">American planes come.</span> <span id="s1152">They make a picture.</span> <span id="s1153">They circle there.</span> <span id="s1154">We was free.</span> <span id="s1155">But just don't run away.</span> <span id="s1156">Don't go nowheres, because in the woods all over there was so many German soldier, you know, so anybody can shoot you.</span> <span id="s1157">But that was short freedom, see...over the night.</span> <span id="s1158">We get up in the morning and here you got the same thing...all the guards and even worse because they had new guards from the front, SS, and they was very cruel, you know, and they start shooting, you know, anybody, you know.</span> <span id="s1159">If they no like you, they shoot.</span> <span id="s1160">OK.</span> <span id="s1161">So we was we was there for one week like that.</span> <span id="s1162">Then they was talking about the evacuation, so OK.</span> <span id="s1163">On April 20th, six o'clock in the morning, they start evacuating two thousand men...that was probably about close to sixteen thousand prisoners that time.</span> <span id="s1164">Now three years ago when I when I come to the concentration camp, that Flossenburg was not more than two thousand, not even two thousand.</span> <span id="s1165">So by the end there was about sixteen thousand because we had some prisoners from Gross Rosen coming.</span> <span id="s1166">OK.</span> <span id="s1167">They start evacuate us on that day, April 20th.</span> <span id="s1168">OK.</span> <span id="s1169">So the tricky was for me and few other my friend of mine, hiding and stay as long as possible in the camp because the American 3rd Army was so close already.</span> <span id="s1170">You can hear them...you can hear the shots you know, machine gun, so we're going to stay as as as long as possible in the camp, but comes about five o'clock afternoon.</span> <span id="s1171">The last column was called and many people fall on a..</span> <span id="s1172">.</span> <span id="s1173">they they want to be sick, you know...they don't want to go, and they start shooting, you know.</span> <span id="s1174">Get up or death, you know, or they shoot you.</span> <span id="s1175">So many people get up, you know, and they form...I don't know...was it two thousand, close to two thousand.</span> <span id="s1176">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1177">Then we march.</span> <span id="s1178">We're marched and how sneaky they are.</span> <span id="s1179">They bring us to the woods, you know...side roads, you know, through the woods, thick woods, you know, we was marching.</span> <span id="s1180">They didn't give us nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1181">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1182">That was Friday.</span> <span id="s1183">Saturday, nothing to eat, and soon we just left to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1184">We come to that woods.</span> <span id="s1185">We see there's so many dead people laying on both sides from previous columns, you know.</span> <span id="s1186">Those previous...there was eight columns, two thousand each, you know, before us.</span> <span id="s1187">All day, you know, and you see those dead people, so that was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s1188">First of all, soon you get so tired, you know, to walk and no water, no bread, nothing.</span> <span id="s1189">On Sunday we had to stop... we had to stop and they give us a little, little piece...fifteen decagram of bread.</span> <span id="s1190">No water.</span> <span id="s1191">No coffee.</span> <span id="s1192">Nothing, and that's all what we had.</span> <span id="s1193">Now each each morning...oh let's say around four o'clock, they bring us in the woods and let us rest for two, three hours the most, you know and by gosh that was good, but so many people couldn't get up, you know.</span> <span id="s1194">They was exhausted, so they was shot.</span> <span id="s1195">They were shot, and as we march to Dachau, if somebody was walking, you know, like, you know, wobbles, the guard come to that guy, push him on the side and close range shoot him with the rifle.</span> <span id="s1196">Shoot him in the head.</span> <span id="s1197">It was terrible picture.</span> <span id="s1198">So I give you example.</span> <span id="s1199">From Friday till Monday noon, about four thousand prisoners from those columns was shot and I was...that last day I was ready to lay down and OK...shoot me because, you know, it was impossible, almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1200">So and we was not even half way to the to the Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1201">We was free on Monday, twelve o'clock.</span> <span id="s1202">On my gosh...at noon.</span> <span id="s1203">The first American tank come with the white star.</span> <span id="s1204">That was emotional.</span> <span id="s1205">Would you believe...oh...then we have to lay down, you know.</span> <span id="s1206">Somebody give us the...somebody give us the order to lay down, and some of those guards want to run away but they was stopped by by those machine guns, American Army.</span> <span id="s1207">Third Army...General George Patton, the best man.</span> <span id="s1208">God give him heaven.</span> <span id="s1209">So after we get up, the first thing what we was running to the American tanks and we kissed those tanks.</span> <span id="s1210">We hugged...we squeezed those American soldier.</span> <span id="s1211">We kissed them shoes and we thank them for the freedom.</span> <span id="s1212">That was unforgettable.</span> <span id="s1213">That was something.</span> <span id="s1214">That was the biggest moment, and during those not quite four days, four thousand was shot and then we'll go back just a little while...a little back where we...there was a little town there, Stansriedt (ph) by the name there...not far away from ____ city, and we stayed there for...privately for two weeks and the Americans make a kitchen for us and we had plenty food and we stayed there and after three weeks the Americans give me the special paper, pass and they give me bicycle and I go back to Austria.</span> <span id="s1215">I was thinking to see Frieda.</span> <span id="s1216">And there's so much to say what happened in a concentration camp, but by gosh, you know, the cruelty, unbelievable cruelty.</span> <span id="s1217">So many people knows so many people not believe that's happen.</span> <span id="s1218">Last week one lady call me and says you was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1219">I don't believe you.</span> <span id="s1220">There was not such a thing.</span> <span id="s1221">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1222">So after that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: I have to stop right now.</span> <span id="s1224">We're out of tape.</span> <span id="s1225">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">END OF INTERVIEW Tape three: no transcript
