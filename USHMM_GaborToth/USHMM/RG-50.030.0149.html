your name please?</span> <span id="s13">A: My name is Laura Margolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And would you tell us where and when you were born?</span> <span id="s15">A: I was born in Constantinople, Turkey, in 1903.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Would you tell us something about your family and your early life?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s18">I was born in Turkey of Austria-Hungarian grand...grandparents and parents really.</span> <span id="s19">And...uh...my grandfather was Dr. Schwartz who...uh...was head of the Jewish community in...uh...Turkey and also consultant to the...uh...Sultan of .</span> <span id="s20">My father, on the other hand, was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s21">I'll get to the marriage part and how they met which is also history...uh...and as graduated high school.</span> <span id="s22">But because of the anti-Semitic regulations there, he couldn't go on to college, so he decided to come to Palestine and see if there wasn't something there that he could do, and he spent a little bit of time in Palestine and...uh...decided that the thing for him to do was go to back to his father, get some money, go to Berlin and study agronomy, and eventually settle in Palestine.</span> <span id="s23">Now in Germany where he studied in Berlin, his professor of Botany was Dr. Otto Warberg, and...uh...there was a very close warm friendships between student and professor.</span> <span id="s24">They somehow clicked.</span> <span id="s25">Parallel with this period, my grandfather, Dr. Saloman Schwartz, in Constantinople had...uh...wanted some of his own medicines patented in Germany and was also in contact with...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Professor Otto Warberg for patenting his own medicines.</span> <span id="s27">This was all 19th century almost.</span> <span id="s28">And...uh...when my father graduated, his destination would have been Palestine straight, but Dr. Otto Warberg suggested to him that he first go to Constantinople and meet Dr. Schwartz and maybe he would put off his going to Palestine for a few years because Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Otto...Professor Warberg's idea was that there was land up in Asia-Minor and...uh...that with my father's training, he would...and with Dr. Warberg's money, he would be able to do some settling of Jews who were already running from the Soviet...from Russia, not the Soviet Union then...from Russia to Constantinople, and were becoming beggars on the streets, and he was already in those years thinking of making them farmers eventually to go to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">This was before EKA which was established in Paris and EKA was a philantrophic Jewish organization that was settling Jews in Russia.</span> <span id="s31">And Dr....or Professor Warberg really wanted to do an experiment with his own money up in Asia-Minor.</span> <span id="s32">So my father agreed.</span> <span id="s33">He was young.</span> <span id="s34">There was no reason why he couldn't do this, and he adored his professor.</span> <span id="s35">He came to Constantinople to Dr. Schwartz who had all the contacts with the Turks and my mother opened the door, and that's where the romance started.</span> <span id="s36">Now, they went together up to Asia- Minor.</span> <span id="s37">That's where they spent their honeymoon.</span> <span id="s38">And it was...uh...absolutely wild up there.</span> <span id="s39">And...uh...they did...were able to bring some of the Jews who were just hanging around and becoming beggars in Constantinople.</span> <span id="s40">They were prepared to take on these people, teach them farming, agriculture, and train them for eventually going to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What year were they married?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: They were married...1903.</span> <span id="s43">I was born in 1903.</span> <span id="s44">I think they were born in l904.</span> <span id="s45">No.</span> <span id="s46">No.</span> <span id="s47">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s49">They were married in 1902, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s51">You were born in 1903.</span> <span id="s52">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: On the honeymoon.</span> <span id="s54">Right.</span> <span id="s55">The story was that...uh...actually I think I was conceived in Asia- Minor (laughing).</span> <span id="s56">And...uh...in order to...I know that in order to give...uh...birth, my mother had to come down...she tells how she came down to her father, the doctor, in an ox cart.</span> <span id="s57">(clearing throat) Anyway, my...uh...these...in...in Hebrew it's called .</span> <span id="s58">This farming...this agricultural training in...uh...Asia-Minor was very successful, but there was a time when Professor Otto Warberg simply said he couldn't finance it anymore and...uh...so the job...my father still wasn't thinking of America at all.</span> <span id="s59">He was still thinking of...uh...uh... Palestine.</span> <span id="s60">My father was offered another job to go back to Russia and...uh...begin training Jews there on the spot.</span> <span id="s61">My father didn't want to go back to Russia.</span> <span id="s62">In the meantime, his father and the whole family had immigrated to the United States and...uh...my mother said, at one point, that she'd had enough of being...uh...uh...a farmer.</span> <span id="s63">She was not trained for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">She was a beautiful musician.</span> <span id="s65">And so my father...they agreed that my father would go to America where all...where his father and all the Margolis family had settled in Dayton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s66">He would see how he liked it.</span> <span id="s67">In the meantime, my brother was born, and his name is Otto.</span> <span id="s68">He's named after Professor Warberg.</span> <span id="s69">And so we waited in Constantinople until my father succumbed to the influences of his whole family and decided that we should come and...come to the United States.</span> <span id="s70">At that time, I was 5 and my brother was 2, and so we shipped off and that's the beginning of the family history in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Now can you tell us what happened in your earlier life without going into great detail but maybe bringing us up to the time when your activities with regards to the war and the Jewish community began.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Uh...How far back do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Well, from the time you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: From the time I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s75">Okay.</span> <span id="s76">(clearing throat) Well, I was 5 years old.</span> <span id="s77">Now when I came to the United States, anyone who knows anything about the Middle East knows that you don't have to be literate or educated in order to speak 5 or 6 or 7 languages.</span> <span id="s78">And...uh...I came to the United States speaking French, German, Greek, Turkish and Spanish.</span> <span id="s79">But no English.</span> <span id="s80">And...uh...my mother brought the...uh...we...we sailed over to the United States with a maid because she couldn't handle two little babies.</span> <span id="s81">And...uh...the maid was Spanish speaking, so for several years after I entered kindergarten in Dayton, Ohio, these languages became...had become a part of me.</span> <span id="s82">And...uh...some of this will later maybe explain why I even got started in the work that I did much, much later in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Uh...Anyway, we lived in America where we...my father went into the business of his family.</span> <span id="s84">My mother continued with her music.</span> <span id="s85">We were educated.</span> <span id="s86">We moved from Dayton, Ohio, eventually to Lima, Ohio, where I went to...uh...where my father opened a shop.</span> <span id="s87">And we ended up really...I won't go through all the different stages of where we lived in Ohio.</span> <span id="s88">We ended up in Cleveland which was the important city for all of us.</span> <span id="s89">And that's where my father...uh...went into the insurance business.</span> <span id="s90">My mother continued with her music and her house.</span> <span id="s91">But at the end of the first world war, 1918, my mother took my brother and myself back to Constantinople for a whole year.</span> <span id="s92">My grandfather had died and she very much wanted to see her own mother and sister.</span> <span id="s93">So I spent a whole year sitting on a bench in a German school.</span> <span id="s94">That was our first trip back.</span> <span id="s95">Then we returned to Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Is that where your completed your high school and college education?</span> <span id="s97">In Cleveland?</span> <span id="s98">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Where did you go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I went to college at...uh...well, I started my...uh...my first...the college I went to sub...sub...not professional...uh...Ohio State, where I got my B.A. And then I continued with professional education at Western Reserve, School of Social Sciences they used to call it in my day where I graduated as a social worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And what sort of a career did you embark upon at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Very traditional career.</span> <span id="s103">Uh...I worked...always worked in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s104">The Jewish Welfare Society, I think it was called in those years, of Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span id="s105">Case work.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">And...uh...I think I..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">if I can remember at all, I did leave that work.</span> <span id="s109">I did leave Cleveland at one point.</span> <span id="s110">I felt that I had...I wasn't growing.</span> <span id="s111">I wasn't learning anything.</span> <span id="s112">I was becoming repetitive, and so I took a year off and...uh...came to New York.</span> <span id="s113">And...uh...without getting a degree of any kind, but just wanting to get some new ideas.</span> <span id="s114">And so I spent a year in New York, and then I was called back to Cleveland by the Jewish Welfare Society, offering me a job of training volunteers to do Big Sister work.</span> <span id="s115">And that became a challenge.</span> <span id="s116">Seems to me that I was always reacting to challenges, you know.</span> <span id="s117">To do something different and something new.</span> <span id="s118">So I came back to Cleveland and trained volunteers for the National Council of Jewish Women, I think about 3 or 4 years.</span> <span id="s119">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: At what point did you become involved with the...with the Joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, the Joint comes much later.</span> <span id="s122">I'll tell you first...uh...after a couple of years of that in Cleveland, the same restlessness showed up.</span> <span id="s123">And I heard that there was a job in Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s124">In fact, I was told that there was a job and they were looking for a Director of their Jewish welfare work.</span> <span id="s125">I went down for an interview.</span> <span id="s126">This was already in the 30s.</span> <span id="s127">And I was hired.</span> <span id="s128">So I left Cleveland, and that's the first time I ever left my parents' home, and was on my own.</span> <span id="s129">And...uh...started working for the Jewish wel...became...became actually the Director of the Jewish Welfare Society of Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s130">It took a long time to set up a good welfare service there which would be accept...where students would be accepted by the...uh... University of Buffalo.</span> <span id="s131">It took me about 4 years to do that job.</span> <span id="s132">I liked Buffalo very much.</span> <span id="s133">I had many friends.</span> <span id="s134">I was settled there.</span> <span id="s135">And then one day I got a telephone call from New York.</span> <span id="s136">19...Christmas 1938.</span> <span id="s137">And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the telephone, head of the...uh...not Joint at that point...it was the...uh...Jewish Refugee Service because already Hitler was in.</span> <span id="s138">Refugees were coming in in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later.</span> <span id="s139">They were people who had means.</span> <span id="s140">Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on the wall in time and got out.</span> <span id="s141">And we were receiving them in Buffalo like in other communities in the United States.</span> <span id="s142">And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the telephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working together with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint.</span> <span id="s143">And she said to me she had heard from somewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in Havana, Cuba.</span> <span id="s144">Refugees were beginning to flee from Germany and from other countries in Europe, and...uh...the boats were coming in, but there were problems in Havana.</span> <span id="s145">The money at that point was being given by the JDC, but the JDC didn't have the official...uh...it was working together with the National Refugee Service.</span> <span id="s146">I didn't even know that I was a employ...employed by the Joint at that time.</span> <span id="s147">And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to, with my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple problems down in Havana.</span> <span id="s148">Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to Havana and look over the picture and be helpful?</span> <span id="s149">Also with...because of my language abilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt.</span> <span id="s150">It was the time of Batista.</span> <span id="s151">(clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming into Havana.</span> <span id="s152">One was to get a false visa somewhere in Germany for $165, and the other was to find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in America would send...would send down to Havana.</span> <span id="s153">And...uh... would eventually ended in the S..</span> <span id="s154">.</span> <span id="s155">in St. Louis...the famous affair of the St. Louis, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the office I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee.</span> <span id="s156">Already the Joint was coming in to it.</span> <span id="s157">Actually, the Joint financially always was there.</span> <span id="s158">And...uh...they...uh...those who had legal $500 bond were allowed to land and some of them were taken into jails.</span> <span id="s159">It was very chaotic.</span> <span id="s160">And we heard that ships were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole diagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the government, and that's when I called the JDC on the phone direct.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Where were you at the time?</span> <span id="s162">A: In Havana.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: You joined the Havana office.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Havana.</span> <span id="s165">Still in Havana.</span> <span id="s166">Expecting boats to come in, ships to come in with refugees and knowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption inside of Cuba with Batista.</span> <span id="s167">And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story.</span> <span id="s168">And then we heard that the next ship that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis.</span> <span id="s169">See, the JDC had offices in Paris, and we were in communications like this: New York, Paris, Havana.</span> <span id="s170">And so I insisted that this is nothing which I felt I should handle alone.</span> <span id="s171">It was more political than social.</span> <span id="s172">My Spanish language didn't do any good.</span> <span id="s173">Uh...And they did.</span> <span id="s174">The JDC went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">And I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal lawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the JDC who...uh...had his ends with Batista.</span> <span id="s176">And I don't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories.</span> <span id="s177">and everyone knows what the S.S. St. Louis meant.</span> <span id="s178">(Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't remember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that ship.</span> <span id="s179">Only a few could disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that ship was stationed there and not allowed to come into the harbor by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Well, the last thing we wanted was for that boat...that boat to go back to Germany because that would have been the end.</span> <span id="s181">So for about a week...this is 39...uh...we in Havana, JDC New York, JDC Paris...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you could do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could telephone.</span> <span id="s182">I don't think we ever went to sleep.</span> <span id="s183">(laughing) Anyway, books have been written, stories been told.</span> <span id="s184">The S.S. did not go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s185">It was...disembarked in Holland, Paris, London.</span> <span id="s186">(Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into Havana.</span> <span id="s187">It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to Germany, many of them were caught when the Germans invaded Belgium, Holland, and France.</span> <span id="s188">But a lot of them were saved.</span> <span id="s189">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a..</span> <span id="s190">.</span> <span id="s191">a nice job, a quiet job in Havana.</span> <span id="s192">And one of the things that I learned...I call this my in-service training period.</span> <span id="s193">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the American Consulate in Havana trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh...American Consulate.</span> <span id="s194">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations.</span> <span id="s195">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing.</span> <span id="s196">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them.</span> <span id="s197">There were understaffed.</span> <span id="s198">And so I stayed on in Havana....39, 40, 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s200">.</span> <span id="s201">for some...I liked...I liked Cuba.</span> <span id="s202">I liked the climate.</span> <span id="s203">I liked the people.</span> <span id="s204">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job.</span> <span id="s205">We were helping to get people to the United States.</span> <span id="s206">But one day, one morning the phone rang.</span> <span id="s207">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt.</span> <span id="s208">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?"</span> <span id="s209">(laughing) 'How are you doing' was not an expression in those years, but he said, "How are you?"</span> <span id="s210">I said, "Fine.”</span> <span id="s211">"Busy?"</span> <span id="s212">"Yal, we're very busy here.”</span> <span id="s213">Well...so...uh...he said, "How would you like to go to China?"</span> <span id="s214">(Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it.</span> <span id="s215">I said, "China?</span> <span id="s216">Where in China?"</span> <span id="s217">"Shanghai.”</span> <span id="s218">I said, "Oh, Yal.</span> <span id="s219">Sure.</span> <span id="s220">I'd like to go.”</span> <span id="s221">(Laughing) I had no idea what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s222">I said, "What's the problem?"</span> <span id="s223">He said, "Well, we've been...first of all we've had a request from the State Department that you should go to China.</span> <span id="s224">You should go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s225">Because refugees are pouring in from Germany.</span> <span id="s226">It's a open port.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">No visas are necessary.</span> <span id="s228">The Chinese don't care who comes in.</span> <span id="s229">We've been sending money to a Jewish committee of local leaders there and.</span> <span id="s230">.</span> <span id="s231">uh...the Embassy is swamped.</span> <span id="s232">The Consulate is swamped.</span> <span id="s233">The Embassy was in Peking at that time.</span> <span id="s234">The Embassy needs help.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">The...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and so...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in Havana.</span> <span id="s236">Will you go?"</span> <span id="s237">I said, "Alright, I'll go.”</span> <span id="s238">(Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever make.</span> <span id="s239">Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there.</span> <span id="s240">Nothing was really going on.</span> <span id="s241">The Embassy...the Consulate was swamped.</span> <span id="s242">There was refugees there who had visas, valid visas that the U.S. was ready for accept for their coming to the United States, but there was no personnel.</span> <span id="s243">So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I got there, in 41...much later in 41, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands and thousands of refugees.</span> <span id="s244">The situation as very chaotic.</span> <span id="s245">But I wasn't supposed to do much about that.</span> <span id="s246">I was supposed to help the Consulate.</span> <span id="s247">Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat) different from the way we travel now...uh...it took...I went over on the first Pan American clipper that ever trans...that ever sailed in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s248">It took 5 days and 4 nights.</span> <span id="s249">But it was very much more civilized than the way we travel now.</span> <span id="s250">Anyway, my...my...I had to get to Hong Kong first.</span> <span id="s251">I couldn't get to China on...on a Pan American, and I had to wait for a whole week in Hong Kong before I could get a ship up the coast to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s252">And when I got there my first...first place I went to as the embassy...the Consulate.</span> <span id="s253">They gave me an office, and I began interviewing, helping them.</span> <span id="s254">But at the same time I had to get to know the Jewish community structure there of local residents.</span> <span id="s255">The chairman was an ex-Dutchman called Spillman, very nice man.</span> <span id="s256">And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC money to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding.</span> <span id="s257">So...uh...all this was done with JDC money.</span> <span id="s258">I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that someone from the Joint was there.</span> <span id="s259">I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming to my hotel.</span> <span id="s260">At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among the refugees and how it was being handled.</span> <span id="s261">All of it went through the pouch, and I..</span> <span id="s262">.</span> <span id="s263">very soon...it took me a month.</span> <span id="s264">In June...I got there in May...in June I issued a definite ultimatum to the JDC in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one- man job.</span> <span id="s265">They would have to send out someone else to work with me.</span> <span id="s266">And I knew...I knew that Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from Buffalo who was working with me in Havana, always said he'd like to come out.</span> <span id="s267">So I said, "Either you send Manny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone.</span> <span id="s268">Or else I'll come home.”</span> <span id="s269">In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued.</span> <span id="s270">I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I think it was...the...the exact date isn't important.</span> <span id="s271">I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans had walked into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s272">We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant.</span> <span id="s273">So I got a cable from the JDC a few days after that saying, "In case communications are cut, you are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is required to take care of the needy" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our kitchen; we had a hospital to support, and there was a school).</span> <span id="s274">Now these sums seem like nothing today, but in those years it was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s275">And...uh...so I had this cable.</span> <span id="s276">That was June, July, August 1941.</span> <span id="s277">And I was just beginning to get to know the whole refugee problem.</span> <span id="s278">I continued to work with the...with the embassy...with the Consulate, but my focus was really upon helping these people.</span> <span id="s279">And...uh...August 1941, I got another cable.</span> <span id="s280">SHIP OUT TO MANILA.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">DON'T...DON'T COME HOME.</span> <span id="s282">SHIP OUT TO MANILA AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.</span> <span id="s283">Well, to get out at that point...the American marines were all leaving.</span> <span id="s284">There was a feeling of war, but nobody was thinking of Pearl Harbor, of course, as you will hear later.</span> <span id="s285">The Japanese had been fighting the Chinese for years before that, but they had never come into the international settlement.</span> <span id="s286">So to get a ship...the only ships coming out were ships with Army soldiers.</span> <span id="s287">Through the American Embassy, I managed to get on the ship.</span> <span id="s288">And I got to Manila.</span> <span id="s289">And I had the cable, DON'T COME HOME.</span> <span id="s290">So...uh...what does one do?</span> <span id="s291">There were...there was a nice Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s292">I used to take trips around the island, but I never could stay away very long because I was waiting for instructions.</span> <span id="s293">And finally, this is already August.</span> <span id="s294">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q; August 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s297">41.</span> <span id="s298">Uh Huh.</span> <span id="s299">September.</span> <span id="s300">Telephone call.</span> <span id="s301">(clearing throat) September 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">September.</span> <span id="s303">Telephone call from Mo Levitt from New York.</span> <span id="s304">"Laura, we've just come from Washington.</span> <span id="s305">We've been to the State Department.</span> <span id="s306">They assure us there will be no war in the Far East.”</span> <span id="s307">You can go back and Manny Segal is on his way.</span> <span id="s308">So I went back.</span> <span id="s309">And it was clear that we were taking over the whole program, using the local Jewish committee as advisory, but the money was coming to...in the bank to us.</span> <span id="s310">Manny Segal arrived December 1st, 1941.</span> <span id="s311">By that time I had a pretty good idea what was going on over in Hong Q which is a section of Shanghai where the Japanese were already...had already occupied, but they had not come over to the International Settlement yet.</span> <span id="s312">The refugees were all...those who couldn't afford to stay in the International Settlement were all housed in the Japanese sector.</span> <span id="s313">Uh...I had then, before Manny came, I had a pretty good idea what the problems were and what kind of reorganization was required, you know.</span> <span id="s314">So...uh...Manny arrived, I think it was December lst, and I gave him an orientation and we started going out to Hong Q, and we organizing the whole thing and in Shanghai on December 8th in the morning in...uh...uh...Hawaii...where the Japanese struck.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Pearl Harbor where the Japanese struck.</span> <span id="s317">It was December 7th, 1941.</span> <span id="s318">By us, it was December 8th, 4:00 AM.</span> <span id="s319">And our hotel was on the...on the , on the shore where all the ships were.</span> <span id="s320">Ships of all nations.</span> <span id="s321">Was the biggest port of China.</span> <span id="s322">We were bombed out of our hotel beds practically with the bombing.</span> <span id="s323">And we looked out the window and all the ships in the Harbor were burning.</span> <span id="s324">Japanese had come across the bridge, marched into our hotel, occupied the hotel.</span> <span id="s325">We were at war.</span> <span id="s326">That was it.</span> <span id="s327">People gathering in the streets below.</span> <span id="s328">We were...the first thing we did when we realized what it was all about was to tear up all the reports we had been sending to New York.</span> <span id="s329">We always kept...we didn't have a secretary.</span> <span id="s330">You couldn't trust...you couldn't have a secretary.</span> <span id="s331">You couldn't trust anyone at that point.</span> <span id="s332">We had been keeping carbon copies for ourselves and doing our own typing.</span> <span id="s333">But we realized we were at war and this is it, so the first thing we did, Manny and I, was to tear up all our papers, flush it down the toilet.</span> <span id="s334">Because we didn't know what was going to happen next.</span> <span id="s335">We were held in our rooms...there was an English broadcasting.</span> <span id="s336">The Japanese took over and broadcast in English.</span> <span id="s337">We were just sitting there and watching broadcasting...listening to broadcasting.</span> <span id="s338">And down below people just mulling.</span> <span id="s339">Mulling, mulling, mulling.</span> <span id="s340">Millions of people.</span> <span id="s341">Couple of times, we went down to the lobby.</span> <span id="s342">We couldn't go out because every door, every exit, there were Japanese soldiers with bayonets.</span> <span id="s343">Then we got...uh...we were just listening...we were able to get food.</span> <span id="s344">Uh...we were listening to the radio the whole time, what was next.</span> <span id="s345">I think it was about 6 o'clock in the evening when the English broadcasting came over saying that people are now free to go out.</span> <span id="s346">So we went out and some friends of ours already, both Chinese and foreigners, were downstairs waiting for us.</span> <span id="s347">They had been waiting for us all day long.</span> <span id="s348">We went out and we had a good Chinese dinner.</span> <span id="s349">But what do we did next?</span> <span id="s350">Now, Shanghai in the pre-Pearl Harbor days was a very social kind of place.</span> <span id="s351">And...uh...I had to go through...my round...my round of dinner parties and entertainment and at many of these affairs, horse races, I had met Captain...Japanese Captain Inasuka.</span> <span id="s352">Captain Inasuka had been living in Shanghai for many years.</span> <span id="s353">He's Japanese.</span> <span id="s354">And...uh...I was told that he was very...he liked Jews.</span> <span id="s355">And that after that...Pearl Harbor, he had moved into the same hotel that we are living in, which was the best hotel in Shanghai and he was already up in the Pent House.</span> <span id="s356">He had already occupied Sir Victor Sassoon's Penthouse.</span> <span id="s357">So what do we do next?</span> <span id="s358">Refugees were in the lobby, scared stiff.</span> <span id="s359">They were all stateless.</span> <span id="s360">No passports.</span> <span id="s361">No identify of any kind.</span> <span id="s362">And I, Manny and I talked it over.</span> <span id="s363">I said, "Manny, go down and tell them we're working on it.</span> <span id="s364">Not to get excited.</span> <span id="s365">Not to worry.</span> <span id="s366">Something's bound to happen.”</span> <span id="s367">And I made this decision.</span> <span id="s368">I had my telegram from JDC that I could raise money to be repaid at the end of the hostilities, wherever these hostilities would be.</span> <span id="s369">So I phoned up to Captain Inasuka.</span> <span id="s370">He remembered me...he remembered me because we had been to social affairs together and received me very nicely.</span> <span id="s371">Made the tea ceremony.</span> <span id="s372">Very nice.</span> <span id="s373">Very cordial.</span> <span id="s374">Then we got to the nitty gritty of what I came for.</span> <span id="s375">Showed him the cable.</span> <span id="s376">(Pause) And I told him that I was prepared to help him.</span> <span id="s377">It's true that I am an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s378">I don't know what's going to happen with me ext, but for the foreseeable future apparently I'm free, and I'm able to help him, meaning helping the Japanese.</span> <span id="s379">That I would be able to take over, Manny and I, the whole operation in Shanghai and keep feeding the people if he would give me permission to raise the money.</span> <span id="s380">Because without his permission I wouldn't be able to do it.</span> <span id="s381">And I think my last...what was my last sentence, which I didn't learn in the school of social work.</span> <span id="s382">Uh...I said, "Look," I said, "You, as an occupying power, cannot afford to have hungry people riot.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">You're responsible for them.</span> <span id="s384">On the other hand, I can help you, so they won't riot if you'll give me an okay to raise the money.”</span> <span id="s385">And he did it.</span> <span id="s386">On one condition.</span> <span id="s387">That I do not...now what was it he said, "I do not take money from enemy aliens," meaning Europeans, but wherever I could raise it I..</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">he also did something else that was very nice.</span> <span id="s390">The banks were closed.</span> <span id="s391">We had a remittance a few days before Pearl Harbor of money which I was already coming in our name, Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s392">He arranged for the bank to open so that we could get money out, because it was there, before we could start raising money.</span> <span id="s393">And then he also...then the American Red Cross had lots of cracked wheat which had been shipped over and stored and I..</span> <span id="s394">.</span> <span id="s395">I had contact with the American Red Cross and they said, "Look, take it.”</span> <span id="s396">But I had to have his permission.</span> <span id="s397">He gave it to me.</span> <span id="s398">So we had cereals that we could give to our kitchens.</span> <span id="s399">That's about where we were when I had to start raising the money.</span> <span id="s400">Break?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: No.</span> <span id="s402">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Now.</span> <span id="s404">People who... There was plenty of money.</span> <span id="s405">Shanghai was a city of wheelers and dealers with all kinds of black money, black market money.</span> <span id="s406">(Pause) I let it get around that we had something to sell.</span> <span id="s407">And money started coming in.</span> <span id="s408">The banks opened.</span> <span id="s409">Eventually the money started coming in and Manny and I took over.</span> <span id="s410">We went out to Hong Q every day.</span> <span id="s411">The whole year of 1942 we were free.</span> <span id="s412">We weren't interned yet.</span> <span id="s413">And...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: We want to...we want to break now.</span> <span id="s415">We need a break now.</span> <span id="s416">A: We need a break now.</span> <span id="s417">We really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You're doing fine.</span> <span id="s419">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s422">Would you please continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A; Yes.</span> <span id="s424">Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we took over the program in Hong Q and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people.</span> <span id="s425">And we also set up an entirely new committee.</span> <span id="s426">The committee which where...which I found when I originally came to Shanghai, most of them had already been interned by the Japanese.</span> <span id="s427">They weren't around anymore.</span> <span id="s428">And...uh...uh...so that I..</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust.</span> <span id="s431">And gradually while on the one hand we were working in Hong Q and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the hospital and the money ad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee, voluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be able to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s432">And we got a very good committee.</span> <span id="s433">Very, very good committee.</span> <span id="s434">Many of them had been...uh...there for many years.</span> <span id="s435">Russians who had fled the revolution and who had made their home in Shanghai and who were very fine community leaders and whom we could trust.</span> <span id="s436">And the...the one committee that we set up, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt very secure in giving him power of attorney after...if anything should happen to us to ensure that part.</span> <span id="s437">Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing.</span> <span id="s438">Uh...the old kitchens that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very old Chinese kitchens.</span> <span id="s439">And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was going...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition.</span> <span id="s440">So what can we do?</span> <span id="s441">Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of Shanghai, there were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were standing there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used.</span> <span id="s442">So I went up to the Sassoon Company, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for permission and they said, "We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a British company, can't give you that permission.</span> <span id="s443">We're as much enemy aliens as you are.”</span> <span id="s444">So what did we do?</span> <span id="s445">We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at those...uh...boilers and said, "Laura, you've got to get them.”</span> <span id="s446">So one night when it was dark and...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the streets all the time and the...and the rickshaws were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to anybody.</span> <span id="s447">We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the French concession and we highjacked the two big (laughing) boilers, and brought them through the masses of people going into the...buzzing around in the streets of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s448">Nobody was paying any attention to us.</span> <span id="s449">Taking them over the bridge, and we got them to Hong Q. And from that point on, we built a new kitchen which was really giving nutrition and we burned up the old kitchens.</span> <span id="s450">That's one of our fun stories.</span> <span id="s451">Anyway, it got to be around the end of...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by radio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all enemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment.</span> <span id="s452">You would be allowed to take in anything you like to your camp.</span> <span id="s453">They didn't tell us which camp at that point.</span> <span id="s454">Your beds, your...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in.</span> <span id="s455">Food...this is...they were beginning to prepare us.</span> <span id="s456">And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in Paoting.</span> <span id="s457">I had not received a notice yet.</span> <span id="s458">So we packed him off, and a month later I got notice.</span> <span id="s459">And...uh...I actually took my own folding bed and my own mattress and...and...uh....a trunk full of canned goods and stuff and things and...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race.</span> <span id="s460">It's a..</span> <span id="s461">.</span> <span id="s462">an interesting group of people.</span> <span id="s463">Uh...They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another camp of couples, and single men and single women outside of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s464">Right now the name of the camp escapes me, but it isn't important.</span> <span id="s465">It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something like that.</span> <span id="s466">We got to the camp which, of course, was surrounded by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s467">It was a old school house that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere.</span> <span id="s468">And...uh...I got into a room with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the room was to see at the very end there were windows going...getting out to the campus.</span> <span id="s469">It was an old school.</span> <span id="s470">It had a beautiful campus, and I quickly took my bed and dumped it in that area so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the campus.</span> <span id="s471">That was the first thing I thought of.</span> <span id="s472">Anyway, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s473">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an oven...stoves, and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s474">We never burned them again.</span> <span id="s475">We just put on more clothes.</span> <span id="s476">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think.</span> <span id="s477">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old Shanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese.</span> <span id="s478">But that's something I've never had.</span> <span id="s479">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything.</span> <span id="s480">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention.</span> <span id="s481">They gave us everything that was due to us.</span> <span id="s482">They brought in the food.</span> <span id="s483">We had to cook it ourselves.</span> <span id="s484">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized.</span> <span id="s485">Put up your committees.</span> <span id="s486">Do what you like.</span> <span id="s487">We'll bring in the food.</span> <span id="s488">And organize your own social activities.</span> <span id="s489">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising.”</span> <span id="s490">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the camp was that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience.”</span> <span id="s492">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience.</span> <span id="s493">I am a number.</span> <span id="s494">I have a number.</span> <span id="s495">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known.</span> <span id="s496">I don't want to have anything to do with all this.</span> <span id="s497">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs.</span> <span id="s498">So I made a very quick as we say.</span> <span id="s499">I..</span> <span id="s500">.</span> <span id="s501">uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I took kitchen duty.</span> <span id="s502">And...uh...the other thing was...oh...the camp...there was barbed wire all around the camp.</span> <span id="s503">And out there were fields, and we were supposed to grow are own vegetables.</span> <span id="s504">And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...is very important for me.</span> <span id="s505">So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the farm.</span> <span id="s506">And that worked very well.</span> <span id="s507">But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting sick.</span> <span id="s508">And that's natural in all of China.</span> <span id="s509">I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to the hospitals, diarrhea and all that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s510">And...uh...nothing was happening to me.</span> <span id="s511">I was as healthy as a horse.</span> <span id="s512">But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the collective.</span> <span id="s513">So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s514">But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my Sarah Burnhart act.</span> <span id="s515">And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the camp who was an American doctor.</span> <span id="s516">And he gave me a permit to get out to the hospital because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't.</span> <span id="s517">And I got out to the...uh...hospital.</span> <span id="s518">It was a English hospital and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the hospital and he remembered me from...from contacts we had before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s519">And they put me in a ward, and when he came to make his rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter what he did, I was in good shape.</span> <span id="s520">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things.</span> <span id="s521">You shouldn't be in a ward.</span> <span id="s522">I can get you a private room, but if you want a private room you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to Japan for permission.</span> <span id="s523">But I can give you a room with another lady on my own responsibility.”</span> <span id="s524">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the room with the lady.”</span> <span id="s525">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the German bank in Shanghai and he used to come to visit her every day.</span> <span id="s526">And I had no right for visitors.</span> <span id="s527">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors.</span> <span id="s528">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?"</span> <span id="s529">And that's the way I saw Mr. Bitker.</span> <span id="s530">I saw my friends.</span> <span id="s531">I got...I got the message out.</span> <span id="s532">And...uh...I was there for 3 months.</span> <span id="s533">They kept me out in the hospital and then came August...July, August 43.</span> <span id="s534">Right?</span> <span id="s535">And...uh...Italy surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the Swiss Consulate because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens.”</span> <span id="s536">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange.</span> <span id="s537">So I'm going to release you now.</span> <span id="s538">You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be re...on that...on that exchange.</span> <span id="s539">Your name is on it.”</span> <span id="s540">He said I also found out that your name was on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off because they needed you.</span> <span id="s541">(Laughing) So I went back.</span> <span id="s542">Before I went back, I sw Bitker once.</span> <span id="s543">For the last time!</span> <span id="s544">And I got a..</span> <span id="s545">.</span> <span id="s546">because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...in the name of the JDC to repay.</span> <span id="s547">And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">So I said, "Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon.</span> <span id="s549">Just give me a..</span> <span id="s550">.</span> <span id="s551">uh...up to date account of what the situation is financially so I can get it back to New York.</span> <span id="s552">Well, he gave me the whole accounting up-to-date.</span> <span id="s553">When we were prepared in our camp...that was September 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go on a ship.</span> <span id="s554">This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s555">I had always these figures, and I took toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before they...before we were left to go.</span> <span id="s556">And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper.</span> <span id="s557">I wrote every piece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my panties, so that...uh...it was invisible and... uh...started packing.</span> <span id="s558">And in September 43, I forget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our camp and from other camps were taken on a..</span> <span id="s559">.</span> <span id="s560">to go on a Japanese ship as far as Goa where the exchange would take place.</span> <span id="s561">That was in...it was Portugese Goa which was part of the Indian mainland.</span> <span id="s562">And...uh...we got on that ship.</span> <span id="s563">It was...uh...a ship...a Japanese ship which had a passenger capacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we picked up people on the way.</span> <span id="s564">And what they gave us women were...uh...like stalls hat you put horses on and mattresses.</span> <span id="s565">And the mattresses were full of fleas.</span> <span id="s566">So the first...the first night we took all our mattresses (laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: The first...uh...night...we tried to sleep with those fleas, but we couldn't.</span> <span id="s569">We took...all of us women, took all the mattresses out and threw them into the Chinese sea and slept on board.</span> <span id="s570">Just took a blanket and slept on board all the way through.</span> <span id="s571">We picked up people in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s572">We picked up people in...uh...uh...what was...before Vietnam, what was it?</span> <span id="s573">A French...uh...anyhow, French port, and finally we got to Goa, where they...uh...Japanese were coming in on the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... uh...uh...Swedish ship, the Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s574">And...uh... so we packed.</span> <span id="s575">We got...they got...they...they...uh...uh... they were coming from their beautiful ship to our Japanese ship and we were leaving the Japanese ship to go on to the Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s576">And it was...it was like...uh...a school, you know, each one going a different direction, not looking at each other.</span> <span id="s577">And when I got on to the Gripsholm, I felt like for the first time I was totally free.</span> <span id="s578">And it was my 40th birthday.</span> <span id="s579">And...uh...of course, we had the smorgasbord and we had a swimming pool, and then we started with the Gripsholm.</span> <span id="s580">From there on, it was all the way around South Africa where we stopped for 2 nights and the...uh...uh... Jewish community there took us and we had...it was fun.</span> <span id="s581">And then around the...around the Cape.</span> <span id="s582">That's right.</span> <span id="s583">We went around the Cape up to South Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s584">And by...we got to Rio, the JDC had sent someone down to meet me, and...uh...to give me money.</span> <span id="s585">I didn't have a penny.</span> <span id="s586">And to...we were there for 2 nights, and so we went dancing.</span> <span id="s587">And it was fun, and then we up the South Atlantic to New York.</span> <span id="s588">And...uh...in New York, I got a message, we're not allowed...uh...ships were not allowed to dock in New York.</span> <span id="s589">No.</span> <span id="s590">Ships were allowed to dock...uh...to dock, but no one was allowed to come to the port.</span> <span id="s591">It was the height of the war.</span> <span id="s592">And the first shock I had was when I got the message that I should come to the...to which hotel I should come, that the...my friends in the JDC were going to be there...uh...that New York was standing.</span> <span id="s593">All the news we had...uh...way back in...in the...in the camps was that bomb...that...that the Hell had been bombed out of New York, and here were people were complaining about rations.</span> <span id="s594">Anyway, it was a wonderful, wonderful reunion.</span> <span id="s595">And...uh...I stayed in New York, and then before I was allowed to even go and see my family in Cleveland, I went to...uh...we went to...uh...Washington to give a report.</span> <span id="s596">I went with Joseph Swartz who was the then Director of the JDC in Europe, and with Mo Levitt and myself, we...we went by train to Washington.</span> <span id="s597">UNRRA had already become organized.</span> <span id="s598">That was the first time I knew about Hitler.</span> <span id="s599">I knew about Jews in camps, but I never, never knew...never heard the words Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and all that had really happened.</span> <span id="s600">I was...had been completely detached from all that.</span> <span id="s601">And (pause) the JDC at that point was giving a report.</span> <span id="s602">We went to the State Department.</span> <span id="s603">We reported to...uh... UNRRA, and then to the Treasury, Morganthal.</span> <span id="s604">Now, the JDC had been totally cut off from any communication with me.</span> <span id="s605">They could not get an okay from the Treasury, I guess, to send money through Switzerland to Mr. Bitker.</span> <span id="s606">And so we went to the Treasury and I..</span> <span id="s607">.</span> <span id="s608">we had a long session with Morganthal, and gave him the whole story of how it's working.</span> <span id="s609">And he had one question.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Are the Japanese getting any of this money?</span> <span id="s611">And I said, "Not a penny.</span> <span id="s612">It's all in the hands of the Bitker Committee," and I said, "This is what is keeping the 8,000 people we are feeding alive.”</span> <span id="s613">And it was from that point on that the Treasury gave the JDC...this is the way...this is the way I remember it...uh...authorization, because we always had a delegate in...uh...during all the wars.</span> <span id="s614">We always had a delegate in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s615">Sally Myer, a very famous, interesting man, a Swiss.</span> <span id="s616">And they...we were able to give an okay.</span> <span id="s617">They gave us...Morganthal gave us an okay to send money...uh...to the Bitker committee to keep the 8,000 Jews alive.</span> <span id="s618">Now, of course, the JDC was sweet and very nice and...and...uh...they put me in the hospital.</span> <span id="s619">They wanted to be sure that I (laughing) was okay, and I came out okay.</span> <span id="s620">And then they said, "Laura, you've really had it.</span> <span id="s621">We have another job.</span> <span id="s622">We don't want you to leave us, but we have another job for you.</span> <span id="s623">That's in Santi de Mingo, where there were...uh...Jewish farmers.”</span> <span id="s624">They were training refugees to be Jewish farmers in Santi de Mingo.</span> <span id="s625">After I heard what I heard, I said, "No.</span> <span id="s626">I'm not going to go and sit under a palm tree anymore.</span> <span id="s627">I can't do that.”</span> <span id="s628">"I..</span> <span id="s629">.</span> <span id="s630">uh...", said, "that if you don't, it's alright.</span> <span id="s631">Don't want to send me to Europe, it's okay with me.</span> <span id="s632">I'll go to Europe with UNRRA because they'll be going.”</span> <span id="s633">So that's...so one night I had dinner with Dr. Joseph Swartz who was the boss in...uh...in...uh...Paris, in Europe...not...at that time our office was in Lisbon, Portugal, and neutral countries.</span> <span id="s634">We operated in Europe through neutral countries.</span> <span id="s635">And...uh...he said, "Laura, forget it.</span> <span id="s636">You're coming with me to...uh...uh...Lisbon" where we had our office.</span> <span id="s637">And he said, "I have two assignments for you in Europe.”</span> <span id="s638">Alright, my first assignment...I..</span> <span id="s639">.</span> <span id="s640">I shipped off.</span> <span id="s641">I shipped off to Portugal, and the first job that I did there was I..</span> <span id="s642">.</span> <span id="s643">I went up to Spain.</span> <span id="s644">Uh...We're already in 40...45, aren't we?</span> <span id="s645">I think so.</span> <span id="s646">Uh...The...France was occupied as we all know by the...uh...Germans and there were in...internment camps in France and children were becoming separated from their parents.</span> <span id="s647">The parents were being sent to where they were being sent.</span> <span id="s648">The children were hanging around and so the underground...the Jewish resistance movement in France organized a transport of children without parents at that point to be brought over the Pyrenees to Barcelona.</span> <span id="s649">But there was no one in Barcelona...we had an office in Barcelona, but there was no one who would know how to handle children, who would know how to handle...they could handle the money, the financial...uh...but we needed to set up a children's home to receive these children and to...uh...to feed them and to...uh...to staff the place and Dr. Swartz asked me if I would do that, and I certainly did.</span> <span id="s650">I certainly would.</span> <span id="s651">And so I spent 2 or 3 months up in Barcelona, going up...into the border lines, with the...uh...staff, .</span> <span id="s652">.</span> <span id="s653">the rest of the staff and bringing the kids down, and...uh...staffing the whole place so that the children wouldn't be in a panic.</span> <span id="s654">And thus...and those children...many, many years later, I met as grownup mothers and fathers in...in Israel.</span> <span id="s655">We had a nice reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Anyway, when that job was done, I went back to...uh...to...uh...what do you call it?</span> <span id="s657">To...uh...Lisbon, and then Joe said to me, "Look, Laura.</span> <span id="s658">I need someone to fly to Sweden.”</span> <span id="s659">So I said, "Sweden's neutral.</span> <span id="s660">What's the problem?"</span> <span id="s661">He said, "Yes, but it's because it's neutral that we are able through the the German...the Jewish...the...uh...Swedish-Jewish community to send parcels of food into the Germans...the camps in Germany for our people.</span> <span id="s662">And he said, "I would like very much...it means...it's a dangerous job.</span> <span id="s663">You have to hang around London for awhile and the...uh...the...uh... Germans are bombing the Hell out of London still.</span> <span id="s664">The flight, which is not a civilian flight, from somewhere in the British Isles and we never know where it's going to be from...to Sweden is not going to be an easy one.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Will you do it?"</span> <span id="s666">I said, "Okay, I'll do it.”</span> <span id="s667">I flew to London.</span> <span id="s668">And there's a very, very nice story in connection with that.</span> <span id="s669">London, of course, was bombed out as we all know.</span> <span id="s670">I had a reservation in the hotel for 2 nights.</span> <span id="s671">I could hear the</span></p> <p><span id="s672">B-1s, but I didn't have the sense...I didn't have enough sense...I slept through them.</span> <span id="s673">And then, I was told by the hotel that my reservation was out, to please pack and go.</span> <span id="s674">Where do I go?</span> <span id="s675">I didn't know anybody in London.</span> <span id="s676">I knew where the JDC office was in London.</span> <span id="s677">So I took my...as we say in German, my , packed up, went to the office.</span> <span id="s678">And it was a bank holiday.</span> <span id="s679">Of course, it was closed.</span> <span id="s680">But the...uh...the janitor was there.</span> <span id="s681">I told him who I was and I said, "Just leave me in the office, that's all.</span> <span id="s682">Everybody will be in the office tomorrow, and they'll take care of me.</span> <span id="s683">And tonight I'm alright, so I'll put my fur coat on the floor and I'll sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s684">What else can I do?"</span> <span id="s685">He let me in, and as I'm...just as I'm getting in the phone rings.</span> <span id="s686">I'll tell you there is a God that watches over me.</span> <span id="s687">The phone rings, and who do you think it is?</span> <span id="s688">It's one of the couples from Shanghai that I was able to get out in the last minute through my work in the Consulate through their uncle in New York.</span> <span id="s689">And they went on to London and this uncle had been...had been following me and wondering from JDC...constantly asking from JDC where is she now?</span> <span id="s690">And found out that I was in London, told his niece and nephew where I was.</span> <span id="s691">They phoned me at the office, came over right away, and took me to their house.</span> <span id="s692">Didn't have to sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s693">Alright?</span> <span id="s694">Then I hung around London, and then I got all through this...all through the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s695">I had to report everyday...I had to report every place where I was in case we got the clearance to...to fly.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">So...uh...one day when I checked in they said, "You're flying tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s697">And we were picked up.</span> <span id="s698">All this was done for us.</span> <span id="s699">We didn't have to do a thing.</span> <span id="s700">Uh...We flew to somewhere...I've never figured it out yet on the Iris sea.</span> <span id="s701">And the only other...other two people who were in the place cause no...cause there was no civilian flying...uh...were there and...uh...we were just hanging around waiting for orders what to do next.</span> <span id="s702">Just like the Army.</span> <span id="s703">And then one day we were picked up and taken to the airport and told that we had to get into parachutes.</span> <span id="s704">This was never told to us before.</span> <span id="s705">Because the last plane that flew over to Sweden was...uh...bombed down over the Fjords by the Germans who were in...uh...what's the other Scandinavian country?</span> <span id="s706">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Denmark.</span> <span id="s709">Yal.</span> <span id="s710">Not Denmark.</span> <span id="s711">No.</span> <span id="s712">The other one.</span> <span id="s713">Q: Norway.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Norway.</span> <span id="s715">Thank you.</span> <span id="s716">Norway.</span> <span id="s717">The last one didn't get through.</span> <span id="s718">So here put on your... There were two men going to the Embassy and myself.</span> <span id="s719">And you'll find blackout.</span> <span id="s720">When we're over Norway, the lights will go on.</span> <span id="s721">But if, by chance, the pilot tells you...he's opening the door and you jump, all you have to do is just take this zipper and zip it up.</span> <span id="s722">Everyone asks me, "When did you feel the most alive?"</span> <span id="s723">I said, "I think I felt the most alive in a parachute (laughing) when I didn't know what the next moment would bring?"</span> <span id="s724">Anyway, we got through.</span> <span id="s725">And then I did my bit.</span> <span id="s726">We had the money and consent already from the Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s727">They were able to make parcels and we started the...uh...parcel sending to...uh...Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz...I don't think Auschwitz was in that vicinity.</span> <span id="s728">It was mostly in the English and the...uh...English area, near....where they could.</span> <span id="s729">And after 2 or 3 months there, I again flew back and this time I flew back in a..</span> <span id="s730">.</span> <span id="s731">uh...bomber where the...American....</span> <span id="s732">You see, in Sweden you had to be so careful because the Germans were also there.</span> <span id="s733">It was neutral.</span> <span id="s734">Anyway, an...an American Captain and myself flew in the hub with the...uh...with the crew.</span> <span id="s735">And we got to an air base in London.</span> <span id="s736">We didn't know where we were flying.</span> <span id="s737">We got to an air base in London and we...we got out.</span> <span id="s738">All of...all the...the whole...the whole base was around the plane.</span> <span id="s739">And we couldn't understand what was the big reception.</span> <span id="s740">Well, they had had a plane before that had been shot down, and they were wondering if this one would come through.</span> <span id="s741">So there we were!</span> <span id="s742">In order to get back to London, I had to sit in the camp there for a week, and...uh...that was a terrible thing because I could...I was there and I saw the boys fly out in the morning.</span> <span id="s743">And not all the planes came back at night.</span> <span id="s744">Wasn't nice.</span> <span id="s745">And then one day they said to me, "Alright, now there's a train going into London.</span> <span id="s746">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s747">Here's your ticket.</span> <span id="s748">Get into London.”</span> <span id="s749">So I finally got back to London, went to the JDC office, and...uh...then Joe Schwartz was there and he said to me, "You know the...uh...the landings are going to take place very soon, and we'll be going into...uh...Germany...no, we'll be going into...uh ...France.”</span> <span id="s750">And he said, "I'd like you, if you will, to...to cross when...when I tell you you can cross, when they...when they tell us you can cross, and .</span> <span id="s751">.</span> <span id="s752">uh...get into Belgium.</span> <span id="s753">But you have to get...you can't go into Belgium or Holland because the war is still on, but it...in France, in Paris that we are preparing staff, and you will have to get a uniform and you'll have to get army status for travel, but you can cross safely.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">So I crossed.</span> <span id="s755">When they time when they told me I could go, I went.</span> <span id="s756">In fact, that's the way...the only way you could work.</span> <span id="s757">You didn't ask questions.</span> <span id="s758">And...uh...and you didn't ask for a ticket either or a hotel.</span> <span id="s759">And...uh...I got to Paris, and there was...Paris was liberated already.</span> <span id="s760">And...uh...there was the...uh...office, what they called the Adjutant General's office, AGO.</span> <span id="s761">So I got my uniform.</span> <span id="s762">I got my army card.</span> <span id="s763">I got the rank of Colonel, which meant that I could fly back and forth all over Europe anytime with that card.</span> <span id="s764">And to get to Brussels, however, I had to take a train, and that took a whole day.</span> <span id="s765">Now, it takes an hour.</span> <span id="s766">Uh...I got to Brussels, and the Germans had just cleared Brussels.</span> <span id="s767">They had cleared the south of Holland.</span> <span id="s768">Belgium was finished.</span> <span id="s769">They...they had finished with Belgium.</span> <span id="s770">In fact, I think I was in Brussels on V.E. Day, when the war in Europe ended.</span> <span id="s771">Was the month of May V.E. day?</span> <span id="s772">I think so.</span> <span id="s773">But I was made...I had an office in Brussels, but I was...the Germans were still in...in Holland.</span> <span id="s774">They were just evacuating.</span> <span id="s775">Anyway...uh...I did get up to the south Eindhoven and there I found a Jewish community that had survived, went with an ambulance into Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s776">And we got into Amsterdam...I went with one of my staff.</span> <span id="s777">I wasn't alone.</span> <span id="s778">We got into Amsterdam, I think 24 hours after...uh...the Germans left, evacuated.</span> <span id="s779">I met with the Jewish community, got all the information we needed.</span> <span id="s780">I wasn't going to stay there.</span> <span id="s781">I stayed there a few days, but it was really to get a..</span> <span id="s782">.</span> <span id="s783">a..</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">a. view of the situation and to be able to report back.</span> <span id="s786">I had that, and then it was time to go back to Brussels where my office was.</span> <span id="s787">And on the way back, I began to feel sick...tired.</span> <span id="s788">Tired!</span> <span id="s789">Tired!</span> <span id="s790">By the time I got to Brussels, I felt sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">And the doctor called...someone called the Belgium doctor, and he examined me and he said, "In your condition, you'll never be able to work again.”</span> <span id="s792">So...uh...I said, "Alright, so I'll be going home.”</span> <span id="s793">At the same time, Shave Mission, the American Shave Mission of Belgium was in Brussels, and Eddie Warberg, who was also the President, then and later became President of JDC was also at Shave Mission.</span> <span id="s794">And...uh...he and I used to see each other.</span> <span id="s795">And when he heard that I was sick, he came right over, and he said, "Don't take any Belgium doctor.”</span> <span id="s796">He said, "Forget it.</span> <span id="s797">I'm putting you in the Army hospital.”</span> <span id="s798">I was in the Army hospital for 3 days, and came out very healthy.</span> <span id="s799">And then I said to my boss, I said, "Joe, I'm tired.</span> <span id="s800">I want to go back to the States, spend time with my family, take a vacation in Havana.”</span> <span id="s801">He said, "Yal, but you're not going to stop?"</span> <span id="s802">I said, "No, I'm not going to stop.</span> <span id="s803">I just need a break.”</span> <span id="s804">Which is exactly the way it worked, and when I got back, really had a good rest, felt good, fine, he said, "Laura, how would you like to go to Paris and take over the operation there?"</span> <span id="s805">That was already 46?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: This is after the war is all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: The war is all over, thank God.</span> <span id="s808">Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s809">I said...uh..."Paris?</span> <span id="s810">Why not?</span> <span id="s811">A very attractive idea.”</span> <span id="s812">I got to Paris in June 46.</span> <span id="s813">Headquarters of JDC were already open, but we were not in the same building.</span> <span id="s814">We had...they had their...their European office in one building and I was in the French...French operation.</span> <span id="s815">We had a different building.</span> <span id="s816">Joe Schwartz was there all...most of the time.</span> <span id="s817">That was the period when the camps were...the...the...uh... concentration camps were being emptied out of the survivors.</span> <span id="s818">Germany was a big operation.</span> <span id="s819">Uh...And Joe had his office in the office for France, in the office...in the...uh...Headquarters office, and I had...I was just...just France.</span> <span id="s820">I didn't want any more.</span> <span id="s821">I had enough.</span> <span id="s822">And that was a very challenging experience, a very challenging experience, because first of all I was already in good shape again, you know.</span> <span id="s823">And...uh...I had the feeling that now I could do some creat...some creative work.</span> <span id="s824">And...uh...it was a good idea, because that's where I met my husband.</span> <span id="s825">He's a very active person in the Jewish community and...uh...we were absolutely and completely working on the same thing.</span> <span id="s826">I as a pro, he as a layman.</span> <span id="s827">And one of the things we were doing and we were working with the illegal immigration to of Palestine with the Jewish Brichah as we used to call it.</span> <span id="s828">The survivors that were going to go, but illegally to Palestine.</span> <span id="s829">That was 46.</span> <span id="s830">And we really...that...that was a wonderful period, because I was no longer saving lives.</span> <span id="s831">I had a feeling of a..</span> <span id="s832">.</span> <span id="s833">of a future.</span> <span id="s834">And then came the time when I decided that it was time for me to get married.</span> <span id="s835">(laughing) Because I found...I had found the person that I wanted to marry.</span> <span id="s836">(laughing) Some times when people in silly magazine interviews would interview me, they'd say, "What made you do all these things?"</span> <span id="s837">I said, "Well, I went around the world looking for my husband, and I found him."</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: And he found you.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: We found each other.</span> <span id="s840">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s841">And...uh...then...uh...we did.</span> <span id="s842">We just went to the and got married and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s843">No big wedding.</span> <span id="s844">He'd lost his wife during the...uh...well, she had really been with him all the time, but when the time came toward the end where they had to...where they came back and could find no house, no nothing and all his library was gone.</span> <span id="s845">The...the Germans had taken everything from him, he says...he once said...he had a wonderful sense of humor and he used to say, "The only time I enjoyed being...the only time I was ever on the sameness with the Rothchilds was when the Germans had my name on the list of people they were after.”</span> <span id="s846">(laughing) So, anyway after I married I said, "Look, I'm so tired of running...very tired of running.</span> <span id="s847">How about our going to Israel?"</span> <span id="s848">That was before the...no...state was declared in 48...and this...I think I had this idea already in 47, but...uh...I didn't feel that my job in Paris was finished in building a new community and helping the community to build itself.</span> <span id="s849">For the first time I was able to use the real skills that I was trained for.</span> <span id="s850">And so we made our decision that in 53, we would both...uh...just...that was after the state already, we would go to Palestine...we would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s851">And there I continued working and so does my husband, but...uh...I felt for the first time that I had roots.</span> <span id="s852">I had been floating.</span> <span id="s853">And...uh...it was really... uh...I..</span> <span id="s854">.</span> <span id="s855">I think the first time in all my years since Constantinople that I felt...uh...real good and at peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Were you there for many years?</span> <span id="s857">A: 30 years.</span> <span id="s858">Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: 53 to 83?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Uh?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: 53 to 83?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I didn't hear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: 1953 to 1983?</span> <span id="s864">Is that about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s866">That's right.</span> <span id="s867">My husband died in...uh...(pause)...in 75.</span> <span id="s868">I continued working, but... Q: What sort of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: In Israel?</span> <span id="s870">Well, I was doing something more...much more creative.</span> <span id="s871">Something that I was...I was learning at the same time that I was working cause I really knew nothing about handicapped children.</span> <span id="s872">First of all, I was not working as an American there.</span> <span id="s873">I was working in the...in the frame of the JDC because there was the money, but I was...uh...not being paid in dollars anymore.</span> <span id="s874">I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s875">I really felt so strongly about that that I just wanted to be one of the country.</span> <span id="s876">I had to learn Hebrew, but this was one language I didn't...I wasn't born with, but I do have an ear and I used to go to the...to a teacher at 6:30 in the morning and take my lessons, and I was provided with a bilingual secretarial help, and I bluffed my way through Hebrew because of my ear, I could just pick up things.</span> <span id="s877">And...uh...after his death, I still kept working, kept our house, and it was only really after my family in America began saying, "Look, why don't you come and join us?"</span> <span id="s878">To this day, I don't know whether I did the right thing, but doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s879">Uh...I think the only time in all of my life that I ever felt that I belonged, that I had roots...there were many things that I didn't like there, just as you don't like anywhere else.</span> <span id="s880">You don't like everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: So you've been here since 1983, 1984, living in Teaneck.</span> <span id="s882">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s883">Living in Teaneck.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: With your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span> <span id="s886">I have my own apartment.</span> <span id="s887">That was one condition because ...uh...I love them dearly, but I wanted to have my own life.</span> <span id="s888">And...uh...it's been a very good life.</span> <span id="s889">It's been a very satisfying life in the sense that I don't know how any of these things ever happened because I've never reached out.</span> <span id="s890">Uh...I have had students from the Hebrew University who are doing their thesis.</span> <span id="s891">One about anti-Semitism in Japan.</span> <span id="s892">One about anti-Semitism in...uh...in...uh...Cuba, so these...these young people catch up with me.</span> <span id="s893">And...uh...also, survivors of the Shanghai experience have caught up with me.</span> <span id="s894">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s895">.</span> <span id="s896">uh...and so actually I would say it's been a very good, comfortable, satisfying life.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You have many, many wonderful things to look back on and look ahead toward too.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: But this is the greatest experience I've had yet, coming and...and talking into so many machines.</span> <span id="s899">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Is there anything else finally that you'd like to say, to tell us, would like to leave on the tape?</span> <span id="s901">A: I wish I were 10, 15 years younger.</span> <span id="s902">Not much more.</span> <span id="s903">Because I find the world so interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">I find what's happening now in the world very exciting.</span> <span id="s905">I can't be a part of it anymore.</span> <span id="s906">I can only be platonic.</span> <span id="s907">I'm a voracious reader.</span> <span id="s908">I think since I'm back I've enjoyed the pleasure of catching up on my love for history, and understanding so many things that I never understood before when I was in action.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: You've lived through a great deal of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: I've lived through history, yes, and I'm very grateful for it, but...uh...I still feel that I..</span> <span id="s911">.</span> <span id="s912">I don't know how to put it.</span> <span id="s913">That if I had a wish at all and I..</span> <span id="s914">.</span> <span id="s915">I say this honestly, I would rather be in Israel than here, although I am very, very unhappy with what is happening there.</span> <span id="s916">But it...it's become a part of me.</span> <span id="s917">Now does it go back to my father and his love for the country?</span> <span id="s918">He also made the compromise and came to America.</span> <span id="s919">I don't know.</span> <span id="s920">I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: It seems to be that you can say and feel that you've done a great deal to make Israel possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">With that I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I and not only I.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: You yourself have had a lot to do with it, and that's something that you certainly can look back on with a great deal of satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: It's been a wonderful interview and thank you very much for having done it.</span> <span id="s927">A: You're very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
