Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born August 8, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And in what town and country were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born in Riga, Latvia, the capitol of Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Was your town ever known by any other name that you’re aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Not since the year 1200.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father’s name was Aaron -- or Adolf.</span> <span id="s17">My mother’s name was Sophie or Shifrah .</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And what was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Feitelsohn.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Do you recall your grandparents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: The one side was the Wildauer, obviously, but I do not remember the first names.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Any names of your great-grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Do you know where your grandparents were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: They were born in Latvia, also.</span> <span id="s26">However, it was at that time Russia, and is now Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And your great-grandparents?</span> <span id="s28">Do you know where they were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Probably the same area.</span> <span id="s30">As far as I know, we hail from there.</span> <span id="s31">I do not know how we got that name because it us an unusual name.</span> <span id="s32">I don’t know if somebody may have made it up because it’s certainly a Jewish name and my grandparents were orthodox.</span> <span id="s33">My parents were orthodox in a way, keeping the holidays and a kosher house.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My father was a merchant.</span> <span id="s36">He had a ladies’ and mens’ furnishings store.</span> <span id="s37">Shirts, ties, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My mother worked with him.</span> <span id="s40">They worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: About how large was the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Riga is a big city.</span> <span id="s43">It was, at that time, before the war, 350,000 people.</span> <span id="s44">It’s now over a million.</span> <span id="s45">It’s the capitol of Latvia and it was known as the “little Paris.”</span> <span id="s46">Very modern city and also old fashioned.</span> <span id="s47">Latvia is a buffer state between Russia and Germany, and it’s located in the southwest corner, with borders on Russia, Poland, and Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: We spoke German.</span> <span id="s50">The Jews in Latvia spoke either German or Russian, but we also all spoke Latvian.</span> <span id="s51">And all the languages were compulsory in public schools -- German, Latvian, Russian.</span> <span id="s52">As a matter of fact, our state signs were in three languages when I was little.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: You said your parents were orthodox.</span> <span id="s54">Could you describe a little bit more about their practices?</span> <span id="s55">Were they very observant, were they religious Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: They were observant, but not very observant.</span> <span id="s57">They kept the holidays strict, and there were a lot of arguments in the house sometimes when the store was open, and before a holiday they went a little bit too late, because a customer was in the store.</span> <span id="s58">I would say they were orthodox.</span> <span id="s59">My father couldn’t always afford to go to the synagogue because you had to buy a seat.</span> <span id="s60">Things were tough in the ‘30s.</span> <span id="s61">But it was an orthodox house.</span> <span id="s62">We children ate outside everything but in the house we kept kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did your family keep Shabbos?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: No.</span> <span id="s65">My father couldn’t because it was a necessity of life, so he had to keep his store open on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s66">Once in a while on Holidays he laid t’fillin.</span> <span id="s67">But I’d say he was orthodox.</span> <span id="s68">He was very bricha, well versed.</span> <span id="s69">He knew practically the Hagadah out of his head.</span> <span id="s70">He could read, he was just standing and bubbling away.</span> <span id="s71">I don’t know if he knew what he was saying, because he didn’t know Hebrew, but he could read it and remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you receive a formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No.</span> <span id="s74">I went to a German school and other Jews either chose the German or the Russian school.</span> <span id="s75">They spoke at home Russian or spoke at home German.</span> <span id="s76">Very few of them spoke at home Latvian.</span> <span id="s77">But they all knew the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Were there any special times set aside when your father or your mother would give you any Jewish instruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span> <span id="s80">They were actually a little busy with their business that they had.</span> <span id="s81">They had at one time a very fine business, but it deteriorated between World War I and World War II to the point that they just struggled to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What events, local, national or international, were you aware of from the mid-1930s till 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: We knew everything, being as close to Germany as we were.</span> <span id="s84">The Germans were very strong, the Russians, they were very strong, and our radios picked up everything!</span> <span id="s85">When the war broke out in 1939, we listened to the war news from the Russian side and the German side and from any side.</span> <span id="s86">We could really compare.</span> <span id="s87">They were all overdoing it.</span> <span id="s88">The Germans were reporting they shot down 50 planes and lost one, and the other side was reporting they shot down 50 planes and lost one, so then you knew there was a battle and everybody lost some.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So the radio was your primary source of information?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Papers, radio -- it was a free country.</span> <span id="s91">It was a democracy established in 1918, and it fell apart in 1939.</span> <span id="s92">Now it became a dictatorship.</span> <span id="s93">It was a very fine democracy in the early years, from ’18 to ’36.</span> <span id="s94">We had a parliament, we had about 300-some members in the parliament, we had two Jewish parties, one orthodox, one not quite as orthodox, both very well, led by rabbis, Rabbi Neurock and Rabbi Dubin.</span> <span id="s95">One was liberal, one was not so liberal.</span> <span id="s96">But they had two parties and we voted.</span> <span id="s97">It took so many votes to send a member to the parliament, and there were enough Jewish votes.</span> <span id="s98">There were 40,000 Jews living in Riga and 90,000 in the total of Latvia.</span> <span id="s99">So they were concentrated primarily in the larger cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you live in a predominately Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No.</span> <span id="s102">We did have a Jewish and poorer Latvian neighborhood, but Jews in general lived pretty much all over the city, scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: You mentioned that you went to a German school, and the next question regards your contact with gentiles, so obviously in school you had contact --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s105">I had contact with several -- we were friends.</span> <span id="s106">There was never brought anything up.</span> <span id="s107">There were anti-Semitic, little incidents, from a teacher sometimes, who called Jews “the black growth.”</span> <span id="s108">It’s one of those things.</span> <span id="s109">But you didn’t pay attention to it, you was young.</span> <span id="s110">I only went to grammar school until I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s111">That’s all the schooling I had.</span> <span id="s112">We had a different system.</span> <span id="s113">To 14 you went to grammar school, and then you went to a middle school, which right now there is talk about establishing here in the United States.</span> <span id="s114">And then you came to the university.</span> <span id="s115">Our middle school was a rehash of what you learned in the grammar school.</span> <span id="s116">When we came out of the grammar school, we could read and write perfectly.</span> <span id="s117">That was a necessity.</span> <span id="s118">You could add, you were ready for life.</span> <span id="s119">And people that had to go out and work and could not afford a higher education, that’s how far they went.</span> <span id="s120">I had to help my parents and so I went out to work.</span> <span id="s121">I was 14 and-a-half when I got my first full time job.</span> <span id="s122">I went to work in a factory as a mechanic.</span> <span id="s123">I learned from the needle, in the knitting factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Back to the question about contact with gentiles for a moment, did you ever have gentiles in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s126">I wouldn’t say that was a routine.</span> <span id="s127">We didn’t have much company in the home.</span> <span id="s128">It’s the first time anybody ever asked me those questions.</span> <span id="s129">It was occasions that we had, but it’s not like we entertain now.</span> <span id="s130">Most of the time the entertainment was done when somebody got married, or a bar mitzvah or something.</span> <span id="s131">I don’t know if other people had it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Other than the occasional remarks from a teacher, do you remember any other incidents of anti-Semitism prior to the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s134">Things started to change when Hitler came to power in 1933.</span> <span id="s135">There was always anti-Semitism in Latvia, but it was a silent anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s136">People would go into a Jewish store, and if they didn’t like anything, they would say, “Why don’t you go to Palestine?”</span> <span id="s137">or they would say, “I don’t like Yidden, you can sell it cheaper,” or they would even say, like that, “a Jew.”</span> <span id="s138">It wasn’t very common, but it was done.</span> <span id="s139">But the Latvians are an anti-Semitic folk, like the Lithuanians, like the Poles, like the Ukrainians, like the Romanians.</span> <span id="s140">They’re anti-Semitic in this border area, and surprisingly enough, where the whole trouble started -- in Germany -- people in Germany, in general, were less anti-Semitic than the people in those countries.</span> <span id="s141">And when the Germans finally, in the war, marched in there, they found out that there was a beautiful ground there to get rid of the Jews, because they were in-born anti-Semites in those countries.</span> <span id="s142">I served in the Latvian army, and as I mentioned before, there were also some officers, they were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s143">A Jew could not get any rank, no sergeant or officer or anything in the Latvian army.</span> <span id="s144">The second rank, a corporal, that’s as far as you could go.</span> <span id="s145">Give you an example.</span> <span id="s146">We were in the maneuvers someplace -- military exercises.</span> <span id="s147">And it just fell into the Jewish Holidays in September.</span> <span id="s148">There was an order from the top to let us off during the day, so we can go to the synagogues.</span> <span id="s149">There were some very orthodox ones -- used to go everyday in the stable and pray until we had a directive, because, as I said before, Rabbi Dubin was very influential in the parliament.</span> <span id="s150">There came a directive from the War Ministry that we should have the day off, so we can attend our services.</span> <span id="s151">Well, the commander out in the field was an anti-Semite and he said the hell with it, he didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s152">One of the Jews wrote to Dubin and this officer was demoted for not letting the Jews off.</span> <span id="s153">So this is what kind of Jekyll and Hyde situation out there.</span> <span id="s154">They were trying to keep some kind of a democracy going, but then, on the other hand, it was counter-acted by the anti-Semites.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you have relatives that lived outside of your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I had an uncle here in America, but no, the rest of them all lived in Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Would you like to say anything more about your experiences of having served in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I just served eleven months in there, and it wasn’t anything unusual.</span> <span id="s159">We were a group of Jews.</span> <span id="s160">In every regiment there were some Jews.</span> <span id="s161">And somehow the Jews always tried, in the worst way, to serve in the capitol of Riga.</span> <span id="s162">We had regiments scattered all over the country, as big as the country was.</span> <span id="s163">It wasn’t very big.</span> <span id="s164">The longest distance was about two hours’ train ride.</span> <span id="s165">But that was the most hated point -- way down on the Lithuanian border.</span> <span id="s166">My older brother, when he had to go in the army, somebody pulled a couple of strings, my Dad went to this Dubin, and they managed to keep him in Riga.</span> <span id="s167">He became a musician.</span> <span id="s168">He knew a little bit to play the cello, so they went to a teacher and he learned how to play the trumpet, so he stayed in the capitol city.</span> <span id="s169">I was too proud.</span> <span id="s170">I wasn’t going to do nothing!</span> <span id="s171">I was going to let the chips fall as they may.</span> <span id="s172">Well they fell badly, because I ended up in that farthest point, in one of the worst regiments we had.</span> <span id="s173">But it was so far away, life just went on routinely.</span> <span id="s174">The soldiers were not babied like the American soldiers in U.S. armies.</span> <span id="s175">It was a pretty primitive way of life.</span> <span id="s176">There were some little anti-Semitic incidents.</span> <span id="s177">But in general, I would say, no.</span> <span id="s178">I was even put in charge of a laundry out there while I was serving.</span> <span id="s179">And the guy before me who I took over from because he went home, he was also a Jew.</span> <span id="s180">They had a hunch that the Jews are a little bit more intelligent.</span> <span id="s181">That’s a fact!</span> <span id="s182">This particular job was originally held by an officer, full time.</span> <span id="s183">And then it was turned to a sergeant.</span> <span id="s184">It was a laughable thing to do.</span> <span id="s185">And it went on and finally it ended up just the university graduates getting them.</span> <span id="s186">The man in front of me was a university graduate.</span> <span id="s187">I was the first one who came out of grammar school that got the job, because they thought I was intelligent enough to do it.</span> <span id="s188">The whole thing I had to do was just about two hours on one day and about two hours the next day, and the rest of them I could have attended all the exercises, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s189">We tried to string it out.</span> <span id="s190">If anything came along, a hike or a forced march, you stayed home, you did something about work then.</span> <span id="s191">So you tried to get away with it.</span> <span id="s192">I would say it was just a routine life at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What exactly was the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I was getting the laundry from the soldiers in and getting it to the laundry, have it washed, and when it came back, it had to be doled out.</span> <span id="s195">Just pretty much like a clerk in a Laundromat or something.</span> <span id="s196">In 1936, the thing started to change.</span> <span id="s197">Hitler was in power in Germany.</span> <span id="s198">The military leader, our War Minister, and another, with some help, overthrew the government and formed a dictatorship -- under pressure of the Germans.</span> <span id="s199">And then things started to change in Latvia.</span> <span id="s200">It became Latvia for the Latvians, and they didn’t want to let the Jews have apartments -- decent ones.</span> <span id="s201">They tried quietly to suppress them, but it was not officially done.</span> <span id="s202">One thing that may have contributed to the trouble of the Jews in Latvia was that in 1940, the Russians marched into Latvia.</span> <span id="s203">They occupied Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania.</span> <span id="s204">I think they had it partitioned off.</span> <span id="s205">That made an agreement with the Germans, and they had those countries divided up.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: That was the era of the Non-Aggression Pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Right.</span> <span id="s208">Ribbentrop was up there.</span> <span id="s209">It came as a surprise, of course, to the Western powers.</span> <span id="s210">To show that the Russians do not have any design to do anything to the Germans, and in turn, by showing the Russians that they don’t have any design on the area, Ribbentrop decided to take the German population -- volunteering -- back to Germany.</span> <span id="s211">So people that lived there for ten generations -- everybody -- the ministers, the leaders in the community, everybody was working then to show the Russians that they do not want to stay.</span> <span id="s212">And a lot of people are afraid of the Communists.</span> <span id="s213">We knew what their life was like behind the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s214">So they went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s215">And that year, under the Russians, if you didn’t mingle in politics, it went on, it was a normal life.</span> <span id="s216">I was a working man.</span> <span id="s217">My dad lost his business.</span> <span id="s218">It was nationalized.</span> <span id="s219">I worked there and I practically became his boss, because I was like the foreman there.</span> <span id="s220">But that lasted a year.</span> <span id="s221">The Russians came in June of ’40, and the Germans came in July of ’41.</span> <span id="s222">That’s one year.</span> <span id="s223">When the Russians came in -- this may interest you.</span> <span id="s224">There was a large part of the Jewish population in Latvia that really had a hopeless way of life.</span> <span id="s225">The sound anti-Semitism that was out there, a Jew could not get a job in a Latvian factory or in a Latvian business.</span> <span id="s226">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s227">Maybe there were -- on one hand you could probably count them, in the whole city -- Jews that would work in the Latvian business.</span> <span id="s228">On the other hand, the Jews tried to employ some Jews.</span> <span id="s229">In our particular case, we had about 120 workers.</span> <span id="s230">We were only allowed a certain percentage minority.</span> <span id="s231">The majority had to be Latvians!</span> <span id="s232">Not just a majority, but an overwhelming majority, like 75 or 80 percent.</span> <span id="s233">So there was a large segment of the Jewish population that did not have anything to do, or couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s234">It was just almost hopeless.</span> <span id="s235">When the Russians came in, they greeted the Russians as liberators, because all of a sudden the doors were open to them.</span> <span id="s236">They could get a job.</span> <span id="s237">They had chances.</span> <span id="s238">Jewish people became prosecutors, they became this or they became that.</span> <span id="s239">We never had a Jew on the streetcar.</span> <span id="s240">We didn’t have a Jew on the police force.</span> <span id="s241">We didn’t have a Jew at the telephone company.</span> <span id="s242">Never in an official function -- a Jew.</span> <span id="s243">As I said, it was not pronounced, it wasn’t brought up, I never thought about it until later years.</span> <span id="s244">It was just not common, it was not our job.</span> <span id="s245">With that fact that the Russians were in there, the Jews started to have a little better way of life, they were equal to the rest of the population, because at that time in Russia it became a crime to call somebody “Jew.”</span> <span id="s246">They had to call them “Hebrew.”</span> <span id="s247">If somebody would swear to you, you’d arrest them and fine them.</span> <span id="s248">Of course, the Latvians resented that, and when the Germans came in, they were very willing to help the Germans in doing those things to the Jews.</span> <span id="s249">So our lot worsened because the Russians were in there for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Because it helped to build up the resentment of the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s252">It increased it.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You were how old, then, in 1939, when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: That makes me 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And do you remember exactly how you received news of the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And how!</span> <span id="s257">I see myself right now sitting in the apartment -- not in my house.</span> <span id="s258">I have friends, and I see that radio standing in the corner, and the announcement came.</span> <span id="s259">And immediately, we went downstairs, and within minutes there were lines at the grocery store -- people trying to buy things -- sugar, salt, these were things that we did not have in the country, that was imported.</span> <span id="s260">We’re standing in line, buying immediately.</span> <span id="s261">Now we are 1939.</span> <span id="s262">This was the war between Germany and France, Poland particularly.</span> <span id="s263">I’ll jump over to 1941, because that’s the year when the Germans came in on July 1st.</span> <span id="s264">And the city was celebrating.</span> <span id="s265">The Latvians were celebrating, because they got rid of the Russians, which they hated with a vengeance.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Let me ask you a question before you go on.</span> <span id="s267">Before the Germans came, were there any discussions among you and your family about possibly leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: We were not scared.</span> <span id="s269">That’s the interesting part about this.</span> <span id="s270">We should have been, because I had a sister living in Germany, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s271">She was married, too.</span> <span id="s272">She married in the early ‘30s.</span> <span id="s273">And she married a person who was stateless!</span> <span id="s274">Didn’t have a citizenship.</span> <span id="s275">These were people that had what they called a Nansen Passport.</span> <span id="s276">They were cut off in World War I from Poland where he was born, and because he didn’t have any sort of identification -- and that is a very important thing in Europe to have -- that Norwegian explorer, Friedhof Nansen, he was very instrumental in the League of Nations in Geneva, and these people being issued identification all received a passport, and it was called a Nansen Passport, because it was in his name.</span> <span id="s277">And that passport permitted them to live in the country where they are, to travel, that they would be allowed into another country.</span> <span id="s278">Let’s say, if they wanted to go to France, the German government, if they happened to live in Germany, would give them a re-entry visa in advance.</span> <span id="s279">So, when my brother-in-law came to Latvia to get married, he had to get one of those re-entry visas into Germany, and he went back.</span> <span id="s280">There were some excesses that we heard a lot about in Latvia, all over Europe, but it wasn’t that bad that he didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s281">He had a job.</span> <span id="s282">He was a furrier, working for a business.</span> <span id="s283">My sister used to come to Latvia once a year for sure, but sometimes twice a year, with the children which they had.</span> <span id="s284">Conversations came up and in conversation they said, “Would you rather have the Russians?”</span> <span id="s285">-- was before the Russians came -- because we knew something will happen.</span> <span id="s286">And she said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s287">And my dad said, “Well, if I had a choice, I would rather take the Germans -- after all, they’re cultural people.”</span> <span id="s288">So my sister told him, “Dad, you don’t know what you’re talking about!”</span> <span id="s289">I still remember that.</span> <span id="s290">The way she said that.</span> <span id="s291">She went back, of course to Germany, and she kept her Latvian citizenship, which you could.</span> <span id="s292">She had a passport and every six months or a year, she renewed it at the Latvian Consulate in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">In 1938, things started to get tough.</span> <span id="s294">That was when the Kristallnacht was in Germany, when they broke the store windows.</span> <span id="s295">By that time, my brother-in-law had lost his job.</span> <span id="s296">The department store where he worked was taken over by somebody else, and he was just without a job.</span> <span id="s297">At that time they didn’t have any kind of a livelihood whatsoever.</span> <span id="s298">He was not paid for his work what he has done before.</span> <span id="s299">Lost it all!</span> <span id="s300">The decided for survival -- and other people are closing their stores -- they opened a store in Germany.</span> <span id="s301">They opened a furrier shop.</span> <span id="s302">You have to realize that Hitler was in power -- 1936.</span> <span id="s303">They opened a furrier shop, and they started to do very well, because the German population was not anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s304">They didn’t give a damn where they shopped, at least in Berlin.</span> <span id="s305">I’m not going to say that, in some part of the country, like Bavaria, there weren’t different situations, but in Berlin, it was a big city, and they did a fabulous business in that little shop that they had.</span> <span id="s306">That store was smaller than this room.</span> <span id="s307">Lots smaller!</span> <span id="s308">Half of this room!</span> <span id="s309">And in the back another half where they had the little workshop.</span> <span id="s310">And the Germans were wearing at that time little fur coats, so they made a good living.</span> <span id="s311">As a matter of fact, in 1936, she invited me and my younger brother to go to Berlin for a visit, and she paid the trip.</span> <span id="s312">We were young at that time.</span> <span id="s313">She gave us some spending money, and we went of course back.</span> <span id="s314">We had a couple nice weeks and we went back.</span> <span id="s315">And there was Hitler in power!</span> <span id="s316">In Germany!</span> <span id="s317">I didn’t see any excesses there at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">In 1938 things started to get a little tough, and that’s the time she came home.</span> <span id="s319">As a matter of fact, my younger sister went back to Germany and picked up the children and brought them to Latvia.</span> <span id="s320">My sister stayed with her husband.</span> <span id="s321">He tried to cross the border several times.</span> <span id="s322">They caught him.</span> <span id="s323">They sent him back.</span> <span id="s324">Didn’t do nothing to him, just sent him back.</span> <span id="s325">But in 1938, my sister came home, a couple days before Christmas.</span> <span id="s326">I was too young to be really concerned about it.</span> <span id="s327">I had my girlfriends, and things like that.</span> <span id="s328">I know how tense they were at home.</span> <span id="s329">My sister was waiting for some news from her husband because he tried to cross the border into Belgium and he succeeded.</span> <span id="s330">He got into Belgium.</span> <span id="s331">Well, 1940, the war broke out there, and the Germans overran Belgium, so he run into France.</span> <span id="s332">Then they run into France and he run to southern France, and finally that’s where the war stopped, and he was interned by the Vichy government in an internment camp, now under pressure of the Germans, obviously.</span> <span id="s333">By that time the Russians have come in in 1940, in Latvia.</span> <span id="s334">And the only message we received from him was a Red Cross card, “I’m released from the camp.</span> <span id="s335">I’m on the way to Marseille, and I want to go to America.”</span> <span id="s336">He had a brother here.</span> <span id="s337">But he never arrived in America.</span> <span id="s338">It happened, like a lot of cases, either he was killed before it, or he may have been killed by the very people who were going to get him passage, or maybe somebody wanted to get him to Africa, and from there out, and take their money and drown them, throw them overboard, like it happened to refugees right now, from El Salvador.</span> <span id="s339">My sister was, by that time, caught in Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So now it’s 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: It’s 1940.</span> <span id="s342">When war is near, or the situation is rough, Russians like to get the border population out, further inland, particularly the people who they feel are anti-Russian -- all former officers, all former policemen, all capitalists, who they have taken businesses away -- and they were not discriminating between Jews and not-Jews, although the percentage of the Jews that were deported is probably a lot larger than the percentage of the Latvians that were deported.</span> <span id="s343">And the way they did it, they mobilized every single truck in the city on a given night, and they went with orders to pick somebody up.</span> <span id="s344">All that was necessary, that somebody said that your wife had made a statement against the Russians.</span> <span id="s345">And they came with a list, and they were looking for Mrs. Wildauer.</span> <span id="s346">They didn’t care about me.</span> <span id="s347">They wanted her!</span> <span id="s348">And if I would say, “Well, I don’t want to leave my wife alone, I want to go with her,” that was fine, as long as they got that person that they were deporting.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Did this happen in your family, or are you just making an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No.</span> <span id="s351">Just an example.</span> <span id="s352">It happened to a lot of friends of ours.</span> <span id="s353">In my wife’s case, where she worked, her boss -- husband and wife -- they were home, and two brothers were home, but their third brother wasn’t there, so he stayed behind.</span> <span id="s354">They picked up the two sons and the parents, and they shipped them to Russia, in cattle- cars, very inhumane.</span> <span id="s355">They put in a barrel there, for their needs, and they shipped them into Russia -- but they didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s356">A lot of them died because some were on medication, some couldn’t take it, and they ended up somewhere in Siberia.</span> <span id="s357">A lot of them came back after the war.</span> <span id="s358">A lot of them survived.</span> <span id="s359">Some of them were sentenced for a certain period or length of time.</span> <span id="s360">I don’t know how the darn thing worked.</span> <span id="s361">But that was the end of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Now that made the Latvians more bitter, yet.</span> <span id="s363">The rumors went around.</span> <span id="s364">If somebody said, “Well, wait a minute now.</span> <span id="s365">The Jews didn’t do it, because there were a lot of Jews deported, too,” the Latvians said, “ No, those Jews only went there as supervisors!</span> <span id="s366">They just like to make it look good!”</span> <span id="s367">The day when the Germans came into the city, the daily newspaper, was a black border around it in memoriam of the deported people.</span> <span id="s368">They counted them as dead, all the deported people.</span> <span id="s369">And whenever there was a Jewish name, it was eliminated!</span> <span id="s370">It was not there.</span> <span id="s371">There were only Latvian names.</span> <span id="s372">And everybody knew that he had a friend or a neighbor or this guy who also was deported, but they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s373">So they were still thinking about it.</span> <span id="s374">There was a silent anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s375">It’s a harmless way, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Now the things changed when the Germans came in on July 1, 1941.</span> <span id="s377">The very same night, the German army itself was pursuing the Russians, the first groups, the Russians were retreating.</span> <span id="s378">There was never really a big battle in Riga because it’s strategically in the pocket on the coast, and the roads, the strategic roads, lead on the bottom, so in order not to get caught, they had to retreat, the Russians, out of there, and the Germans came in, so they were in pursuit of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s379">But the Latvians had plenty of time!</span> <span id="s380">So immediately they formed those “freedom fighters” -- not like partisans.</span> <span id="s381">They put on that bright red-white band on their sleeves, and the very first night, on July 1st, they came up to our house.</span> <span id="s382">We were about a half a block away from the big building which was the Ministry of the GPU -- or KCB, what they call it now.</span> <span id="s383">The GPU was the Gestapo, the Russian Gestapo.</span> <span id="s384">It was the secret service.</span> <span id="s385">And that’s where the last group of Russian soldiers, before they retreated, camped in the yard.</span> <span id="s386">It was a huge building, with a yard in the center.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Well, they took all the Jews of our apartment out.</span> <span id="s388">Knocked on every door.</span> <span id="s389">For some reason or other, in Latvia, we could see a Jew, we could see a Latvian, without even having to look at them, by the way they walked, the way they dressed .</span> <span id="s390">That was not the case in Germany!</span> <span id="s391">It was certainly not the case in America.</span> <span id="s392">But in Latvia, the Jews somehow stood out.</span> <span id="s393">And we had to assemble downstairs.</span> <span id="s394">I think we must have been about 25 people, maybe.</span> <span id="s395">And we were taken that half a block down to the building of the headquarters of the Russian deal, and there were several Latvians out there.</span> <span id="s396">A group of them.</span> <span id="s397">And kind of a high-ranking German officer was standing around.</span> <span id="s398">They made us clean up the yard.</span> <span id="s399">It was a mess.</span> <span id="s400">The toilets were overflowing, it was just a mess!</span> <span id="s401">And after we got a little bit organized there, we got some brooms, were sweeping, and one of the Latvian officers said, “Let’s take them downstairs.”</span> <span id="s402">Well downstairs the Russians had built a little vault -- torture chambers.</span> <span id="s403">They are known for things like that.</span> <span id="s404">They built those little cells.</span> <span id="s405">We saw them when they were building them, and people started to talk about them.</span> <span id="s406">They covered the windows up so you don’t see what was going on.</span> <span id="s407">But from the ground you could see they were no larger than this.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: About three feet wide.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A; Yeah.</span> <span id="s410">Terrible.</span> <span id="s411">So if we would have gone downstairs, I would never have seen the daylight, because they probably would have killed us down there.</span> <span id="s412">They had Latvians down there -- tortured or something -- and it would have been terrible.</span> <span id="s413">Thanks to the German officer, he said, “Can’t take anybody down.”</span> <span id="s414">He said, “we have tomorrow morning the photographers coming.”</span> <span id="s415">Which saved our life.</span> <span id="s416">In my next period of four years, I had those happenings that kept me alive.</span> <span id="s417">Lucky strokes.</span> <span id="s418">So we swept the yard.</span> <span id="s419">And my older brother was there.</span> <span id="s420">There were three of us -- three brothers.</span> <span id="s421">And he swept himself out towards the gate, and when he got to the gate, he put the broom down and he walked away.</span> <span id="s422">I followed him, my younger brother followed me, that same way.</span> <span id="s423">We just went home.</span> <span id="s424">Now I had made, over the telephone with my boss, an arrangement.</span> <span id="s425">I had the keys to the factory -- he was living further out -- and we started to go back to the factory, because he was thrown out by the Russians.</span> <span id="s426">All of a sudden the Germans are in, and they think it’s my factory.</span> <span id="s427">So we decided that we will not answer the telephone unless both of us are there, because we thought, “Maybe somebody will stop us and we’ll say, ‘I have the keys to the place, I have to go to open it.”</span> <span id="s428">Sure enough, the next morning -- after the first night, July 2nd -- I go to the corner, there’s a couple Latvians standing there.</span> <span id="s429">They spot me right away, that I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s430">“Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s431">I said, “I have to go to work.”</span> <span id="s432">“We’ll show you some work!”</span> <span id="s433">So they dragged me back to the damn building.</span> <span id="s434">But there was an officer.</span> <span id="s435">And I said, “I have to go!”</span> <span id="s436">I said, “I have to open the factory.”</span> <span id="s437">I said, “I have twenty girls, they’re waiting to get in the factory.”</span> <span id="s438">I told him he should call, but I don’t know if he called, or he didn’t call, but he let me go.</span> <span id="s439">So I went back to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Was your boss a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s442">The first day we were back in the factory, in walks a German.</span> <span id="s443">He walked in with a briefcase, and I was alone in the factory with the workers, and he wanted to talk to me.</span> <span id="s444">And he said, “You know, we want you to go on production 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s445">We need the merchandise.”</span> <span id="s446">We were making stockings, some underwear, and things like that.</span> <span id="s447">So we got under production.</span> <span id="s448">And I said, “We need materials, we haven’t got enough yarn to do that.”</span> <span id="s449">“We’re going to give you all the yarn you need!”</span> <span id="s450">Braggers, you know.</span> <span id="s451">“You’ll have all the material and all the supplies, and everything what you need.”</span> <span id="s452">And he went on like this, rambling for a long time.</span> <span id="s453">Pretty soon my boss walks in, and I introduce him, “Mr. Friedlander, Mr. --?</span> <span id="s454">Whatever this guy’s name was.</span> <span id="s455">My boss was not a good Jew at all.</span> <span id="s456">He ate matzos all year.</span> <span id="s457">Pesach he was tired of it.</span> <span id="s458">(Laughter) Wouldn’t eat any more matzos.</span> <span id="s459">He was not religious at all.</span> <span id="s460">And on that day I forgave him for everything because he said to the guy, “Gee, I’m sorry,” he said, “that you’ve just let me know today, because we had to let a lot of people go.”</span> <span id="s461">And we had.</span> <span id="s462">We had to let that morning all the Jews go.</span> <span id="s463">They just had to be kicked out of the factory.</span> <span id="s464">And the guy says, “Oh, just hire them back!”</span> <span id="s465">And he said, “Well, I don’t know if we can.”</span> <span id="s466">“Why can’t you?</span> <span id="s467">Were they Communists?”</span> <span id="s468">“No, they were not Communists.”</span> <span id="s469">“Were they Jews?”</span> <span id="s470">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s471">“We don’t want nothing to do with them!”</span> <span id="s472">the guy says.</span> <span id="s473">So my boss said to him, “Well, if that’s the case, then you probably don’t want nothing to do with me either.”</span> <span id="s474">“Are you a Jew?”</span> <span id="s475">And my boss said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s476">And he said, “ And you, too?’</span> <span id="s477">and points at me.</span> <span id="s478">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s479">He said, “Then get out of here!</span> <span id="s480">We want nothing to do with you!”</span> <span id="s481">And takes his briefcase together and storms out of the office!</span></p> <p><span id="s482">I went downstairs about a half an hour later, in the shop there -- I had some parts made -- and I hear, all of a sudden, some steps, military steps.</span> <span id="s483">I look out the door.</span> <span id="s484">I see here this German, civilian -- he had a uniform on, but it was like semi-military --and a couple Latvians, with their armband.</span> <span id="s485">Went upstairs with rifles.</span> <span id="s486">And I learned later what transpired.</span> <span id="s487">The few Jews that were still left, the foreman or something, they were lined up there, and they fired them all, and then they arrested my boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: You mean they shot their guns at them, they killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s490">They just “fired” them.</span> <span id="s491">They arrested my boss and took him down to the headquarters of the police station.</span> <span id="s492">He’s dead now, but he played his luck that day, because when he walked in, if he would have stayed, some terrible things happened in that police headquarters.</span> <span id="s493">They were really playing with the Jews out there.</span> <span id="s494">They made them perform sex acts.</span> <span id="s495">I had witness reports.</span> <span id="s496">I read them from a fellow whose name I took.</span> <span id="s497">People jumped out of windows, they were thrown out of the windows, people were shot in the yard.</span> <span id="s498">Some terrible things happened to the Jews out there.</span> <span id="s499">But my boss says he walked in there, and somebody just came in and he needed some workers.</span> <span id="s500">He said, “I need ten men.’</span> <span id="s501">So they shoved him over, so he got out of there.</span> <span id="s502">That’s how he played his luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">I, myself, stayed on in the factory, because immediately a Latvian was named manager of it.</span> <span id="s504">A German officer walked in and he wanted to buy some stockings, from him for his girlfriend, wife.</span> <span id="s505">And this engineer who was supposed to take over the factory was a fairly young man, and he said, “You know, I have a man here, a Jew working.</span> <span id="s506">I would like to get a pass for him.”</span> <span id="s507">And the guy sends him out a pass: “The Jew, Fred Wildauer, is under the protection of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s508">He is not to be arrested without my knowledge.”</span> <span id="s509">And I went to work with that piece of paper.</span> <span id="s510">Had to show it many times.</span> <span id="s511">It lasted maybe two weeks or three.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">We were walking every day the gauntlet.</span> <span id="s513">When you walked home, we could not walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s514">We had to walk on the curb.</span> <span id="s515">Two days after the Germans came, it was on a Sunday, we had to register at the yard.</span> <span id="s516">People would have been daring, maybe they wouldn’t have registered, but we did.</span> <span id="s517">We got a “Jew” stamped into our passport – a “J”.</span> <span id="s518">And we were handed out a star.</span> <span id="s519">We had to put on the star.</span> <span id="s520">First on the chest, a couple of days later the ordinance came that we had to put it on the chest and the back of our clothes.</span> <span id="s521">And that’s how we had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">There were people -- very few of them -- that had compassion.</span> <span id="s523">People would spit on you as you walked by.</span> <span id="s524">They were standing, waiting for the streetcar, and you had to walk on the curb in front of them.</span> <span id="s525">You couldn’t ride the streetcar.</span> <span id="s526">We were only allowed to shop in a Jewish area, which later became the ghetto.</span> <span id="s527">So we had to walk across the city to buy our groceries.</span> <span id="s528">My wife is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s529">She stood in line for us.</span> <span id="s530">She was my girlfriend at the time.</span> <span id="s531">She survived us; all through my years in the concentration camp, she kept me supplied with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">So that was their entry into the city.</span> <span id="s533">That did not last very long.</span> <span id="s534">Then they started to establish a concentration camp, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s535">They took a part of the city and fenced it in with double fence and they called the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s536">They had to allot a certain space to people.</span> <span id="s537">If it was a room like this, you’d probably have two families in there.</span> <span id="s538">I think it was two square meters per person.</span> <span id="s539">So sometimes they had two or three families living in one room, and they just put a curtain across or something.</span> <span id="s540">Tried to make it last.</span> <span id="s541">We walked in there and I bluffed my way into a little milk store -- tiny little place.</span> <span id="s542">It was a milk store, and my sister and myself -- my sister who’s had two children -- and my younger brother moved in there together.</span> <span id="s543">My parents found an apartment.</span> <span id="s544">They had five rooms’ furniture which they had to move, and my brother had three rooms and my sister had two rooms.</span> <span id="s545">They all moved into one room and a kitchen!</span> <span id="s546">The room was big, about as large as this, but it was a small kitchen, and obviously you couldn’t get the furniture in.</span> <span id="s547">So the furniture that you couldn’t use remained in the yard.</span> <span id="s548">We were not the only ones, there were hundreds of apartments that had the same thing.</span> <span id="s549">It was just piled up in the yard, and every morning they would go down and break up a piece of furniture and use it to kindle wood.</span> <span id="s550">We had a buffet that probably was forty years in the family already by that time, but it was all broken up little by bit.</span> <span id="s551">How long we would have lasted, I don’t know, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s552">They closed the ghetto in the fall of 1941.</span> <span id="s553">Then we were locked in.</span> <span id="s554">We could only go out under guard.</span> <span id="s555">Now we were picked up every day to work.</span> <span id="s556">My younger brother was caught on the street by some SS men -- several Jews out there -- and they put them on a truck and they brought them over to a place at the Latvian university and they hade to unload a car.</span> <span id="s557">And they were talking nicely to them.</span> <span id="s558">They were not hitting them, like in some places they were really very rough, but they said, “Now, you come back tomorrow to work.’</span> <span id="s559">So we could still go out at that time from the camp.</span> <span id="s560">You had to go work someplace, so my brother went there to work.</span> <span id="s561">And when they closed the ghetto, one man, a flunky of those SS men, would come down in the morning and pick the guys up to work.</span> <span id="s562">Most of the people were afraid of the SS.</span> <span id="s563">They would rather work for the Wehrmacht, because they thought they were nicer people.</span> <span id="s564">They probably were.</span> <span id="s565">But this particular unit was, in a way, harmless, as I will go on, you will realize.</span> <span id="s566">And the guy would go out and bring them back, and pretty soon he had a tough time getting those guys together.</span> <span id="s567">He had five or six fellows working.</span> <span id="s568">The guys didn’t show, didn’t come to the gate.</span> <span id="s569">You had to go out to the gate.</span> <span id="s570">So my brother said to me and to my older brother, “Why don’t you come along,” because they weren’t touching us, they seemed to be pretty nice to us.</span> <span id="s571">So we had to work someplace, rather than being caught.</span> <span id="s572">In the morning they were looking for workers, but you never know where you end up.</span> <span id="s573">We decided to go along.</span> <span id="s574">And that became a full-time job.</span> <span id="s575">Every morning they would pick us up, every night they would bring us back.</span> <span id="s576">That lasted from the time the ghetto closed till late fall.</span> <span id="s577">.</span> <span id="s578">And then they got tired of hauling us back and forth and they got a permit from the Gestapo to keep us at the place of work.</span> <span id="s579">They call it in German a Kazenmeirum.</span> <span id="s580">Which means like a “Kazan” that means “army billet.’</span> <span id="s581">So we got billeted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">In the university they gave us a room, which was formerly a theater.</span> <span id="s583">It was a nice room.</span> <span id="s584">And they said, “You build yourselves some bunks.”</span> <span id="s585">Which we did.</span> <span id="s586">We started out, made little bunks.</span> <span id="s587">Two tiered bunks.</span> <span id="s588">There were three of us, my two brothers, myself.</span> <span id="s589">There was a father and son, and there was a bachelor in there.</span> <span id="s590">Six of us.</span> <span id="s591">So we became handymen there.</span> <span id="s592">Everybody got a job, My brothers and myself, we took care of the mechanical things.</span> <span id="s593">Fixed cars, bicycles, motorcycles, repaired the electricity, we did everything.</span> <span id="s594">And later we used to go out in the country for firewood -- in the back of the truck.</span> <span id="s595">Pretty soon we became established and they were starting to talk very nice to us.</span> <span id="s596">They had a theory.</span> <span id="s597">They said, “My Jews are good Jews.</span> <span id="s598">It’s the other Jews which are –“ and they went to the extreme to give us bread sometimes, or I needed a pair of shoes, my shoes were worn out, they took is over to a clothing chamber out there, and he kept busy the SS man out there, and told me I should go upstairs and pick out a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s599">I threw my old ones out and put on new ones -- army boots -- and I came down.</span> <span id="s600">That’s how they were doing things.</span> <span id="s601">“My Jews are good Jews.”</span> <span id="s602">Before this billeting started, we did go back and forth every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">On Saturday, November 29, 1941, we came home and there were placards all over the camp.</span> <span id="s604">Pasted.</span> <span id="s605">“The ghetto is going to be moved.</span> <span id="s606">Everybody’s allowed to take 20 pounds along.”</span> <span id="s607">Now the people that worked that day in town, like we did and a lot of others did, were not allowed back to our families.</span> <span id="s608">But we were guided into a camp.</span> <span id="s609">You have to picture this square camp, and one-fourth of it, they divided up -- before the square there was a gate - divided it up and made a small camp in it.</span> <span id="s610">Moved all the people out during the day, told them, “Go wherever you want to.”</span> <span id="s611">They moved them into the other part, and we had to move in there.</span> <span id="s612">We ended up nine men in one little room that belonged before to a horse and buggy driver.</span> <span id="s613">We had a tiny little room, a kitchen -- nine men.</span> <span id="s614">We lifted out the barn door.</span> <span id="s615">Laid it down on two blocks and we, all nine, slept on top of it.</span> <span id="s616">In the middle of the night, about three o’clock in the morning -- going on the 30th of November -- snow -- it must have been a couple feet on the ground and it was bitter cold, we didn’t have a toilet in the house -- it was an outside greenhouse -- went outside to use the toilet.</span> <span id="s617">You could do it right there on the wall.</span> <span id="s618">And I heard shots!</span> <span id="s619">Seemed awful far away!</span> <span id="s620">And I went back to the house.</span> <span id="s621">I told the guys, “You know, there seems to be in town shooting going on.</span> <span id="s622">Maybe it’s an uprising or something.’</span> <span id="s623">What I didn’t realize was that that noise was pistol shots, and they were muffled by the snow, and it happened right in the back of the little house on the main street out of the camp.</span> <span id="s624">During that same evening when we moved, the 29th, into this separate partition in the camp, they were taking the Jews out of the ghetto, out in groups, surrounded by Latvian guards.</span> <span id="s625">They were drunk, I heard later, because they gave them a lot of booze, and they were taking them out, into the woods -- the Bikernieku woods.</span> <span id="s626">Russian prisoners have dug out trenches there some time before.</span> <span id="s627">And out there these people had to take off, in German orderly fashion, their shoes, their coats, their glasses, their canes, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s628">In their underwear they went into the grave -- alive!</span> <span id="s629">And they were shot there.</span> <span id="s630">I lost that day everybody in my family!</span> <span id="s631">My two sisters, their children.</span> <span id="s632">Not both sisters in one day, because they did it so ingeniously, the Germans.</span> <span id="s633">By telling people that they’re going to move them to another camp, everybody put their most valuable things they had on themselves.</span> <span id="s634">If somebody had some diamonds or money or gold or something hidden, and it was buried in the ground, they dug it all out to take along.</span> <span id="s635">They sewed it into their coats or something.</span> <span id="s636">And all their things got lost.</span> <span id="s637">The Germans knew that, so all that stuff they sent back later to the clothing chamber, and the Jews or Germans were sitting out there, ripping the whole thing apart, looking for valuables.</span> <span id="s638">We still went to work the next morning.</span> <span id="s639">We were picked up and we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s640">It was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s641">My wife came to see me there at the university -- like a student, she would walk through the halls -- and I met her in a corner, in a little room, and that was the first time I broke down, because I knew that something has happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: When did you find out exactly what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: For sure?</span> <span id="s644">We did not!</span> <span id="s645">That was the point!</span> <span id="s646">The Germans were so slick about it.</span> <span id="s647">A day or so later appeared a letter in the ghetto -- in our part of it now --that supposedly came from another camp: “We are all well.</span> <span id="s648">The quarters are better here than what we had, and I’m here together….</span> <span id="s649">.”</span> <span id="s650">and they list about twenty or thirty names who are on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">And everybody was trying to find a name, somebody they knew.</span> <span id="s652">You have to realize that these were 20,000 people taken out, so 20 names is nothing!</span> <span id="s653">But everybody found somebody, a Jacobson or a Greenberg or something, and they would say, “That could be my uncle, it could be my friend.”</span> <span id="s654">This was only to prevent the rest of them to run, because they couldn’t get everybody out that night, and they didn’t want to do it during the day.</span> <span id="s655">So they waited for the following weekend and everybody got a feeling that it was maybe not so bad, because maybe they are in a different camp.</span> <span id="s656">Otherwise people may have found some way to get out and hide.</span> <span id="s657">But people, in their heart, knew that things are not so good, because there you found the difference in nature in people.</span> <span id="s658">There were guys that bribed the guards surrounding the inner camp where we were.</span> <span id="s659">They said, “I want to go with my family.</span> <span id="s660">Whatever happens to my family, will happen to me.”</span> <span id="s661">Or the other way around, there were people that left their family and tried to get into that compound, because they had a feeling that this was the safer compound -- that bribed their way in there, and said, “I couldn’t help my family.”</span> <span id="s662">This is what the nature of the different people were.</span> <span id="s663">My boss, the one I was mentioning to you about, he was afraid that his daughter and her children are going to be taken, so he wanted to go into the fence and see what will happen.</span> <span id="s664">He put on a coat and a knapsack and his most important things in case if they grabbed it, he would be there.</span> <span id="s665">Sure enough, they saw a guy standing with all the outfit, they took him right in there.</span> <span id="s666">So he went with the first column, too.</span> <span id="s667">My sister and her two children were taken the second week.</span> <span id="s668">In the two Sundays, we lost 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s669">The ghetto had 24,000 people when they closed it.</span> <span id="s670">There was another ghetto in a different city -- Levou -- and a lot of people ran away, but a lot of people also were killed in those two days -- massacred down.</span> <span id="s671">That came out in the Nuremberg trial!</span> <span id="s672">But by that time, we knew pretty much what happened.</span> <span id="s673">Now this was about the time that the Germans decided that they didn’t want to bother, and that’s when we got billeted in the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">The first day after they were taken out, in the morning, we had to go out and pick up bodies.</span> <span id="s675">There were some people that could not make it, older people.</span> <span id="s676">My grandmother must have been among them, because she was 98 years old.</span> <span id="s677">The people, they shot in columns.</span> <span id="s678">And the people that fell back, that couldn’t cope, they shot there right on the spot.</span> <span id="s679">There were scenes!</span> <span id="s680">There was a Latvian hero.</span> <span id="s681">His name was Surkos.</span> <span id="s682">The Israelis got their revenge on him.</span> <span id="s683">I think they killed him in Montevideo later.</span> <span id="s684">Herbert Surkos.</span> <span id="s685">He was out there in Argentina with Peron and Peron protected him for all these years.</span> <span id="s686">They tried to get him out.</span> <span id="s687">Simon Wiesenthal tried to get him out.</span> <span id="s688">So many witnesses on him.</span> <span id="s689">He was taking babies out.</span> <span id="s690">He threw them out of the windows, picked them up, shot them.</span> <span id="s691">Just horrible, that man!</span> <span id="s692">He was the same a hero in Latvia like Lindberg was in America.</span> <span id="s693">He flew a self-made plane to Africa someplace -- an officer.</span> <span id="s694">So that was the time when we finally left the ghetto ourselves.</span> <span id="s695">And we were stationed, just six men, into that place</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So about how many weeks prior to those first shootings were you moved into the university compound?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: I went back and forth every day.</span> <span id="s698">I was moved only after the shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Where is the compound?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s701">They took the ghetto and cut one-fourth of it off and they made a separate compound.</span> <span id="s702">They were all younger people in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: And you were mostly the people who were going out each day to some kind of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: That is correct.</span> <span id="s705">They took all the people that came back to work -- most of them were younger people -- they moved them in there.</span> <span id="s706">Now that, in the beginning, did not last very long, because about a week later, they decided that this was still too many people.</span> <span id="s707">They still wanted to reduce the count.</span> <span id="s708">So one morning, they came in with buses.</span> <span id="s709">I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s710">I was at work.</span> <span id="s711">They went through the houses and the basements and the attics looking for people that didn’t go out to work.</span> <span id="s712">They knew they had 4,000 people and maybe 2,500 went out to work.</span> <span id="s713">Where are the rest of them?</span> <span id="s714">So they rounded them up and put them on buses.</span> <span id="s715">How methodical they are.</span> <span id="s716">There was a man, he was a watchmaker, he had a wooden leg.</span> <span id="s717">They caught him, too, and they were chasing him to the bus.</span> <span id="s718">He got within fifteen feet there -- I heard later from eyewitnesses at the bus -- and then the German officer was standing with his watch in his hand.</span> <span id="s719">He said, “Shneller.”</span> <span id="s720">“Faster!”</span> <span id="s721">And the guy couldn’t go faster with his leg.</span> <span id="s722">He just didn’t get closer than maybe this to this hallway here.</span> <span id="s723">And he said, “Time is up.”</span> <span id="s724">They closed the bus and took off.</span> <span id="s725">Left him standing -- alive.</span> <span id="s726">The man survived the ghetto, I remember, because he started to work for the Wehrmacht and they went out with a large group every morning, several hundred people.</span> <span id="s727">He was always in front, because he set the pace of the unit.</span> <span id="s728">They liked him.</span> <span id="s729">He was a nice guy, and maybe valuable, too, because he was a watchmaker.</span> <span id="s730">He set the pace for the whole column to go to work.</span> <span id="s731">From then on, we were stationed at the university and we were there till fall of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: So after these two weekends, did you have definite knowledge of what had happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: We knew that they were dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: You did for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Not for sure, but we suspected that they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: So you didn’t believe the letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: We started to believe -- we saw what was going on, and we started to believe that they were probably not, any more, alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Were you aware at that time of other events in the outside world -- other ghettos or the establishment of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No.</span> <span id="s740">We suspected that there were ghettos in Poland, and a lot of Jews have been killed.</span> <span id="s741">We saw what happened in Latvia, and we had to assume that there are some.</span> <span id="s742">We never knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s743">But we learned about it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">We were in the university out there.</span> <span id="s745">This was not a prison.</span> <span id="s746">The Germans were supposed to lock us in -- they had an agreement with the Gestapo that we are under guard -- but they didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s747">So they told us at night, “You lock yourself in, and if somebody knocks at the door, just tell them you’re locked in.”</span> <span id="s748">So there was no problem for us to walk away.</span> <span id="s749">We could have walked every single day or any time of the day away, and nobody would have known it for a while, but where would you go?</span> <span id="s750">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s751">You didn’t know how long the war would last.</span> <span id="s752">Maybe Germany will win!</span> <span id="s753">Where are you going to be?</span> <span id="s754">Who will hide you?</span> <span id="s755">There were people in hiding.</span> <span id="s756">A friend of mine who worked with me in the same factory was stationed just like I was in the unit of the Wehrmacht out there.</span> <span id="s757">They walked one day away, and they both of them survived the war.</span> <span id="s758">I don’t know where they lived, but somebody hid them out.</span> <span id="s759">They must have been a couple of years in hiding!</span> <span id="s760">As far as I’m concerned, our life was not threatened in that job.</span> <span id="s761">We became, more or less, valuable to them, because we did all those works.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">There developed a situation out there with a man which you may have heard the name.</span> <span id="s763">Roschman?</span> <span id="s764">Roschman was a man who must have killed hundreds, even thousands of Jews.</span> <span id="s765">He was absolutely one of the worst.</span> <span id="s766">Did you read the book The Odessa File?</span> <span id="s767">You should read it, because it’s my story.</span> <span id="s768">The fictional character which appears there with the name of Tauber could be me, because he went through all the camps as I did -- because somebody who was in the camp gave him all the information.</span> <span id="s769">Roschman is the guy who they’re trying to trace down, because he was a many-fold murderer.</span> <span id="s770">And we had an episode with him in the same university!</span> <span id="s771">They had a party out there and one of our guys made a mistake out there and he spotted him.</span> <span id="s772">He said, “You’re a Jew!</span> <span id="s773">What the hell are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s774">He hit him, and he said, “I’ll be back tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s775">And he came back tomorrow and he found us in the quarters, not locked in.</span> <span id="s776">Sunday morning, without the stars; we were supposed to wear them outside, but not in the room.</span> <span id="s777">He didn’t care.</span> <span id="s778">He hit me.</span> <span id="s779">He hit the other guys.</span> <span id="s780">He had a list.</span> <span id="s781">“Where is Harry?’</span> <span id="s782">“Harry is my brother.</span> <span id="s783">He went out in the garage.”</span> <span id="s784">Found Harry out there.</span> <span id="s785">He was working on a car, and they beat him up with a wrench.</span> <span id="s786">And he came back, and he said, ‘You’re all going to be replaced!”</span> <span id="s787">You know what that meant?</span> <span id="s788">That you go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s789">They will send them six other people.</span> <span id="s790">That we would be the next ones out in a transport.</span> <span id="s791">It was, at that time known that Auschwitz existed -- that that was not a good place to be -- there are smokestacks.</span> <span id="s792">In other words, “the first thing when you come back, you go into the ghetto, into jail.</span> <span id="s793">And then from then on, the next transport you are gone!”</span> <span id="s794">So our SS people actually went to bat for us.</span> <span id="s795">They called up our boss -- their SS boss -- who was a Lt. Commander.</span> <span id="s796">He was an Obersturmbannfuehrer.</span> <span id="s797">He was the highest- ranking medical officer in that occupied area out there.</span> <span id="s798">Beside the point, I found out later in a Latvian book, they wanted to find him, too, to kill him because he supposedly had made some experiments.</span> <span id="s799">When I read that, everything fell into place, because the guys in the ghetto used to tell me, “Why is Bloedow (Dr. Bloedow was his name) always coming into the ghetto and going to the jail and picking up some people?</span> <span id="s800">And he’s looking always for people who don’t have any hair on their chest.”</span> <span id="s801">I knew that he was with an air force officer working on some sort of serum against typhoid or something.</span> <span id="s802">I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s803">He probably killed all those -- used them for experiments.</span> <span id="s804">But he was nice to us.</span> <span id="s805">That’s the funny part of it.</span> <span id="s806">We used to go out in the woods, cold days, and he asked if we would be warm enough dressed.</span> <span id="s807">If it was a cold day he said, “Take an army coat.”</span> <span id="s808">We would put on army insignia, and we were sitting on the truck.</span> <span id="s809">I’m coming back to the same thing: “My Jews are good Jews.”</span> <span id="s810">He was a Jekyll and Hyde.</span> <span id="s811">The German soldiers feared him more than we did, because we’d make ourselves somehow useful out there, so they kept us.</span> <span id="s812">He went to bat for us.</span> <span id="s813">How far he would have gone, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s814">But he told that Roschman,”I’d like to keep them.”</span> <span id="s815">He had so much influence, the guy backed out.</span> <span id="s816">So we stayed on, and that saved our lives.</span> <span id="s817">That was a lucky moment.</span> <span id="s818">But then the unit was whittled down.</span> <span id="s819">Three of them were sent back.</span> <span id="s820">By that time they established a concentration camp outside Riga.</span> <span id="s821">Now, again, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s822">This particular unit at the university, it was a medical unit, and they got a delousing oven.</span> <span id="s823">Some were built in Germany.</span> <span id="s824">They wanted to rest it for the soldiers at the front.</span> <span id="s825">So they took me and the unit and a Latvian officer into this concentration camp ,which was called Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s826">It was a nice area out there.</span> <span id="s827">My boss, at one time, had a nice home.</span> <span id="s828">And they had built a typical concentration camp with wooden shacks, with the boards like you’ve seen them in all the pictures -- barracks -- and when I was in there, there were youngsters in there!</span> <span id="s829">Fourteen, 15, 16 year olds who were not Jews!</span> <span id="s830">They were from all parts of the world.</span> <span id="s831">They spoke all languages.</span> <span id="s832">I wasn’t allowed to talk to them, but they were so hungry, the poor guys.</span> <span id="s833">I had a piece of bread and I saw how hungry they were, so I laid it down and I walked away, and about twenty of them just tore into that place to grab that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s834">Now my fortune came in here.</span> <span id="s835">This unit needed water, so they put it next to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s836">The supervisors in the camp were German criminals -- not necessarily criminals, because there were a whole group of German Communists who, in ’33, when Hitler came to power, he just threw them in a camp for the duration -- but there were also a double murderer, also a couple other killers in there.</span> <span id="s837">And they were leaders of the group.</span> <span id="s838">Now I was working, operating the machine, and they took one of those Communists who was in there, who by trade was a stoker in a ship, and he had to heat the unit.</span> <span id="s839">And the cook was right next door, and I was not allowed to talk to them, but I did.</span> <span id="s840">When I left that night, they asked me I could get them some tobacco.</span> <span id="s841">They smoked, I didn’t smoke, but my brother did, and the old guy that we had in the unit out there, when we went to the farmers, he always brought those tobacco leaves and he dried them in the barn out there.</span> <span id="s842">He had lots of them.</span> <span id="s843">So the next day I was supposed to come back and I brought a whole bunch of those leaves to those guys and they were very happy.</span> <span id="s844">I thought I’ll never see them again.</span> <span id="s845">But lo and behold, about a couple months later, they liquidated all those people that were billeted away, closed up all those units, and we were all sent into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s846">They were going to concentrate us to get rid of us -- for good!</span> <span id="s847">So we realized that that was the first step into the concentration camp of Kaiserwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: What month and year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: It must have been in the early fall or late summer of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: And was there any warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: It was, in a way, because, as I said, three of our guys were taken out earlier.</span> <span id="s852">My older brother was among them, and he was sent to that particular concentration camp, from which I didn’t know where they went!</span> <span id="s853">They made this camp.</span> <span id="s854">They had moved all the youngsters away.</span> <span id="s855">They left those German criminals and the Communists in there as our bosses now.</span> <span id="s856">And they made a Jewish camp out of it.</span> <span id="s857">So my brother was in there first, but by that time we knew that they were in the camp.</span> <span id="s858">They went to work, all under heavy guard.</span> <span id="s859">We were moving around pretty freely.</span> <span id="s860">In my place at the university, I used to listen to the BBC at night!</span> <span id="s861">I could go down in the university building and I’d listen on the radio at night because we could move around in the building.</span> <span id="s862">And all of a sudden now, they’re behind the fence with guards, with towers, the whole works.</span> <span id="s863">And we knew it isn’t good, because once in a while we went out someplace to work and we were working next to a unit that came from that camp.</span> <span id="s864">We were not allowed to talk to them.</span> <span id="s865">So they really kept them under guard.</span> <span id="s866">Then came the day that they were going to liquidate, and it came sudden.</span> <span id="s867">They came over there and they said, “You’ve got to get ready, you have to go back in the camp.”</span> <span id="s868">They didn’t let us go because they were afraid now we may take off.</span> <span id="s869">So they had one guy sitting there with a pistol, actually watched till we put our thing together.</span> <span id="s870">Then we were brought back into the ghetto and the next morning our names were called and we had to get on a truck.</span> <span id="s871">Terrible depressing!</span> <span id="s872">When I walked into the gate, there was a guy standing there with a pail with white paint.</span> <span id="s873">There was a big wide brush and he just dumped it in.</span> <span id="s874">It was white wash, what you wash houses with.</span> <span id="s875">And he went across my jacket.</span> <span id="s876">It went right across the back and the front.</span> <span id="s877">They did that to degrade you and to keep you from running away.</span> <span id="s878">Of course that was paint that dried out fast.</span> <span id="s879">Then you had to go in there and find a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s880">Just the boards.</span> <span id="s881">No sack, nothing.</span> <span id="s882">Later you got straw sacks, but before that you just laid down to sleep.</span> <span id="s883">That was a terrible, terrible let-down out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You were simply taken on bused from the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span> <span id="s886">Truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: So you didn’t have to go through a long train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span> <span id="s889">That was right in town!</span> <span id="s890">We had a ghetto maybe at the most three miles.</span> <span id="s891">That same day when I walked in there, I run across that cook that I was attached to.</span> <span id="s892">He says, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s893">I says, “I’m here now.”</span> <span id="s894">He said, “If you need something, you come in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s895">Now to have the right to walk in the kitchen in a concentration camp is just like having a ticket to the White House here in the United States.</span> <span id="s896">The first thing he asked me, “Do you already have a unit you’re going to work with?”</span> <span id="s897">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s898">He said, “you’re going out with Umbrey.: Now Umbrey was the stoker, the other guy who got the tobacco from me.</span> <span id="s899">So in the morning we went out, several hundred people, and when we got to the place of work, they were gasoline storage tanks.</span> <span id="s900">The prisoners were putting a cement wall around each tank, in order if one of them blows up, all of them don’t go.</span> <span id="s901">It was a very tedious process, particularly you work with prisoners, because they were half of them old women.</span> <span id="s902">They had to shovel that cement into that machine that lifts ‘em up and makes the cement and they haul them up there.</span> <span id="s903">There were German craftsmen working with them, but the laborers were these poor Jews.</span> <span id="s904">The women were so cold.</span> <span id="s905">They had rags wrapped around their feet.</span> <span id="s906">People lose all their humanity.</span> <span id="s907">When they went out there, they could not make it, and they said, “Stop.”</span> <span id="s908">“Austraighten” -- “Take a rest.”</span> <span id="s909">They would run into the side of the road -- in Latvia the roads always have a little dent, like a little grave, a ditch on both sides -- and they would do their business there.</span> <span id="s910">Number one, number two, right in front of each other, men and women.</span> <span id="s911">Didn’t bother.</span> <span id="s912">Came over to Umbrey and me and he said, “You know anything about technical things?”</span> <span id="s913">I said, “Yes, I do.”</span> <span id="s914">He said, “Fine, tomorrow I got you a job.”</span> <span id="s915">He said, “ You’ll be away from the rest of them.”</span> <span id="s916">So in the morning when I got there, there was a German Blacksmith working -- a craftsman.</span> <span id="s917">He came from a storage yard which was about a tenth of a mile away.</span> <span id="s918">He came, picked me up, and I went to him.</span> <span id="s919">I didn’t have a card, and I was working a little shed.</span> <span id="s920">My wife used to come from work.</span> <span id="s921">She would take off her lunch, get on the streetcar, drive out to the end station, walk maybe a quarter of a mile there and through the fence she would throw in some food.</span> <span id="s922">Sometimes hand it to me, but most of the time she’d throw it in, and that German, that old blacksmith, he would pick it up and save it for me.</span> <span id="s923">And I went to work there as long as I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s924">I was alone there at the beginning.</span> <span id="s925">Later they brought in about seven, eight guys from the other unit.</span> <span id="s926">They started to manufacture something, and I was like a foreman out there.</span> <span id="s927">When I was working I was okay, but when I went to the camp, I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s928">And that’s how it was until fall of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: You went into the camp in the fall of ’43.</span> <span id="s930">Do you remember any more specifically the date when you arrived and who went into camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: My younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: And did you find your older brother in the camp when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No.</span> <span id="s934">By the time we got there, they had formed a group of several hundred people, and they sent them out to another area where they were in another camp that I understand was not a very good one.</span> <span id="s935">It was called Ballastdam.</span> <span id="s936">But my brother got a job like an electrician.</span> <span id="s937">We were not electricians but he knew something about it so he had a little shop, and he had it better there.</span> <span id="s938">But he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s939">I will continue the story and we will come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: In addition to having the paint put onto you, what other types of things were done to you, or how were you processed into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: We had to go through a delousing process.</span> <span id="s942">We had to take off practically all our clothes.</span> <span id="s943">We get into a shower and we got prison clothes.</span> <span id="s944">Striped clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And were you tattooed at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No.</span> <span id="s947">I never had a tattoo.</span> <span id="s948">I was never in one of those camps.</span> <span id="s949">We had to take out first our things that we had in the pocket.</span> <span id="s950">Pictures of families, just everything thrown into piles.</span> <span id="s951">And the only thing we could keep is a comb and shoes.</span> <span id="s952">What for I need a comb, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s953">And then we were put in the shower, and at that time we didn’t have a fear that there may be something wrong with the shower, but what we did have afterwards, we had lice which we didn’t have before -- after we went through the delousing!</span> <span id="s954">(Laughter) But that night happened something.</span> <span id="s955">A lot of people knew that while they were standing in line, on the other side was a woman’s camp.</span> <span id="s956">It was just partitioned off with two strands of wire.</span> <span id="s957">And there was a guard in between.</span> <span id="s958">The men were already processed.</span> <span id="s959">They went through it.</span> <span id="s960">The women went through the same thing, so in order not to lose their things, they started to throw over a sweater and a jacket to the men.</span> <span id="s961">Word got around about it, and in the middle of the night, they turn on the lights in the barracks.</span> <span id="s962">They said, “I give ten or fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s963">I’ll turn off the lights again.</span> <span id="s964">And then I’ll turn them on, and I want all that stuff that was thrown over the fence right here in the pile.”</span> <span id="s965">They turned off the light, and they turned it on, and there was a pile -- people got scared -- but not big enough for him.</span> <span id="s966">He said, “There must be more.”</span> <span id="s967">And then they did something what they called the Battle of Maisonite at that time.</span> <span id="s968">It’s part of history, because the people in town thought something terrible’s happening.</span> <span id="s969">It did.</span> <span id="s970">They gave us the order to line up outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: What was the name of the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: The Battle of Maisonite from the history under Isabella in Spain, 1492, when they massacred the Catholics.</span> <span id="s973">That’s famous in history.</span> <span id="s974">We gave it the name the battle of Maisonite.</span> <span id="s975">And we had to rush outside!</span> <span id="s976">People tried to get out of the windows because at the door, they were standing there, not only Germans were standing, Polish guards!</span> <span id="s977">Prisoners!</span> <span id="s978">The Poles with big sticks and they were hitting everybody that came out and hitting fiercely.</span> <span id="s979">Wherever it hit, the head or something, with planks, and you really had to run the gauntlet out there.</span> <span id="s980">We made it out.</span> <span id="s981">I got a knock on my shoulder but it wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s982">And they lined us up and said, “Everybody back!”</span> <span id="s983">so we had to run back.</span> <span id="s984">Gauntlet again.</span> <span id="s985">Then he came out.</span> <span id="s986">“I want more of the clothes out here!”</span> <span id="s987">So then this whole process, fifteen minutes later, repeated itself.</span> <span id="s988">About three or four times that night.</span> <span id="s989">People were walking around with bloody heads and broken bones and it was something fierce that night, what happened.</span> <span id="s990">And it was done so loud that people outside the camp could hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Can you provide a physical description of the camp?</span> <span id="s992">The size, the number of buildings, about how many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: I think we had three barracks.</span> <span id="s994">Each of them probably held between two and two hundred and fifty people.</span> <span id="s995">That’s what I estimated.</span> <span id="s996">The camp probably consisted of a couple thousand, including the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s997">They had another washroom which had a lot of sinks and other things where we used to shave or wash our things in the morning.</span> <span id="s998">Everything was cold water, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Could you describe a routine day from the very beginning through the day and into the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: You had to get up early in the morning, obviously.</span> <span id="s1001">There was a roll call.</span> <span id="s1002">It happened occasionally that a guy was missing.</span> <span id="s1003">It happened one morning, there was a fellow missing.</span> <span id="s1004">They let you stand there for hours until they chased him down to the camp, where they found him on the toilet, sleeping.</span> <span id="s1005">Fell asleep, a young boy, sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s1006">They dragged him out in front and they beat the hell out of him.</span> <span id="s1007">They beat him to a pulp right in front.</span> <span id="s1008">They kicked him and beat him and then they dragged him into one of those barracks and they laid him across a bench, and they hit him, fifteen or twenty times, with a heavy cable.</span> <span id="s1009">And every time they hit him I thought they were going to cut him in half!</span> <span id="s1010">And finally he wasn’t even -- just moaning.</span> <span id="s1011">But people are stronger than I am.</span> <span id="s1012">They dragged him out, and I thought, “The guy is gone.”</span> <span id="s1013">And about a half hour later he came in and said, “Has anybody seen my cap?”</span> <span id="s1014">it was absolutely unbelievable what people can take, I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">We had a commandant.</span> <span id="s1016">His name was Sauer.</span> <span id="s1017">He was a smart man.</span> <span id="s1018">He knew that he could not supply us with food.</span> <span id="s1019">there was just not enough to go around.</span> <span id="s1020">But he was making money on us because when we were working on that cement place there, and other units were doing other things, he was getting paid something like 50 cents or a dollar a day for each of us from the construction companies.</span> <span id="s1021">And he wanted to keep us going!</span> <span id="s1022">So when he was in the camp, he did not let us be searched when we came back from outside.</span> <span id="s1023">They used to sometimes search if you have bread, or bring something in, because we had all managed on the outside to get something.</span> <span id="s1024">But he didn’t let us be searched, because he knew damn well if we carried in a piece of bread, somebody well eat.</span> <span id="s1025">Or salami or sausage or whatever they’d eat.</span> <span id="s1026">But when he wasn’t there -- sometimes he left early -- and the guards were out there, they would search us.</span> <span id="s1027">And the chances some people took.</span> <span id="s1028">There were a group of five, six guys, I think they were jewelers, watchmakers, and they had gold.</span> <span id="s1029">Not a lot of it, but they had gold, they may have jewels or something.</span> <span id="s1030">They always carried it handy, that they can put it away.</span> <span id="s1031">They would stand up when they searched them, and they held that thing in their hand like this.</span> <span id="s1032">Up there.</span> <span id="s1033">They would search them all over but the things they were looking for -- they were really looking for food -- they had a list and if they had jewelry on it, they would have stripped them.</span> <span id="s1034">But they were looking, really for food, because people got really inventive.</span> <span id="s1035">They used to take a salami and put it right in front and close to the jacket, or a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1036">Or you take a loaf of bread in the back with the hands, put the jacket down over it.</span> <span id="s1037">When they search you, they usually go right there on the sides, always on the sides.</span> <span id="s1038">You took a chance.</span> <span id="s1039">If they caught you, they marked you.</span> <span id="s1040">They gave you white epaulettes.</span> <span id="s1041">They painted you white here on top and then they didn’t let you out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1042">Now they knew that you are a candidate of running away, because you see you’re the next one to go up to Auschwitz or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">They used to have something else that they called the himmelfahrts kommando.</span> <span id="s1044">A himmelfahrt means “going up in the sky.”</span> <span id="s1045">Who gave them the name, I don’t know yet, because they’re always picking up a group of 30 people and most of the time when we were standing on roll call they would tell the oldest in the camp, the leader -- who was a German prisoner, a double murderer, handsome like a movie actor -- would tell him,”I need 30 men.”</span> <span id="s1046">So they all knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1047">That was for that himmelfahrts kommando.</span> <span id="s1048">And he would take out the people that he either didn’t like or people who had committed a little crime like taking something out, or people that were marked which he had to pick, or people that he thought wouldn’t make it anyway -- older people.</span> <span id="s1049">He put them together, and none of them ever returned.</span> <span id="s1050">So we don’t know for sure, but word was that these people are destroying evidence of some massacres or something, and then at the end, being killed themselves.</span> <span id="s1051">This is at least what people are saying because it all the time happened.</span> <span id="s1052">But many times, the commandant was standing nearby, or the SS there, and he took too long.</span> <span id="s1053">And then the commandant would say.</span> <span id="s1054">“Stop.”</span> <span id="s1055">And he’d walk up to somebody -- we’re standing three deep -- and he just counts down ten, and there is his 30 men!</span> <span id="s1056">I’ll tell you, you sweated it out.</span> <span id="s1057">They cut it off with the next guy, one time, from me.</span> <span id="s1058">They came that close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Just from morning roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: In the roll call in the night or in the morning.</span> <span id="s1061">After that we lined up.</span> <span id="s1062">We had breakfast -- a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1063">I don’t remember if we got soup or not.</span> <span id="s1064">And then we went with the units.</span> <span id="s1065">We assembled where the units were.</span> <span id="s1066">We were marched out through the gates with the units, several guards around.</span> <span id="s1067">Things were several miles away, where we worked, about 45 minutes walk.</span> <span id="s1068">This became such a routine that it’s just like going to work every day.</span> <span id="s1069">At night we were sitting in the barracks, and got our little bit of food, tried to stay alive.</span> <span id="s1070">We had occasions towards a little bit later when things started to get pretty much normalized.</span> <span id="s1071">They started to get ships which had to be unloaded.</span> <span id="s1072">Most of the times they were grenades, ammunition, but sometimes it was a supply ship with food.</span> <span id="s1073">When a supply ship came in, the leaders of the group always selected some guys who could work and steal at the same time.</span> <span id="s1074">They had to steal, not only for themselves, but they had to steal some of the food for the people in the camp -- to bribe the guard, whatever it was -- cigarettes or candy or chocolate or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1075">And they would.</span> <span id="s1076">They would do some ingenious things.</span> <span id="s1077">Unbelievable, the chances they took.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">At the time our food improved.</span> <span id="s1079">Earlier, before we went to the harbor, the people would steal from each other a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1080">Now all of a sudden we would get a double ration bread.</span> <span id="s1081">Instead of a quarter of a German rye bread we’d get double portion of bread.</span> <span id="s1082">That made such a difference, that there was all of a sudden bread laying around.</span> <span id="s1083">Nobody was stealing from each other anymore.</span> <span id="s1084">(Laughs) Plus that the people got something in the harbor, too.</span> <span id="s1085">But by that time the Russian army started to advance back towards Latvia and the Germans got a little bit itchy about it and they took about half the camp and shipped them into Germany -- near Danzig -- Gdansk -- into a camp called Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1086">It was a big camp!</span> <span id="s1087">45,000 people in there.</span> <span id="s1088">There was a German submarine commander, the whole Lithuanian government in there, a Danish police force -- anybody that had done something!</span> <span id="s1089">The whole camp was subdivided into little camps and everybody had a different food, different supplies and different treatment.</span> <span id="s1090">There were a couple barracks that were the Jews.</span> <span id="s1091">They had it bad!</span> <span id="s1092">The majority of the people in the camps were Poles.</span> <span id="s1093">This is what Germany wanted to make out of them, cheap labor, give them a bedstead and a place and you got labor for fifty cents a day.</span> <span id="s1094">But the barracks of the Jews, we had a barrack that was designed for 300 people, and they were excellent design for 300 people, for everything was room, with washing facilities.</span> <span id="s1095">The only problem was they took in 1,500.</span> <span id="s1096">(Chuckle) So we didn’t have place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1097">They would chase us in, too with sticks.</span> <span id="s1098">Those were not the Germans, these were the Poles in the camp -- the leaders, the kapos.</span> <span id="s1099">At night we would have to run and they would hit you with sticks so you get in, four men in a bunk.</span> <span id="s1100">You know a bunk of three stories?</span> <span id="s1101">Four in each.</span> <span id="s1102">There was no way that four people could lay, so you had to triple and the fourth one had to lay on the other three until the lights went out.</span> <span id="s1103">Then they crawled under and slept under the bed, on the floor, in between, wherever there was room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">And then they had a front room.</span> <span id="s1105">They laid us down like sardines!</span> <span id="s1106">At least there we had some air.</span> <span id="s1107">We always tried to stay behind to end up in the front room, and still they didn’t have enough room.</span> <span id="s1108">Then they would come with a stick -- a piece of lumber or something -- and they hit a spot, wherever they want to, and everybody would pull in, and they would put another guy in there!</span> <span id="s1109">Everybody had to lay one direction.</span> <span id="s1110">We used to face just like sardines.</span> <span id="s1111">With next guy’s knees under your knees.</span> <span id="s1112">And that’s how we had to sleep.</span> <span id="s1113">You took off your shoes, rolled it in your jacket, used it as a pillow to protect the shoes that nobody steals them.</span> <span id="s1114">But lucky, it lasted for me only six weeks there.</span> <span id="s1115">We didn’t get out on the first transport when they took half the people out.</span> <span id="s1116">We continued working.</span> <span id="s1117">The food provision got pretty good.</span> <span id="s1118">We all of a sudden had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1119">We started to look pretty good.</span> <span id="s1120">Then in August of ’44, they finally decided they’re going to take us out too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Now that was a time I was going to run away with my brother.</span> <span id="s1122">By the way, my older brother was killed before.</span> <span id="s1123">They came back, that whole unit, where I told you he was an electrician.</span> <span id="s1124">They put him that night into an extra barrack in the camp.</span> <span id="s1125">They didn’t let us together, and they had guards around it all night.</span> <span id="s1126">We didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1127">In the morning they all came out and joined up with us.</span> <span id="s1128">We were together in a roll call, went out together to work.</span> <span id="s1129">At night the SS unit follows them back into the barrack, but by this time, we didn’t get scared.</span> <span id="s1130">If I would have known what happened, I could have saved my brother’s life.</span> <span id="s1131">They decided to get rid of the entire unit.</span> <span id="s1132">There were too many of them.</span> <span id="s1133">They didn’t have enough room.</span> <span id="s1134">I had friends in the camp, and they would have done the same what they did with others, they exchanged them.</span> <span id="s1135">They picked up an old guy instead, and took him out at night, and the guards didn’t care as long as they had the right count.</span> <span id="s1136">They would have got my brother out too.</span> <span id="s1137">But I didn’t know about it, I slept through it.</span> <span id="s1138">So in the morning I heard there was about ten or twelve guys survived it.</span> <span id="s1139">They came out, and there came one guy looked like my brother from far away -- but it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s1140">They were gassed in those trucks, those infamous trucks that they gassed by running up a pipe in the truck, gassed on the road.</span> <span id="s1141">The people in there knew what would happen, because a couple guys tried to save themselves and jump into the latrine, buried themselves in the dirt, and they hauled them out.</span> <span id="s1142">They found them, and got them out, and there’s all this smell and stink.</span> <span id="s1143">They got in the truck and were hauled away.</span> <span id="s1144">I felt pretty bad about it, because I had the feeling that if I would have not slept through it, I may have saved my brother -- the older one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">The younger one was with me all the time, and the only thing is he worked for a different unit than I worked, but every morning I went to the cook and, like shopping in a grocery market, I would pick up some potatoes, some peas or potatoes in huge kettles -- food for us.</span> <span id="s1146">Sometimes the cook was nice enough, he gave me a little chunk of meat .</span> <span id="s1147">They used to get half of a horse.</span> <span id="s1148">Most of the meat was cut off already by the Germans, but there was always some meat pieces left, and sometimes he gave me a little piece, put it in there, too.</span> <span id="s1149">Never forgot that I gave him the tobacco.</span> <span id="s1150">I gave that container every day to my brother, to work.</span> <span id="s1151">He had the chance to cook.</span> <span id="s1152">I didn’t need it because I would get through my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">There was a Latvian working out there.</span> <span id="s1154">He was very good to us.</span> <span id="s1155">Used to come early in the morning with a whole sack of white bread which he sometimes sold for whatever it cost him.</span> <span id="s1156">Sometimes he gave it away.</span> <span id="s1157">Then he would go home.</span> <span id="s1158">At working time, eight o’clock, he’ll come with a second load.</span> <span id="s1159">There were nice people all over that helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">In August of ’44, finally we decided -- my brother and I -- we’re going to run away.</span> <span id="s1161">Now the time is come, because the Russians are coming closer.</span> <span id="s1162">So I had to get him back to the place where I work.</span> <span id="s1163">I had a truck to repair there, something on the motor.</span> <span id="s1164">I always was lucky to fix it -- I still don’t know anything about it -- but I was lucky, and they thought I could do anything.</span> <span id="s1165">I told them there was some electrical system not right.</span> <span id="s1166">I said, “There’s a guy in the camp.</span> <span id="s1167">He really knows it well.”</span> <span id="s1168">They said, “Well, tomorrow morning, you point him out in the line, and bring him along here.”</span> <span id="s1169">Which I did.</span> <span id="s1170">It was my brother!</span> <span id="s1171">Nobody else knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">I’ll never forget that moment.</span> <span id="s1173">There’s a huge truck.</span> <span id="s1174">Real high, big wheels.</span> <span id="s1175">I was sitting on one fender, he was sitting on the other fender, we had this thing opened.</span> <span id="s1176">Instead of working on the truck, we looked at each other with, “What do you think, should we, or shouldn’t we?</span> <span id="s1177">Should we?”</span> <span id="s1178">We were all alone.</span> <span id="s1179">No guards.</span> <span id="s1180">Just a matter to walk away.</span> <span id="s1181">Should we, or shouldn’t we?</span> <span id="s1182">Should we or shouldn’t we.</span> <span id="s1183">We’re putzing around for hours like that, and all of a sudden we see through the gate, the whole unit coming in there.</span> <span id="s1184">They got a telephonagram we should be brought back to the camp.</span> <span id="s1185">They’re going to ship us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Now we had still time to go in the barracks to say, “I have to change clothes,” or something like that and take off.</span> <span id="s1187">But by that time we’d already lost out guts, because you were afraid.</span> <span id="s1188">So many people were running already from Riga that by the time you get someplace, a friend or something, they might be gone, too.</span> <span id="s1189">They may have run away and you’ll stand in front of a closed door.</span> <span id="s1190">So we decided one thing.</span> <span id="s1191">That we would go to the harbor, and if it’s an old tanker -- because at night we were going to go -- we are not going aboard, because there were rumors that they torpedoed them.</span> <span id="s1192">They threw a bomb and they sink in the Baltic.</span> <span id="s1193">If it’s a new ship or a good ship, we’ll go aboard, otherwise we don’t.</span> <span id="s1194">And that night, everybody was running.</span> <span id="s1195">The German soldiers were going, civilians were going, everybody.</span> <span id="s1196">There was no lights, no nothing, we could have walked any moment away.</span> <span id="s1197">It was pitch- black night and everything was headed for the harbor.</span> <span id="s1198">We got to the harbor.</span> <span id="s1199">There was a brand new ship standing there, a Hunter ship, it’s just like American Liberty ships.</span> <span id="s1200">Brand new.</span> <span id="s1201">They ain’t going to sink that one!</span> <span id="s1202">It was a terrible journey.</span> <span id="s1203">We were in the hull.</span> <span id="s1204">Everybody was seasick!</span> <span id="s1205">We had to stop several times -- there were submarines that were nearby -- but we made it to Danzig.</span> <span id="s1206">We stayed there for about half-a-day, then they put us on a barge.</span> <span id="s1207">They had hooked together a whole bunch of barges, with one tugboat.</span> <span id="s1208">Everybody got on there -- the men, women.</span> <span id="s1209">We were sitting on boards.</span> <span id="s1210">They put the boards across.</span> <span id="s1211">There were just too many of us.</span> <span id="s1212">And no supplies, no food.</span> <span id="s1213">They did have supplies, but they were all on the tugboat.</span> <span id="s1214">They were not going to hand it out.</span> <span id="s1215">They didn’t have a way to do it anyway.</span> <span id="s1216">I was lucky again, I stayed behind and they picked the last 30 men and -- because there was no room -- they took us on the tugboat.</span> <span id="s1217">So I found myself a good warm spot right next to the smoke stack.</span> <span id="s1218">That’s how I sat there for almost the whole night.</span> <span id="s1219">The next morning they landed in the camp.</span> <span id="s1220">And they’d gone over, the Germans, and they told them that we have received supplies for another 24 hours, so for 24 hours in the camp the guys didn’t get nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1221">We ate on the tugboat, because there was food.</span> <span id="s1222">We found something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">But then we got to the camp and I’ll tell you, we had a ceremony, every single day.</span> <span id="s1224">They had a narrow little track railroad where they brought in potatoes.</span> <span id="s1225">You had to take the whole cars and dump them out -- they’re light -- and put them back on the tracks, pushed the train out of sight.</span> <span id="s1226">Then they had to put the potatoes in boxes and put them on their shoulders and run -- not walk across the road and into a field where they buried the potatoes for the winter.</span> <span id="s1227">They put them under mounds.</span> <span id="s1228">And the whole population -- the German population -- had to walk there, two miles across, from the town to the railway station.</span> <span id="s1229">If there’s anybody that says they didn’t know there was a concentration camp, they got a liars, because they saw the way we were chased there, and beaten.</span> <span id="s1230">While we were carrying, I used to eat raw potatoes right out there -- like an apple -- because of hunger.</span> <span id="s1231">Very hungry.</span> <span id="s1232">They hardly got any food there.</span> <span id="s1233">Got a thin soup.</span> <span id="s1234">That was all.</span> <span id="s1235">And a slice of bread in the morning and a slice of bread on the way back.</span> <span id="s1236">And a stick as you got back in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1237">Was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1238">We would stand out there and actually freeze.</span> <span id="s1239">By that time it was getting to be October.</span> <span id="s1240">It must have been September when we got there.</span> <span id="s1241">And about the area out there near the Vissla river, it’s foggy and wet, and it was miserable, miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">There I saw for the first time one of those crematoria.</span> <span id="s1243">It was a small one --just had one of them -- but every single day, almost, they took little groups of people.</span> <span id="s1244">Mostly women would walk down.</span> <span id="s1245">And the people knew where they were going, you could see it in their faces, the way they were walking.</span> <span id="s1246">There were maybe ten, twelve of them, just little groups.</span> <span id="s1247">One guard would go on the side.</span> <span id="s1248">There was no way to run, because it was all within the camp.</span> <span id="s1249">They would go down and they would throw in like a bullet of some type into the thing and it would explode and had the gas that killed the people.</span> <span id="s1250">On the other side you opened the doors and there they had something like a lowering end on it, and put the bodies on, and shoved them into the oven.</span> <span id="s1251">And it was always hanging, that pall of a smell, over the area.</span> <span id="s1252">And this was only one.</span> <span id="s1253">How would it be in the places like Auschwitz, I just can’t imagine -- teeming with people.</span> <span id="s1254">The people in this particular camp were orderly because each of them had their place.</span> <span id="s1255">There was from Latvia the minister of transportation in there too.</span> <span id="s1256">He had a separate room.</span> <span id="s1257">A room about half the size of this one, all by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: He was a prisoner though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1260">But they treated everybody different.</span> <span id="s1261">The German submarine commander -- the whole unit out there -- they were supposed to go out to sea, and they didn’t want.</span> <span id="s1262">They were mutiny.</span> <span id="s1263">They put them all in the camp.</span> <span id="s1264">But they got a different rationing than we did.</span> <span id="s1265">We got the worst end of the stick.</span> <span id="s1266">Then all of a sudden, some guy decided that he needs hire from that man mechanics.</span> <span id="s1267">Everybody’s always a mechanic.</span> <span id="s1268">I happened to know something about it, but 90% of them didn’t.</span> <span id="s1269">They gave you a medical checkup.</span> <span id="s1270">From here we had about 200 yards to run down.</span> <span id="s1271">If you could run -- or walk even --you were good enough!</span> <span id="s1272">(Laughs) And the guy came there from the factory – their representative.</span> <span id="s1273">I must not have looked very good because he squeezed my arm.</span> <span id="s1274">He said, “What is your trade?”</span> <span id="s1275">I says, “I’m an auto mechanic.”</span> <span id="s1276">And he said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1277">Then they give us civilian clothing, because the Germans were methodical.</span> <span id="s1278">They decided that prisoners are not allowed to work on ammunition, so they made civilians out of us.</span> <span id="s1279">They gave us all civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1280">The way they did it, they chased us into a shower again, we took our bath, as we came out, we got from each pile, one piece -- one underpants, one undershirt.</span> <span id="s1281">If by mistake there would have been an undershirt in the shorts, you would have gotten two undershirts, no shorts.</span> <span id="s1282">That’s the way it worked, one, one, one, one.</span> <span id="s1283">I happened to end up with a pair of pants that fairly fitted me, and a winter jacket that fitted me very well.</span> <span id="s1284">It was a three-quarter long jacket and it was warm.</span> <span id="s1285">So I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1286">One guy had feet like this.</span> <span id="s1287">And he had a pair of beautiful boots, those long ones that you lace up.</span> <span id="s1288">One of the Polish workers there decided he liked those boots so he gave him another pair of boots.</span> <span id="s1289">The guy couldn’t get his feet in.</span> <span id="s1290">Only the front went in.</span> <span id="s1291">The back was sticking out.</span> <span id="s1292">This man was about six-foot-two and he cried like a baby when he came out.</span> <span id="s1293">He couldn’t walk in them.</span> <span id="s1294">But that’s all he gets!</span> <span id="s1295">So the friends in his cell say, “Go back and get it back from the Pole.”</span> <span id="s1296">And he did!</span> <span id="s1297">Had a terrible fight, but he got the shoes back.</span> <span id="s1298">Came out, dirtier than could be, went into the bathtub, but he got his shoes back!</span> <span id="s1299">Every single day was a fight for your life!</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Then we were put on the train.</span> <span id="s1301">We didn’t know where we went.</span> <span id="s1302">They took us back to the city of Magdeburg, Germany -- that’s on the way to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1303">We got off in the middle of night.</span> <span id="s1304">They brought us into a camp, and we really thought we are in heaven, because each of us got a blanket.</span> <span id="s1305">All of a sudden we had a blanket for each -- for ourselves!</span> <span id="s1306">Before that they used to throw about ten blankets in for everybody to cover in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1307">And he said, “Go pick yourself a bunk.’</span> <span id="s1308">So my brother was with me.</span> <span id="s1309">This is my younger brother.</span> <span id="s1310">We got up there and we had to actually work in a factory, on the revolver benches where you make shells.</span> <span id="s1311">The work was not very pressure, we worked twelve hours.</span> <span id="s1312">But there again, the guards were stealing out food and selling it on the black market.</span> <span id="s1313">Food was getting short.</span> <span id="s1314">The factory was interested that we get our food.</span> <span id="s1315">But they didn’t let us have it.</span> <span id="s1316">Then, in January of 1945, the Americans bombed Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s1317">Damaged the factory, enough of it, that they didn’t have enough air pressure and not enough water.</span> <span id="s1318">So they took us out.</span> <span id="s1319">Instead of work in the factory, they took us out building anti-tank traps against tanks.</span> <span id="s1320">We would go into the buildings, pick up those steel girders and ram them into the ground and fill them up with rubble so prevent from the tanks to come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">On April 12 -- I’m getting down to the nitty gritty -- we were working on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s1322">The Russians were coming from one side, the Americans from the other.</span> <span id="s1323">And somewhere along the line an American tank saved my life.</span> <span id="s1324">They pulled up a little closer to the city and some German panicked and sounded the tank alarm, which was a special kind of sound.</span> <span id="s1325">When the thing sounded all over the city, the commandant of the camp told the guards, “Save yourself, the Americans are coming,” and he took off.</span> <span id="s1326">So some of the guards took off.</span> <span id="s1327">We were working right there where the traps were.</span> <span id="s1328">There was an SS man who was a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s1329">He didn’t want to take us back, he wanted to place in the hand of the Americans.</span> <span id="s1330">He wanted to have the Americans overrun the position, but they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1331">The Americans crept up close.</span> <span id="s1332">They found a little resistance, they pulled back, they came a week later.</span> <span id="s1333">So here we are in the city.</span> <span id="s1334">Finally they decided to bring us back in the camp.</span> <span id="s1335">Now we get somewhere in the middle of the city, and the guards are coming.</span> <span id="s1336">One guy has a Polish prisoner under his arm -- they’re taking off together.</span> <span id="s1337">He’s got his rifle hanging across his neck and carrying two suitcases.</span> <span id="s1338">So our guards saw that, they take off, too.</span> <span id="s1339">We’re standing free in the city, all alone!</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">At night, we started to look around, but we didn’t have any place to go, so we went closer to the camp.</span> <span id="s1341">We see people coming out, people going in.</span> <span id="s1342">I stop a guy, he says there was no guards.</span> <span id="s1343">He said, “You can go back.”</span> <span id="s1344">So we went in there, we found something to eat.</span> <span id="s1345">They had broken in all the supplies and I got a bowl of soup from a guy.</span> <span id="s1346">I couldn’t eat more than two spoonfuls.</span> <span id="s1347">Up to here.</span> <span id="s1348">Stomach shrunk.</span> <span id="s1349">I stayed with my brother, and we laid down to sleep in one of the guards’ quarters -- SS.</span> <span id="s1350">In the middle of the night my brother wakes me, he says, “I just heard an announcement on the loudspeaker.</span> <span id="s1351">We should be ready in an hour.</span> <span id="s1352">They’re going to take us back.”</span> <span id="s1353">Because the tanks didn’t come, some of the guards came back, because they’re deserted.</span> <span id="s1354">And we dumbbells are sitting in the camp!</span> <span id="s1355">A lot of other guys hid out in the city someplace, but we were in the camp.</span> <span id="s1356">I told my brother, “Get dressed.”</span> <span id="s1357">It was a pitch- black night.</span> <span id="s1358">And we went through the men’s camp into the women’s camp, not Jewish women, Polish women.</span> <span id="s1359">And we looked.</span> <span id="s1360">We couldn’t see the towers.</span> <span id="s1361">It was really pitch black.</span> <span id="s1362">No moon, nothing.</span> <span id="s1363">We pulled out a board out of a fence, and another board out of the fence.</span> <span id="s1364">And that noise that nail makes -- that sound of nails being pried out of boards -- terrible at night!</span> <span id="s1365">I went, like this, outside.</span> <span id="s1366">Didn’t feel nothing.</span> <span id="s1367">Then I thought, “If I don’t see them, they don’t see me either.”</span> <span id="s1368">I stuck my shoulder through and I was outside.</span> <span id="s1369">Gives you an eerie feeling, because inside you were allowed to be, outside you’re on the run.</span> <span id="s1370">My brother followed me.</span> <span id="s1371">We went a few steps and we hid in the bushes.</span> <span id="s1372">And after about five minutes the rest of the guys were standing out there.</span> <span id="s1373">They all took off, and running on the cobblestones, we started to walk like soldiers -- in step.</span> <span id="s1374">In the city, we headed into the area where we were pulling out the girders, closer to the American line.</span> <span id="s1375">Plus that we wanted to get into the bombed out area.</span> <span id="s1376">When it started to break the light around 3:30 in the morning, four o’clock, we decided we better get off the street before somebody sees us, so we started to climb behind the buildings in there -- over the rubble.</span> <span id="s1377">We found a basement.</span> <span id="s1378">We climbed into the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">: This is a place where a guy should enter religion, because I think in the whole city of Magdeburgt ,here wasn’t a basement like this.</span> <span id="s1380">The building was blown away from a bomb.</span> <span id="s1381">It was sitting there waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1382">There were three compartments.</span> <span id="s1383">One belonged to a painter, It had supplies and ladders and everything.</span> <span id="s1384">The other one just had empty crates in there.</span> <span id="s1385">The third one was locked, where tenants keep their stuff in the basement.</span> <span id="s1386">We took a brick and knocked off the lock.</span> <span id="s1387">And everything was in there that a guy on the run should want!</span> <span id="s1388">There was a cabinet with canned stuff in there, but they were not put up in glasses in Germany.</span> <span id="s1389">Everything!</span> <span id="s1390">Asparagus and carrots and anything!</span> <span id="s1391">Vegetables.</span> <span id="s1392">I found matches.</span> <span id="s1393">I found potatoes.</span> <span id="s1394">We found a loveseat and a huge wicker basket, like a trunk, and I made myself a bed up there, and my brother on that loveseat.</span> <span id="s1395">We were dead tired.</span> <span id="s1396">We went to sleep and the next thing we woke up, there’s a German standing in there -- civilian.</span> <span id="s1397">He said, “What are you doing in here?”</span> <span id="s1398">We said, “Well, we’re on the run.”</span> <span id="s1399">He says, “ You’ve got to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s1400">I says, “We’re tired.”</span> <span id="s1401">He said, “ Okay, you sleep a couple of hours, but then you’re getting out.’</span> <span id="s1402">Well, it was not his basement.</span> <span id="s1403">We found that out later.</span> <span id="s1404">He came there himself to steal something.</span> <span id="s1405">So he came back a couple hours later.</span> <span id="s1406">And he was a very gullible man.</span> <span id="s1407">He was afraid that the Americans would kill all the Germans, so it may be nice to have a friend next door.</span> <span id="s1408">So he came back, he said, “You can stay here, but you have to help me when the Americans come in.”</span> <span id="s1409">Obviously we promised him.</span> <span id="s1410">He was a nice man.</span> <span id="s1411">Brought us every day a bucket of water -- sometimes a couple potatoes from his wife.</span> <span id="s1412">Brought sometimes a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1413">Never told his wife about it.</span> <span id="s1414">And always came early morning hours.</span> <span id="s1415">One day there was a raid.</span> <span id="s1416">And after about seven days, he said, “I think the Americans are going to come in today.”</span> <span id="s1417">Next day he didn’t come.</span> <span id="s1418">“I heard a lot of noises going in the back.</span> <span id="s1419">I thought any minute the Germans would walk in.</span> <span id="s1420">A couple of times I had near misses.</span> <span id="s1421">A couple Germans were standing, I could see their feet, their boots, just standing there looking their territory over.</span> <span id="s1422">Then all of a sudden, that man comes in.</span> <span id="s1423">He used to knock before he opened that gate.</span> <span id="s1424">He just walked in to steal something.</span> <span id="s1425">He said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1426">I said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s1427">He said, “Don’t you know the Americans are here in town?”</span> <span id="s1428">I said, “Where?”</span> <span id="s1429">He said, “there’s a unit right across the street.”</span> <span id="s1430">And as I walked across the street, there was a guy standing at the truck.</span> <span id="s1431">Looked like a gentile, but he said to me, “Vis der Yid?”</span> <span id="s1432">We said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1433">He said, “Me, too!”</span> <span id="s1434">And he gave me some cigarettes and some K-rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">To make a long story short, his mother brought us to the United States.</span> <span id="s1436">It’s the very first American soldier we saw.</span> <span id="s1437">He introduced me to the cook, but after a week they left, and he left me his address, and when I finally couldn’t find a sponsor here, I wrote to him.</span> <span id="s1438">His mother was very religious, and she had promised herself, “If my son comes back from the war unharmed, I would like to do something for somebody.”</span> <span id="s1439">And then she got our letter asking to get me in touch with the Jewish organization, and the mother said, “That’s for me.”</span> <span id="s1440">And so she sponsored us and that’s how I come, my wife, my brother, myself.</span> <span id="s1441">We got married in Germany.</span> <span id="s1442">I found my wife, which is a long story, but I’ll tell you that some other time.</span> <span id="s1443">A miracle that I found her in all of Germany!</span> <span id="s1444">But that’s the story of my life, and I came to the United States in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: There are a lot of specific questions about the camp life.</span> <span id="s1446">You mention that there were a lot of different groups in the camps.</span> <span id="s1447">Did you have contact between the other groups or just with the other Jews or just with the other people in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: No contact whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: But you were aware that there was different treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1451">We could see that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: And in that large camp, there was a small crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1454">That camp’s name was Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1455">I have talked to people that come from that area, Germans here.</span> <span id="s1456">They all lived in that area.</span> <span id="s1457">They never knew about any of those camps, they told me, but as I said, the people living in that little village of Stutthof -- there’s no way anybody can say that they didn’t know about a camp, because they had to go by, every day they went to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: While you were in the camp, were you aware, very much, of the war effort?</span> <span id="s1459">Of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Everything.</span> <span id="s1461">The day that they tried to assassinate Hitler, we knew it, within the hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Did you know when the Americans landed in Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: That was announced.</span> <span id="s1464">That was the Germans.</span> <span id="s1465">They didn’t announce it to us, but these were speakers.</span> <span id="s1466">You always managed.</span> <span id="s1467">There was news.</span> <span id="s1468">They called them “VISA” Surprising its called “VISA” like our VISA card.</span> <span id="s1469">It was an abbreviation for “Eden Villenlasse.”</span> <span id="s1470">The Jews liked to have news, would love to have, so they made up.</span> <span id="s1471">We used to have rumors that the Swedes are going to come in, and we’re going to be released, because there were exchanges.</span> <span id="s1472">The camps thrived on rumors.</span> <span id="s1473">They used to say, when we met somebody, “Anything new?”</span> <span id="s1474">All the time.</span> <span id="s1475">And they said, “No.</span> <span id="s1476">Didn’t hear nothing.”</span> <span id="s1477">Well thank God, no news were good news, because any news that came were always worse.</span> <span id="s1478">Always worse.</span> <span id="s1479">The first relief that came was the time when we had a chance to go to Magdeburg -- 500 men.</span> <span id="s1480">It really was a drastic difference from what we had there.</span> <span id="s1481">We were standing in Stutthof in the cold out there.</span> <span id="s1482">In order to keep warm, we would build “furnaces’ -- five, six guys would stand in a circle, and they keep calling any other guy that went by, to stand on the outside, while the guy on the outside would call some other people, so pretty soon, came like a huge beehive.</span> <span id="s1483">Hundreds of people were standing in one mass.</span> <span id="s1484">But inside was warm.</span> <span id="s1485">The body temperature was actually warm.</span> <span id="s1486">And we didn’t have nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1487">We sometimes sing something.</span> <span id="s1488">We just start to sway, the whole group out there.</span> <span id="s1489">And we could stand for hours and hours and hours that way.</span> <span id="s1490">Four o’clock in the morning we were outside, and I remember nine or ten o’clock at night they let us back in with a slice of bread or so on, but never saw the barrack before.</span> <span id="s1491">We had to fight our way into the toilet!</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: So there was no work at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: There was nothing to do, except once in a while we unloaded the potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Do you remember the names of any of the major German personnel at that camp?</span> <span id="s1495">The commanders or officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: We never saw them.</span> <span id="s1497">They were on the outside.</span> <span id="s1498">Occasionally they’d take us out in the middle of the early morning or something, and they would hang somebody.</span> <span id="s1499">They would hang them up.</span> <span id="s1500">We never knew who it was.</span> <span id="s1501">Usually somebody either refused to work, or had done something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Do any other memories come to mind about specific actions of the German personnel in the camp or any behavior of the personnel in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Well, there were always some bastards in the deal.</span> <span id="s1504">The fact that I’m here is because I got away.</span> <span id="s1505">We were caught in little things.</span> <span id="s1506">Got a couple times hit over the rear-end with a stick.</span> <span id="s1507">Because one guy stole something, the whole unit that went out to work, fifteen guys, you all had to lay down on the bench and they beat us.</span> <span id="s1508">Some of the guys were all the time beatings, hittings.</span> <span id="s1509">There was a discipline more or less in the camp.</span> <span id="s1510">Some guy, at night, would steal from another prisoner things, and what they would do, they would call in the camp “eldester’ -- that was a Jew, too -- and put him at night on the table and he would spend the rest of the night on the table, and in the morning they would give him 15 on the “toches.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Was it an organization among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1513">Always is.</span> <span id="s1514">There is immediately a society.</span> <span id="s1515">We had in the camp a fellow with the name of Karpen.</span> <span id="s1516">He came into the camp like the rest that were standing in line, and a Polish prisoner walked up to him and says, “I see you got a watch.</span> <span id="s1517">They’re going to take it away from you.</span> <span id="s1518">Why don’t you give it to me?”</span> <span id="s1519">And the guy tried with him, ”Mind your own business.”</span> <span id="s1520">So this Pole was a boxer and he hit him.</span> <span id="s1521">And this Jewish boy, Karpen was a short guy like I am, but powerful guy.</span> <span id="s1522">He was an amateur boxer.</span> <span id="s1523">He turned around and he let the Pole have one.</span> <span id="s1524">And there just happened that a good 500 yards away the commandant was standing, and he saw it happen.</span> <span id="s1525">He said, “Bring me that man!”</span> <span id="s1526">And immediately he made him the boss over 2,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1527">He, all through the years, was transferred from camp to camp, always as the leader.</span> <span id="s1528">He had a separate room in front.</span> <span id="s1529">He did have a little bit better -- strictly by his fist.</span> <span id="s1530">And he had to, in order to keep his authority, he had to rule with fists, but this guy was not good.</span> <span id="s1531">He was too rough on the Jews.</span> <span id="s1532">Tried to improve himself with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1533">People decided, “When the war is over, we’re going to hang him.”</span> <span id="s1534">But he had a brother, sixteen years old and when we were all liberated in Magdeburg he sent out his brother.</span> <span id="s1535">He went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1536">Sent his brother out to investigate: How’s the sentiment?</span> <span id="s1537">Well we were all busy looking for our own places, to find clothes, to find food.</span> <span id="s1538">Nobody bothered with him.</span> <span id="s1539">We all forgot.</span> <span id="s1540">So he found out nobody’s looking for him.</span> <span id="s1541">So he came out, and he moved in with one of the guys he hit most!</span> <span id="s1542">Then came the time he had a chance to leave for America right away, and one of the questions you have to answer, if you were ever a kapo in the camp.</span> <span id="s1543">And he said no.</span> <span id="s1544">We all knew better.</span> <span id="s1545">The Jews decided, “Let him go.</span> <span id="s1546">Let him fight it out with his own conscience,” -- not to stand in his way.</span> <span id="s1547">Otherwise he would have been still in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Have you ever heard of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1550">He must have had some relatives here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Did you give much thought to the matter of survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s1553">It was a “will to live” to the point that they always let you know that when the time comes they wouldn’t need you anymore, they’ll kill you.</span> <span id="s1554">But you always thought that maybe the time comes, you’re not going to let them.</span> <span id="s1555">You’re going to take off before.</span> <span id="s1556">And in my case, that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1557">Now I’m not a hero in this point, because two other guys came the same night.</span> <span id="s1558">Two good dear friends of mine.</span> <span id="s1559">They also ended up in a basement some place in town.</span> <span id="s1560">They were also surprised by a German.</span> <span id="s1561">But this guy told them, “You can stay here.”</span> <span id="s1562">But he went to the Germans and reported them.</span> <span id="s1563">So they picked them up and they took them to the river and shot them.</span> <span id="s1564">The one guy Max Schneider, got a bullet in the back, which is normally fatal, and it came out here and didn’t touch a tooth!</span> <span id="s1565">But the shot stunned him and they kicked both of them into the Elbe.</span> <span id="s1566">The cold water woke him up, and he climbed out of the water and he was in a basement for five days without food, with a bullet wound.</span> <span id="s1567">After five days, he was crawling out on his hands and knees as the American tanks were pulling up.</span> <span id="s1568">He ended up in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1569">They nursed him back to health and I met him when I went to look for my wife -- about four or five weeks later.</span> <span id="s1570">I met him in Braunsweig with a cane.</span> <span id="s1571">He’d just been released from the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Surprisingly, when I was in Leegard, at the University called the Hegain Institute, it was in the middle of winter, and there was an epidemic or something around there, so they decided to inoculate all the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1573">Since we were there -- the Jews -- they thought we should get the shots, too.</span> <span id="s1574">But they wanted to show the difference between the Germans and the Jews, so they got two shots, we got one shot.</span> <span id="s1575">(Laughter) We all had to strip to the waist.</span> <span id="s1576">I had from my wife a man’s ring, a wide one, and she had made two rings out of it.</span> <span id="s1577">I’m the only guy who was engaged to a wife where the wife bought him the ring.</span> <span id="s1578">She had the two rings made and she gave me that ring.</span> <span id="s1579">I made myself a little cover and I wore it around my neck on a chain under my shirt, so nobody knew about it, because we were not allowed to have it.</span> <span id="s1580">You get so used to it, you don’t pay attention to it anymore.</span> <span id="s1581">And the guys went up there and they said, “Strip your shirt off.”</span> <span id="s1582">I took off the shirt, and this young SS doctor in his 30s gives us the shot.</span> <span id="s1583">And he comes up to me, he says, “What have you got there?”</span> <span id="s1584">real quietly.</span> <span id="s1585">I look down.</span> <span id="s1586">My heart sinks down there.</span> <span id="s1587">Here’s that ring.</span> <span id="s1588">The ring was in a cover, but you could see the shape of it, it’s a ring, because it pressed itself down there.</span> <span id="s1589">Now another guy may have taken and ripped it off, and maybe knocked me around.</span> <span id="s1590">The guy said, “Put it away.”</span> <span id="s1591">And he went on to the next guy.</span> <span id="s1592">Must have been a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s1593">You never know about these guys.</span> <span id="s1594">They are people like other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">We had a driver and we used to go out in the country with him all the time.</span> <span id="s1596">We asked him how he ever got into the SS.</span> <span id="s1597">He said he was a boy in the Hitler Youth, which was just like the Boy Scouts here at that time.</span> <span id="s1598">And automatically, he said, he was just of age, he became a guard in a camp.</span> <span id="s1599">I asked him, “Mr. Kolbe, did you have to shoot somebody?</span> <span id="s1600">’” He said, “yeah, once,” seventy people he shot.</span> <span id="s1601">We said, “Who were they?”</span> <span id="s1602">He said, ‘they were enemies of the state.”</span> <span id="s1603">We said, “They were all men?”</span> <span id="s1604">He said, “No!</span> <span id="s1605">They were from the babies up to the grandmothers!”</span> <span id="s1606">I said, “Kolbe, how can a baby be an enemy of the state?”</span> <span id="s1607">“I never thought about it,” he said.</span> <span id="s1608">“You know, when they asked for volunteers, nobody volunteered.</span> <span id="s1609">But then they said, ‘You, you and you,’ and I was among them.”</span> <span id="s1610">And he said, “My stomach turned, but by golly, after you do it once, if I had to shoot my mother, I could do it now.”</span> <span id="s1611">That’s how it hardens down the people.</span> <span id="s1612">And he was a nice man!</span> <span id="s1613">I was driving with him, and you learn to know a man after a long time.</span> <span id="s1614">But that’s what war does to you.</span> <span id="s1615">That’s what the leaders will do to you.</span> <span id="s1616">Particularly, they took the responsibility off the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: When you came out of the cellar and you saw this first American soldier face-to-face, what kind of feelings did you have right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: First I had a scare.</span> <span id="s1619">Before I saw him, I saw two Germans with a Red Cross deal, doing something.</span> <span id="s1620">Barked to me like an old military, “What do you want!”</span> <span id="s1621">We were scared, we were out there in the open now.</span> <span id="s1622">I said, ‘We’re looking for food.”</span> <span id="s1623">and all of a sudden I hear a big guy say, “What do the people want?”</span> <span id="s1624">in German.</span> <span id="s1625">I look around.</span> <span id="s1626">There’s a big officer standing there.</span> <span id="s1627">Also with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1628">And this guy snaps to attention.</span> <span id="s1629">He said, “These are prisoners.</span> <span id="s1630">They’re looking for food.”</span> <span id="s1631">They said, “Well, we don’t have any for ourselves, you have to ask them.”</span> <span id="s1632">And he points back in the yard and that’s where the Americans were.</span> <span id="s1633">He said, “Those are Americans.”</span> <span id="s1634">They didn’t have any insignia.</span> <span id="s1635">Just green uniforms.</span> <span id="s1636">But I thought, “if those are Americans, we don’t need you anymore.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: So then you went over to the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Went over there, yah, and there was a guy with a truck out there.</span> <span id="s1639">Oh, unbelievable!</span> <span id="s1640">As I walked off the street, sun was shining!</span> <span id="s1641">It was a beautiful day, April the 20th.</span> <span id="s1642">Seven days -- 12th I went in, on the 20th I came out.</span> <span id="s1643">Every time I get in spring, a day like this, I am there!</span> <span id="s1644">It’s hard to explain!</span> <span id="s1645">I’m walking on that street.</span> <span id="s1646">I feel exactly that moment, how it was.</span> <span id="s1647">I was walking like on a cloud!</span> <span id="s1648">You cannot explain to anybody unless you’ve been through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">The very same thing is if outside is snow, in the middle of winter, I sometimes walk out at night, and I’m alone and it’s quiet.</span> <span id="s1650">I am back in the ghetto -- how the ghetto looked, because we tore down all the gates and all the fences.</span> <span id="s1651">We burned them all up.</span> <span id="s1652">We needed firewood, but the whole thing was an empty field, and the wind was blowing and there was a dreary, hopeless feeling out there.</span> <span id="s1653">Again, I’m standing out there and it comes to me, just like that!</span> <span id="s1654">It’s true.</span> <span id="s1655">But only if I’m alone, it’s quiet, because I did went out a couple times, out in the yard.</span> <span id="s1656">Right there, vividly, comes back the memory --that night when I heard the shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">I’m not paranoid about it.</span> <span id="s1658">I didn’t get any, what you read about Vietnamese veterans -- that they have some sort of shell shock or mental thing.</span> <span id="s1659">It has not really affected me, because we were very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1660">We came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1661">We were hungry, but we got food the first day from my butcher.</span> <span id="s1662">He gave us some horsemeat -- a chunk of it.</span> <span id="s1663">We made a whole huge bowl of hamburgers and we ate it all!</span> <span id="s1664">It could have killed us!</span> <span id="s1665">A lot of people died afterward.</span> <span id="s1666">There’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1667">In the camp we never fought for an extra bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s1668">The people in the camp usually eat, eat, eat fast the soup, but then they wait.</span> <span id="s1669">There’s sometimes a second, because they don’t give you the full quart.</span> <span id="s1670">They give you two-thirds of a quart, or three-fourths of a quart, because they’re afraid it may be short at the end.</span> <span id="s1671">If they’re short, that’s it!</span> <span id="s1672">So they always hold it down a little bit and then they have a few extras.</span> <span id="s1673">So some of the guys would just eat, eat, eat, and then with one foot all ready, wait until the guy says, “Seconds!”</span> <span id="s1674">Then they run – kill themselves.</span> <span id="s1675">Sometimes instead of getting the soup, the guy would take that thing and hit them over the head.</span> <span id="s1676">But all the things we were drinking down was just water.</span> <span id="s1677">And in the morning, the last four or five months, it was a pitiful sight to see the guys.</span> <span id="s1678">They would woke up in the morning.</span> <span id="s1679">Couldn’t put their shoes on, because their feet were swollen.</span> <span id="s1680">You couldn’t see their eyes, because they were just like a blob of meat.</span> <span id="s1681">Whole head, everything swollen.</span> <span id="s1682">They were on their way out, those people.</span> <span id="s1683">A lot of them, I’m sure, did not make it anymore after the liberation, because they were just full of liquid, full of water, all puffed up.</span> <span id="s1684">Fortunately, we were weak, but we made it.</span> <span id="s1685">There was one guy in the camp.</span> <span id="s1686">He slept right next to me.</span> <span id="s1687">He was my size, my age and somehow I saw myself in him.</span> <span id="s1688">I was watching him, because we didn’t have any mirrors around.</span> <span id="s1689">We used to shave looking in a glass, into the barrack.</span> <span id="s1690">I saw myself in him and I saw how he was deteriorating fast from day to day.</span> <span id="s1691">Then they didn’t let him go to work anymore.</span> <span id="s1692">He was laying in bed all day long.</span> <span id="s1693">Then one day I came home and he was dead.</span> <span id="s1694">I took his death more than I would have taken today, my brother’s death, because I saw myself in him.</span> <span id="s1695">I was on the way out!</span> <span id="s1696">We had twelve or eighteen steps to walk up to the factory and I actually could not make it anymore.</span> <span id="s1697">I couldn’t lift my feet up.</span> <span id="s1698">I was weighing about eighty pounds.</span> <span id="s1699">But that was only the last six months.</span> <span id="s1700">How people did it for years with that kind of food!</span> <span id="s1701">Because as I told you before, I had always chances to get some food.</span> <span id="s1702">Was from a Latvian I worked with, from somebody else.</span> <span id="s1703">Always managed.</span> <span id="s1704">My wife brought me some.</span> <span id="s1705">Always managed to get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Hunger can do terrible things.</span> <span id="s1707">We were in Magdeburg, the last place.</span> <span id="s1708">We were walking down the street to the bath and I saw a frozen potato laying in the snow.</span> <span id="s1709">I knew damn well you march in lines surrounded by guards, you don’t putz around.</span> <span id="s1710">But my hunger was so great, that I run out of line -- right in the middle of the street -- like in a trance -- and I picked up the potato.</span> <span id="s1711">The next thing I got, I was getting hit with a rifle butt and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1712">I could hold onto the potato.</span> <span id="s1713">Hunger does that to you, A second time it happened in the camp.</span> <span id="s1714">We were bringing in a load of rutabagas.</span> <span id="s1715">There were guards around, no horse or anything, but a lot of prisoners were pulling and pushing the thing.</span> <span id="s1716">Just like in a trance, too, I run up there and grabbed one of those rutabagas.</span> <span id="s1717">The next thing I was laying on the ground, and they were hitting me, and I had to get up and take that rutabagas and put it back on that load.</span> <span id="s1718">Didn’t even get it.</span> <span id="s1719">And I was lucky because for that they could have sent me away.</span> <span id="s1720">But I was really fortunate.</span> <span id="s1721">I ate what a dog had left over.</span> <span id="s1722">Sunday morning, volunteering to clean the barracks from the SS -- out in front -- we went into territory where the prisoners normally are not.</span> <span id="s1723">So you always find something.</span> <span id="s1724">They had a can, big can there where they dumped all the food for the dog, and the dog could only reach a certain way.</span> <span id="s1725">It’s some mold in there, but I took that can.</span> <span id="s1726">I put it in the pushcart, and covered it with a sack and I carried it into the camp.</span> <span id="s1727">Was the middle of winter.</span> <span id="s1728">We cut it out with a knife.</span> <span id="s1729">With my brother we knocked it out.</span> <span id="s1730">Pulled out a couple of dog hair and we had a Saturday dinner, because the food was good what the guards ate.</span> <span id="s1731">Didn’t care it was for the dog.</span> <span id="s1732">It was good food, nourishing food that kept you alive, that little extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Did you return to Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No.</span> <span id="s1735">My wife was back.</span> <span id="s1736">I did not go back.</span> <span id="s1737">I was liberated in the American zone.</span> <span id="s1738">The Elbe River was the dividing line.</span> <span id="s1739">The Russians were on one, the Americans were here.</span> <span id="s1740">Now I wanted to find my wife, and we had made out a lady, an address, in case we survived the war, we would write to that lady on the west bank of the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s1741">That’s across whole Germany.</span> <span id="s1742">I thought, “I’d better go there first.</span> <span id="s1743">If she’s not there, if she went back to Riga ,I can always go back to Riga, but you cannot come out from behind the Iron Curtain.”</span> <span id="s1744">So that’s why we waited for mail.</span> <span id="s1745">Didn’t go, no telephone, no mail, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1746">No transportation!</span> <span id="s1747">Then finally there was talk that the Russians coming in to the west of Magdeburg, which eventually turned out that way.</span> <span id="s1748">I decided with my brother we’re not going to wait, we’re going to walk!</span> <span id="s1749">And we walked across Germany for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1750">We hitched a ride once in a while, sometimes on a train, and we got to that little village, and the lady had died.</span> <span id="s1751">The people that were there, at first they didn’t want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1752">Then they finally said they think my wife went to Solingen, which is a town in Germany where the forks and knives are made.</span> <span id="s1753">So we went back there and I looked at the police records.</span> <span id="s1754">We couldn’t find her anywhere.</span> <span id="s1755">Germany’s easy to find somebody because of the police records, you’ve got to register, but couldn’t find them.</span> <span id="s1756">They were bombed.</span> <span id="s1757">I finally, after staying there a couple of days, decided I’m not going to find her anymore.</span> <span id="s1758">We’re going to the American zone -- which is Frankfurt -- and try to get in touch with my uncle in the United States.</span> <span id="s1759">We had his address.</span> <span id="s1760">I remembered it all these years.</span> <span id="s1761">He run away from Europe when he was 13 years old, have been living here all his life.</span> <span id="s1762">So I walked with my brother out of that little village.</span> <span id="s1763">Always with my brother on the side and we didn’t get along that well.</span> <span id="s1764">We had real arguments, but he never ate anything what he found without sharing with me, and I never ate anything.</span> <span id="s1765">I pulled out, one time, a root out of the ground -- the last day before the tank alarm sounded -- and we broke it in half and we ate it.</span> <span id="s1766">Today if I ate it, it would kill both of us.</span> <span id="s1767">(Chuckle) Poison.</span> <span id="s1768">It’s been in the ground, just the root.</span> <span id="s1769">But we walked through that little village on the way out of town and we saw a little store with a little sheet, like a typewriter sheet.</span> <span id="s1770">They were just government announcements, real fine print, up there.</span> <span id="s1771">I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1772">I was dumb about these things.</span> <span id="s1773">I went in and I said, “I would like to put in a search ad.</span> <span id="s1774">I’m looking for a person.”</span> <span id="s1775">He said, ‘Well there’s a couple of more million people like to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1776">We don’t have any paper.</span> <span id="s1777">We don’t have a permit to do it.</span> <span id="s1778">But if you want to pay me,” he said, “I’ll put it in whenever we get the permit.</span> <span id="s1779">Give me the name.”</span> <span id="s1780">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1781">So he gave me a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1782">I wrote down my wife’s name.</span> <span id="s1783">Lucky for me that she had an unusual name.</span> <span id="s1784">Her first name is Tamara and her last name was Lilget with an apostrophe in the French way -- not too many of them around.</span> <span id="s1785">He picked that thing up, and he says, “ I know her!”</span> <span id="s1786">He said, “She lives in the next street someplace.</span> <span id="s1787">She wanted to subscribe.</span> <span id="s1788">I think it is an even number.”</span> <span id="s1789">So I went up and down the street looking for that even number, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1790">Asked them about it, is she wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1791">Time was running out, because of the curfew.</span> <span id="s1792">Then I tried the uneven side.</span> <span id="s1793">I finally got to a house, and there was a lady sweeping outside, and I said,” I’m looking for a Tamara.”</span> <span id="s1794">“Yes, she just moved out of here,” she said.</span> <span id="s1795">But she had the address.</span> <span id="s1796">It was just a street away.</span> <span id="s1797">I knocked on the door and there I found my wife.</span> <span id="s1798">We were just on our way out of town.</span> <span id="s1799">If I wouldn’t have passed that store, I would have never found my wife again!</span> <span id="s1800">Coincidence!</span> <span id="s1801">And that’s my life story -- or rather, the story of those times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: How did you come to Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: My sponsors were from St. Louis, Missouri, and that’s where we went, originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Why didn’t your uncle sponsor you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: My uncle had financial problems and he had some family problems, and he never answered us!</span> <span id="s1806">But then he did make some step to bring us over, because when we landed in Boston I got a whole bunch of papers out from one cabin on the ship, and we were standing in the hallway and about half-an-hour later, another cabin, I dumped everything in.</span> <span id="s1807">During that process I went from the emigration to the immigration, and there I found one telegram where it says, “Bernard Fidelsohn welcomes the arrival of his nephew and niece and brother.’</span> <span id="s1808">But that was the only thing I saw from him.</span> <span id="s1809">He was not capable, he was like a lot of Americans, he didn’t know very well to write, he didn’t have a lot of education and he, like most of Americans, couldn’t understand the urgency.</span> <span id="s1810">A lot of people don’t do those things.</span> <span id="s1811">The people who finally sponsored us, they were being talked at by the Jewish Family service in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1812">They said, “You are crazy to do that!</span> <span id="s1813">People don’t do it for their relatives!</span> <span id="s1814">You will be responsible for five years!”</span> <span id="s1815">Which they would have been -- five years.</span> <span id="s1816">But that old lady says, “My son knows him.</span> <span id="s1817">He says they’re going to be all right in America here, and I want to sponsor them!”</span> <span id="s1818">She had to insist!</span> <span id="s1819">So that’s why, right now, we’d be in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1820">My brother is still in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1821">He is married there.</span> <span id="s1822">We didn’t like the town at all.</span> <span id="s1823">I can’t stand that warm climate, the humidity and the dirty parts.</span> <span id="s1824">We were about three and a half years there.</span> <span id="s1825">We had a little grocery store there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">My wife had a doctor here and so did I, and we decided my birthday, August 8th is going to be the last day we are in business, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1827">We quit on August 8th and we decided to take a trip up to visit Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1828">We didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1829">At first we came in from the wrong side of town.</span> <span id="s1830">We came to Milwaukee Depot, Plymouth Avenue.</span> <span id="s1831">He was living on Morgan Avenue, around there, lousy neighborhood, an old orthodox Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1832">By that time the better ones had left already.</span> <span id="s1833">Decided we don’t want to, we’re going to go to Madison, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1834">We went through the town.</span> <span id="s1835">I liked it.</span> <span id="s1836">It was impossible to find a room to stay!</span> <span id="s1837">Oh, in those years, you couldn’t find one here, either.</span> <span id="s1838">I had to beg, steal and borrow to get a room here.</span> <span id="s1839">We couldn’t find nothing in Madison, so I finally put my wife on the train back to St. Louis and I came back to Minneapolis, and this time, somehow, for some reason, I missed the highway.</span> <span id="s1840">I came in from south of Lyndale Avenue and I saw the lakes and everything.</span> <span id="s1841">All of a sudden, I liked the town.</span> <span id="s1842">And I’m glad I came here.</span> <span id="s1843">So we came up here and found myself a job to sell insurance and made a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Do you maintain contact with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Just with my personal friends.</span> <span id="s1846">I have a lot of Jewish personal friends here which I made, but they’re not really European.</span> <span id="s1847">I know Fred Baron -- met him in Europe.</span> <span id="s1848">There’s a couple of them like that.</span> <span id="s1849">There is Alex Freisinger.</span> <span id="s1850">German Jews, primarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Do you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I don’t.</span> <span id="s1853">We have a mixed marriage, and my wife doesn’t belong to any.</span> <span id="s1854">It’s maybe not the right thing to do, but we don’t have any children today, so it isn’t important.</span> <span id="s1855">We are free thinking people.</span> <span id="s1856">I’m not religious anymore.</span> <span id="s1857">I cannot understand the things that God let happen that time, for all those innocent people to die, and that the guilty ones are still walking the streets.</span> <span id="s1858">There’s a lot of them right here, Latvians, officers.</span> <span id="s1859">They can’t even deport them, there’s all kinds of flaws in the laws.</span> <span id="s1860">Unbelievable stories -- we have read them -- those guys protected by the CIA or something.</span> <span id="s1861">They actually hired this Romanian guard out there, a whole group of them were criminals, but they were important to them, because they knew something that may help them against the Russians.</span> <span id="s1862">Politics makes dirty bedfellows.</span> <span id="s1863">What is it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Politics makes strange bedfellows, yes.</span> <span id="s1865">Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Luck, fortune.</span> <span id="s1867">And being in the right place at the right time, doing what it was smart to do, possibly some little luck that came with it.</span> <span id="s1868">Maybe I acted right, too.</span> <span id="s1869">I found myself in the situation where we worked, managed to make the best out of it.</span> <span id="s1870">An example is with the fellow that we gave him those tobacco.</span> <span id="s1871">Tried to do a good deed, came back to me.</span> <span id="s1872">That old German fellow helped us.</span> <span id="s1873">We came back to him.</span> <span id="s1874">We gave him a lot of aid, we came back to him with a lot of food after the war.</span> <span id="s1875">He was just a plain, ordinary worker, paperhanger or something, very simple man.</span> <span id="s1876">It’s just fortune.</span> <span id="s1877">My time wasn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: And in the years following the war, since you’ve been in the U.S., do you reflect back on your experience often?</span> <span id="s1879">How has it influenced your life since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Yes, I do, but I have many times been asked about these things.</span> <span id="s1881">I had to tell many times, little excerpts of the things that I told you today, and it seems to people a miracle.</span> <span id="s1882">These things happened to me.</span> <span id="s1883">The time that I survived is the thing that we got into, that we came in to the other places.</span> <span id="s1884">It was really one of the best places of any, that billeting -- of any place in the city.</span> <span id="s1885">Because we were just six men, and we -- my two brothers with me -- we had practically all the food we wanted.</span> <span id="s1886">We used to eat in the university.</span> <span id="s1887">A cellar for storing food.</span> <span id="s1888">Went to the country and the soldiers, the drivers -- they used to trade stuff which you weren’t allowed to -- gasoline and boots and everything for food.</span> <span id="s1889">They traded some for us.</span> <span id="s1890">I had to do the translation with the Latvian farmers.</span> <span id="s1891">When we arrived back into town, they used to sort the things out that belongs to the Jews -- that’s ours -- and they’d take it back.</span> <span id="s1892">And we had, at that time, food.</span> <span id="s1893">Even among the Germans I could find some decent people, but there’s one thing -- if there was a bad, rotten apple in them, he spoiled the rest of them.</span> <span id="s1894">If they were alone with you, they were wonderful, but if that one guy was there -- (click sound).</span> <span id="s1895">Wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s1896">I got so daring when I think back.</span> <span id="s1897">I built one of the guys a lamp out of wood.</span> <span id="s1898">I made the frame and those things, and a tube to move.</span> <span id="s1899">A fantastic lamp with a table underneath.</span> <span id="s1900">I liked it myself.</span> <span id="s1901">I’m not a carpenter, it probably was pretty raw, but it was a lamp, and it worked!</span> <span id="s1902">Well, another guy came, but the guy never treated me nice.</span> <span id="s1903">He hit me one time and I told him, “I’m not going to make you a lamp!”</span> <span id="s1904">When I think back -- the guts I had!</span> <span id="s1905">The guy threatened me after that and I decided I better start making him a lamp.</span> <span id="s1906">But the guts I had to tell the guy that, “I’m not going to make you the lamp.”</span> <span id="s1907">When I think back today, I sure must have felt pretty safe there.</span> <span id="s1908">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Can you describe any general feelings about human nature based on your experience, non-Jews, Germans, Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Human nature tells me that every nationality there’s some good and bad people.</span> <span id="s1911">Some of the example, the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s1912">I mentioned that one kapo as an example.</span> <span id="s1913">There were a lot of them like that.</span> <span id="s1914">We had in another unit -- where I told you the guy with the wooden leg was in the Wehrmacht -- they had a guy by the name of Glazer who was a commando leader.</span> <span id="s1915">He really knew how to run it.</span> <span id="s1916">The Germans thought that he’s the toughest guy against the rest of the Jews, because when he was out there, they built his authority.</span> <span id="s1917">“Yes, Mr. Glazer.</span> <span id="s1918">Yes, Mr. Glazer.”</span> <span id="s1919">But when at night they caught one time a couple guys stealing chicken from this transport that came, instead of going to report them to the camp, which would have cost them their life, they said, ‘We’ll tell Glazer!”</span> <span id="s1920">That’s how Glazer built himself a position.</span> <span id="s1921">“We’ll tell Glazer,” And they used to go to Glazer and the first thing Glazer would do, he’d give them a slap in the face!</span> <span id="s1922">He said, “When you get back in the camp you’re going to get the rest.”</span> <span id="s1923">But then at night, they would take the chicken home and eat them together.</span> <span id="s1924">He was a born leader.</span> <span id="s1925">He built himself the authority, that the Germans think he’s really tough, when he was not.</span> <span id="s1926">Now that guy we had, that kapo, he was just plain tough.</span> <span id="s1927">So there again, people are different.</span> <span id="s1928">Human nature is hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Do you believe that films and books about the Holocaust accurately depict it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1931">I think they are some of them obviously probably a little tainted, but the facts are there.</span> <span id="s1932">The facts are absolutely there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Can you remember any of the books and films that you’ve read or seen that you think are worthwhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Me and my wife has a book there which is from Latvia, taken from German pictures of Europe.</span> <span id="s1935">They were showing scenes in Latvia where the Germans actually took pictures where the women are standing at the grave naked.</span> <span id="s1936">And you may have seen those pictures someplace.</span> <span id="s1937">This book is printed by the Russians!</span> <span id="s1938">They’ve sent it here, accusing some of the Latvians that live in the United States that they were part of this massacre.</span> <span id="s1939">And they have everything.</span> <span id="s1940">They’ve got the names and dates and everything on those people, but nothing is being done.</span> <span id="s1941">They don’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1942">Everything that has been said about it is true --– and a lot more that really hasn’t come out -- the most gruesome thing that history has ever written.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Anything else you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: All I can say, I’m fortunate that I’ve been alive.</span> <span id="s1945">I’ve had my years.</span> <span id="s1946">I had a couple of near misses, but I was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s1947">I’m sorry that my older brother didn’t survive with us.</span> <span id="s1948">The rest of the family, they were gone in 1941 already.</span> <span id="s1949">Lost about 40 members of the family in one day.</span> <span id="s1950">Uncles, aunts and they were just wiped out!</span> <span id="s1951">One of the uncles -- I don’t know how he was in the Kaiserwald camp, which was quite a lot later -- he was older, and he didn’t feel well, and he decided one day not to go to work.</span> <span id="s1952">He asked to be excused.</span> <span id="s1953">So they let him stay behind.</span> <span id="s1954">They took all the people that were there, they said, “You should go and clean up, go in the shower.’</span> <span id="s1955">So they went in the shower.</span> <span id="s1956">As they came out of the shower, they wrote down everybody’s number: “What’s your number?’</span> <span id="s1957">He didn’t know what it was for.</span> <span id="s1958">They decided to send them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1959">And by that time he knew it’s bad.</span> <span id="s1960">So he asked me, “Fred, what am I doing?”</span> <span id="s1961">He was a smart man, he was a very wealthy man, on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1962">And I said, “Uncle, the only thing you can do is, if they call your number, don’t walk out.”</span> <span id="s1963">We had numbers written on, not here, just written.</span> <span id="s1964">“Just don’t walk out.”</span> <span id="s1965">Well, they called the numbers.</span> <span id="s1966">There were several other guys.</span> <span id="s1967">They called his number.</span> <span id="s1968">He didn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1969">They called his number again, and a third and fourth time, and probably the fifth time.</span> <span id="s1970">In those minutes he must have lived five life times for fear.</span> <span id="s1971">Then finally he just decided to go out.</span> <span id="s1972">Walk out.</span> <span id="s1973">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1974">They sent him to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1975">He was gone.</span> <span id="s1976">Otherwise he would have shown up in America here, because he knew his brother was here.</span> <span id="s1977">Same with my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1978">He has a brother in New York.</span> <span id="s1979">I have his address.</span> <span id="s1980">He was a furrier, too.</span> <span id="s1981">Got married to an American girl.</span> <span id="s1982">He was lucky.</span> <span id="s1983">Here was this gal, a Polish girl, that came to Germany and she was not the best looking gal, but he was a best looking one.</span> <span id="s1984">He looked like a movie actor.</span> <span id="s1985">So she fell in love with him, and for him it was a passage to freedom.</span> <span id="s1986">They got married and he came to the United States and maybe she wasn’t so bad, because they’re still married, family.</span> <span id="s1987">And it was his ticket to freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">My sister was telling me that some people actually went and forged documents.</span> <span id="s1989">They “bought” somebody in an embassy.</span> <span id="s1990">I think it was a British embassy in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1991">They produced document that they own half a million pounds or something in a British bank.</span> <span id="s1992">Forged papers.</span> <span id="s1993">And after the thing was signed, they have seen those papers were destroyed, and these people were let out of Germany because Germany, in the beginning, let out a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1994">They wanted to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s1995">Actually wanted to get rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1996">It’s later on that they came and found out that they would never get rid of them unless it became a priority.</span> <span id="s1997">If they would have put all the people’s minds -- all their engineers, in that big nation, all the professors, that worked on the destruction of the Jews -- to work on the war effort, that would have helped them!</span> <span id="s1998">If they would have utilized the brains of the Jews that they actually chased out of the country or killed, they could have won!</span> <span id="s1999">They probably would have, too!</span> <span id="s2000">I just read about Ilse Meitner, here, who did part of the atomic bomb here, developing.</span> <span id="s2001">So many of these Jewish specialists -- Oppenheimer, Einstein -- all the people that just they gave away.</span> <span id="s2002">It’s all right for us.</span> <span id="s2003">Without the war, we wouldn’t have had an Israel.</span> <span id="s2004">I strongly believe that.</span> <span id="s2005">I think Israel would never have come to pass, if not that the sentiment of the whole world of the thing that had been done to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2006">And even then we barely made it!</span> <span id="s2007">We would have never been, had the vote, to take that piece of land and to make a country.</span> <span id="s2008">So for all what it is, maybe it has to happen in history.</span> <span id="s2009">We have, right next to my business where I was.</span> <span id="s2010">There’s a couple men out there, Scandinavians, and they are both religious, but the one guy is really a very true Christian, and he studies quite a bit there.</span> <span id="s2011">When the war started in 1967, and I was worried about what may happen to Israel, he used to come in every morning, he says, “Fred, I don’t know how you can worry.</span> <span id="s2012">If you would only read the Bible, if you’d trust –“ He really believes in the thing -- “It’s all there.”</span> <span id="s2013">He said, “You will not have any worries, because it says right clear that Israel will be big again, and grow, and be a country.”</span> <span id="s2014">The man is absolutely convinced.</span> <span id="s2015">He still talks today about it.</span> <span id="s2016">He says, “If I were a Jew I would never worry about it, because they’re here to stay.”</span> <span id="s2017">Good if a person can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">I met an awful lot of nice people in my life.</span> <span id="s2019">But I met plenty of sour ones, too.</span> <span id="s2020">I have friends, even, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2021">Really met them through our store.</span> <span id="s2022">One brought in the other one.</span> <span id="s2023">They had some parties.</span> <span id="s2024">There are a couple of them I don’t like to associate too much with them.</span> <span id="s2025">I don’t know them -- what they are in their heart.</span> <span id="s2026">They’re all very nice to me, but what they are in their heart -- But the majority of them are nice, honorable people.</span> <span id="s2027">Can’t keep them guilty for their parent country.</span> <span id="s2028">I ran into, one day, a Latvian by accident.</span> <span id="s2029">He was a realtor, he showed me houses one afternoon.</span> <span id="s2030">We’re looking for a house, and I found out he was from Latvia.</span> <span id="s2031">I had an accent.</span> <span id="s2032">He had hardly an accent but he was a baby when he came to this country.</span> <span id="s2033">And we started to talk about what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2034">I was interested in sounding him out.</span> <span id="s2035">He didn’t know a thing about it!</span> <span id="s2036">He said I opened his eyes.</span> <span id="s2037">He was really so interested.</span> <span id="s2038">He said, “After you tell me all those things, I understand what the Latvians did to the Jews.”</span> <span id="s2039">He said, “I understand why my parents never told me about it.”</span> <span id="s2040">I have told many of my Latvian customers in the store, “If the Germans did it, they came to Latvia as conquerors.</span> <span id="s2041">That was government-inspired anti-Semitism, a new anti-Semitism, to do the killing, on the programs of Hitler.”</span> <span id="s2042">He said, “But the Latvians never waited for the Germans to come.</span> <span id="s2043">They did it to their neighbors, to enrich themselves.</span> <span id="s2044">They just did it on their own.”</span> <span id="s2045">He said, “and only two kind, rats and people, kill their own kind.”</span> <span id="s2046">And I said, “The Latvians, I can only associate with rats.”</span> <span id="s2047">I used to tell many Latvians about it.</span> <span id="s2048">In the small towns in particular, they would kill the neighbors.</span> <span id="s2049">They would take their neighbors out in the woods, right in the first days, and massacre them down, so they could enrich themselves with a chair or a couch.</span> <span id="s2050">They did it.</span> <span id="s2051">Because the German army, as I mentioned before, they were in pursuit of the Russians at the beginning.</span> <span id="s2052">Later the Gestapo came and all those things, but in the beginning, there was not any of those destructive programs.</span> <span id="s2053">Was entirely done by the Latvians!</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">The massacre of the fall of ’41 -- that was inspired by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2055">There was a reason to it.</span> <span id="s2056">They made room for the German Jews.</span> <span id="s2057">They wanted to get out the German Jews, so the site of the ghetto Riga -- that’s where they would take them.</span> <span id="s2058">Germans -- we had a lot of them -- lived in Riga.</span> <span id="s2059">In order to make room for them, that’s why they killed our families.</span> <span id="s2060">Later became a German ghetto.</span> <span id="s2061">And the German ghetto is like a home away from home.</span> <span id="s2062">They had a police officer.</span> <span id="s2063">A German police, Jewish police officer in there.</span> <span id="s2064">The Germans used police, and they were buddy-buddy with the Gestapo out there -- not that they were denouncing, but if they could do it to save themselves, they could denounce the Latvians very good.</span> <span id="s2065">They were on top.</span> <span id="s2066">They thought they were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">As a matter of fact, I read a book by a German lady who came to the ghetto of Riga’s.</span> <span id="s2068">she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s2069">She said that when they came to Riga, they thought nothing would happen to them because why would they have killed the Latvian Jew in order to bring the German Jews in?</span> <span id="s2070">Because they want the German Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s2071">Because they’re Germans after all.</span> <span id="s2072">That was her comment.</span> <span id="s2073">But she said, “Then later, some transports came, and right at the railroad station, they sorted them out, and half of them were killed right away.”</span> <span id="s2074">She said, “Then we thought we’re not so safe, either.”</span> <span id="s2075">She wrote a very good book.</span> <span id="s2076">I forgot the name of it.</span> <span id="s2077">For what people really could experience in a camp, you have to read the book by Martin Grey For Those I Loved.</span> <span id="s2078">You ever get hold of this story about a man that went through the real camp -- Auschwitz and other camps.</span> <span id="s2079">This man did.</span> <span id="s2080">I had a picnic if you read the stories that this man went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Another story.</span> <span id="s2082">We all used to do it occasionally where we worked there – we tried to get a piece of bread, something on the side.</span> <span id="s2083">Well, this guy was a little bit more careless than most of us.</span> <span id="s2084">He had a little fur collar which he got in the ghetto or from his wife -- it fits on the coat -- and he traded that fur collar in for some food.</span> <span id="s2085">He got something for it.</span> <span id="s2086">But the woman he traded with, somebody in an apartment up there, she just happened to be the wife of a Latvian policeman who was a super-duper anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s2087">So when she told him that, he said, “Where did you get it?”</span> <span id="s2088">She said, “I got it from a Jew down there who works…” The guy went and reported this to the military police.</span> <span id="s2089">In Germany they had these “chindogs,” they used to call them.</span> <span id="s2090">They had a great big metal shield here in front.</span> <span id="s2091">And fortunate for all of us this officer in the military police happened to know this staff sergeant, Rehren was his name.</span> <span id="s2092">He called him up.</span> <span id="s2093">He said, “My God.</span> <span id="s2094">Carl -- how the hell do you let the Jews all alone to roam around in the house there?”</span> <span id="s2095">“They’re supposed to be under guard!</span> <span id="s2096">You can get in trouble for it.”</span> <span id="s2097">He didn’t report it.</span> <span id="s2098">They dropped the case.</span> <span id="s2099">Lucky for that guy, because he would have been in trouble.</span> <span id="s2100">Now this Rehren calls all six of us up in the office at the university.</span> <span id="s2101">He said, “One of you guys traded in a collar in the building where I live.</span> <span id="s2102">I want you to go out and the guilty one to come back in.”</span> <span id="s2103">Well when we walked out, we all looked at each other.</span> <span id="s2104">At one time or another we had all done something.</span> <span id="s2105">We looked at David Shapiro, because we knew the guy’s careless.</span> <span id="s2106">Sure enough, he said, “Yes, I did it.”</span> <span id="s2107">He thought maybe I’ll help him.</span> <span id="s2108">So he said, ‘”Come in with me.”</span> <span id="s2109">I said, “okay.”</span> <span id="s2110">So we knocked on the door, came in and he said, “Oberstafuhrer, I was the one.”</span> <span id="s2111">He said, “I know that.</span> <span id="s2112">I just wanted to see if you’re going to report yourself.</span> <span id="s2113">They described you to me, so I knew exactly.</span> <span id="s2114">I talked to the woman.</span> <span id="s2115">I knew it was you.”</span> <span id="s2116">“David,” he said, “I wanted to let you know what I said.</span> <span id="s2117">I saw you one day standing at the gate.</span> <span id="s2118">I knew you were waiting for somebody to meet.</span> <span id="s2119">I saw you another day out there, standing there.</span> <span id="s2120">I acted like I don’t see you because you were on the premises.</span> <span id="s2121">You were careless and dumb!</span> <span id="s2122">But I want you to know one thing, David.</span> <span id="s2123">You should remember one thing, that in the house where you eat, you don’t crap.”</span> <span id="s2124">In other words, if you have to do it, do it somewhere else, but I’m not getting involved.</span> <span id="s2125">He was so right about it.</span> <span id="s2126">Now here was a case where they played it down.</span> <span id="s2127">He played his luck.</span> <span id="s2128">He got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Another episode.</span> <span id="s2130">We went out one time to the country for some firewood.</span> <span id="s2131">We always traded some stuff in.</span> <span id="s2132">One lieutenant or stafuhrer -- corporal -- went along.</span> <span id="s2133">He wanted to trade something.</span> <span id="s2134">But this guy was a black marketer.</span> <span id="s2135">He brought along army boots, gasoline, stuff which -- treacherous.</span> <span id="s2136">He stayed in a little town before we dropped him off.</span> <span id="s2137">We went for our wood, and we came back.</span> <span id="s2138">We picked him up.</span> <span id="s2139">He was sitting there with a box this size and about this high -- huge box.</span> <span id="s2140">Sitting on the highway with his feet dangling down from the box waiting for us.</span> <span id="s2141">The box was full with food.</span> <span id="s2142">Nailed shut.</span> <span id="s2143">We loaded the box up there on the truck.</span> <span id="s2144">A woman comes running up, she said, “I think the military police knows about it.</span> <span id="s2145">Somebody reported it that this guy’s sitting out there.”</span> <span id="s2146">Now my driver gets scared, because once they get caught, on the front, you know.</span> <span id="s2147">So he tried to take a side road.</span> <span id="s2148">He did not know that, you had to go through one point which was called Mittau and there’s a military police station there.</span> <span id="s2149">If they got called, they’ll wait for it.</span> <span id="s2150">So we drive up the side roads, and about a mile off the side road, the axle breaks on the truck.</span> <span id="s2151">Now they get panicky.</span> <span id="s2152">So they go to a farmhouse nearby and they call this Rehren, Oberstafuhrer, and tell him their problems, to ask him to send out a car so that they can go back to town.</span> <span id="s2153">They want to get away from this scene, and who will be left is the driver of the car!</span> <span id="s2154">Suppose the police comes and they ask him, he’ll say, “I don’t know from nothing.</span> <span id="s2155">I wasn’t here, the Jews were here.”</span> <span id="s2156">There were the two of us, myself and my brother.</span> <span id="s2157">Lucky for us.</span> <span id="s2158">Told you I had luck.</span> <span id="s2159">The guys sent me up the road, because we are on a side road.</span> <span id="s2160">They sent me to walk up to that road after an hour or so to meet the car, because the guy would never find us if we’re on the side road to that main road.</span> <span id="s2161">I walked, but evidently I didn’t think about it, and we started too late, or a regular car is faster than a truck.</span> <span id="s2162">When I got to the corner he had passed the crossing, and he went out to the farmhouse where we used to go.</span> <span id="s2163">He couldn’t find us out there and decided, “To hell with them.”</span> <span id="s2164">He ate dinner and he stayed overnight at the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s2165">Our luck!</span> <span id="s2166">Because this evening, the military police shows up at the farmhouse, the SS.</span> <span id="s2167">If we would have been there, we would have been caught.</span> <span id="s2168">This way the two Germans were there.</span> <span id="s2169">The one guy says right away to me, we’re going to the barn, they have meantime buried it in the barn.</span> <span id="s2170">I didn’t even know where it was, but there was out in the field a huge barn, and they said there was a pile of straw in the back where you walk in to the left of the gate.</span> <span id="s2171">It’s covered there!</span> <span id="s2172">But they had a lot of bundles on the truck, and half-a-dozen or more of them, bundles were ours.</span> <span id="s2173">They belonged to us.</span> <span id="s2174">That they put into another pile on the back of there, under the straw.</span> <span id="s2175">“Now,” he says, ”When you come in the barn, you go to the left, and tell them that box, that’s yours.”</span> <span id="s2176">So the other driver was smart enough.</span> <span id="s2177">He’s the kid that told me about the shooting of the people.</span> <span id="s2178">He said, “How can we tell them that we didn’t know any bit?</span> <span id="s2179">How can we permit the Jews, they’re supposed to be under supervision, that they can trade all the stuff and we don’t know anything about it?”</span> <span id="s2180">The guy finally saw how it really was.</span> <span id="s2181">So he didn’t even wait for me to do anything.</span> <span id="s2182">He just walked up there to the box and said, “That’s where it is.”</span> <span id="s2183">They never found the bundles.</span> <span id="s2184">They looked for the box.</span> <span id="s2185">They opened it up, and I thought, “This is the end of us.”</span> <span id="s2186">“Now we got a nice dinner,” he said -- that German to the Latvian policeman.</span> <span id="s2187">They took him along, but our big boss -- this high ranking officer -- had so much influence that he didn’t want to have a mark against his unit.</span> <span id="s2188">They turned him over for punishment to him.</span> <span id="s2189">And all he gave him is six weeks of telephone duty at night.</span> <span id="s2190">So we got away.</span></p> <p><span
