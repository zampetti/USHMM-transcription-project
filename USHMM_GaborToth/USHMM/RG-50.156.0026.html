id="s41">Q: What events were you aware of in the mid-1930s, local, national international?</span> <span id="s42">You knew about the Nazi party in Germany, but how much attention were you paying to what was going on before they marched into Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, in 1936 I was in Hashomer Hatzair.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Which is…</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: This is Mapai.</span> <span id="s46">And I went to the camp, the Hachshara.</span> <span id="s47">I went there two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I was in Tomaszow…Charobyaszow, Zamoszh, Ludmir and Chelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Now for the tape, everybody doesn’t know, describe a Hachshara.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, we used to work.</span> <span id="s52">I used to work in a bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q; I mean, basically, it’s where you learn how to be a farming community?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: A kibbutz.</span> <span id="s55">This was Kibbutz-Artzi.</span> <span id="s56">This was different.</span> <span id="s57">This was a different kibbutz, they were more on the Left in Palestine.</span> <span id="s58">In Israel, Kibbutz-Artzi, Hapoel Hamizrachi, they are the first kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s59">They are very rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And you say your sister was a Zionist?</span> <span id="s61">Wouldn’t you say that you were a Zionist, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Well, sure I was.</span> <span id="s63">I wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s64">In 1936 was my last year.</span> <span id="s65">I was called for the Polish army and then I went for 18 months to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Was everybody being drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Not everybody.</span> <span id="s68">But I was drafted.</span> <span id="s69">I was 18 months in the army and I came back from the army and I wanted to go back to the same kibbutz, but my kibbutz wasn’t anymore.</span> <span id="s70">All my people, they all emigrated to Palestine.</span> <span id="s71">And they told me I should go to a different kibbutz.</span> <span id="s72">I didn’t want to, so I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And so you missed your chance to go with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s75">I was in the army!</span> <span id="s76">And all the Bocherim and the Bocherot (comrades), they went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s77">So the organization, Hashomer Hatzair, they told me I should go in a kibbutz, but my kibbutz wasn’t there, and I didn’t want to go anymore.</span> <span id="s78">So that’s why I didn’t go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What did you do then?</span> <span id="s80">You said you’d worked in a bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: While I was in kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: so afterwards, then, when you came back from the army…</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I was very musical.</span> <span id="s84">In kibbutz I organized and we were playing theater.</span> <span id="s85">And I organized a chorale.</span> <span id="s86">We were singing, and the last day in kibbutz, we played theater.</span> <span id="s87">This was in Kubriczow.</span> <span id="s88">And in the morning I went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So then when you came back, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: When I came back I went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I was in the leather business.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So then you weren’t really paying that much attention to what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, it’s only ’37.</span> <span id="s95">This started in ’39.</span> <span id="s96">In 1939 I went in front, against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You were called back in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A; I was on the front line, in the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: So they had Jews, then, in the Polish army, fighting against the Germans when the Germans invaded Poland?</span> <span id="s100">Then this does make part of the answer to the next question very obvious.</span> <span id="s101">The next question is: In what setting or settings did you have contact with gentiles?</span> <span id="s102">Did your family do business with gentiles?</span> <span id="s103">Did you ever have gentiles in your home?</span> <span id="s104">Well, obviously, you were in the army with gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: I was with Jews, and I was in there with gentiles.</span> <span id="s106">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And did you have gentile friends that came to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah, a lot.</span> <span id="s109">We used to live in a small town, in a very small town.</span> <span id="s110">My father, the whole business was with the gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s113">He was buying grain.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Like a wholesaler?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How much anti-Semitism did you experience, say, in your small town, in the army…</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, in the army was the first.</span> <span id="s118">When we came for our recruit, the captain took us in a separate room.</span> <span id="s119">He wanted to find out how the brain is working.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You mean, Jews might be different from gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">We were together with gentiles.</span> <span id="s123">They gave us a book to go around with, and usually the Jewish boys, they used to have the best…</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Scores on the test?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: So the captain came back and he said to us, “I’m not able to take you on the school,” the officers’ school.</span> <span id="s126">Why?</span> <span id="s127">We are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Jews could not be officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No.</span> <span id="s130">In case you were a doctor or something, then you could be an officer.</span> <span id="s131">A plain Jew, you wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s132">If you were in first class, or you did something good, then you could get like a couple of…(gestures at chest.)</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Ribbons?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s135">But not from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s137">And so you were with non-Jews all the time.</span> <span id="s138">You were aware though, of anti-Semitism, because like you said, you couldn’t become an officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Well, even when I went to the public school it was anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s140">Before Easter you couldn’t go outside.</span> <span id="s141">They used to throw water on you, even when I was a small boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: This was just little kids picking on other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Not picking on other kids.</span> <span id="s144">This came from what the Pope, last time, mentioned…the Jews has got something to do with Jesus.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So they learned this?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Sure, this is everything from the middle out of what came…that the Jews killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s147">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You must have had a very large family.</span> <span id="s149">You had not only eight brothers and sisters, but you had lots of aunts, uncles, cousins.</span> <span id="s150">Did they live in the same community you lived in?</span> <span id="s151">Or were they in other parts of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, one sister went in 1927 to Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s153">After World War II when I was liberated, I found her.</span> <span id="s154">The first time I went in 1936.</span> <span id="s155">And I didn’t see her 40 years, and now she passed away, in 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: And she married and has six children.</span> <span id="s158">And I am going every year to see the nephews and nieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: But your parents, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles of yours…</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Everything is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: But they were all in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s163">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So then when the war broke out, when the Germans attacked Poland, you were already 26 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, when the Germans attacked Poland, I was in the army.</span> <span id="s166">This was on the 15th September, 1939.</span> <span id="s167">(Transcriber note: the German army attacked Poland September 1, 1939) I was on the first front.</span> <span id="s168">We were fighting only two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What did you do in the army?</span> <span id="s170">You were a gunner, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yeah, I was a special shooter, a big gun.</span> <span id="s172">I used to go on the front line.</span> <span id="s173">They used to have -- not cars, you know -- specially made bikes.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: These were big guns on wheels?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, my gun was hung up in a frame, made special.</span> <span id="s176">My gun was hanging.</span> <span id="s177">And I used to carry about 40 to 50 kilos.</span> <span id="s178">That’s a hundred-pound pack on my shoulder -- and the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: With the ammunition and everything too?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And you had a special bike.</span> <span id="s182">This was alright when you were on the road, but what happened if you had to go across the fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, I didn’t leave the bike.</span> <span id="s184">If I wouldn’t have the bike, I wouldn’t live an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Was it a motor bike, or a pedal bike?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: A pedal bike, not a motor bike.</span> <span id="s187">So I was two weeks fighting.</span> <span id="s188">Then we saw that we lost, and I threw everything away and I ran away.</span> <span id="s189">I didn’t want to go to Jail, to Germany.</span> <span id="s190">So I came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Why did you not want to go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well, they picked right away the Jews.</span> <span id="s193">I didn’t want that they should pick me up, I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s194">Then when I ran away, I went with a friend and we took two horses and a buggy, and we were going.</span> <span id="s195">We went in a church and a priest gave us uniforms, me a uniform, my friend a uniform, we should go and the Germans they should not catch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Not a priest’s uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, a priest’s uniform.</span> <span id="s198">Two old uniforms.</span> <span id="s199">So we went.</span> <span id="s200">The Germans, they didn’t catch us, and we went to a town in Galicia.</span> <span id="s201">It’s called Tarnhof.</span> <span id="s202">So came a Polack and told us -- we were freezing -- we should go with him and drink coffee.</span> <span id="s203">We went to him and we lay down in the barn where the straw was.</span> <span id="s204">In the Old Country, usually the older farmers, they used to come in the market.</span> <span id="s205">So we came to Lienszut, we came in the market and so he was begging us that we should go.</span> <span id="s206">We lay down to sleep in the barn, and then he came to the barn and he said, “You’re gonna freeze in there.</span> <span id="s207">Why don’t you come in the kitchen?’</span> <span id="s208">so we went in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s209">I was together with a friend, with a Polack.</span> <span id="s210">He wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s211">And he said to me, “ Felix, don’t go.</span> <span id="s212">Don’t go.</span> <span id="s213">We are warm, we are laying here on the ground and we are covered.</span> <span id="s214">Don’t go in the kitchen.’</span> <span id="s215">So I said,” What the hell, come on in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s216">So we went in the kitchen, and this same Polack, he “stole the boat,” he stole from us the horses!</span> <span id="s217">In the night time we were asleep in the kitchen and he stole the horses.</span> <span id="s218">So we didn’t have with what to go.</span> <span id="s219">At this time the Germans used to “unload” everything from the Jewish houses, from the factories, from everything, and they sent this to Germany.</span> <span id="s220">So I went on a train like this and I went home.</span> <span id="s221">I was traveling 200 miles, about four, five days.</span> <span id="s222">So I came home where my parents used to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So now it was two weeks, the war was over, you had gotten home.</span> <span id="s224">What was going on in the community?</span> <span id="s225">There were a few Jews in this little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, it wasn’t a few Jews, it was about a hundred families.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: In a town how big?</span> <span id="s228">Was this maybe a third of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes, I would say about a third of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And what were the Jews saying at this point?</span> <span id="s231">What things were going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: This time they start right away.</span> <span id="s233">The Germans start taking us to different kinds of work.</span> <span id="s234">Between the Jews they organized a Judenrat, and the Judenrat was responsible that we should go every morning to work.</span> <span id="s235">And they didn’t pay us nothing for this.</span> <span id="s236">We worked every day.</span> <span id="s237">I used to work on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s238">And I lost my right eye at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: How did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well, the German guy, he was playing around where we cut steel wires.</span> <span id="s241">He took a wire, and he was playing like a bird.</span> <span id="s242">He was going around like this…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Spinning around his head?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Spinning around and it went in my eye.</span> <span id="s245">Then I went right away into Cracow.</span> <span id="s246">We used to wear the Star of David already.</span> <span id="s247">We couldn’t go by train.</span> <span id="s248">Well, anyway, I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s249">One Jewish policeman -- at this time was already Jewish police -- he went with me to Cracow to the Lazar hospital and they operated.</span> <span id="s250">The doctor -- a Jewish doctor -- told me.</span> <span id="s251">“Well, we could save your eye, but at this time it’s not allowed.</span> <span id="s252">You don’t know what’s going to be, so it’s better to be taken out.”</span> <span id="s253">I still can remember the doctors.</span> <span id="s254">One was Meirovsky and the other doctor was Schell.</span> <span id="s255">I don’t know how many days I was in the hospital in Cracow.</span> <span id="s256">I haven’t got my right eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So that’s an artificial eye?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: That’s an artificial eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: But the other eye is okay.</span> <span id="s260">You can see alright?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s262">This was in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did your family talk at all about trying to escape?</span> <span id="s264">I mean, where was there to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: No.</span> <span id="s266">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s267">From our town, I don’t know even one family that was so smart that they started thinking what’s going to be, and to…Well, it’s a fact, when I was in the Polish army, when that captain came to us and said, “We are not fighting any more, everyone should go on his own,” this was in Tomaszow and I wasn’t too far to go to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s268">But I wanted to go home and see my family.</span> <span id="s269">That’s why I came home, and that’s what started the whole trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So there you were, working.</span> <span id="s271">Every day the Judenrat would call you out and assign you to these jobs.</span> <span id="s272">That’s men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Women they took to a different city, to Cracow.</span> <span id="s274">They picked up a lot of young girls from our town and they took them about 80 miles into Cracow, and they used to work on the airport.</span> <span id="s275">They used to do a different kind of work for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Now were your sisters over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Not my sisters.</span> <span id="s278">My niece was over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Did you have any contact, any communication?</span> <span id="s280">Did you know what was happening with her/</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes, I was in contact.</span> <span id="s282">She saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Shall we talk about that now?</span> <span id="s284">Or was that several years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, this was the whole thing.</span> <span id="s286">I was home and she came home.</span> <span id="s287">The pilot came with them, with all the girls, to this town.</span> <span id="s288">They wanted to see all the parents, if they’re still all alive.</span> <span id="s289">So my niece heard that that’s going to be the second “selection,’ and she said, “Uncle, you better start to run away.</span> <span id="s290">Don’t wait until they’re going to come and take you.</span> <span id="s291">And when you’re going to run away, you come over there on the airport.”</span> <span id="s292">She used to work for a German guy where he was like a boss.</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">He used to raise tomatoes.</span> <span id="s295">And she was a nice little girl.</span> <span id="s296">He was stealing tomatoes, and he made a little hole by the fence and he sent her every day out to his home with the tomatoes.</span> <span id="s297">So she told me where the hole is, and it happened like this.</span> <span id="s298">They came, the Germans, to start taking everyone, so I ran away and came there, and went through this hole in the airport in Cracow.</span> <span id="s299">And she told me there’s going to be “companies,” with Jewish people working for German companies.</span> <span id="s300">I went and I saw Jewish boys working, and the boss came over and he asked what I wanted.</span> <span id="s301">So the boys, they told him I want to work, So that boss, the German boss, he said, “Let him come after lunch.”</span> <span id="s302">So I came after lunch, and he registered me, so I was already a free man.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So you were a worker.</span> <span id="s304">You were accepted.</span> <span id="s305">Was this leather work?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s307">I worked all kinds of work on this airport.</span> <span id="s308">And then I met a good friend, he was working in a different place where they made brick.</span> <span id="s309">You know, they build houses with.</span> <span id="s310">So I went over there.</span> <span id="s311">And I read in the paper that to Poland used to come a doctor from Germany -- I used to have a hole where the eye should be -- and my name is Kaminsky, it’s a Polish name, so I took a risk.</span> <span id="s312">I took off my Star of David from my arm, and I went to the hospital and told them my name and everything.</span> <span id="s313">So he made me right away a prosthesis.</span> <span id="s314">Then I was really free.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: You mean you didn’t have an identity card that you had to show, that all the officials would always ask to look at?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: This time was no identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Or a ration card, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s319">He was thinking, I’m not Jewish, I’m a Polack.</span> <span id="s320">My hair wasn’t grey, you know, and I used to wear a hat like the Polacks, and I came with the boots in.</span> <span id="s321">So when I was talking Polish to him he made me an artificial eye, right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: So if you didn’t wear your yellow star, they didn’t do any checking up on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Well, before I came to this, was a lot of things.</span> <span id="s324">Before I came to Cracow when my niece told me I should come, I went with the train.</span> <span id="s325">And all of a sudden, somebody said to me, “Halt!”</span> <span id="s326">A Polack recognized that I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s327">Not a German, a Polack.</span> <span id="s328">And so he stopped me and he started to talk to me in Polish.</span> <span id="s329">He asked me if I’m a Jew and I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s330">He said he’s going to call the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s331">I don’t know where the words were coming to me, but I said, “What are you going to have?</span> <span id="s332">Alright, you’re going to call the Gestapo, the Gestapo’s going to take me, they’re going to finish me up.</span> <span id="s333">Now what are you going to have from this?”</span> <span id="s334">“Well, I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s335">And he said, “Run away!</span> <span id="s336">Go from my eyes, I should not see any more!”</span> <span id="s337">And that’s the time my niece told me I should come to the airport through this hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So then after you got your artificial eye you came back to… A; Then I was free.</span> <span id="s339">Then I could go anyplace!</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Then you put your yellow star back on again?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No, I didn’t put on the yellow star.</span> <span id="s342">When they took us out from the houses, this time I was with my whole family, with all the Jewish people in the place called Slomit, and I had no eye.</span> <span id="s343">I used to wear a patch, like Moshe Dayan.</span> <span id="s344">Right away they took the older people, hell, they shot ‘em, and we saw that, everything.</span> <span id="s345">And then the young people they picked up to work.</span> <span id="s346">So then they were going around, seeing that they didn’t make any mistakes, so I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s347">.</span> <span id="s348">So I took down this black thing from my eye and I took a handkerchief and I started wiping my eye as if maybe something is in it, and so I went through the “selection.”</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What happened to the rest of your family, and when?</span> <span id="s350">Were your parents taken quite early?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Well, my mother, she died in 1942.</span> <span id="s352">When the Germans chased out all the Jews from home, from the town, they hired all the farmers.</span> <span id="s353">They were staying on the road.</span> <span id="s354">It was young and old, older people, young people, they separated us.</span> <span id="s355">They took the older people.</span> <span id="s356">We were thinking it’s the older people they’re going to put on the wagons, or they would not be able to go.</span> <span id="s357">No they didn’t.</span> <span id="s358">The younger people only they put on the horses and buggies, and they took us, I don’t know how many miles.</span> <span id="s359">Then we heard it.</span> <span id="s360">The Jewish police came back -- the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s361">We were wondering what happened to all our parents, so the Jewish police told us what happened.</span> <span id="s362">They all went through the town, and they told them they should run.</span> <span id="s363">And they started to run, and they shot, right away, in the back, and the head, and they threw them over the bank.</span> <span id="s364">And then the Polacks came with the wagons, and they put everybody in and they went to a forest called Wimirhof, and they buried over there the whole community, the rabbi and everybody.</span> <span id="s365">My family was there.</span> <span id="s366">One from my family was over there about three years ago and he made a memorial.</span> <span id="s367">This was a hundred Jews, close by Meirhof.</span> <span id="s368">It’s a big memorial.</span> <span id="s369">And it’s a fact, the Polacks, they were watching this.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Were you still together with your sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No.</span> <span id="s372">My sister when she was eight months pregnant, they took her right away to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s373">And this was the place they took the other sister -- she wasn’t married -- and then another sister who had two children.</span> <span id="s374">They were all taken to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s375">The two children, they are alive in Brazil.</span> <span id="s376">My niece who didn’t survive, she was on this ship -- they asked President Roosevelt to save the ship -- and the Germans drowned the ship.</span> <span id="s377">I think this was in ’45.</span> <span id="s378">She was a young girl, about 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So then you were in the factory at the airport with the Luftwaffen, working.</span> <span id="s380">How long did this last?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s382">About a year.</span> <span id="s383">Then one time came two big semi-trucks and they were loading us.</span> <span id="s384">We didn’t know where they’re going to take us.</span> <span id="s385">The driver, he was a Polack, when he was driving with us, he was laughing as we were going.</span> <span id="s386">I don’t know how many people were on this truck -- about 80 -- and he said, “We are going to Our Father.”</span> <span id="s387">So we were thinking they’re going to shoot us someplace.</span> <span id="s388">Then they took us to Schindler.</span> <span id="s389">This was a factory in Cracow on Lipova 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: What was the approximate date when you came to Schindler?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I think this was in ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: You say there were 80 of you who were on this big semi?</span> <span id="s393">Did you know why you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s395">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s396">When the driver told us we are going to Our Father, everybody was thinking we are finished!</span> <span id="s397">And all of a sudden we came in this factory, and we saw this tall man.</span> <span id="s398">He was a beautiful tall man, this Schindler.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You met Oscar Schindler?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Sure, I was his best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Can you describe him for us?</span> <span id="s402">Tell me some more about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Then I started working over there.</span> <span id="s404">When I came there was a lot of Polacks, they used to work in the factory.</span> <span id="s405">But they used to go out.</span> <span id="s406">The Jewish people, we used to have barracks, and after we finished in the factory, we used to go home to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Now there was a men’s barracks and a women’s barracks.</span> <span id="s408">There were women working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s410">Well, no.</span> <span id="s411">It was separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What kind of factory was it?</span> <span id="s413">What were you making?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Pots and pans, metal.</span> <span id="s415">I used to work in the factory for metal.</span> <span id="s416">I done on the machine.</span> <span id="s417">And then all of a sudden -- then was a big kitchen.</span> <span id="s418">The Polacks, they used to eat lunch, he used to give lunch to all the Polacks.</span> <span id="s419">We didn’t eat lunch.</span> <span id="s420">We used to have in camp, over there in the barracks, we used to have a kitchen.</span> <span id="s421">And all of the Polacks they used to eat in the factory.</span> <span id="s422">Those two cooks, Polacks, they were Jaska and Gala.</span> <span id="s423">I still remember their names.</span> <span id="s424">And then I met a Polish girl over there.</span> <span id="s425">She used to taking care for pigs what Schindler used to raise.</span> <span id="s426">He used to have a big yard, All the iron what went from the machines we used to load on train cars.</span> <span id="s427">This was going on a long time.</span> <span id="s428">But I was feeding the pigs and I was feeling good.</span> <span id="s429">And then he asked me, Schindler, do I know to raising geese.</span> <span id="s430">I said, “Sure, I know how to raise ‘em.”</span> <span id="s431">So he bought geese and I was raising geese and feeding the geese with -- not with corn -- grain.</span> <span id="s432">And then usually used to come the whole bunch from Plaschau, from Jerusalemsky, Goett and Jung.</span> <span id="s433">All the whole bunch they used to come and visit him.</span> <span id="s434">He was bigger, he was an Obersturmbahnfuhrer, Schindler.</span> <span id="s435">He told me the geese they will use when they will be fat.</span> <span id="s436">One time he told me that I should kill about ten, there’s going to be a big party.</span> <span id="s437">So I killed about ten geese and took two boys and two women from the barracks, and they helped me clean them, the feathers.</span> <span id="s438">And there was a big party over there by Schindler, the whole bunch, the big shots from Plaschau.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now Schindler didn’t wear a uniform.</span> <span id="s440">He was not part of the…</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No, he was wearing a suit like I was.</span> <span id="s442">We cut the geese and everything, and he heard it, at the party -- Jung was drunk, a little guy with such a big belly -- and he wanted shooting somebody from us.</span> <span id="s443">So Schindler came to us and he said, “Run away!</span> <span id="s444">Leave everything and run away!”</span> <span id="s445">So we run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Went back and hid in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s448">We run away in the barracks and that’s it.</span> <span id="s449">In the morning I come back -- I used to have a lot of meat, geese -- and took everything to the barracks for the women, for the boys, and give it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: How were the pigs doing, though?</span> <span id="s451">Were they getting enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: The “pigs” was one pig.</span> <span id="s453">I fed her so she couldn’t stay on her legs!</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Did he have a whole big farm there?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, this wasn’t a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Just a little garden and a few animals?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: It wasn’t a garden.</span> <span id="s458">This was on a different yard.</span> <span id="s459">We used to load all the iron that was from the pots and pans, they used to load from the barracks.</span> <span id="s460">The Jewish boys used to load.</span> <span id="s461">And this went someplace else, the iron.</span> <span id="s462">And then -- I don’t know how long I was over there -- we heard, it was already about ’45, the situation is no good.</span> <span id="s463">We gonna go to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Now wait.</span> <span id="s465">The situation was not good?</span> <span id="s466">You mean the Germans by now were losing the war, the Russians were coming…</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, they’re coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s468">He wants to liquidate the factory here in Poland.</span> <span id="s469">We went to Himmler and said he has to have the same Jews that have experience with this kind of work.</span> <span id="s470">Other men and the ladies, they used to work in a different factory, ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Were you making ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Not me.</span> <span id="s473">The whole was 1,100 people, 400 women and 700 men.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Because in the book, Schindler’s List, the author says you made mess kits for the army, pots and pans, but he says that you never really made ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Made ammunition, too.</span> <span id="s476">And it came to the fact that he came back and he said that we are all going to a different place, to</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Sudetenland…Czechoslovakia…Sudetenland.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Which is where he was from.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">So there was a list from 1,100…400 women and 700 men.</span> <span id="s481">You know, even between Jews, there used to be a lot of bad Jews over there in Plaschau.</span> <span id="s482">Used to be a Matzle Goldberg, used to be a Kerel, used to be a Schmeling.</span> <span id="s483">Anyway, when Schindler made the list from all the 1,100, who should go to Sudetenland, we went to Germany, to Grossrosen.</span> <span id="s484">They took a lot of Jews from Plaschau, and we went together.</span> <span id="s485">The big shots like Matzle Coldberg, he was knowing the place we going was Brno, Brinitz.</span> <span id="s486">And everybody want to be by Schindler, so what he (Goldberg) done, he sold.</span> <span id="s487">From the other group he took two to change, took out somebody from Schindler and put in from the other group.</span> <span id="s488">He took for this two $20 gold pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So you could buy a place on Schindler’s list?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: They took me from the list.</span> <span id="s491">Well, Schindler didn’t know they start to sell to the other group, taking from out from our list.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: I didn’t know, but I found out, and I went to Schindler.</span> <span id="s494">This was in Grossrosen.</span> <span id="s495">I said, I am not on the list.</span> <span id="s496">They took me out from the list.</span> <span id="s497">And he said, “Where is that damn Jew?’</span> <span id="s498">and he took this Matzle Goldberg, and he said to him in German, “If you take that Jew’s name off the list, I’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s499">Then I went back, and I came to Sudetenland.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: You got back on the list.</span> <span id="s501">How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I found out.</span> <span id="s503">(Laughs) So I came to Brinitz.</span> <span id="s504">Then I went in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: You became a cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s507">I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s508">When I start to work, in the kitchen, was a lot of Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s509">They used to come with a different Sturmbahnfuhrer.</span> <span id="s510">His name was Leitputh, and he put them in the kitchen, too.</span> <span id="s511">So Schindler came in the kitchen, he throwed them out, and he put in our people.</span> <span id="s512">So I was in the kitchen the whole time until the liberation the 8th of May, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How many of you did he know personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: A lot of them.</span> <span id="s515">Before the liberation, for instance, he went to town and he bought horses for us.</span> <span id="s516">If he found out -- the big horses, the Belgian horses -- if he found out there’s a farmer, there’s a horse broke a leg, he went right away and he bought the horse and he brought it in the kitchen for us to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: You ate horsemeat?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: He bought for his money.</span> <span id="s519">We were lucky we used to have horsemeat!</span> <span id="s520">This is indescribable, what he did.</span> <span id="s521">And then he was knowing the war goes to the end, and he was a little bit afraid.</span> <span id="s522">In Sudetenland, in the same town, was a lot of linen-weaving factories.</span> <span id="s523">They used to make the best linen, like for sheets, the best in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s524">And he went around, I would say about four weeks before liberation, with big semi-trucks and he took out from all the factories all the materials.</span> <span id="s525">Material for men’s suits, all kinds of materials, he took to our place.</span> <span id="s526">He called us and we had a meeting in the factory with him and he said to us, “I wish this, that I should live through this whole thing like you’re gonna live.”</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Why did he think he might not live through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, he still was an Obersturmbahnfuhrer.</span> <span id="s529">Anyway, at the end, when the Russians came in, four boys went with him and they told the Russians what he done for us, and he was free.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: How did it happen, the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: We was waiting, and all of a sudden the Russians, they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: How did you know?</span> <span id="s533">You were waiting, you said.</span> <span id="s534">How did the word…</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: All of the Obersturmbahnfuhrers what used to be in Plaschau, they came to Schindler, to Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s536">We was thinking as they came, they’re going to finish us.</span> <span id="s537">And he was hiding ‘em under his shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: And you didn’t have radios or anything?</span> <span id="s539">It was just a rumor?</span> <span id="s540">You were guessing?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s542">all of a sudden in the morning we heard the Russian, they are here.</span> <span id="s543">They came in and gave us a whole day free and we can do with the Germans what we wanted.</span> <span id="s544">So we caught all the bad guys.</span> <span id="s545">We caught right away the Jews, the young guys what done bad, and they finished them right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: You did it yourselves then?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s548">Nobody done it to me, you know.</span> <span id="s549">Was a lot of people over there from Plaschau what used to have bad times.</span> <span id="s550">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s551">I was always lucky.</span> <span id="s552">I went with one eye in camp.</span> <span id="s553">I didn’t know what hunger is.</span> <span id="s554">And I gave people to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So what happened, then, after the war was over and you were liberated?</span> <span id="s556">Then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Schindler said, “You can take the materials, everything.</span> <span id="s558">How much do you want?</span> <span id="s559">It’s better you should take with you if you’re going to leave.</span> <span id="s560">The Russians are going to take, anyway!”</span> <span id="s561">So I filled up a big sack with all the materials.</span> <span id="s562">I wanted to go home, see whom I got, so I went to Cracow.</span> <span id="s563">I sold all the material so I got some money.</span> <span id="s564">I used to go with my wife, we used to know each other, but I didn’t get married.</span> <span id="s565">I didn’t find nobody in Cracow, so I came back to Sosnowiec, where my wife is from.</span> <span id="s566">I went through the street, and all of a sudden I saw her holding two little pots and pans, going to the committee for a little bit to eat!</span> <span id="s567">So I met her!</span> <span id="s568">She was with a cousin, staying in a relation’s house on Radomsky street, and I went over there.</span> <span id="s569">I was living over there.</span> <span id="s570">The cousins were very religious so they want I should get married right away.</span> <span id="s571">So January 27, 1946, I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: When did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I met her in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So then she wasn’t one of Schindler’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No.</span> <span id="s576">She wasn’t far.</span> <span id="s577">She was in Sudetenland, but I didn’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: How did she survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Over there in Sudetenland, the same thing, the Russians, they liberated her.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: But she was never in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: She was in camp.</span> <span id="s582">She was at a different company.</span> <span id="s583">Her company was Bausch.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So then she was a worker too.</span> <span id="s585">And you met her after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: After the war when I came back and I sold my stuff, I came back and I met her and we got married.</span> <span id="s587">It was the first wedding from the Holocaust people.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did you go back to your home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I went back.</span> <span id="s590">I bought turkeys for my wedding, in my home town.</span> <span id="s591">I didn’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s592">I heard a lot of people went back and the Polacks, they killed them.</span> <span id="s593">So I didn’t wanna go back.</span> <span id="s594">I bought the turkeys and we went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And there was nobody there?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Where were you living then?</span> <span id="s598">Were you in a displaced persons camp?</span> <span id="s599">Or were you just living in Cracow in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I wasn’t too long in Poland.</span> <span id="s601">I wanted to emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s602">The same thing my wife.</span> <span id="s603">She was sick, she couldn’t stay on her feet.</span> <span id="s604">She couldn’t even go to the chupah.</span> <span id="s605">We couldn’t emigrate to the United States from Poland, so we wanted to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s606">We smuggled into Germany through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s607">We came to a town where we have to go through the water in the nighttime.</span> <span id="s608">We paid this guy, that he should show us where the water should not be too deep.</span> <span id="s609">On this side were the Americans, and on this side was the Czechoslovakians.</span> <span id="s610">This was in February.</span> <span id="s611">We went in the water and my wife, she couldn’t stand in the water, and she started swimming, and my brother-in-law’s brother -- he passed away in Israel three years ago -- he caught her when he saw her start to swim and he was holding her until we went through the water and was going in the forest, in the snow.</span> <span id="s612">We went to a house and dried out, and we were already on the German side.</span> <span id="s613">We came to Bodenwaldhof.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What did you do there?</span> <span id="s615">How did you live?</span> <span id="s616">Who took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: What do you mean, how?</span> <span id="s618">(Laughs) I met people.</span> <span id="s619">I came to Munich.</span> <span id="s620">Before I came, my wife found a sister, with two children, in Lanzberg, Memmingen, in Germany.</span> <span id="s621">She lost her husband in camp.</span> <span id="s622">She met a cousin, and the cousin used to have a sister in France, so she decided to go to France.</span> <span id="s623">I remember I was one day by my sister-in-law where she used to live, and in the morning she packed and she went.</span> <span id="s624">I was a child when my sister went to Argentina in 1927 and I didn’t remember the address.</span> <span id="s625">Usually in the Old Country they used to have addresses written down on a Jewish book on the table.</span> <span id="s626">So I was laying in bed, and when I woke up, all of a sudden I remember!</span> <span id="s627">I had an address for my sister!</span> <span id="s628">At this time from Germany it didn’t went the mail, so in the morning I said to my sister-in-law, “Anna, I know that from France the mail goes already all over.’</span> <span id="s629">So I give her the address and she wrote to her a letter that I’m alive, and all of a sudden came back a letter from my sister that she is alive.</span> <span id="s630">The first time I went there was in 1966.</span> <span id="s631">So I came to Munich, and I was in Munich, I think about eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: And you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I used to have a little store, selling different shtick, American stuff -- coffee and cigarettes and this and that.</span> <span id="s634">And I lived private.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Then you knew German too?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Sure I knew German.</span> <span id="s637">Every Jew knows German.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: What was it like living in a German city, as a Jew, right after World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: At this time the German was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did they know you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s642">I used to live by a German.</span> <span id="s643">He was even a Nazi!</span> <span id="s644">The Jewish Committee got me the apartment.</span> <span id="s645">I didn’t pay nothing.</span> <span id="s646">At this time they used to be afraid of a Jew over there.</span> <span id="s647">He was happy that a Jew lives by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: So you lived there for eight years while you were waiting to get your visa to come to the United States?</span> <span id="s649">It took you all this time, planning to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: It took a long time until I got all the papers.</span> <span id="s651">I went through Hanover and I came with a G.I. ship to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: This was already, then, ’54?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: In 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So then you came to New York.</span> <span id="s655">What did you do then?</span> <span id="s656">You and your wife came together; did you have any children yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: My son was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s658">He was four years old when I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So you came to New York, and here you are in this strange big city.</span> <span id="s660">You don’t speak the language…</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, the Joint Distribution Committee, they asked me what kind work can I do.</span> <span id="s662">I said, “I’m from the leather.’</span> <span id="s663">So they sent me and the second day I got a job in a factory, pocketbooks and men’s wallets.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: This is something you had done as a very young man but you hadn’t done it all through the war…</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Listen, what you learn when you are young, you still can remember.</span> <span id="s666">I was eight years in New York.</span> <span id="s667">My brother-in-law, they sent him to New York too, from Germany, and the Joint Distribution asked him what he can do.</span> <span id="s668">And he said he knows about cows, horses.</span> <span id="s669">So they sent him to Minnesota, to St. Paul.</span> <span id="s670">He used to work here in St. Paul in the stockyard, I don’t know how many weeks.</span> <span id="s671">He didn’t want it, he wanted to go by himself, so he asked people where is a good town so he can buy a farm.</span> <span id="s672">He went to Stewartville, not far from Rochester, Minnesota, and he bought a farm and started to deal with cows.</span> <span id="s673">So he was dealing with cows and I still was in New York, and in 1958 he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s674">He said, “Why do you want to sit here in New York?”</span> <span id="s675">I was already a partner to my boss -- he was a bachelor -- but I used to have trouble with him.</span> <span id="s676">And I didn’t like it, sitting inside in a shop a whole day.</span> <span id="s677">I like to be outside.</span> <span id="s678">So he said, “Come over.</span> <span id="s679">Maybe we going to buy something together.”</span> <span id="s680">My wife wasn’t too happy.</span> <span id="s681">I was going around and I met Rabbi Eisemann.</span> <span id="s682">He said, “You wanna move to Rochester?</span> <span id="s683">I give you a kind of suggestion.”</span> <span id="s684">I said, ‘what kind?’</span> <span id="s685">“Well.”</span> <span id="s686">He said, “Minnesota has 10,000 lakes.</span> <span id="s687">I sell you a thousand.’</span> <span id="s688">(Laughs) Well, I came and we was looking around but we couldn’t buy nothing, so I went back home.</span> <span id="s689">But my head was all ready to come back, so I came back and we was going around and all of a sudden, a day before I left, came a guy and he offered a business, a trailer park.</span> <span id="s690">It took about five minutes, we bought this trailer park!</span> <span id="s691">I was in Rochester 25 years.</span> <span id="s692">And that’s my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: So then you and your friend, your brother-in-law, bought this trailer park?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, he’s still in the cattle business.</span> <span id="s695">Me and my wife, we used to have 120 units, 120 families -- 80 permanents and 40 travel units.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So then you didn’t move to Minneapolis until…</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: It came to the point we wanted to sell, so we sold it.</span> <span id="s698">When you’re in a place 25 years, well, I saw what’s going on, how they’re managing it, and I didn’t like it, so I don’t want to stay there any more.</span> <span id="s699">So that’s why I came here.</span> <span id="s700">It’s a year.</span> <span id="s701">On March 7 last year I came to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s702">And to Rochester I came in 1959, so it was almost 25 years there in the trailer park.</span> <span id="s703">In 1978 there was a flood in Rochester.</span> <span id="s704">It was flooded.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Were you involved with the Jewish community in Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s707">I was involved in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s708">I was social director in the (Mayo) clinic.</span> <span id="s709">I used to be interpreter in the clinic for Jewish people that came from South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: You speak Spanish too?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yiddish and German, a little bit Spanish.</span> <span id="s712">I was social director of the Jewish community in Rochester about 10 years.</span> <span id="s713">The B’nai Brith paid me.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Social director for the B’nai Brith?</span> <span id="s715">Or social director for the synagogue?</span> <span id="s716">Or for the clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: There was a rabbi, and I was the social director.</span> <span id="s718">A lot of South American and Central American Jews used to come to Rochester as patients to the clinic.</span> <span id="s719">We used to have a good time.</span> <span id="s720">They used to come to the Center.</span> <span id="s721">Then they told me I should make a Jewish delicatessen store.</span> <span id="s722">I made the store.</span> <span id="s723">I lost $45,000 and I closed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: So now what are you doing in Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Now?</span> <span id="s726">I’m not doing nothing.</span> <span id="s727">You got a job for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Why did you move up here instead of staying in Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: I miss Rochester.</span> <span id="s730">But don’t forget, I’m 72 years old.</span> <span id="s731">I still could stay in Rochester, taking care of things, but we start to fighting with my partner and I couldn’t stay any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: And so here you are.</span> <span id="s733">Where does your son live?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: My son lives in Plymouth and he’s got an office in the Midland Bank in downtown Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: What business is he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: He’s a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So this is one reason you came to Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s739">Without that I wouldn’t come to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s740">I got a lot of relations in Brazil.</span> <span id="s741">I got two nephews in Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: You had been on Achsherah, and you’d talked so long about going to Palestine -- did you consider going to Israel instead of coming to the United States after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s744">But my wife’s sister who used to live in France, she married a guy from Israel and she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s745">She got cancer and my wife went over there.</span> <span id="s746">She was there about four weeks and I was by myself in the trailer park.</span> <span id="s747">She didn’t like Israel.</span> <span id="s748">She didn’t like the people.</span> <span id="s749">There in the hospital they treated her badly.</span> <span id="s750">If not for my son, I wouldn’t stay here, I would move to Brazil, Buenos Aires.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And you have grandchildren too?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: I have three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And you didn’t have any other children, just the one boy.</span> <span id="s754">One more thing about living here.</span> <span id="s755">Are you involved at all in the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A; Yeah.</span> <span id="s757">I’m in the Kenesseth Israel (synagogue) I’m going to the JCC ( Jewish Community Center).</span> <span id="s758">And I belong to the B’nai Brith.</span> <span id="s759">My health is not good.</span> <span id="s760">When I was in the park, I was healthy.</span> <span id="s761">Then I was much too busy.</span> <span id="s762">I was 20 hours with people, and it was too many.</span> <span id="s763">I’m going next Monday for an angiogram.</span> <span id="s764">I don’t know what’s gonna be.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Now we get to the philosophical questions.</span> <span id="s766">You might want to think about it for a minute before you start to answer.</span> <span id="s767">Can you tell me what it’s meant to you to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s768">You smile…</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Well, you got characters from our people -- some survivors --they can take it better than I. Can you imagine to be eight children, and not to have nobody?</span> <span id="s770">I got only my son.</span> <span id="s771">You know, a daughter-in-law is not a daughter.</span> <span id="s772">We are by ourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: But out of eight children, there’s you and your two sisters who did survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: But there was one in Israel, who died?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s777">I haven’t got no sister what’s survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: I thought it was your sister in Buenos Aires.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: She passed away in 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: But she did live through the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Only two nephews what survived -- one survived in Bergen-Belsen and one in Mauthausen -- they are in Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Oh, I see why you’d like to go there.</span> <span id="s783">Another question here: if you can, could you tell me how you feel about human nature, about non-Jews, about Germans?</span> <span id="s784">Do you think about that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: I feel much worse about the Polacks than the Germans.</span> <span id="s786">The German people, they didn’t recognize a Jew when a Polack wouldn’t holler, “Oh, a Jew!”</span> <span id="s787">They wouldn’t recognize!</span> <span id="s788">The Polacks they are blond, and the Jews they are dark complexioned, and the Germans they are dark complexioned too.</span> <span id="s789">So the Germans didn’t recognize a Jew when the Polack wasn’t hollering, ‘That’s a Jew!”</span> <span id="s790">I wouldn’t go to Poland for no money.</span> <span id="s791">That’s a bloody, bloody land for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Do you think they’ve changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I don’t know if they’ve changed.</span> <span id="s794">The Polacks they are Polacks.</span> <span id="s795">That’s it.</span> <span id="s796">They are not in bad shape now, maybe they are a little better.</span> <span id="s797">Anyway, they got Judenfrei over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Then there is this question: Has your belief, or the way you practice Judaism, or whether you believe in God changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: That’s a big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Well, you belong to the Orthodox synagogue…</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Sure, I belong.</span> <span id="s802">I ask a lot of people questions.</span> <span id="s803">I ask questions even the rabbi.</span> <span id="s804">I said, ‘Rabbi, tell me.</span> <span id="s805">Every nation in the world got sin, every human being’s got sin.</span> <span id="s806">The Jewish people, they used to have sin.</span> <span id="s807">But why, when it’s a God, why didn’t he send a miracle?</span> <span id="s808">Why was he waiting that six million Jews was killed?</span> <span id="s809">Why didn’t he do a miracle about two million killed?</span> <span id="s810">That He could see such…the best people in the world, religious people…that they could see this, and they could see young children, shooting them, putting them in the ground…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s811">I don’t believe it.’</span> <span id="s812">He says, “There’s no answer to this, I can’t give you an answer.”</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Rabbi Herzog says this?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: “I can’t give you no answer?’</span> <span id="s815">It’s no answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: I think you’re right.</span> <span id="s817">There is none.</span> <span id="s818">Do you have any photos, mementoes, things that you could share with us if we’re going to do a book or an exhibit?</span> <span id="s819">Did you bring anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: What do you mean, photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: For example, photos of you as a young man.</span> <span id="s822">Wedding photos of yourself and your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Sure, I got photos here.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: (Looking at photos) When you were talking about your wife earlier, I didn’t realize that you had known her before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: My parents, they used to have orchards in the summer.</span> <span id="s826">The whole family, they used to live in a big city and they used to come to use over the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: You mean people would come to rent?</span> <span id="s828">To camp?</span> <span id="s829">Families?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Her mother used to come to us to bring from the big city stuff like a peddler.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: What kind of things did they sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Like somebody needed pens or somebody needed shirts, she used to bring from the big city.</span> <span id="s833">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s834">She used to give, to pay off.</span> <span id="s835">They couldn’t afford to go in a hotel so they came to us for the whole summer.</span> <span id="s836">We used to have two bungalows in the orchard.</span> <span id="s837">We didn’t charge them nothing.</span> <span id="s838">So we knew each other a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: So that’s how you met your wife.</span> <span id="s840">So then how did you meet her after the war?</span> <span id="s841">Somebody told you she was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Somebody told me that she is alive.</span> <span id="s843">I met her on the street in Sosnowiec and she was waiting with pots in her hand, going to the committee for a little food…</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And you recognized her right way.</span> <span id="s845">That must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Sure!</span> <span id="s847">She used to stay with cousins.</span> <span id="s848">The cousins, they are now in Israel, in B’nai Barak.</span> <span id="s849">They are very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: There is a book called Schindler’s List.</span> <span id="s851">You say that it is not accurate.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I tell you, you interviewed me, I can’t remember everything.</span> <span id="s853">You have to sit with me two days until I tell you everything.</span> <span id="s854">This guy, maybe he interviewed somebody, but that’s…I started to read the book, but I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: It’s not right.</span> <span id="s857">A lot of things are not right.</span> <span id="s858">He didn’t know a lot of people what used to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: You mean there were other people that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Well, he (Schindler) took over the factory from a Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s861">His name was Banke.</span> <span id="s862">And this Banke was all the time the chief in the factory.</span> <span id="s863">He got nothing, Schindler got the whole factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: But Schindler kept him on.</span> <span id="s865">Are you saying then that Schindler was not a 100% good person?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: What do you mean 100%?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Well, he saved so many Jews’ lives…but…</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: He was still a German.</span> <span id="s869">But when they would find out he is for the Jews, they would kill him!</span> <span id="s870">He was for us, not for the German.</span> <span id="s871">He was an Obersturmbahnfuhrer and he went to Himmler and said he has to have the same Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Did you ever talk to him about why he was doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I didn’t talk to him.</span> <span id="s874">After World War II, I was going from Ravensbruck to Munich and I met him.</span> <span id="s875">We were sitting together and I told him, “I’ve got half a sack of coffee over there,’ and exactly then came the German police and he saved me maybe 100 pounds of coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: So then you saw him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s878">Then I heard he went to Israel and he got $25,000 right away from Joint Distribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Was this to reimburse…</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No.</span> <span id="s881">He is buried in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s883">He didn’t live in Jerusalem after the war…</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: He lived for a while, and he’s buried in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Did you ever talk among yourselves?</span> <span id="s886">Do you remember trying to figure out why this man was like he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: He was smart.</span> <span id="s888">He told me one time, “When Hitler wouldn’t start with the Jews, Hitler would win the war.’</span> <span id="s889">That’s why he walked on two sides.</span> <span id="s890">He was better for the Jews, alike for the Germans.</span> <span id="s891">He couldn’t be bad for the Germans.</span> <span id="s892">If they would find out that he give to eat, the Jews, the Germans they would kill him.</span> <span id="s893">It made no difference he was Obersturmbahnfuhrer, he would go in jail and they would kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: It says in the book that he was arrested three times and each time, with connections, he got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: That’s why he was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: But you think then that the reason he helped the Jews was really just that he thought the Germans were being foolish to waste their efforts on the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: He was knowing that the Germans they’re going to lose.</span> <span id="s898">He was a smart cookie.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: But it’s almost like you’re saying that he didn’t do this because he was a good person, he did it because he was a smart person, he did it because he figured the Germans are going to lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: (To Mrs. Kaminsky) Did you get the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Your wife doesn’t want to be interviewed?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Have you read any other books about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Nobody hears what they got to.</span> <span id="s905">No, I don’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Are you going to see Shoah?</span> <span
