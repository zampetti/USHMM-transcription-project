My father could not go.</span> <span id="s74">And we’ll probably get into that.</span> <span id="s75">So I had actually two sets of friends.</span> <span id="s76">I had my grandparents and a large family in Pabianice.</span> <span id="s77">And my grandfather at times would rent a place in the country.</span> <span id="s78">This was in Poland.</span> <span id="s79">And oh I also went to camp in Germany as a younger person.</span> <span id="s80">So yes it was a very nice childhood up to a point.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Let me ask you a few things about what you’ve already just told me.</span> <span id="s82">You said your father was a business man, but you didn’t tell me what kind of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: He was in the what we would call here dry goods.</span> <span id="s84">He was also a manufacturer’s representative.</span> <span id="s85">He sold suspenders and garters for openers.</span> <span id="s86">He also sold children’s clothing.</span> <span id="s87">Many things that are considered here dry goods.</span> <span id="s88">I would have to list too many things.</span> <span id="s89">And he was a manufacturer’s representative.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And you mentioned that you would go and have summers in Poland with relatives.</span> <span id="s91">Can you give me the names of the relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Ok we would say with my mother’s parents, Sacka and Marcus Kleinert.</span> <span id="s93">Those are my maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s94">He was a dentist, my grandfather and they had a large home and where he also had his practice.</span> <span id="s95">Then I had my paternal grandparents although my paternal grandfather died early on But my grandmother Salzberg lived and I loved going to her house, more religious than my maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s96">And I don’t want to get ahead of anything.</span> <span id="s97">And with her lived with my paternal grandmother lived my father’s sister who was widowed early on and her daughter.</span> <span id="s98">And I loved going there, especially on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s99">Because her house was smelled of fresh challah and chicken soup and my aunt Henya, my father’s sister was the funniest person that I have ever met.</span> <span id="s100">And made me laugh a whole lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: German.</span> <span id="s103">And my parents if they didn’t want us to understand, Polish.</span> <span id="s104">Although the primary language, even for my father was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: When you went to visit relatives in Poland what did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I spoke German and they spoke German back to me.</span> <span id="s107">My grandmother, paternal grandmother spoke Yiddish which if I understood it was all right and if I didn’t understand it my aunt, her daughter would explain but it was primarily German.</span> <span id="s108">I understood some Polish although because they, if they spoke Polish there were things I could pick up and out, but I did not speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: During your childhood, did you ever reflect about how the life of the family was different in Poland than it was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I really don’t’ think so because my maternal grandparents were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s111">I liked the city of Pavlenitsa.</span> <span id="s112">I really did.</span> <span id="s113">It was smaller, but then Hamburg wasn’t what it is today either.</span> <span id="s114">No, I have to say no that I didn’t’ reflect.</span> <span id="s115">It was, it was different.</span> <span id="s116">My grandmother my paternal grandmother lived a simpler life.</span> <span id="s117">In a different section of Pabianice, but it was still it was nice.</span> <span id="s118">It was nice.</span> <span id="s119">I should say though that my grandmother Salzberg I do remember when I was very, very young we used to have facilities on the outside.</span> <span id="s120">I did not have that at my other grandparents’ house.</span> <span id="s121">But that changed relatively early on.</span> <span id="s122">But I do remember that.</span> <span id="s123">But then again we always went in the summer so that was not a terrible hardship.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: You mentioned that you went with your mother and your sister but your father couldn’t come on those trips to Poland.</span> <span id="s125">Can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Very simply he had left, I don’t know if it was surreptitiously but he left to a, to avoid serving in the army and he could not return there.</span> <span id="s127">He was stateless, rendered stateless by the German government.</span> <span id="s128">Well, getting a little ahead of it he was stateless because he was Jewish but that came slightly later.</span> <span id="s129">But he was never made, he never was a German citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: I want to ask you some more about Hamburg and your childhood.</span> <span id="s131">You mentioned that your different grandparents had different levels of religious observance but in your home in Hamburg what religious traditions did you observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: All the holidays.</span> <span id="s133">Friday night.</span> <span id="s134">I want to say Saturday we knew it was the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s135">But we were not observant in the sense that the orthodox people are.</span> <span id="s136">We were not.</span> <span id="s137">But yet we were, both my sister and I as we were raised that’s how we raised our children.</span> <span id="s138">The Sabbath with all its traditional things, the candles, the challah, the wine, the boruchas, it’s all part of our life.</span> <span id="s139">And has become and we’ve carried that on for our children.</span> <span id="s140">I speak for myself.</span> <span id="s141">I know both of my daughters.</span> <span id="s142">But we are not observant to the point of not riding on a Saturday or et cetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And that was what your family observed even then?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">As a matter of fact my mother was raised the same way.</span> <span id="s146">She was not raised in a particularly religious home.</span> <span id="s147">My father, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Was there a large Jewish community in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s150">Very large.</span> <span id="s151">Extremely large.</span> <span id="s152">I didn’t’ even realize how large as a child.</span> <span id="s153">Only it was in later years that after the end of the war and since I’ve been back that I realized just how large the community was.</span> <span id="s154">Synagogues and a lot of Jewish activity but we’ll get into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: What were relationships like between the Jews and the gentiles in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We’re talking about before the Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s157">Good.</span> <span id="s158">I had friends from early, early on that I can remember that were definitely not Jewish.</span> <span id="s159">And they were good friends.</span> <span id="s160">I might, excuse me.</span> <span id="s161">I might add my parents also my father was in a card game that was primarily non-Jews.</span> <span id="s162">So he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s163">As other businessman, as other businessman, the ultimate business man.</span> <span id="s164">He associated with and was personable I might add and associated with people that he liked got along with and did business with.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young child in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: After the, soon after the Nazis came.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: But before the Nazis came?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Not that I was aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: When you went to school, you started at kindergarten, elementary.</span> <span id="s170">Did you go to public school or private school.</span> <span id="s171">A: I went to, I started out in public school.</span> <span id="s172">Yeah public school to begin with unh hunh.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And then what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Well since you know how old I am, I started school in 1932.</span> <span id="s175">31, 32, when I was about five, five and a half years old.</span> <span id="s176">And it was fine.</span> <span id="s177">We learned, we had fun.</span> <span id="s178">And it didn’t last very long because as you know in 1933 the Nazis came into power.</span> <span id="s179">And how I happened to be very, become very much aware of that is because of something that happened to me in public school.</span> <span id="s180">If you’d like I can tell it to you.</span> <span id="s181">I went to school one day as I always did and was called out of class.</span> <span id="s182">And there was, I was called into an office of a very quote unquote nice lady and she had a conversation with me and asked me many questions about my mother and father and grandparents, my aunts, my uncles.</span> <span id="s183">It didn’t’ matter where they were.</span> <span id="s184">And what who my parents associated with and who their friends were, who my friends were and but primarily about family things and where they were and what we did and this was all as far back she asked me as I could remember.</span> <span id="s185">And at that time I still had a great grandfather, my maternal grandmother’s father was still living whom I was very fond of.</span> <span id="s186">So they dug into the back, my background as far back as a child of six, seven years old could remember.</span> <span id="s187">And when I came home and told my parents about this, they were furious.</span> <span id="s188">And it wasn’t too long after that that my parents put me into a private school for Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s189">And my and that coincides with the time that I wasn’t even welcomed in public school anymore.</span> <span id="s190">What this was about, this interview was called in German, I’ll give you the German word for it.</span> <span id="s191">It’s called Razen undazuhom.</span> <span id="s192">Literally translated means race research.</span> <span id="s193">Race, race research is what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: You said your parents were furious.</span> <span id="s195">Did they explain to you why they were so angered?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s197">To the best of my knowledge my father especially was very vocal about it.</span> <span id="s198">Because he felt at that time that it was a heck of a lot of nerve for these people to take, get hold of a young person like myself and dig into their background.</span> <span id="s199">I have to tell you that at the time, at the time, I wasn’t aware.</span> <span id="s200">I was curious why.</span> <span id="s201">And I also knew that not everybody had this.</span> <span id="s202">And you know kids are very tuned into other kids and other kids knew that I went for this interview, but not everybody did.</span> <span id="s203">So already there was a line drawn.</span> <span id="s204">But it wasn’t as obvious, as horrendous to me as it certainly was to my father.</span> <span id="s205">Specially my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Do you remember the campaign that Hitler waged to get himself into political a position of political influence.</span> <span id="s207">Do you remember the election campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well what I remember primarily is a man would get on television and he would not on television.</span> <span id="s209">I’m sorry I’m way ahead of him.</span> <span id="s210">Wow, thank god there was no television then.</span> <span id="s211">Who knows what damage he could have done.</span> <span id="s212">My father was a, like listening to the radio and I did too.</span> <span id="s213">But when this person came on, I never understood what he was talking about because this man screamed and yelled.</span> <span id="s214">And although I was very proficient in German and spoke what is now called Hochdeutsch.</span> <span id="s215">They don’t’ even have that anymore.</span> <span id="s216">They speak one level of German.</span> <span id="s217">And I also wrote in this different script which is Hochdeutsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Can you translate Hochdeutsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: High German.</span> <span id="s220">High German.</span> <span id="s221">And yet I did not understand this person.</span> <span id="s222">If you listen to his speeches today on tape or in the movie, movies that we have and when I say we, I’m talking about the museum.</span> <span id="s223">Anyway historians have.</span> <span id="s224">Who understands what he’s screaming about?</span> <span id="s225">I certainly did not.</span> <span id="s226">I will say this, that I could see my father and mother and friends.</span> <span id="s227">As I said before they had friends.</span> <span id="s228">Lots of friends.</span> <span id="s229">Being upset about it.</span> <span id="s230">And talking you know how is this all going to, what is he saying.</span> <span id="s231">Or why is he saying these things about an Aryan race and all the other things.</span> <span id="s232">Although he promised to make things better economically and that was what my father explained to us, to me.</span> <span id="s233">His real mission Hitler’s mission was to make things financially, economically better at the expense of who knows.</span> <span id="s234">Who knew at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Do you remember Hitler being sworn in as Chancellor?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I believe they had it on the radio.</span> <span id="s237">I believe we were told that in school because I was still in public school.</span> <span id="s238">I believe that they talked about it because immediately the pictures went up on the walls of the school with him in his now infamous salute.</span> <span id="s239">Yeah.</span> <span id="s240">I don’t know that I exactly heard or understood or grasped the concept.</span> <span id="s241">Can I tell you that I saw this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: I was going to ask you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: When I was still in public school we went on a field, what’s called a field trip.</span> <span id="s244">He was in Hamburg and we had to go downtown and see Hitler.</span> <span id="s245">And although it was from a distance, remember I was a small person then.</span> <span id="s246">So I craned my neck and yes I got to see him and we had to give the what is now the infamous Heil Hitler salute.</span> <span id="s247">I will tell you, I was not comfortable with that.</span> <span id="s248">And I didn’t really quite know yet why I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s249">But I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s250">Probably what I heard at home.</span> <span id="s251">You know that from the speeches that he had made and listening to the grown-ups talk.</span> <span id="s252">But I did see him and heard him.</span> <span id="s253">I didn’t, I no more understood him then I did when I heard him on the radio.</span> <span id="s254">But yes I did see this infamous man.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What kind of impression did he make on you in person?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Being not, not that close to him.</span> <span id="s257">Well I already had preconceived impression.</span> <span id="s258">Having heard him on the radio and having heard my parents and their acquaintances talk so I think maybe that’s why I was uncomfortable but I had to do it, give the salute.</span> <span id="s259">I might add I had to give that salute every morning once he came into power.</span> <span id="s260">As we pledge allegiance in school, in this country, to our flag, we had to give, I mean with every other word it was Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s261">Never comfortable with it and fortunately I didn’t have to do it for very long because they didn’t want me and we didn’t want them in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: You were still going back and forth to Poland over the summers, during this time period.</span> <span id="s263">I want to ask you to walk me through some of the changes that you might have noticed among neighbors and friends in the early days of Hitler’s chancellorship.</span> <span id="s264">What stands out in your mind about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I had two very good friends, a boy that lived in our building, same building that I went to visit when I went back two years ago.</span> <span id="s266">And of a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s267">Her name is Ingeborg.</span> <span id="s268">I have, I remember her.</span> <span id="s269">The boy and I was a bit of a tomboy, this particular boy and his friends, but I’m focusing on him because he was, lived in the building.</span> <span id="s270">He joined very early on as a very young kid the Hitler Youth and from that moment on I became an outcast.</span> <span id="s271">For several years he tormented us with bad language, throwing stones, kicking us and as he got older, of course it got worse.</span> <span id="s272">He somehow disappeared.</span> <span id="s273">I don’t know if they moved or what happened.</span> <span id="s274">I, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s275">The, this girl friend of mine from very early on, they didn’t live that close to us but her parents and my parents were also friends.</span> <span id="s276">And I do remember their last name.</span> <span id="s277">It was Vall.</span> <span id="s278">They my parents stopped being friends with them.</span> <span id="s279">Or they with us and I never saw her again either.</span> <span id="s280">So it was almost abrupt because they didn’t live near me.</span> <span id="s281">Whereas some of these other kids did.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did you start experiencing any direct anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Tell me about some of these early experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: As I said you didn’t have to know the people, the youngsters.</span> <span id="s286">Mainly young people.</span> <span id="s287">My age, older.</span> <span id="s288">You walked around with a nervous stomach and you saw kids that were not, that you knew were not Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s289">Because we were teased.</span> <span id="s290">We were made fun of.</span> <span id="s291">We were called bad names.</span> <span id="s292">They had nobody to answer to.</span> <span id="s293">In other words, this was the accepted thing.</span> <span id="s294">You felt fortunate if they left you alone.</span> <span id="s295">And I’m not going to tell you that they, many times when I say they, I’m talking different kids, different from different areas.</span> <span id="s296">Don’t’ forget I had to use public transportation to go to school, once I started private school.</span> <span id="s297">So you felt fortunate if you didn’t get picked on and made fun of and tugged at and pulled at and kicked.</span> <span id="s298">And I will say this, I fought back too.</span> <span id="s299">Yes I did.</span> <span id="s300">And but that didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s301">I was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How did you fight back?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I hit back.</span> <span id="s304">I hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: what advice did your parents give you on handling these kinds of situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s307">You know we didn’t talk about it all that much, even though we all knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s308">We and they knew what, were they not going to send us to school.</span> <span id="s309">It wasn’t like an every minute type of thing.</span> <span id="s310">Though not isolated, it wasn’t every minute.</span> <span id="s311">It was to begin with tolerable and then of course little by little it became intolerable, living under that regime for over six years.</span> <span id="s312">So we experienced many things and learned to deal with some.</span> <span id="s313">Be angered by others.</span> <span id="s314">Fight back a little bit if you could.</span> <span id="s315">And it made for a little bit of a tough life.</span> <span id="s316">It wasn’t pleasant and nice life that I was used to.</span> <span id="s317">Also I have to tell you, some of this other than kids in the immediate circle of friends, some of this was a little more gradual.</span> <span id="s318">Little more gradual.</span> <span id="s319">So that it not everybody pounced it, on you at the same time.</span> <span id="s320">And there were rest periods.</span> <span id="s321">But then of course in the last two years there, it became intolerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: I asked you a moment ago if you were still going to Poland over the summers.</span> <span id="s323">Did you notice anti-Semitism in Poland on those summer visits.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No because it was, things were very isolated visits as far as visiting family is concerned, going to the country.</span> <span id="s325">I have to say that I did not.</span> <span id="s326">They may have been.</span> <span id="s327">I heard conversations you know that they set, you know my grandparents used to say you know this person was you know not friendly toward Jews.</span> <span id="s328">But especially my grandfather.</span> <span id="s329">He was in a situation where he was a professional man.</span> <span id="s330">People came to him to get rid of a tooth, get rid of pain, to get a filling, to get a tooth pulled.</span> <span id="s331">They were more than grateful if you took care of them.</span> <span id="s332">And he was also somewhat educated in medicine.</span> <span id="s333">So they came to him actually for more than just the dental work.</span> <span id="s334">And I would say that 60% of his patients were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s335">But very grateful that he took care of them, because I used to sit there and watch him work.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: I had asked you about Hamburg in 1933 when Hitler was sworn in as chancellor.</span> <span id="s337">Do you remember some of the things that started to happen right after Hitler came into office.</span> <span id="s338">Like the burning of the Reichstag and emergency powers.</span> <span id="s339">Do you remember those events.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, not really, not really.</span> <span id="s341">I remember life starting to change but that was very subtle as I’ve said before, primarily amongst the young children.</span> <span id="s342">And this is, it was subtle.</span> <span id="s343">Mainly I heard it through my father who was a very much into the politics of the day and the conversations, et cetera.</span> <span id="s344">But other than experiencing the anti, what we now call, what was then called to the anti-Semitism or the anti-Jewish situation.</span> <span id="s345">Specific events like what you just asked me about the, no I, I have to say that I don’t’ remember.</span> <span id="s346">I have to really dig down.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you remember the boycotts of Jewish businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah , I mean my father was a victim of that.</span> <span id="s349">definitely a victim of that.</span> <span id="s350">But it took a while.</span> <span id="s351">I mean he, it was not subtle but he lost customers.</span> <span id="s352">Cause they wouldn’t’ buy from him.</span> <span id="s353">They would initially say you don’t need anything this trip around cause he also traveled.</span> <span id="s354">It didn’t start to affect his livelihood until it ceased.</span> <span id="s355">It did totally cease.</span> <span id="s356">For the last year I would say not more that he was in business.</span> <span id="s357">And he also represented a company.</span> <span id="s358">He was a manufacturers rep. Who had to break up their relationship with him.</span> <span id="s359">But I might add they also wrote him a reference if you ever need it.</span> <span id="s360">That was very nice of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Do you remember the book burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Well we saw some of it.</span> <span id="s363">In Hamburg most of it was done synagogues.</span> <span id="s364">Our synagogue.</span> <span id="s365">You know it’s something that when you’re young, that young, and you become aware of some of these things that you’re asking me about, specifically the book burning.</span> <span id="s366">At first, no matter how many times somebody explains it to you whether it be teacher or parent, it’s something maybe you can, people can even relate to that here.</span> <span id="s367">You don’t understand.</span> <span id="s368">You don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s369">Why?</span> <span id="s370">Why get books together and burn them.</span> <span id="s371">They explained to us that they meaning the regime of the day didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s372">They believed in burning the books that taught.</span> <span id="s373">Humanitarian things.</span> <span id="s374">Great writers that have terrific influence on, on everybody’s life, that if it didn’t’ match up with their beliefs it was something that had to be gotten rid of.</span> <span id="s375">But you go try to explain that to a ten year old kid.</span> <span id="s376">It’s, it’s hard to swallow that.</span> <span id="s377">It is hard to swallow.</span> <span id="s378">Burning books.</span> <span id="s379">I, I’m an old woman now and I have a hard time comprehending that.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Imagine that you saw some book burning.</span> <span id="s381">Can you tell me, can you describe what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: A bunch of frenzied Nazis have a pile of books that they’ve collected from around.</span> <span id="s383">I watched this out of our home in, from the balcony.</span> <span id="s384">This was a small, relatively small.</span> <span id="s385">This wasn’t one of these big, big bonfires.</span> <span id="s386">They collected books.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t even know where they got them from, probably out of people’s homes or stores or neighborhood synagogues.</span> <span id="s388">I have no idea where they got them from.</span> <span id="s389">And they built like a fire.</span> <span id="s390">These were the uniformed brown shirt Nazis, a lot of them young.</span> <span id="s391">The youth groups, the youth groups.</span> <span id="s392">Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s393">Which you have heard a lot about.</span> <span id="s394">And they would light them up and set them on fire and go nuts.</span> <span id="s395">And, and absolutely think they were listening to a rock concert.</span> <span id="s396">That’s the only thing I can you know they’d go crazy.</span> <span id="s397">They were frenzied.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I’m going to pause now and flip the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: This is tape 1, side B, we are interviewing Jutta Levy and you were telling about the book burning and I wanted to ask you about any recollection you might have about President Hindenburg.</span> <span id="s400">Do you remember when he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I remember when he died and the publicity surrounding it and I haven’t talked about this in a long, long time.</span> <span id="s402">So I’m not going to say too much about it because I just, I right this second.</span> <span id="s403">I know there was a lot of publicity about it and I want to say and I may be wrong but I think there was a certain amount of sadness within Germany that he died.</span> <span id="s404">But that I really that’s all.</span> <span id="s405">I want to comment on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You mentioned publicity.</span> <span id="s407">Did you see a lot of anti-Semitic publicity in those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Well they had lots of posters, store fronts were marked.</span> <span id="s409">Juden, which of course means Jew.</span> <span id="s410">Saw that pretty early on.</span> <span id="s411">I might also add that I would say that even prior to Hitler, maybe just prior, just after he came in.</span> <span id="s412">There were the makings, not even the makings, it was a natural but for a certain element of people to persecute or be anti-Semitic, as it is everywhere.</span> <span id="s413">Desecration of a synagogue, desecration of a store front, name calling.</span> <span id="s414">You know I, I want to say that also was part of normal life.</span> <span id="s415">It didn’t necessarily all begin with this maniac.</span> <span id="s416">But of course it intensified.</span> <span id="s417">We have listen we have some of that in any country.</span> <span id="s418">And I might add in Poland too.</span> <span id="s419">But you know you don’t dwell on it.</span> <span id="s420">It happens.</span> <span id="s421">It’s over with, except where I grew up, it wasn’t over with.</span> <span id="s422">But it does happen and life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: You mentioned you saw posters.</span> <span id="s424">Can you describe some of the things that you saw as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Primarily posters of Hitler’s with the salute.</span> <span id="s426">We’ve all seen those posters, pictures, pictures of SS men because they were the elite.</span> <span id="s427">Posters like that.</span> <span id="s428">Posters extoling Mein Kampf now.</span> <span id="s429">Not the book necessarily but that again is in connection with Hitler.</span> <span id="s430">I didn’t know too much about Mein Kampf then, his book but that’s what I remember seeing because they were up and around and especially when I still went to public school.</span> <span id="s431">I knew when he was sworn in those things were up in, within the school.</span> <span id="s432">And also throughout the city.</span> <span id="s433">Not everywhere but I would venture to say in the theaters and wherever you went.</span> <span id="s434">Restaurants.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You mentioned posters in the context of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s436">Do you remember seeing any anti-Semitic posters.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I saw some but primarily I remember vividly my father showing us, showing me a newspaper that was called Der Spiegel which I think is still in business.</span> <span id="s438">It’s Spiegel is mirror, the mirror.</span> <span id="s439">And they always depicted Jewish people with being very homely with a hooked nose and pockmarked nose.</span> <span id="s440">I remember seeing a lot of that in the paper and in posters.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Do you remember the enactment of the Nuremburg laws, either as a specific act or even do you have a sense of what the impact of these laws was on your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well maybe not directly but certainly indirectly.</span> <span id="s443">Not knowing as a child what all, what impact it had at the moment or was going to have but I certainly became aware of it very quickly.</span> <span id="s444">Now you need to ask me specific questions because otherwise I’m going to be lost and go on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: About the racial laws and the intermarriage and all those classifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Not just racial, not just inter marriage and et cetera, but also people that changed their religion from Jewish to whatever.</span> <span id="s447">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s448">It did not matter.</span> <span id="s449">A person was still classified as a Jew not clean for lack of a different expression.</span> <span id="s450">Jews were responsible for all the bad things.</span> <span id="s451">Jews were not Aryan.</span> <span id="s452">They were not of a pure race.</span> <span id="s453">Jews were needed to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s454">Jews needed to be exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were you aware of the existence of concentration camps in the 30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: The only one that I personally was aware of was because my father mentioned it as early as when I say 1933, that’s when this particular camp came into existence almost simultaneously with Hitler.</span> <span id="s457">But we, I have to be honest.</span> <span id="s458">The media and the information that trickled back is not like today.</span> <span id="s459">Today a person sneezes at one end of the world and it’s picked up at the other end of the world.</span> <span id="s460">Those were not days of great communication but my father did know about a camp by the name of Dachau which has become infamous.</span> <span id="s461">And but you didn’t really understand.</span> <span id="s462">We knew we thought it was a prison camp.</span> <span id="s463">We didn’t know all the horrible things that were going on there at that time.</span> <span id="s464">At that time.</span> <span id="s465">Had we known more I think we would have gotten out earlier, or tried, excuse me, tried to get out earlier.</span> <span id="s466">Because we got out as we were getting to by the skin of our teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: I’d like to go over a few more historical events and then ask you when the family made the move to get out.</span> <span id="s468">Do you remember the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: That’s when he went into Austria.</span> <span id="s470">I did.</span> <span id="s471">When you say do I remember it.</span> <span id="s472">It was part of what was going on that he marched very defiantly into Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: What was the reaction of your family or the community to this event?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Like with everything else.</span> <span id="s475">There was a certain amount of, but I would not, certainly, there was apprehension.</span> <span id="s476">No apathy but apprehension with this will pass.</span> <span id="s477">Ok so he annexed or and, as you say Anschluss Austria.</span> <span id="s478">That’s one thing that he did.</span> <span id="s479">Don’t’ forget it’s as far as it got at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How was that event reported in the media in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I don’t have a whole lot of oh memory of that but tremendous victory.</span> <span id="s482">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s483">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s484">They, they felt they always they gave us to understand and I’m only sort of repeating what I heard and was privy to.</span> <span id="s485">That the Germans always felt that Austria was Germany and Germany was Austria.</span> <span id="s486">It was like one.</span> <span id="s487">And I might also add that my mother had some education in Austria, as well as her brother did and Austria was the land of Strauss and waltzes and my mother lamented you know the fact that Austria will probably never be as she had known it as a young person.</span> <span id="s488">That’s really what I remember mostly.</span> <span id="s489">It did not make the impact on me personally as a young person that it would had it happened ten years later in my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: During these events what was the Jewish community doing in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Go, mostly going on as best as they could, as normally as they could with many people making arrangements, plans to leave.</span> <span id="s492">And others saying it will, I mean this will pass, this can’t be happening.</span> <span id="s493">I may be getting ahead of it but people were starting to talk about getting out.</span> <span id="s494">And some left, some people left as early on as 1934, 35.</span> <span id="s495">My father’s brother who would follow him to Germany and they were in business together for a time his younger brother.</span> <span id="s496">He did not leave under the circumstances that my father did because he was able to return to Poland and visit.</span> <span id="s497">But he left in 1936 and that was supposed to be when we were offered well we’ll get into that I’m sure.</span> <span id="s498">But people started to leave.</span> <span id="s499">They didn’t want to put up with, well they were afraid.</span> <span id="s500">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s501">Some people more afraid than others and also I might say it’s a tremendous venture to pick up your family, your, your, your life and move it to wherever.</span> <span id="s502">It’s a tremendous and especially when there are children.</span> <span id="s503">We knew my aunt and uncle never had children so it’s not as traumatic.</span> <span id="s504">We had another my parents had friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to leave but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s505">They had no children.</span> <span id="s506">People with children, it was a little harder, it was a little harder to pick up.</span> <span id="s507">Imagine yourself having to totally leave.</span> <span id="s508">I mean for that time it, maybe today it isn’t.</span> <span id="s509">People are moving about the whole world.</span> <span id="s510">In those days they, they left for political reasons like my father did but then he had established himself in, and was raising a family.</span> <span id="s511">It’s not so easy but he started to think about it.</span> <span id="s512">As things progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: One last questions about historical events and then I want to figure out where your family fit in.</span> <span id="s514">The Evian Conference in 38.</span> <span id="s515">What was the reaction as best as you could tell and the Jews around you when they realized what had happened at that conference.</span> <span id="s516">Or what was not going to happen because of the conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Well, being again young not really understanding the full impact of it, other than what I heard around me, they didn’t go into these things in school.</span> <span id="s518">My I have to say my personal reaction is only what the vibe that I picked up from my family, my father especially.</span> <span id="s519">And that is the fear, fear.</span> <span id="s520">And it’s not just from that conference but from everyday living is fear, fear that the average person in this country just doesn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Explain what you mean by every day fear on an everyday basis.</span> <span id="s522">What was happening every day that made you fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Just going out.</span> <span id="s524">Having to sneak to school.</span> <span id="s525">Did you ever hear of anybody having to sneak to school.</span> <span id="s526">In Germany there are six school days.</span> <span id="s527">One of them is Saturday.</span> <span id="s528">I went to a religious school, a Jewish school .</span> <span id="s529">One did not go to school on the Sabbath but we had to get in six days of school.</span> <span id="s530">So we went on Sunday.</span> <span id="s531">Well we had to sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I mean this is just one relatively small example, although not so small.</span> <span id="s532">Carry instead of a book bag, a dress bag.</span> <span id="s533">Put a book in, lunch, no outside recess, quietly.</span> <span id="s534">Again the word surreptitiously went to school.</span> <span id="s535">Also you never knew what was going to happen to you on the outside.</span> <span id="s536">Is somebody going to pick on you.</span> <span id="s537">Is somebody going throw stones at me.</span> <span id="s538">Is somebody going to hit me.</span> <span id="s539">Is somebody call, going to call me dirty names and then as things progressed they did come into the schools, the SS people and very quietly and systematically escorted kids out of the school.</span> <span id="s540">Now I don’t know if you want to hear this now or, or as you get on with the interview, but this is all part of it.</span> <span id="s541">So you live in fear because somebody out there is out to pick on you.</span> <span id="s542">For the lack of a better word.</span> <span id="s543">I think it’s more than just picking.</span> <span id="s544">Kids get picked on all the time.</span> <span id="s545">but this is a different kind of picking on.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: When did your parents first think about getting out Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well we were my father was offered to leave Germany in 1936 because he had one brother over here.</span> <span id="s548">But in 1936 he was still under the illusion that it would perhaps pass.</span> <span id="s549">The other thing also was that sometime around that time the uncle that we have here suggested that my father come by himself and leave my mother and his two daughters to come at a later time.</span> <span id="s550">And that was not acceptable to him.</span> <span id="s551">I may have my dates a little muddled with that.</span> <span id="s552">But instead of he basically felt when that first offer came, no I have a family.</span> <span id="s553">And my mother was totally against moving.</span> <span id="s554">How could she leave.</span> <span id="s555">Poland was not that far away.</span> <span id="s556">If she came to let’s say the US she would never get to see her parents and her family again.</span> <span id="s557">And this will pass, this, this can’t last.</span> <span id="s558">People were in total I’m not going to say denial, but disbelief.</span> <span id="s559">Denial is too strong as far as the way I understand denial means they just felt it, this can’t last.</span> <span id="s560">It can’t last.</span> <span id="s561">This will change.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: What was the straw that broke the camel’s back for your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: My uncle left in 36 or 37, 37.</span> <span id="s564">Before they ever left my father realized that he had made a mistake and that we also needed to leave and what did that.</span> <span id="s565">Totally no livelihood, number one.</span> <span id="s566">Number two the Gestapo started hounding us.</span> <span id="s567">Number three people were disappearing, people that we knew were disappearing.</span> <span id="s568">Kids were taken out from school, as I mentioned before, first very quietly, very nicely.</span> <span id="s569">And then not so nice.</span> <span id="s570">We lived in a very nice apartment building.</span> <span id="s571">You heard knocks at the door in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s572">More people were taken away.</span> <span id="s573">A few screams, screeches.</span> <span id="s574">Everything you know it was horrific.</span> <span id="s575">We heard via my father and also via friends heard of people disappearing.</span> <span id="s576">Oh they were sent to on a train to no man’s land which is out in the corridor.</span> <span id="s577">In fact that’s the word I was looking for much earlier in the tape.</span> <span id="s578">And in the winter time.</span> <span id="s579">Because winter in Germany at that time came early on, sometimes on my birthday there was snow on the ground and I was born very late in September.</span> <span id="s580">But they were sent out on a train and then chased off the train into no man’s land.</span> <span id="s581">And if they tried to come back or plead they were shot.</span> <span id="s582">These things came back to us.</span> <span id="s583">Or they froze to death or got away.</span> <span id="s584">And these things got back to me, to my parents and also to me.</span> <span id="s585">And by this time I’m already a pre-teen-er.</span> <span id="s586">Pre-teen.</span> <span id="s587">And so beginning to understand.</span> <span id="s588">But primarily for my father it was the total no job, no money coming in.</span> <span id="s589">Being released from his representation.</span> <span id="s590">And then his own business, what he did on you know himself was also nonexistent.</span> <span id="s591">And it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and threats and primarily people disappearing and what they heard.</span> <span id="s592">And never to be heard from again.</span> <span id="s593">And also other people making plans to leave because Germany at the time that we’re now at was in a state of frenzy to rid itself of Jews.</span> <span id="s594">So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his wife Alice left, we already knew that we had to also make plans.</span> <span id="s595">That’s when my father was offered the opportunity to come alone and we would be sent for later on and he said no it’s all of us or none of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: What was the deciding factor for your mother?</span> <span id="s597">When did she also accept that not to stay in Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s598">What was the last straw for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: When her husband said it’s time to make plans to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: How did your family manage without the income from the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I never knew what my father had.</span> <span id="s602">In those days you don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s603">I imagine that he had money saved up.</span> <span id="s604">He was not a rich man but he wasn’t penniless so we, he existed like that and you know he may on his own have done some business dissolving, getting rid of stock certainly with the company he was with because he was severed, but managed to get rid of whatever he had, and also was, well I’m getting ahead of it again.</span> <span id="s605">You know we’re now talking about two years of before we left that he had virtually no real income to speak of but we maintained the apartment.</span> <span id="s606">We maintained the help.</span> <span id="s607">He was able to, to do it.</span> <span id="s608">He never counted his money.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: When did he lose the income.</span> <span id="s611">You said it was two years before you left but can you give me a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I think that the, the company that he was representing was in 1936 slash 37.</span> <span id="s613">It wasn’t you know like this but, but also remember before he was let go, people weren’t buying from him.</span> <span id="s614">Well when people aren’t buying from you, you’re not generating the income so I always say two years, two years because it just ebbed away.</span> <span id="s615">And people don’t buy, you don’t’ make money, you don’t make commissions and your income ceases.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: What did they do to try to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: My father applied to well he first had to be get an affidavit from this uncle in Paterson New Jersey, Isaac Gothelf.</span> <span id="s618">He also needed to get this didn’t, none of this happens overnight.</span> <span id="s619">He also needed to get permission from the Germans to get out, permission to leave.</span> <span id="s620">Might I add that all of us with the exception of my mother who had a Polish passport were stateless.</span> <span id="s621">And I was, my sister, my father obviously was.</span> <span id="s622">SO you start putting into motion plans to leave which isn’t like going to a consulate today, get a visa and off you go.</span> <span id="s623">It’s a lot of was a lot of work and persistence.</span> <span id="s624">With the Germans definitely bribing them.</span> <span id="s625">Making so called friends with them, well let’s not call it friends, but it’s bribing them and he did that.</span> <span id="s626">He bribed, he lied.</span> <span id="s627">He did he put every trick out of his bag that he could so that we would not be taken away.</span> <span id="s628">That didn’t guarantee it.</span> <span id="s629">Did not guarantee it so he put into motion to leave.</span> <span id="s630">The affidavit from the uncle finally came.</span> <span id="s631">The permission from the Germans finally came.</span> <span id="s632">But we didn’t have a visa from the US to come and that’s where we almost didn’t make it out because the Americans didn’t want to give us a visa.</span> <span id="s633">I hate to say that.</span> <span id="s634">Sitting here in this beautiful country, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s635">And he had booked passage already for March of 39 which was changed because of a boat was being painted.</span> <span id="s636">So he changed it December of 38.</span> <span id="s637">That also didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s638">The Aquitania so then he booked it for November of 38.</span> <span id="s639">With no proper papers.</span> <span id="s640">And my mother went, my mother, my sister and I went to Poland in October of 38 which was a harrowing trip which is a story all unto itself to say goodbye to the parents, the grandparents.</span> <span id="s641">Aunts, uncles, cousins.</span> <span id="s642">And when we came home my father said we’re leaving.</span> <span id="s643">We’re definitely leaving and that was within two weeks that we came back.</span> <span id="s644">And my mother said I can’t leave.</span> <span id="s645">My curtains are wet.</span> <span id="s646">I’m not this, I’m not that.</span> <span id="s647">I’m not packed.</span> <span id="s648">I don’t have the thing.</span> <span id="s649">He said I’m sorry we have to leave.</span> <span id="s650">And we did.</span> <span id="s651">But we didn’t’ have the visa so on the Saturday before we left we still didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s652">We had pleaded, we had the way he was with the Germans because he couldn’t, didn’t bribe anybody at the American consulate.</span> <span id="s653">But he pleaded with them.</span> <span id="s654">He went every day practically.</span> <span id="s655">No visa, Mr. Salzberg, it’s a quota it’s a this, it’s a that.</span> <span id="s656">Finally he went, took my mother, my sister Ruth and me down to the consulate.</span> <span id="s657">He insisted on seeing somebody.</span> <span id="s658">He was told nobody could see him.</span> <span id="s659">He says but you are going to see me, you are going to see us.</span> <span id="s660">Somebody has to see us.</span> <span id="s661">It was very dramatic, very compelling.</span> <span id="s662">There is no way that I can even describe that scene at the American consulate in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s663">There is no way.</span> <span id="s664">I can tell you about it and it’s ever going to make the impact that it had on me anyway and I’m sure my sister and all of us, especially my father for the rest of our lives.</span> <span id="s665">This man finally let us in and we were told time and time again that you cannot have a visa today, the papers are not ready blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s666">We were like up on the fifth or sixth floor and my father said I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s667">With what’s going on we are leaving and if we are not leaving Germany we are going out that window.</span> <span id="s668">He starts pulling me, my mother and my sister over to the window.</span> <span id="s669">We were going to jump.</span> <span id="s670">He meant it because he knew that our time was up.</span> <span id="s671">We had so far been left pretty much alone.</span> <span id="s672">As far as we weren’t’ dragged away in the middle of the night like many of our neighbors, let alone friends were.</span> <span id="s673">People in school were.</span> <span id="s674">We were pretty much left alone.</span> <span id="s675">But our time was, was up.</span> <span id="s676">So this fellow who was there, Mr. Davis knew that well Mr. Salzberg meant business.</span> <span id="s677">And we did get the visa that day.</span> <span id="s678">And then the rest of it is all pretty dramatic too.</span> <span id="s679">We left.</span> <span id="s680">Am I getting ahead of myself here.</span> <span id="s681">We left a few days later.</span> <span id="s682">We got to Cologne.</span> <span id="s683">We left an apartment with furniture.</span> <span id="s684">Some things we had, my mother had sent away in anticipation of leaving.</span> <span id="s685">We, we left.</span> <span id="s686">We got to Cologne but we left the housekeeper there.</span> <span id="s687">Her name was Frau Krug and we had a little parakeet that I entrusted to her.</span> <span id="s688">And all the bens and the furniture but the parakeet to me was my most important possession that I had to leave behind.</span> <span id="s689">We got to Poland the next morning.</span> <span id="s690">My father called her up.</span> <span id="s691">I was right there with him when he called and you could see his face drain of color.</span> <span id="s692">She told him, we left at, the train left at midnight.</span> <span id="s693">At 6 AM the following morning they came and they were furious, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s694">These were the people in the black uniforms, the SS people came to take us away and when she told them that we had left they were furious.</span> <span id="s695">Absolutely furious.</span> <span id="s696">The destroyed our bedding.</span> <span id="s697">They destroyed our apartment, they trashed it.</span> <span id="s698">Bayonetted my bird, bayoneted this tiny little bird and beat her to a pulp.</span> <span id="s699">She was not a, see what she was doing anyway was illegal.</span> <span id="s700">She was, she was not a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s701">I have no idea what she was.</span> <span id="s702">But she had nowhere to go so you know for her my father said listen.</span> <span id="s703">Whatever is here is yours.</span> <span id="s704">But what are you going to do with it.</span> <span id="s705">So she was in the apartment and they didn’t’ believe her.</span> <span id="s706">They, they beat her and destroyed everything.</span> <span id="s707">And that’s how we know when they came.</span> <span id="s708">We have no other way of know.</span> <span id="s709">How would we know but for her.</span> <span id="s710">And we were very grateful to be where we were, but we were still in Germany.</span> <span id="s711">If this were five years later with telecommunications being what they became, I don’t’ know that we would have made it out.</span> <span id="s712">But we were in Germany and changed trains and came the next saga.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: What did you take with you when you left your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Me personally?</span> <span id="s715">I took a doll.</span> <span id="s716">I took my autograph book which I still have and I took my diary and whatever my mother packed.</span> <span id="s717">That’s it.</span> <span id="s718">Some pictures.</span> <span id="s719">That’s what I took, but most importantly my autograph book and my diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And then what happened to you after, the next step for your journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: We had to get to Paris.</span> <span id="s722">Then we came to the border in Aachen and the Germans gave us one last send off.</span> <span id="s723">Took my father off the train as they came through to check the papers.</span> <span id="s724">You don’t dare move in Europe.</span> <span id="s725">There are compartments and from each compartment.</span> <span id="s726">Remember we were not the only ones running.</span> <span id="s727">There were many people on the train, some with no luggage but many people like us.</span> <span id="s728">But they took my father off the train and you don’t dare move.</span> <span id="s729">Every time we moved we had everything or my mother or anybody that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed at you and he’s ready.</span> <span id="s730">Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father.</span> <span id="s731">He’s talking and he’s very animated and we had no idea.</span> <span id="s732">All of a sudden they say the train is going to move and it started to, move, start to move along slowly and we’re hysterical.</span> <span id="s733">There we are.</span> <span id="s734">My mother and two kids and no husband.</span> <span id="s735">He’s still talking to the Germans.</span> <span id="s736">Finally we saw him run and he got on the last what do they call it, the end of the train.</span> <span id="s737">The man was 40 years old, suffered from high blood pressure.</span> <span id="s738">That he didn’t have a heart attack then was amazing.</span> <span id="s739">What did they want from him.</span> <span id="s740">When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too much money on him.</span> <span id="s741">So he said well then take it.</span> <span id="s742">We don’t do that.</span> <span id="s743">They didn’t’ offer him an alternative.</span> <span id="s744">He says well why can’t you take it.</span> <span id="s745">He says we are honest, we are honest people.</span> <span id="s746">We don’t take money.</span> <span id="s747">Well he had to come up with an alternative.</span> <span id="s748">He says well then I’ll send it to Hamburg, to the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s749">Is that all right.</span> <span id="s750">at first they said no and then they said yes.</span> <span id="s751">But of course you know that she never got the money.</span> <span id="s752">And we’re not talking about a whole lot of money because he came out with next to nothing.</span> <span id="s753">That’s how, that was our goodbye and then once we crossed the border people started opening up.</span> <span id="s754">You know once we were sure there were no more Germans, now we’re in Holland, Belgium.</span> <span id="s755">We’re on our way to Paris.</span> <span id="s756">So we were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: What was the exact date you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: We left Hamburg on November sixth going to the seventh of 1938, just about the last legal train.</span> <span id="s759">When I say legal, yeah legal.</span> <span id="s760">Not too many people came out after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: I’m going to pause now and change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">(file 2 – RG-50.106.0077.02.03 – duration: 01:14:16) Esther Finder: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s763">Today’s date is September 15.</span> <span id="s764">This is a continuation of the September 8th interview with Jutta Levy.</span> <span id="s765">This is tape 2, side A.</span> <span id="s766">You have been telling me about your escape from Germany.</span> <span id="s767">But I wanted to go back and ask about something you had said previously about the last trip to Poland.</span> <span id="s768">YOU said it was a harrowing trip.</span> <span id="s769">Can you tell me about that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Jutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother.</span> <span id="s771">She wanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives.</span> <span id="s772">So she took my sister and of course me, back to Poland.</span> <span id="s773">Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get on the train and you have to go through no man’s land.</span> <span id="s774">That’s that stretch of land at that time, that was quote unquote free.</span> <span id="s775">That meant passing borders.</span> <span id="s776">You’re going through border.</span> <span id="s777">Every border stop is a stop and the officials come on board.</span> <span id="s778">Well at that time, this is late 38, the Germans of course, the Nazis come on board and searched, questioned, very body on the train.</span> <span id="s779">I didn’t know at the time what strip search meant.</span> <span id="s780">I was a little past 12 years old and I found that out in a big hurry.</span> <span id="s781">Because of a matronly German woman took the women aside and strip searched them.</span> <span id="s782">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s783">And if anybody has ever been strip searched and especially by an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine what that was like.</span> <span id="s784">Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal.</span> <span id="s785">It is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that’s all I’m going to say about that.</span> <span id="s786">I think one can imagine what that was like.</span> <span id="s787">They made it difficult.</span> <span id="s788">They let us go but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening.</span> <span id="s789">I was dreading the trip back home because I hadn’t even gotten there yet because I was afraid that I’d have to go through that again.</span> <span id="s790">But mercifully I did not.</span> <span id="s791">They were very thorough about checking our luggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated.</span> <span id="s792">But it was going out of Germany to Poland.</span> <span id="s793">Why they didn’t do it on the way back quite in that manner I don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s794">It’s was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was.</span> <span id="s795">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s796">they were angry people that, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train.</span> <span id="s797">Just to be never heard from again which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of.</span> <span id="s798">Again, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s799">Sometimes not knowing a lot of things, not knowing what had already been done is a blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: I’m going to ask you.</span> <span id="s801">You just said a moment ago that they had already done, they had already thrown people off the train.</span> <span id="s802">Can you clarify that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: in Hamburg where we lived as I said previously people began disappearing.</span> <span id="s804">Especially people, Aust Juden which are the Jews from eastern Europe began disappearing.</span> <span id="s805">My parents for instance had a couple.</span> <span id="s806">I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who disappeared.</span> <span id="s807">We learned later on I learned later on.</span> <span id="s808">My parents knew even before that they were rounded up.</span> <span id="s809">They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man’s land in the dead of winter.</span> <span id="s810">Told to get off at a given point.</span> <span id="s811">Oh they weren’t the only ones.</span> <span id="s812">There were hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s813">Told to get off the train.</span> <span id="s814">And just let go.</span> <span id="s815">Chased off the train, let go, in the dead of winter.</span> <span id="s816">If the people didn’t move fast enough for them, they were shot.</span> <span id="s817">If they managed to get away, who knows where they went.</span> <span id="s818">Some managed to escape to other parts of the world.</span> <span id="s819">Others froze to death.</span> <span id="s820">Others were shot to death.</span> <span id="s821">These stories have been documented.</span> <span id="s822">These stories my father found out and I did to after a time.</span> <span id="s823">At the time that I’m talking about now when we went legally to Poland, legally to Poland.</span> <span id="s824">I mean they could have done what they wanted to.</span> <span id="s825">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s826">At the time we did not know what had already been, the atrocities that had already been committed.</span> <span id="s827">We didn’t’ know.</span> <span id="s828">Communications as I’ve said before was certainly nothing like it, not anywhere near what it is today.</span> <span id="s829">Had it been I don’t think I’d be having this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: When you got to your relatives in Poland, what was that visit like?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Heart wrenching.</span> <span id="s832">Very heart wrenching.</span> <span id="s833">Not because of any dark premonitions, certainly not on my grandparents, my relatives side.</span> <span id="s834">In fact my grandfather was a very intelligent very this is not my maternal grandfather who is a professional man.</span> <span id="s835">Very far sighted very ahead of the times.</span> <span id="s836">But he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland.</span> <span id="s837">What was happening in Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews.</span> <span id="s838">But living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country here.</span> <span id="s839">He just felt that it might pass.</span> <span id="s840">But he also fully understood why we had to leave given the circumstances I’ve described before.</span> <span id="s841">Lack of making a living, the name calling the anti-Semitism is a mild word for what was happening.</span> <span id="s842">The burning destruction of synagogues.</span> <span id="s843">He was well aware of that.</span> <span id="s844">So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was sad to let us go.</span> <span id="s845">Not just him, all the family.</span> <span id="s846">It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so for my mother and it was for my sister and me too.</span> <span id="s847">I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older and I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents, my maternal and my paternal grandmother in her, on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s848">What was also very heart breaking I might add is that my father, my late father was never able to go back because of the reasons I stated before.</span> <span id="s849">Especially for his mother and his side of the family.</span> <span id="s850">Realizing that we were leaving, realizing that perhaps they would never see him again was conveyed and understood by me even at my young age.</span> <span id="s851">So that whole trip was very fast.</span> <span id="s852">We didn’t’ stay long.</span> <span id="s853">And again very, very heart wrenching.</span> <span id="s854">Sad, sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Did you notice any changes in the social attitudes toward Jews in Poland at that visit</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No.</span> <span id="s857">At that visit I wasn’t even exposed all that much.</span> <span id="s858">We mainly visited.</span> <span id="s859">I also vested with my girlfriend and I had friends over there but especially one who also did survive.</span> <span id="s860">Her family did not.</span> <span id="s861">No I can’t honestly say.</span> <span id="s862">My grandmother still, my maternal grandmother still had help in the house.</span> <span id="s863">MY grandfather’s practice was continuing on.</span> <span id="s864">No I can’t say at that, don’t’ forget.</span> <span id="s865">They were always somewhat anti-Semitic, some a great deal Anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s866">I never felt it to that extent.</span> <span id="s867">After all I was a visitor.</span> <span id="s868">And by a visitor I mean visited family and loved ones and was loved in return so maybe we were shielded, although I don’t’ think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Did your cousin or your friend ask you about what was happening in your life back in Germany during that visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Oh yeah they did.</span> <span id="s871">And as best I could explained, especially about they were interested in the school, what was happening in school.</span> <span id="s872">What was happening to some of the friends that I had back in Hamburg who a lot of them at that point already weren’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s873">They had either emigrated or were taken away.</span> <span id="s874">and of course their fate was unknown to me at that time as with a lot of them even to this day their fate is unknown to me.</span> <span id="s875">So yes they asked and as best I could, as, as kids we’re all we were all the same age.</span> <span id="s876">I had explained to them and they were interested in what was going on thinking surely this would never come into their lives.</span> <span id="s877">Little did they know but a few months later they marched in, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s878">Into Poland.</span> <span id="s879">And their lives changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: You told me about leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s881">And I wanted to ask you to think back and just once more reflect about the moment when you were out of Nazi Occupied territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Unbelievable as I have told you.</span> <span id="s883">First of all the relief of my father getting back on the train.</span> <span id="s884">Knowing that momentarily we were crossing into a place that was not Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s885">It’s hard to explain when you realize that you can say something without being fearful, being afraid.</span> <span id="s886">I told you that life had become full of fear, nervous stomach, that kind of fear.</span> <span id="s887">People here are people in general unless they went through a similar experience can’t understand.</span> <span id="s888">It’s not fear of an exam, it’s not fear of, it’s a totally different fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: With respect to that fear that you’re just describing.</span> <span id="s890">You mentioned a nervous stomach.</span> <span id="s891">Were there are any other symptoms or manifestations of this fear that you can remember from your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Me personally.</span> <span id="s893">That nervous stomach that developed when I was a kid has stayed with me to this day, to me.</span> <span id="s894">I can’t attribute hyper, I suffer from hyper tension.</span> <span id="s895">I can’t attribute that to it, although my father developed hyper tension there.</span> <span id="s896">And ultimately actually died from that because we didn’t’ have the drugs that they have today for it.</span> <span id="s897">But he had hypertension, I have hypertension.</span> <span id="s898">It’s an inherited thing probably.</span> <span id="s899">But I’m more keenly aware of a nervous stomach which I developed and I still have it.</span> <span id="s900">I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s901">it’s fear even to this day of a uniform.</span> <span id="s902">My father had a business here downtown and I’m digressing a little bit and he made friends with all the police which was in downtown Washington years and years and years ago.</span> <span id="s903">Every time a police man would come up to collect for something or just to come up and say hello, my father froze.</span> <span id="s904">Every time a uniform came in during the war.</span> <span id="s905">A friend of mine was in uniform, whether it be army or navy uniform, especially officers, he froze.</span> <span id="s906">Momentarily and I have to tell you I do too.</span> <span id="s907">And I wasn’t, I had friends that were in the service, but the moment when you see a uniform that is the fear that developed over a period of time and you live under a regime for that many years.</span> <span id="s908">six years is a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Often times children will have nightmares if they’re anxious about something.</span> <span id="s910">Is that something that was true in your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s912">And this was before we left.</span> <span id="s913">When you hear footsteps at night on marble floors, boots, and they’re not, you don’t know but they’re not stopping at your door but they are stopping someplace else and you hear conversations and it gets loud you can’t help but take this with you when you go to sleep or if you’re awakened by it.</span> <span id="s914">It’s hard then to go back to sleep.</span> <span id="s915">Sure.</span> <span id="s916">It’s a, it was a fearful frightful I don’t know how else to say it time in my life.</span> <span id="s917">I can seek for myself.</span> <span id="s918">Not knowing all the ramifications but knowing enough to be afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Let’s go back to your trip out of Germany.</span> <span id="s920">Tell me about route through Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: We went by way of Aachen.</span> <span id="s922">It’s near the border where my father was taken off the train.</span> <span id="s923">And once you are through that you’re in Belgium.</span> <span id="s924">And there’s another stop and more uniforms come in.</span> <span id="s925">The uniforms at this point though are Belgian officials who spoke French and not German.</span> <span id="s926">So once we got past that and they were, they were official, they were to the point but even though we were fearful but there was nothing really to be afraid of at that point but as I said before, you don’t get over that.</span> <span id="s927">Once we got through that border, don’t’ forget there were many other people on the train in the compartments other than us that were on the run.</span> <span id="s928">Some with only the clothes on their back, no luggage even.</span> <span id="s929">But then they started to talk a little bit.</span> <span id="s930">Without fearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn’t politically correct.</span> <span id="s931">And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out.</span> <span id="s932">In the most ingenious way.</span> <span id="s933">I remember one lady had I don’t’ know if it was a coat or a jacket but her big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a half a dollar and she was so proud of herself, as well she should have been, that she was able to smuggle out diamonds that were hidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed.</span> <span id="s934">But in retrospect how she got away with that.</span> <span id="s935">How they didn’t, I mean this was just one.</span> <span id="s936">People had other ways of bringing things across.</span> <span id="s937">But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s938">That they were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were saying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn’t been able to do all these years.</span> <span id="s939">Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they felt they were with somebody that they could trust and they couldn’t trust them.</span> <span id="s940">That was another thing.</span> <span id="s941">So you know it goes on and on.</span> <span id="s942">It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people like myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this.</span> <span id="s943">And believe it or not, even to this day and I’m almost 71, even to this day I can say that (fully?)</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">I can say that.</span> <span id="s946">I can be critical.</span> <span id="s947">I have never ever taken that for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Continue on with your trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: So we then came to the rest of it was uneventful.</span> <span id="s950">When I say uneventful, nothing is uneventful and you’re sitting with people that were running away from a dictatorship such as we were running away from so nothing is uneventful.</span> <span id="s951">But we don’t want to be repetitious.</span> <span id="s952">I don’t want to be.</span> <span id="s953">We got to Paris where my mother had her brother there and we stayed there waiting for the Queen Mary to take us to America.</span> <span id="s954">While we were in Paris, an incident happened that really changed the rest of Germany forever.</span> <span id="s955">And that was the young Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s956">He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attaché in Paris of the German embassy.</span> <span id="s957">Most people are, historians are very much aware of that.</span> <span id="s958">This of course caused a tremendous upheaval in Germany and that is a, it culminated what they call here now Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of frustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record and have said it before.</span> <span id="s959">That was the culmination this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass.</span> <span id="s960">They had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that year and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s961">I heard oh yes, store fronts being broken into.</span> <span id="s962">And I knew of book burnings.</span> <span id="s963">I saw some of it.</span> <span id="s964">And I what I think we mean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then.</span> <span id="s965">But it was the culmination of and so I only want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of Germany at the time that we did.</span> <span id="s966">After that we would not have been a relatively no it wasn’t easy, but it would not have been let’s say legally to use that term.</span> <span id="s967">Because we left legally.</span> <span id="s968">We had proper papers.</span> <span id="s969">After that there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s970">He was done with, Hitler was done with German Jews.</span> <span id="s971">If he hadn’t annihilated them if we hadn’t gotten out, their life wasn’t worth a plugged nickel.</span> <span id="s972">Because shortly thereafter he moved into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: While you were in Paris and your hearing this news, what was the reaction of people around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: First of all my father was appalled.</span> <span id="s975">I keep referring to my father because he was a very strong influence in my life.</span> <span id="s976">He was, I listened.</span> <span id="s977">I listened.</span> <span id="s978">When he and my uncle and other, we had other relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had happened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did.</span> <span id="s979">It also was with some relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did.</span> <span id="s980">And I mean almost to the minute, I wouldn’t’ be talking to you today.</span> <span id="s981">We got out just at the nick of time, six hours before the Gestapo came to my house.</span> <span id="s982">That this young man chose that day that week to shoot the German attaché, causing tremendous uproar in Germany, and the fact that we were no longer there was very fortunate for us.</span> <span id="s983">So yeah we had there was a tremendous amount of relief.</span> <span id="s984">On my father, my parents’ part and of course transcended to me.</span> <span id="s985">And even though I might have left with a lot of sadness leaving behind friends and stuff.</span> <span id="s986">And a life.</span> <span id="s987">I having had it explained to me what was going on at that point and papers being full of it, radio, I was to tell you that I was pretty happy being out of there.</span> <span id="s988">Naturally not knowing what was facing us in a new country, in a new life, but still we did not have to fear for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s989">There were other fears.</span> <span id="s990">So yes, generally that’s the reaction.</span> <span id="s991">And again I’m talking as someone who at that point was 12, a little over 12 years old.</span> <span id="s992">So I am, my reactions were through my parents and other relatives that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind on your stay there in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: My father had a cousin in Paris who lived outside Paris.</span> <span id="s995">Their name was Gothelf.</span> <span id="s996">The first cousin was a well-known artist there, Sam Zamush Gothelf, a well-known artist.</span> <span id="s997">He had a son, 12 years old and here I meet this handsome young fellow.</span> <span id="s998">He was about 15, 16 at the time.</span> <span id="s999">And at 12 years old the hormones already are working a little bit so of course I immediately fell in love with this young cousin.</span> <span id="s1000">He wrote a beautiful poem in my autograph book.</span> <span id="s1001">Remember I never go anywhere without my autograph book.</span> <span id="s1002">He was also an artist.</span> <span id="s1003">He even drew a beautiful little picture.</span> <span id="s1004">A forlorn seashore because we were leaving and turns out that this cousin we heard later who I really liked so very much.</span> <span id="s1005">His name was Guy, Guy, G-U-Y.</span> <span id="s1006">Joined the resistance and was shot as was his father.</span> <span id="s1007">And needless to say although I found this out several years later, it saddened me deeply.</span> <span id="s1008">He was, they were talented lovely, lovely people.</span> <span id="s1009">And especially the young fellow who I, who I liked so much.</span> <span id="s1010">Actually I would say that was my first real crush.</span> <span id="s1011">So the other thing leaving there we had to go to Cherbourg.</span> <span id="s1012">And everything happens at night.</span> <span id="s1013">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1014">Late at night we got to Cherbourg, got on a tender.</span> <span id="s1015">Everything was black.</span> <span id="s1016">Everything was sort of blacked out.</span> <span id="s1017">And all of a sudden this humongous monster appears in the water.</span> <span id="s1018">And that was the Queen Mary with a few little lights here and there.</span> <span id="s1019">This huge to me then and of course it is huge ship out there that we had to get on.</span> <span id="s1020">And I have to tell you I was scared to death, but we got on the ship and started our voyage across.</span> <span id="s1021">In November, the middle of November when the seas are pretty rough.</span> <span id="s1022">So and we along with many other people left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Anybody stand out in your mind who was on the ship with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: As a matter of fact, I have pictures, tiny little pictures.</span> <span id="s1025">There was a couple and I don’t’ know if, where in Germany they were from, but they were from Germany that traveled and left as we did.</span> <span id="s1026">Basically the same circumstances that were traveling with very, very young children, babes in arms and I do have a picture of them.</span> <span id="s1027">Because I, I loved autographs and pictures if I could get them.</span> <span id="s1028">And I do believe they also wrote in my autograph book.</span> <span id="s1029">They stand out because I, even though I don’t’ know where they came from but traveling with very, very young children into an unknown situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Did you make any friends on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No other than, well acquaintances but nothing lasting.</span> <span id="s1032">It’s weird that on the same ship which I found out later was a school mate of mine who boarded the ship before I did because the ship came, the Queen Mary came from Southampton to Cherbourg.</span> <span id="s1033">She boarded.</span> <span id="s1034">She and her family boarded the ship in Southampton.</span> <span id="s1035">They left before I did but we never ran into each other.</span> <span id="s1036">That ship is a big one, was a big one, still is.</span> <span id="s1037">I’ve been back on it when it was in Long Beach, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Tell me about arriving in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: That is quite something.</span> <span id="s1040">We got on deck at 7:00 in the morning that the ship was coming into the New York harbor and it was misty, it was cold, it was gray.</span> <span id="s1041">As I expected it would be.</span> <span id="s1042">And I don’t know because I think life was gray and kind of sad at that point.</span> <span id="s1043">The thing that was pointed out to us was the Statue of Liberty and I had heard about it but vaguely.</span> <span id="s1044">And I couldn’t’ tell you if I knew the significance of it but I soon learned because people were talking about it.</span> <span id="s1045">and to see the Statue of Liberty and people talking about what it meant that we are now free and to pursue, to, to worship, to all the things that it really stands for.</span> <span id="s1046">To have people talk about it in German because that’s all I spoke at the time, that was quite a moment.</span> <span id="s1047">Thinking back on it now.</span> <span id="s1048">Getting off the ship was quite something else again.</span> <span id="s1049">My father got down on his hands and knees and he kissed the concrete ground as he came off the boat.</span> <span id="s1050">And that’s a moment I won’t forget.</span> <span id="s1051">The next thing that I saw was a stevedore that just that one stevedore.</span> <span id="s1052">I remember.</span> <span id="s1053">He was black and I had not seen too many black people before.</span> <span id="s1054">In fact I hadn’t, I had seen one.</span> <span id="s1055">And he was in flowing robes and sort of a diplomat in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1056">So and then at first not seeing my relatives, well I mean I had never met them, you know and then my father pointed out over there his brother and his two brothers actually.</span> <span id="s1057">The one that had left before us and the one that had been here for many years.</span> <span id="s1058">I have no other impressions.</span> <span id="s1059">It was very overwhelming, very, very overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1060">And if you want me to continue on in that vein.</span> <span id="s1061">The uncle was there that had signed our affidavit.</span> <span id="s1062">We went to his home.</span> <span id="s1063">we spent one night there and I was separated from my parents which was almost as traumatic as that whole experience of leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s1064">So if you want me to continue on that I’d be glad to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: I’d like you to reflect on some of the difficulties in general.</span> <span id="s1066">I don’t’ need it necessarily day by day account, but overall what were the difficulties that you had adjusting to life in the United States</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: To begin with it was awful.</span> <span id="s1068">Because as I started to tell you, I was here one day, new country, new language, new everything and my parents went off to Detroit Michigan where my father’s two brothers were and I was to go with this great aunt and uncle who lived in Washington, DC, people that I didn’t’ know, really never heard of them, but this was my grandmother Salzberg, my paternal grandmother’s sister and her husband who said that they would take me because there was not enough room for me in Detroit.</span> <span id="s1069">So since I was the older of the two daughters, I was the one that was elected to go with them.</span> <span id="s1070">Now coming to a new country, being here one day, at most two days and one night and then leaving my parents and my sister was t, do you use the word traumatic.</span> <span id="s1071">It was traumatic.</span> <span id="s1072">I came here with them on the train.</span> <span id="s1073">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s1074">They didn’t’ understand me, I didn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s1075">They talked Yiddish but German and Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn’t used to it you don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1076">And they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn’t understand and I had to go with them.</span> <span id="s1077">And nobody’s going to feel sorry for me because they had a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s1078">they were very well heeled people.</span> <span id="s1079">He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington.</span> <span id="s1080">And so I don’t want anybody feeling sorry for me.</span> <span id="s1081">I just felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s1082">It was my heart was aching.</span> <span id="s1083">I was alone.</span> <span id="s1084">I felt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned.</span> <span id="s1085">And so I was not a happy person when I first came here.</span> <span id="s1086">And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well.</span> <span id="s1087">The Ulmans, U-L-M-A-N.</span> <span id="s1088">They were very good to me.</span> <span id="s1089">They were generous.</span> <span id="s1090">But I was very unhappy and very lonesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: We have to pause so we can change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, I’m interviewing Jutta Levy.</span> <span id="s1093">This is tape 2, side b and you were telling me about being separated from your parents and your sister and coming to the Washington DC area with other relatives.</span> <span id="s1094">How long did you stay apart from your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: About nine months.</span> <span id="s1096">Nine months.</span> <span id="s1097">Yeah and I want to say that I was comfortable.</span> <span id="s1098">I had, my physical needs were taken care of.</span> <span id="s1099">I was treated very well.</span> <span id="s1100">They sent me to the Americanization school.</span> <span id="s1101">They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes.</span> <span id="s1102">Not much, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1103">They had other family here from his side.</span> <span id="s1104">He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife my aunt, great aunt I might say that part.</span> <span id="s1105">So his he had family here and they weren’t too nice to me but I frankly didn’t’ realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the Americanization school.</span> <span id="s1106">Downtown at 13th and New York Avenue.</span> <span id="s1107">The building is still standing.</span> <span id="s1108">So I was put in with, I was the only kid there.</span> <span id="s1109">They were all adults.</span> <span id="s1110">To say that I disliked it is putting it mildly.</span> <span id="s1111">I hated it.</span> <span id="s1112">And I don’t think I got a whole lot out of it because I was frankly unhappy.</span> <span id="s1113">I cried a lot.</span> <span id="s1114">I cried myself to sleep.</span> <span id="s1115">I don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1116">I woke up crying.</span> <span id="s1117">I was lonesome.</span> <span id="s1118">They tried very hard.</span> <span id="s1119">I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought I was happy.</span> <span id="s1120">They had a business here.</span> <span id="s1121">He took me to the business with him.</span> <span id="s1122">I had no chores to do.</span> <span id="s1123">I basically had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1124">I would go the Americanization school which was not a good experience for me.</span> <span id="s1125">They didn’t put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not.</span> <span id="s1126">But that’s how it went.</span> <span id="s1127">If my father called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few months later he did make a trip to Washington to see me.</span> <span id="s1128">I did not see my mother that whole time.</span> <span id="s1129">And he came here and he promised that as soon as he could establish himself somewhere and he was hopeful it would be other than Detroit.</span> <span id="s1130">He didn’t’ like Detroit.</span> <span id="s1131">We would all get, be together again and at that time he looked around Washington and he really liked it but he at that time had no knowledge of how he would arrange making a living and coming here.</span> <span id="s1132">So he went back to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1133">About nine months later, maybe a little more but let’s say nine, nine and a half months later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to New York.</span> <span id="s1134">My mother had some cousins there.</span> <span id="s1135">And he felt maybe that would be better.</span> <span id="s1136">He didn’t’ like Detroit, didn’t like what was going on there between the brothers, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1137">And he came to New York and once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also.</span> <span id="s1138">And he came and he got me.</span> <span id="s1139">And from a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Northwest Washington I went with my, I went to a walk up apartment at 91st and Amsterdam Avenue.</span> <span id="s1140">Right along with the bedbugs, rats and the mice.</span> <span id="s1141">But you know what I was happy cause we were all together at this point.</span> <span id="s1142">Then he started to, he started to look for work do work.</span> <span id="s1143">He sold hair ribbons, stockings.</span> <span id="s1144">If he made two dollars he would spend it to buy then made two more dollars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we could eat and have the rent.</span> <span id="s1145">We had very little money.</span> <span id="s1146">We did not come here with bundles of money.</span> <span id="s1147">He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things like that.</span> <span id="s1148">And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work.</span> <span id="s1149">Without getting too wordy on this.</span> <span id="s1150">About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position representing a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany.</span> <span id="s1151">For the territory that encompassed Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</span> <span id="s1152">So he started thinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was to represent.</span> <span id="s1153">And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York.</span> <span id="s1154">He didn’t’ love it, but he did love Washington.</span> <span id="s1155">A good reason.</span> <span id="s1156">It was a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1157">It was cleaner at that time.</span> <span id="s1158">Than New York and very much like Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1159">He always used to say it reminded him, it was that type of city.</span> <span id="s1160">So I would say within a year’s time we made a move here.</span> <span id="s1161">And I might add, I did start public school in New York.</span> <span id="s1162">In those days they put you in class.</span> <span id="s1163">It was sink or swim.</span> <span id="s1164">Or is it swim or sink.</span> <span id="s1165">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1166">But I was put into sixth grade which of course I promptly flunked because I didn’t know how to talk but I did have a young girl in my class.</span> <span id="s1167">I know her name because she did an autograph.</span> <span id="s1168">May Corbet who was a black girl who helped me.</span> <span id="s1169">The only person in that class in New York that helped me.</span> <span id="s1170">How I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1171">I guess with sign language and little by little I started to learn English.</span> <span id="s1172">I also listened to the radio a lot.</span> <span id="s1173">And went to the movies a lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s1174">Because that was an escape.</span> <span id="s1175">And it was, and I liked it.</span> <span id="s1176">I was a movie fan in Germany and just a fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the movies a lot.</span> <span id="s1177">In New York and of course continued it here.</span> <span id="s1178">But I did lose some schooling along the way.</span> <span id="s1179">Number one I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s1180">Number two I flunked and but here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Can you give me a time frame.</span> <span id="s1182">When did you first arrive in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: We came here, it’s, it was 17th, 17th of November.</span> <span id="s1184">Into, we came to America the 17th of November 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: What was the time frame that you were in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I was here from then, maybe two days later, maybe the 19th until the summer of 39.</span> <span id="s1187">So from November I was with the aunt and uncle until the summer of 39.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Where were you when you first heard about the German invasion of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: We were at that time already in New York.</span> <span id="s1190">That was in August of 39 I believe.</span> <span id="s1191">No.</span> <span id="s1192">I think, well I think I was I think I was already with my parents.</span> <span id="s1193">I’m not 100% sure.</span> <span id="s1194">It may well I must have been.</span> <span id="s1195">I don’t really recollect 100%.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Can you recall, what was the sense in this country to the news coming out of what is now war torn Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: What was my, my no I remember I’m a teenager at this point.</span> <span id="s1198">I want to just go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1199">I have in my possession and I remember getting when we first came to Washington, so we were already in Washington.</span> <span id="s1200">Sketchy mail, maybe a postcard from my family in Poland.</span> <span id="s1201">You know my father’s mother wrote and her family wrote for her and my grandfather wrote.</span> <span id="s1202">So we were already in Washington when we heard about the invasion of Poland.</span> <span id="s1203">And I have to say that it was devastating news to my parents.</span> <span id="s1204">Hearing that the Germans had marched into Poland.</span> <span id="s1205">We then knew nothing further.</span> <span id="s1206">As far as the what happened in Europe, in all of Europe as it became war torn, it was a tragedy it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1207">Again what happened other than the, the fact that I had so much family in Poland but the fact that I had friends over here who at that point being 17, 18 years old drafted into the army or signing up for the army maybe, whatever going into service.</span> <span id="s1208">And some of them never to come back.</span> <span id="s1209">Or hearing almost immediately they were killed.</span> <span id="s1210">Because already I’m a, at this point I’m a teenager too.</span> <span id="s1211">And I again have friends that went off to war and never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: During the time between the beginning of the war, with the attack on Poland being a time when American got involved, is there anything in that time frame that stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Primarily the fact that my parents tried very hard to get in touch with their families in Poland.</span> <span id="s1214">Never hearing again.</span> <span id="s1215">There was conversation that things were very difficult in Poland for our families there.</span> <span id="s1216">We did not and I reiterate did not know all the ramifications of what was happening.</span> <span id="s1217">But we knew I should say the adults, my parents knew that whatever it was, it wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s1218">And having escaped from that regime ourselves, we knew that whatever was happening wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s1219">It was a constant fear of what was happening over there.</span> <span id="s1220">To our families.</span> <span id="s1221">And we’re talking Poland specifically.</span> <span id="s1222">My father was a news hound.</span> <span id="s1223">He liked, he wanted to listen to the radio constantly when he wasn’t, when he was home.</span> <span id="s1224">WE didn’t dare talk while he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was of what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s1225">Primarily in Europe and more specifically in Poland.</span> <span id="s1226">And not a whole to came out.</span> <span id="s1227">Again, given the lack of knowledge as far as communication is concerned as we know it today.</span> <span id="s1228">Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became known but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland.</span> <span id="s1229">It was a progression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today.</span> <span id="s1230">And we all know it.</span> <span id="s1231">Poland was not the only stop he made.</span> <span id="s1232">He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for news and for us specifically.</span> <span id="s1233">But of course my father became agitated every country that he went into.</span> <span id="s1234">That Hitler went into, he was agitated.</span> <span id="s1235">And he was in a constant state of agitation and frustration.</span> <span id="s1236">And also making a living, making a living.</span> <span id="s1237">My mother worked and at 14 I went to work.</span> <span id="s1238">I don’t know what else to say about that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Do you remember Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Oh definitely.</span> <span id="s1241">Certainly.</span> <span id="s1242">It was on a Sunday of course as everybody knows.</span> <span id="s1243">If you must know I was taking a bath.</span> <span id="s1244">We were four people.</span> <span id="s1245">At that time we were already in a two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1246">To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1247">And shortly before Pearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath.</span> <span id="s1248">And I heard my father about that time yelling that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s1249">And I did not know where Pearl Harbor was.</span> <span id="s1250">Obviously he did.</span> <span id="s1251">And I quickly got out and I thought what’s going on, what’s going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US possession or protectorate.</span> <span id="s1252">I don’t know what you call it.</span> <span id="s1253">And essentially we would be at war with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1254">I have to tell you though that there was a little bit of a lilt to him, to my dad because he felt that once the Japanese, once America and at that time Roosevelt had not been declared but he and his friends and there was lots of talking going on.</span> <span id="s1255">Once they declared war on the Japanese, as certainly they did it wouldn’t be too long before we would declare war on Germany.</span> <span id="s1256">And they were waiting for that, they were waiting for that.</span> <span id="s1257">As much as people didn’t want to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we too felt better get in there.</span> <span id="s1258">Have to put a stop to what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1259">So it was horrible, horrible, horrible.</span> <span id="s1260">And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days.</span> <span id="s1261">First Japan, then Germany and of course we knew about the Blitzkrieg and we at this time knew I don’t want to jump ahead of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: At this time you knew, you want to finish that sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Yeah we knew that certainly not all of what was going on in the camps or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1264">You know we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1265">We knew some, we knew some.</span> <span id="s1266">We didn’t know to what extent our own families were involved in that.</span> <span id="s1267">We didn’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1268">But we knew there were evil things going on all over Europe where Hitler had invaded and we certainly knew about, we knew about the French, his marching into France.</span> <span id="s1269">And we certainly knew about the Blitzkrieg between the bombings of London and Britain and what was going on over there.</span> <span id="s1270">We did.</span> <span id="s1271">I mean we had news commentators, radio, newspapers so we certainly were aware and it was for that reason people felt, people like my father I don’t want to include all Americans, felt that it was time that the Americans took a stand and got involved also.</span> <span id="s1272">To save Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or any anti-foreign sentiment in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Not Anti-Semitism as I knew it.</span> <span id="s1275">Anti-Semitism as I knew it in Germany, no.</span> <span id="s1276">No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1277">Anti-refugee.</span> <span id="s1278">Anti-refugee, anti-refugee.</span> <span id="s1279">You know we’re foreigners.</span> <span id="s1280">For several years I had a guttural accent.</span> <span id="s1281">Germany was not popular.</span> <span id="s1282">Having a guttural German accent, didn’t exactly make me queen of the day.</span> <span id="s1283">I fought hard and bitter to lose it, got into fights.</span> <span id="s1284">Kids made fun of me.</span> <span id="s1285">People that I’m friends with to this day made fun of me and I had, I was a tomboy.</span> <span id="s1286">I had fights with them.</span> <span id="s1287">I’d beat them up, they’d beat me up.</span> <span id="s1288">As far as anti-refugee as my parents ex, might have experienced it, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1289">My father was a personable man, a likeable person.</span> <span id="s1290">Straightforward, honest man and he made a living, starting to make a living, worked hard.</span> <span id="s1291">My mother did and as I said I went to work at 14 myself.</span> <span id="s1292">But I knew that if I wanted to get along, and wanted to belong that I needed to learn English.</span> <span id="s1293">And I did so in record speed I might add, although at the time it didn’t seem like it but I did.</span> <span id="s1294">But I have people here friends to this day.</span> <span id="s1295">I was just with one of them that remembers when I really couldn’t speak the language as I am speaking to you today.</span> <span id="s1296">But once I did, and it’s been many years and I speak without an accent.</span> <span id="s1297">Once I got over that there was no I didn’t experience that anymore.</span> <span id="s1298">(pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: I want to ask you when did you begin to realize what was happening or what had happened to the Jews in Nazi occupied Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Well in Germany of course we knew.</span> <span id="s1301">Because we left.</span> <span id="s1302">So we know more or less what had happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1303">As far as the countries that he occupied.</span> <span id="s1304">For instance in for us more importantly Poland, we got a phone call.</span> <span id="s1305">We knew that things were not good.</span> <span id="s1306">Things had started to come out.</span> <span id="s1307">My father was very, very concerned.</span> <span id="s1308">My parents were about, and other people, but we’re specifically talking about my family.</span> <span id="s1309">We knew that many evil things had gone on there and I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else.</span> <span id="s1310">Just how bad and how our families were affected, we really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1311">It was a nightmare that was going to come true.</span> <span id="s1312">Then we got a telephone call from Sweden, from mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1313">Flora Kerner at that time.</span> <span id="s1314">And, telling us that she and my, her daughter my cousin, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in our family had perished.</span> <span id="s1315">I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees because he was so very emotionally upset, drained.</span> <span id="s1316">And very other thing that you can name.</span> <span id="s1317">It wasn’t a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in gaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his worst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: When did you get this phone call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Very shortly after my aunt had my cousin were liberated from Bergen Belsen and I have to correct myself.</span> <span id="s1320">They called from the what’s the camp called.</span> <span id="s1321">Where they put people.</span> <span id="s1322">They were liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s1323">To get them ready to go to Sweden and I can’t think of the term.</span> <span id="s1324">It’s displaced person’s camp they were put in.</span> <span id="s1325">And that’s where my aunt called from.</span> <span id="s1326">It took several days after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having survivors call but my aunt had not been well.</span> <span id="s1327">She had contracted typhus, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s1328">So it took a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time.</span> <span id="s1329">and there were thousands and thousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world.</span> <span id="s1330">But she did call us and she told us at that time, she would call us again when they got to Sweden because that was where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: What kinds of things had you heard about what happened to the Jews before you got that phone call.</span> <span id="s1332">You said that this filled in some gaps.</span> <span id="s1333">Can you recall what things you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Well, you know my parents spe, and more specifically my father had heard a lot of things about concentration camps and murdering Jews, crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1335">These things started late in the war years, or end, towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1336">Don’t forget soldiers were already coming back.</span> <span id="s1337">Not that he met them personally.</span> <span id="s1338">Some yes, some not, but there was the media and so he did know about camps, crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1339">He knew about Dachau, or he knew about Dachau early on but not knowing exactly Dachau came into existence as I said, I think I said earlier in 33.</span> <span id="s1340">But the atrocities that were being committed were somebody’s worst nightmare and hearing them prior to getting this telephone call and from the news media and the people that had already come back so, wounded soldiers et cetera, made it, it became very factual and he could only, we could only imagine what had happened to our own family.</span> <span id="s1341">However, always hopeful that perhaps they weren’t as touched as so many thousands, millions were.</span> <span id="s1342">At that point we weren’t thinking in terms of millions.</span> <span id="s1343">We didn’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1344">At least I didn’t know but we knew that bad things had happened over there.</span> <span id="s1345">We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had survived, some of our family if not all had survived.</span> <span id="s1346">Hearing that they hadn’t other than my mother’s sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news.</span> <span id="s1347">But in another it was horrific.</span> <span id="s1348">It was my mother and my father were devastated as was I.</span> <span id="s1349">At that point already I was on my way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very, very pained.</span> <span id="s1350">To say the very least.</span> <span id="s1351">It’s an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left behind but two people had perished.</span> <span id="s1352">And at that time we really didn’t know exactly who died in which way.</span> <span id="s1353">We didn’t know that exactly until they came here.</span> <span id="s1354">And I’m getting ahead but my aunt and my cousin came here after Sweden, not too in 1946.</span> <span id="s1355">So about a year, a little over a year after they were liberated.</span> <span id="s1356">My father brought them home.</span> <span id="s1357">He, if you like I can tell you when they called him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went and I went with him, this is now 1945.</span> <span id="s1358">Immediately went to I believe it was the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1359">I remember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and the wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today.</span> <span id="s1360">Got it together and sent it to my aunt and my cousin in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1361">And with which he then went to work to bring them here.</span> <span id="s1362">Which he did.</span> <span id="s1363">He had them sponsored by my aunt, the lady that I lived with here.</span> <span id="s1364">They were moneyed people as I said.</span> <span id="s1365">He got her to sign the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1366">She didn’t blink an eye and signed it, not with all the problems that we had.</span> <span id="s1367">And we tried to get her over here and did of course.</span> <span id="s1368">And but we paid for their passage, and we set up an apartment for them where we lived.</span> <span id="s1369">And he went and, and worked very hard, along with my mother.</span> <span id="s1370">And I remember going with him to these various places to bring them over here.</span> <span id="s1371">So I want to give him, my father and my mother all respect and credit that’s due them for acting as quickly as they did in seeing to the comfort and to bringing these two survivors over into what my father called the land of milk and honey which he was not an original of that expression.</span> <span id="s1372">But he loved America and the opportunities that it gave him and he wanted them here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: When they did come, did you ask you cousin what her experience had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: One afternoon, we lived as I said in the same apartment unit, Peabody Street, she and I were out back.</span> <span id="s1375">We were basically the same age and in fact we recently talked about this very thing I’m telling you now.</span> <span id="s1376">I asked her, what was it like?</span> <span id="s1377">What was camp, concentration camp like?</span> <span id="s1378">Well for two hours or more my cousin told me graphically as graphic as she could get exactly what camp was like, what ghetto was like, what camp was like for her because I have since heard other stories but that was my first.</span> <span id="s1379">And I was absolutely horrified.</span> <span id="s1380">Talk about nightmares, if I didn’t’ have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that.</span> <span id="s1381">Here was somebody in front of me that had lived through these horrors and they were other people that had worse stories.</span> <span id="s1382">But her story and it’s been documented was not pleasant, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1383">What my aunt and she went through and my family.</span> <span id="s1384">Telling me that how my grandparents died, how my, my father’s family died, how my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, how they all died at various stages of the internment, in the gas chambers, in the ghettos, just disappearing.</span> <span id="s1385">One goes to the left, the other one goes to the right.</span> <span id="s1386">One meant certain death, one was uncertain.</span> <span id="s1387">Hearing all that just between the two of us was about one of my worst experiences and I’m sure it was, I think probably the first time that she really talked about it.</span> <span id="s1388">And for years and years and years afterward, we never talked about it again.</span> <span id="s1389">My cousin’s name is Rita, R-I-T-A, Levine Hilton.</span> <span id="s1390">And she for a time lived, for a long time lived in New York but my aunt remarried.</span> <span id="s1391">My aunt’s name was Flora Klinnert Kerner.</span> <span id="s1392">K-E-R-N-E-R.</span> <span id="s1393">and she married a gentleman here by the name of Adin, A-D-I-N so her name the last 40 years after they came here until she died.</span> <span id="s1394">Anyway they were married over 40 years.</span> <span id="s1395">Was Flora Adin, A-D-I-N.</span> <span id="s1396">She was a dentist also.</span> <span id="s1397">I have a feeling that that kept her from being exterminated because she could tend to patients that had from what she told us horrible diseases in the mouth because of malnutrition, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1398">And they tried the Germans, to for the Red Cross anyway for people who came to put up an appearance that they were doing all that they could, quote unquote.</span> <span id="s1399">Of course that was all nonsense.</span> <span id="s1400">My cousin Rita Hilton’s testimony is on file at the US Holocaust Museum as well as Shoah.</span> <span id="s1401">She gave testimony to Shoah also.</span> <span id="s1402">Her testimony is or will be viable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: I think we’re going to pause now and change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">(file 3 – RG-50.106.0077.03.03 – duration: 25:04) Esther Finder: This is tape 3, side A an interview with Jutta Levy for the US Holocaust memorial museum.</span> <span id="s1405">You had just told me about your talk with your cousin when she told you of her experiences in the Holocaust and I wanted to ask you how was the news of the death camps presented in this country, in the American media?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Jutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels.</span> <span id="s1407">And which most everyone at this point has seen.</span> <span id="s1408">That’s all we had at the time, well that’s all you have.</span> <span id="s1409">How was it presented.</span> <span id="s1410">It was presented graphically and with certain amount of disbelief.</span> <span id="s1411">I think the disbelief is to this day.</span> <span id="s1412">The disbelief.</span> <span id="s1413">Not that people didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1414">But my god in heaven, how could this have happened.</span> <span id="s1415">Virtually under our noses.</span> <span id="s1416">How could such a thing have happened?</span> <span id="s1417">Never did my family or I ever, ever become used to seeing those pictures or those images.</span> <span id="s1418">They were shown here not just by the news media, in the news and in the movies.</span> <span id="s1419">Didn’t have television, just yet.</span> <span id="s1420">But it was not easy to take.</span> <span id="s1421">It really was very difficult but the main thing was how was it that this government, you’re talking about the American government, how is it that this could have happened.</span> <span id="s1422">How was it that they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1423">And if they did know why didn’t they do more to help?</span> <span id="s1424">Why didn’t’ they put a stop to it?</span> <span id="s1425">As though that was so easy.</span> <span id="s1426">But these are questions that bubbled up.</span> <span id="s1427">There was a certain amount of anger amongst people like, like us.</span> <span id="s1428">How could this have happened.</span> <span id="s1429">Ok we didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s1430">Or we didn’t’ have as much of a clue as maybe the governments didn’t.</span> <span id="s1431">What did they do?</span> <span id="s1432">Why was it allowed to happen?</span> <span id="s1433">There was anger.</span> <span id="s1434">There is anger today about the very same thing because we’re finding out more and more and more.</span> <span id="s1435">we’re still finding out.</span> <span id="s1436">These atrocities that we heard about and then saw in the news, newsreels, atrocities that my generation, my parents’ generation and people of their, of the generation before have never even dreamt of, could not even visualize other than for the pictures.</span> <span id="s1437">Anger, sadness.</span> <span id="s1438">Disbelief, just as when my cousin sat and talked to me.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t’ think I said a word.</span> <span id="s1440">For two, better than two hours and believe me, if you knew me it’s not easy for me not to talk.</span> <span id="s1441">I was totally in shock at hearing that something like this went on and the world stood by.</span> <span id="s1442">And now as an old woman I have to say how could the world have stood by.</span> <span id="s1443">I didn’t’ understand it then, I don’t’ understand it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Can you make a distinction in your mind.</span> <span id="s1445">I asked you what the Americans thought and you responded to me but was that a general response for the American people or perhaps was it a response from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1446">Do you have a sense of I hope I’m making my question clear.</span> <span id="s1447">Do you have a sense of whether it was the general public in the United States that had that response or was it perhaps a Jewish response that you just described.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A:Well I think primarily it was a Jewish response.</span> <span id="s1449">However I was still in school.</span> <span id="s1450">And at that point, 45, 46, I was on my way to college, so I was there was a mix I’m talking about younger people and also older people.</span> <span id="s1451">I have to say that the people that we were associating with and I include us as a family I would say that that was a universal attitude.</span> <span id="s1452">How could this have happened.</span> <span id="s1453">how.</span> <span id="s1454">Simple as that, or as complicated as that.</span> <span id="s1455">How could it have happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Do you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Did I follow it?</span> <span id="s1458">Somewhat, yes.</span> <span id="s1459">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: What were you reactions to the trials and what came out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Horror.</span> <span id="s1462">Horror.</span> <span id="s1463">I have to be honest with you.</span> <span id="s1464">To begin, not to begin with, some of I couldn’t, I personally had a hard time even having listened to what my cousin had to say, some of the things that came out, I had a very hard time listening to.</span> <span id="s1465">I had a very hard time watching the visuals, very hard time.</span> <span id="s1466">Because they are so horrific.</span> <span id="s1467">My reaction, you don’t want to know what I think about what, well they never got a chance to really punish.</span> <span id="s1468">What they should have done to these people there is, I have no answer for it.</span> <span id="s1469">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1470">there isn’t anything that I can think of that reflect of what, how some of these or all of these criminals should have been punished.</span> <span id="s1471">There isn’t a punishment.</span> <span id="s1472">And I don’t know what, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Did you and your friends ever talk about the Nuremberg trials while they were happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: You know if I talk to people like myself, yes.</span> <span id="s1475">If I talked to Americans not as much.</span> <span id="s1476">You know when you’re young, you’re in college by that time, its’, it’s not going to be the topic of conversation.</span> <span id="s1477">You know people turn away.</span> <span id="s1478">They don’t want, the average whether they’re Jewish or not they just don’t want to be, they don’t want to think too much about these things.</span> <span id="s1479">but I have to tell you something, I myself was still in the process of, want to be accepted, I want to be like the rest.</span> <span id="s1480">How much on that, of that can I, can I personally focus on.</span> <span id="s1481">The general interest was there but overall after five minutes, ten minutes of conversation it was over with, on to other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: I’m going to get back to that.</span> <span id="s1483">I have one more question then I want to get back to just that point.</span> <span id="s1484">Did you follow the events of partition of Palestine anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yeah we did, I did.</span> <span id="s1486">I was aware of it.</span> <span id="s1487">When you say follow, I didn’t read every word on it but I was very much aware of what was going on and ultimately the independence.</span> <span id="s1488">I might add a little PS.</span> <span id="s1489">MY cousin Rita and I went down to the what was then the counselor embassy, Israeli when independence was declared and she and I were even in a huge group picture together.</span> <span id="s1490">But yes I followed the creation of the state of Israel, the partition, you know all that went on, yeah followed it.</span> <span id="s1491">Was interested.</span> <span id="s1492">Was thrilled when independence came.</span> <span id="s1493">Because I felt along with many other, I can speak for myself I felt my God, the Jews now have a homeland.</span> <span id="s1494">Not that I wanted to go there to live.</span> <span id="s1495">I was perfectly content here.</span> <span id="s1496">But we now have a homeland, something that we didn’t have when we needed it the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Now I want to get back to what you were saying before.</span> <span id="s1498">From your perspective as a refugee that had come to the united States could you see what effect there might have been on the American Jewish community as a result of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1499">And the Nuremberg trials and the birth of the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1500">Did you see any changes in the Jewish community from when you first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: That’s a very tough question because you know for as many people as there are and as many people as I knew not that it is that many, but you get different reactions.</span> <span id="s1502">Totally different reactions.</span> <span id="s1503">This, I have to tell you amongst a lot of people and Jews too there’s a lot of apathy.</span> <span id="s1504">I think that’s the right word.</span> <span id="s1505">The war was over, six million Jews plus perished.</span> <span id="s1506">What a horrible, horrible thing.</span> <span id="s1507">Now this Is years back.</span> <span id="s1508">we’re talking from, you’re asking me about that.</span> <span id="s1509">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1510">It must never happen again.</span> <span id="s1511">I don’t’ really think that it all sank in.</span> <span id="s1512">There are too many things happening.</span> <span id="s1513">Same with the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1514">That there are your true Zionists who absolutely were thrilled.</span> <span id="s1515">My father one of them.</span> <span id="s1516">Thrilled with the fact that there was a state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1517">But you also found a lot of ok it’s done, let’s get on with it type of attitude.</span> <span id="s1518">And the ramifications of all what we’ve been talking about the last few minutes, didn’t’ really come to a, well there’s no concluding cause nothing is over.</span> <span id="s1519">But the full impact didn’t come til many, many, many years later.</span> <span id="s1520">I would say as recently as 15 years ago, 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s1521">That people really began well when those survivors started speaking.</span> <span id="s1522">They haven’t been talking all that long.</span> <span id="s1523">I for one started to talk about my own experience when my kids got really involved in their high schools, at Blair High school.</span> <span id="s1524">The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has a mother or father that is survived the Hitler regime that was from Poland or Germany or Romania, or Russia or whatever.</span> <span id="s1525">And the only one in the class that raised their hand was my daughter.</span> <span id="s1526">Shannon.</span> <span id="s1527">And the teacher said well she asked about me and my daughter was told her that oh yes my mom was born in Hamburg Germany and she lived under Hitler for six years.</span> <span id="s1528">My four year old grandchildren when they were at that age that this Grandma came from Hamburg Germany.</span> <span id="s1529">Hamburger Germany.</span> <span id="s1530">Anyway she said my, told her that the mom that she was born in Hamburg Germany, came over here and the teacher said would your mother be interested in talking and my daughter says I don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1531">Anyway teacher called me.</span> <span id="s1532">And I did talk to all the classes during that year of that and then, and then the teacher.</span> <span id="s1533">I don’t know if the same teacher did, I did it for my younger daughter also when she four years later followed.</span> <span id="s1534">But you know up until except for isolated cases, do you know they didn’t’ speak.</span> <span id="s1535">The survivors did not speak if you want to call me a survivor.</span> <span id="s1536">Or a refugee, it really doesn’t’ matter.</span> <span id="s1537">But we didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1538">Who wanted to hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Tell me about your life since the end of the war, about your personal life, your professional life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Well as I told you in the beginning we fluffed over that quickly.</span> <span id="s1541">I went to work at the age of 14.</span> <span id="s1542">First for others.</span> <span id="s1543">I won’t’ even begin to tell you all the things that I’ve done.</span> <span id="s1544">But then primarily for my father in his business.</span> <span id="s1545">I worked hard.</span> <span id="s1546">I worked with both my parents.</span> <span id="s1547">My father got sick early on so I ran a business.</span> <span id="s1548">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s1549">I ran a business.</span> <span id="s1550">I got married in 1952.</span> <span id="s1551">We held onto that business.</span> <span id="s1552">My father was very ill, required, he could never get the proper life insurance because of his hypertension.</span> <span id="s1553">We, he had the best of care.</span> <span id="s1554">we tried very much, very hard to keep him going but he died at 55.</span> <span id="s1555">He accomplished a lot in a very short time.</span> <span id="s1556">Married off two daughters in style, college educated, two daughters at George Washington University.</span> <span id="s1557">Had a home.</span> <span id="s1558">lived well, way beyond his means.</span> <span id="s1559">So by the time he died we were pretty well tapped out.</span> <span id="s1560">So but we rebounded.</span> <span id="s1561">My husband went to work for the government.</span> <span id="s1562">I went to work for various people.</span> <span id="s1563">In the jewelry business, in the travel business, in a doctor’s office.</span> <span id="s1564">Too many things to name.</span> <span id="s1565">We’ve had and I have a, we always have even when my parents were alive a nice life, pleasant.</span> <span id="s1566">Problems yes.</span> <span id="s1567">Always struggling a bit.</span> <span id="s1568">A lot, a bit.</span> <span id="s1569">Looking back on everything and I hope there’s more to come it’s been ok.</span> <span id="s1570">it’s been fine.</span> <span id="s1571">I’m a Yankee Doodle American.</span> <span id="s1572">I reflect many times on my life over there.</span> <span id="s1573">And how fortunate I was, we were to have gotten out when we did.</span> <span id="s1574">Because but for the grace of God we would not have been here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Are you affiliated with any survivor groups or organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Yes I am.</span> <span id="s1577">With the Holocaust survivors and friends.</span> <span id="s1578">I’m a member and it’s through their auspices that I do whatever speaking I do.</span> <span id="s1579">Primarily at the US Capital Children’s museum and whoever wants me.</span> <span id="s1580">I’ve also been involved in the US Holocaust Museum, although not I’m not a volunteer there because believe it or not I still work a little bit.</span> <span id="s1581">So there’s just so many things in the week and I feel that giving my talks and I am contributing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Have you ever been back to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Yes I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Can you tell me what that experience was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: I have to tell you that on my own I wouldn’t’ have gone.</span> <span id="s1586">Had I not been invited and the trip been paid for I wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s1587">The city of Hamburg has invited people like myself back and two years ago my husband and I went as guests, everything paid for.</span> <span id="s1588">What was that like?</span> <span id="s1589">The day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment.</span> <span id="s1590">And we took the subway whatever.</span> <span id="s1591">I knew exactly where to get off.</span> <span id="s1592">It’s amazing how everything came back.</span> <span id="s1593">I saw the apartment, I saw ultimately the school where I went.</span> <span id="s1594">Not the public school, the private school.</span> <span id="s1595">I went into the building, into the apartment.</span> <span id="s1596">I went into the back yard where I had to be so quiet.</span> <span id="s1597">During our recess.</span> <span id="s1598">Went to the downtown branch of the school, saw what was left of my synagogue.</span> <span id="s1599">That’s unusual that that façade is standing.</span> <span id="s1600">The only thing that remains of it is the front of it because it was granite and it had been relatively newly built.</span> <span id="s1601">They couldn’t burn granite.</span> <span id="s1602">The Hebrew lettering is there and I have pictures of that.</span> <span id="s1603">What was my you asked me what was my impression going back.</span> <span id="s1604">The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically it was somewhat frozen in time.</span> <span id="s1605">The downtown area has was completely bombed and rebuilt.</span> <span id="s1606">It’s a very rich city moneywise.</span> <span id="s1607">Pros, prosperous is a better word.</span> <span id="s1608">I did get to see some special places that we used to go to.</span> <span id="s1609">I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen where to me that’s like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there.</span> <span id="s1610">I’m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it.</span> <span id="s1611">it’s been sanitized.</span> <span id="s1612">It’s become like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very few Jews in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1613">Very few.</span> <span id="s1614">Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1615">Between Hamburg and Hanover.</span> <span id="s1616">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1617">Til I got there.</span> <span id="s1618">I’ve forgotten that you asked me.</span> <span id="s1619">The overall impression.</span> <span id="s1620">I was sad.</span> <span id="s1621">When I left the plane took off and I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried.</span> <span id="s1622">Oh I shouldn’t’ say that.</span> <span id="s1623">I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn’t changed.</span> <span id="s1624">But when we left I cried.</span> <span id="s1625">Why?</span> <span id="s1626">I was born there.</span> <span id="s1627">I grew up there.</span> <span id="s1628">What I felt they took away my childhood.</span> <span id="s1629">I had realized it before but it didn’t’ impact me as much as, my husband was sitting next to me on the plane.</span> <span id="s1630">And it didn’t impact me until I left.</span> <span id="s1631">They took away my childhood.</span> <span id="s1632">They did and for that and that’s a small maybe price to pay in view of what others lost but don’t forget I lost my family too.</span> <span id="s1633">But I wasn’t’ in a camp.</span> <span id="s1634">I didn’t starve.</span> <span id="s1635">We were very dirt poor when we first came to New York.</span> <span id="s1636">All that was do-able and bear-able.</span> <span id="s1637">But we’re talking about me talking about me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did.</span> <span id="s1638">They took away my childhood.</span> <span id="s1639">They took away what might have been for me, education wise.</span> <span id="s1640">Many things.</span> <span id="s1641">And once I got that out of my system on the plane going from Hamburg to Frankfurt, I became sad.</span> <span id="s1642">While I was there I wasn’t even sad, other than various you know just moments here, moments there.</span> <span id="s1643">Because we were kept busy.</span> <span id="s1644">But then reflecting.</span> <span id="s1645">I have reflected a lot since I came back.</span> <span id="s1646">I was cheated also.</span> <span id="s1647">Cheated.</span> <span id="s1648">It was, they took away a chunk of my life, a big chunk.</span> <span id="s1649">And I think it has impacted me, the way I act, the way I think and the way I behave, even into my 70s.</span> <span id="s1650">And I’m starting to fill up and I don’t’ want to.</span> <span id="s1651">It’s sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: IS there anything that you’d like to add before we conclude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Maybe the only think I’d like to say.</span> <span id="s1654">I know that what I’ve gone through doesn’t’ begin to tell a whole story, doesn’t’ begin to compare to so many thousands but I have survived the millions that were killed.</span> <span id="s1655">It doesn’t’ compare.</span> <span id="s1656">If I can teach anything or say something that will have an impact other than the few things I’ve said on this tape, don’t’ take anything for granted.</span> <span id="s1657">Don’t take your freedom for granted, don’t take anything for granted because it can change.</span> <span id="s1658">Be grateful for what you have here.</span> <span id="s1659">Who’s ever listening to this.</span> <span id="s1660">This is the greatest country on earth.</span> <span id="s1661">Not perfect.</span> <span id="s1662">There is nothing perfect.</span> <span id="s1663">This is not a perfect world but here you have as close to perfection as it’s going to get.</span> <span id="s1664">It’s not going to get any better.</span> <span id="s1665">So don’t’ take it for granted, love your country.</span> <span id="s1666">Vote, support it, work for it, enjoy it and keep it free.</span> <span id="s1667">Keep it free.</span> <span id="s1668">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: And thank you for doing the interview and this now concludes the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">(end)</span></p></body></html>
