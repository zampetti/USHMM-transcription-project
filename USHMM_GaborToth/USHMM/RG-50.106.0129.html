1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born in Marktberg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Bertha Weisenberg Hagan.</span> <span id="s23">Isaac Hagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Did you have any brothers, sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I have a brother two years younger, Max Hagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What do you remember of your childhood in Germany?</span> <span id="s27">Can you tell me about your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I -- we lived in an apartment on the second floor.</span> <span id="s29">There was a -- a hill there.</span> <span id="s30">We had a small car with a rumble seat and sometimes we would dra -- ri -- get a ride in the rumble seat.</span> <span id="s31">And I was -- I lived near my aunt and uncle, Esther and Herschel Hagan, and I played with my younger cousins, Manny and Jackie.</span> <span id="s32">And I remember going down to -- with my brother down the apartment steps and we went into the car and started the car and somebody saw us and stopped us cause we were rolling down the hill, he had released the brake.</span> <span id="s33">And I -- oh, I started kindergarten in regular school, and a few months after I was in the school the teacher called my mother in and said, Frau Hagan, this is not my policy, but your daughter can no longer stay in this public school, she has to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s34">So I went to a Jewish school with a Jewish teacher.</span> <span id="s35">And he was there for a few months and then one day we went to school and he was no longer there, he had gotten papers to come to America.</span> <span id="s36">So there for awhile I was out of school, there was no school.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Was your hometown a -- a large town, or was it small?</span> <span id="s38">A: I would say it’s a medium size town and it was an industrial town.</span> <span id="s39">There were a lot of factories there.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Was there a large Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s42">We had Jewish friends and we did go to synagogue, so there were some Jewish people there, but I don’t know whether -- the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did your family have a long history in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: They got -- they left Poland in 1919, so they were there from 1919 to 1939.</span> <span id="s45">They were never allowed to become citizens, you had to be in Germany 30 years before, so they were statenloss; people without a state.</span> <span id="s46">My father always went to work, he did selling house to house, bought things at the wholesale place, sold them and made a living, cause we were never deprived of anything, we had food and clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Do you know why your family moved from Poland to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, they moved there because of economic reasons.</span> <span id="s49">They were very, very poor, and my granduncle, at the age of 15 was caught playing cards, and then he said he never wanted to stay in that place because of this [indecipherable] and he -- he left very early to go to Germany, and then came to America.</span> <span id="s50">He then grew up, b-became a good businessman in Detroit, Michigan, and he was the man that signed the affidavits for us to come here, that if we couldn’t sup -- if my father couldn’t support us, he would support us.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Do you know where in Poland your family is from?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Nowy Zandak.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What work did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My mother was a homemaker, but my father always had a paperwork that had to be done, and she helped him with the accounts.</span> <span id="s55">She spoke a good English once we got to America.</span> <span id="s56">My father always spoke all the languages that he had ever encountered, Polish, German, Spanish, then English, so that he never -- he went to business, but he never got the hang of the language the way my mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Was your family religiously observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s59">They -- we lived -- I couldn’t go -- do anything on Saturday.</span> <span id="s60">I went to -- well, in Miami I went to Hebrew school and then stayed home on Saturday.</span> <span id="s61">A-And we observed all the holidays and we were kosher at that time.</span> <span id="s62">Mostly we were Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: When you were a child growing up in Germany, did you have a favorite holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: When I was growing up in Germany -- we didn’t do much about Hanukah, as I wa -- Passover, because we would all get together, with the fam -- with the aunt and uncle and my cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And what language did you speak in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: When you were a little girl, did you experience any anti-Semitism, other than what you mentioned to me in the school, did you, in your playtime with your friends, anything like that ever experience anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: No, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s69">Not in Germany, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You ever see Hitler or -- or the Nazis in your travels?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, I didn't see Hitler, but I was there Kristallnacht and we went out on the street and saw all the windows had been smashed and there was glass all over the streets.</span> <span id="s72">So that was my memory of the -- of the beginning of the bad times.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What can you remember about Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s74">Did you know what was happening during the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: A wa -- there was a -- a neighbor who said we shouldn’t go out at night the night of krysta -- the night before Kristallnacht because something bad was happening.</span> <span id="s76">So he was trying to warn us about something like that.</span> <span id="s77">So we stayed in.</span> <span id="s78">Then the next day we did go out and walked around and saw the destruction.</span> <span id="s79">And then that morning my uncle was arrested and sent to -- Ben Bruner, that was my uncle, he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s80">He later got out because my Aunt Esther bribed one of the Gestapo people to get him out so he could come to America with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Before Kristallnacht had there been any mention of your family going to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, because my father was against going.</span> <span id="s83">He said that this would pass, that it’s not as bad as people were saying.</span> <span id="s84">But my Aunt Esther, younger than my mother, she was the motivating factor.</span> <span id="s85">She said to my mother, pack the suitcases, pack the boxes, we’re leaving.</span> <span id="s86">And my father came along with us, even though he felt that it would not be so bad.</span> <span id="s87">There were people in my family who left earlier.</span> <span id="s88">My Uncle Beryl was in Detroit already and of course grand-uncle Jassie was in Detroit.</span> <span id="s89">But he had gone much earlier, for economic reason.</span> <span id="s90">Beryl went because he realized things were getting bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind about the time up to Kristallnacht, from your childhood?</span> <span id="s92">Any other memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, I can’t remember anything that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: When your family decided to move, how was the move explained to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well, my mother was very capable of taking care of us, and she said we were going to have an adventure, and we would be going halfway around the world.</span> <span id="s96">And so I felt as long as she felt it was an adventure, I was going to go along.</span> <span id="s97">And she made it easy for my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s98">We didn’t worry.</span> <span id="s99">They were very worried, but we didn’t, as children.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Were you aware that they were worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes, I realized that things were getting tense, and that Esther and Bertha and everybody was anxiously preparing for this trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did your parents have any trouble getting out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, they got the affidavit from Uncle Jassie in Detroit.</span> <span id="s104">The -- the hard part was that my grandparents wouldn’t come.</span> <span id="s105">And so they left them in Hamburg, Germany, and my two aunts and my mother, they had to say goodbye to their mother and father, and that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s106">And my mother really never got over it, I don’t think Ceeta ever got over it either.</span> <span id="s107">They went to Poland, and we have letters from Poland where they’re living in an apartment and letters that we sent and packages that we sent were opened up and -- by the censors and money and food was taken out, so that they would get a little bit of what we had sent, but not very much.</span> <span id="s108">And that happened through 1940 -- ’39 - ’40 - ’41, then ’42 we had no more correspondence, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Do you remember what arrangements were made for your departure?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: This is hard to believe but my aunt contacted a rabbi and he -- you couldn’t take much money out.</span> <span id="s111">And she gave him our money and for every 14 marks that we gave him, she met him in Belgium, he gave us back a dolla -- a mark.</span> <span id="s112">So we had little money as we left Belgium, and there were people who got off at Belgium and I remember waving goodbye to friends and then we never saw them again, and then we continued to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So your objective was Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: No, our objective was United States of America, but there was a quota system in America, we couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s115">In fact, the arrangements we had to make to go to Cuba was that we were going there on vacation, which is what we said on the papers, going on vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Since you were going on a vacation, as you said, were you able to say goodbye to people?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes, we said goodbye to our friends who lived in the apartment house.</span> <span id="s118">And of course my close relatives, very fortunately were able to come with us.</span> <span id="s119">Uncle Ben, who was in the concentration camp, my Aunt Esther bribed a Gestapo and they let him out.</span> <span id="s120">Her story is that Hitler was willing for Jews to leave if they could get out somehow, and we -- she went ahead and got the papers and we -- as we said, a -- a vacation to Cuba, but our intention was never to stay in Cuba, to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Were there any last minute glitches before you could leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, other than saying goodbye to my grandparents and having them go to Poland, which was the first place that they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You mentioned that you could not take out a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: What could you take out of Germany?</span> <span id="s126">What -- what did your parents take and what did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: My parents took out a sterling silver set co -- silverware.</span> <span id="s128">A big sewing machine, it’s a -- was a piece of furniture, and a beautiful sterling silver candelabra and I have the candelabra, which I will give to my daughter so that she will know that this is something else that she can take with her.</span> <span id="s129">I don’t remember what I took.</span> <span id="s130">I -- all I remember was wearing a short dress, but most of the time that’s what I wore, dresses.</span> <span id="s131">I don’t remember toys or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: What did you most regret leaving behind, for you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Having to leave my school, and the people that I knew in school.</span> <span id="s134">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: When did you leave your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Do you know the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Perhaps January, 1939, cause I feel that we were on the ship in February, and took a few weeks, we had to go to Hamburg and make arrangements for my grandparents.</span> <span id="s139">They did get an apartment in Poland, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: How did you travel from your home to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: By train, we went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: How old were you at the time you left your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: I was seven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: When you get -- when you got to Hamburg, how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: We were there a few weeks, until we got on the ship, and the ship was the Oronoco and a -- my cousin says that after we were dropped off in Cuba by the Oronoco that the next time the Oronoco sailed, it was torpedoed.</span> <span id="s146">So I don’t know if we have any record -- we don’t have any records of the Oronoco, I thought maybe the Holocaust Museum might.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Do you know what registry it [indecipherable] under?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, no, just the name, that stuck with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Let’s stay in Germany just a little big longer --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: -- we’ll go back to the ship.</span> <span id="s152">You mentioned saying goodbye and then leaving and going on the ship.</span> <span id="s153">Did you have any problems at all actually leaving German territory?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: I asked you if you knew what registry the ship had, was it German registry, or was it other than German registry?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, it had a Spanish name, the Oronoco is a river in South America.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t know if that had anything to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: When did you realize that you were no longer in German control?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: When I was on the ship.</span> <span id="s160">And there, life was somewhat normal.</span> <span id="s161">My parents and everybody got very seasick, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s162">So I continued eating and running around the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Can you describe the ship a little bit to me?</span> <span id="s164">Tell me how large it was, at least how large it seemed to you as a seven year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s166">It seemed like a very large ship, and we ate at a dining room table like you would, I don’t know like a cruise liner, but to me it was a large ship and we had room to run around on the deck and my brother and I played on the deck.</span> <span id="s167">Oh well, my Aunt Ceeta, the younger of the three sisters that were coming over, because it was such a rough voyage her baby could not keep any food down and died on the ship.</span> <span id="s168">And I remember this, he was buried at sea, and my Aunt Ceeta never got over that.</span> <span id="s169">That was a trauma that stayed with her all her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Was the child sick before the voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, child was alright, but he was s -- it was a boy, six weeks old, couldn’t hold the food down.</span> <span id="s172">So became, I suppose seasick like the rest of the people and died from dehydration.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Can you tell me what the cr -- the crossing was like for the adults?</span> <span id="s174">From your perspective, what could you see the adults going through?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, they were worried about what life would be like, they would talk about the language.</span> <span id="s176">My mother and my aunts started studying English, since that was our destination, in Germany.</span> <span id="s177">So they were studying even onboard, when they would sit out on the deck.</span> <span id="s178">They had their English-German dictionary and they would try to converse with each other in English.</span> <span id="s179">And then of course there was the problem of learning Spanish, which I don’t think they studied until they got over to Cuba.</span> <span id="s180">So a lot of the time they were talking about how we would make a living -- how they would make a living and how they would get along with the language.</span> <span id="s181">That was the main topic of conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Besides your family [indecipherable] who were the other passengers?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I mentioned that there were some friends of my family that were left off in Belgium, so they were refugees like us.</span> <span id="s184">Seems to me that they -- it was a boatload of refugees, people who were fleeing from Europe because they knew it was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: How long was the crossing?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Seems to me it was two weeks, but they had to stop the ship because of some problems, mechanical problems, so we were on the ocean for awhile.</span> <span id="s187">And then that was repaired, so it took about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And besides running around the deck with your brother, what did you do during those two weeks during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I do remember now we brought some books, so I was reading and that was in German, cause I was trying to learn a little English also, but that -- I didn’t learn too much there.</span> <span id="s190">I learned more when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s191">Played with my cousins because we were all very close together.</span> <span id="s192">My father and my uncle were brothers and my mother and my aunt were sisters.</span> <span id="s193">So two mothers, two women married to two brothers -- two sisters married two brothers, so my relationship with my cousins were double, very close, almost like brothers and sister.</span> <span id="s194">I was the only girl, everybody else was a boy, so I had a very close relationship with Aunt Esther because she always wanted a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: When you were on the ship, what were your expectations for when you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I was hoping I could make some friends in Cuba and learn the language.</span> <span id="s197">And I did, when I got to Cuba, I started learning Spanish, spoke German.</span> <span id="s198">I started studying English with my mother and my aunt there in Cuba.</span> <span id="s199">They would sit in the park while we played, and studied.</span> <span id="s200">And of course then I started learning English.</span> <span id="s201">So at that time I was trilingual.</span> <span id="s202">That didn’t last, but at that moment in my life I spoke three languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How long did you think, you and your family, that you would be in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Oh, we just thought it would be about six months, but then it turned out that we had a longer wait and we didn’t get in til a year and a half later.</span> <span id="s205">And we were in this country, in America, must have been at the beginning of 19 -- at least the middle of 1941, cause we moved to Miami, and then my father and my mother moved to Saint Louis for six months.</span> <span id="s206">They thought they could earn -- he could earn a better living up there.</span> <span id="s207">But that only lasted six months, then we moved back.</span> <span id="s208">But we have letters from my grandparents and my aunt who stayed in Poland addressed to us in 1941 in America, to -- in Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Tell me about your arrival in Cuba.</span> <span id="s210">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: We arrived in Cuba.</span> <span id="s212">Battista was very good to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s213">Seems like Cubans didn’t have any feelings of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s214">They did put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s215">Not a concentration camp, but a camp to hold us until we could get settled in the country, and treated us very nicely.</span> <span id="s216">There was food morning, noon and night and they treated us to something that was their delicacy, but we didn’t like it, was fried bananas.</span> <span id="s217">And we stayed there a few days and my Uncle Jassie, the one who signed the papers, he was living in Detroit, and I understand now he sent money to us every month, to mine -- all three families, so that we could survive in Cuba.</span> <span id="s218">The story I got from my father was that he immediately went to work, which he did, and earned money so that we could be supported.</span> <span id="s219">But he had help.</span> <span id="s220">But he did go to work, went to work on a bicycle in Cuba.</span> <span id="s221">Carried around the package that he was selling from door to door.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What was he selling?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Dry goods, clothing, women’s clothing, men’s clothing.</span> <span id="s224">Anything you wanted, he would get.</span> <span id="s225">And I made friends with a Cuban family who lived -- we li -- got an apartment.</span> <span id="s226">It was around a courtyard like they have in Cuba so that the -- we were living indoor outdoors, cause of the warm weather and made friends with a mother and a daughter.</span> <span id="s227">The mother was lovely to me.</span> <span id="s228">The daughter and I became very good friends.</span> <span id="s229">She made clothes for me and her daughter, same kind of dresses so we looked like sisters when we went out.</span> <span id="s230">Very nice people, but I lost contact with them.</span> <span id="s231">Went to Cuba, learned Spanish.</span> <span id="s232">Went to school in Cuba, learned Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: You said that you were going to Cuba, quote unquote, on vacation --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: -- or holiday, whatever, that’s what you told the German authorities.</span> <span id="s236">Was there any problem with your staying with respect to the Cuban government?</span> <span id="s237">Did they give you any -- any hassles for staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, they seemed to know that -- what the reason was and they allowed us to stay there without any hassles.</span> <span id="s239">In fact, some of the people on the ship that we made friends with stayed in Cuba until Castro came in, because they began to make a good life, right there.</span> <span id="s240">So that we had some friends that stayed in Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Tell me about starting school in Cuba and where you were in Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, it was near my apartment because I -- I could walk to school.</span> <span id="s243">And of course it was very strange because I wasn’t speaking anything at all, I couldn’t understand anything that was going on, so I kept quiet.</span> <span id="s244">And then, after a couple of months I was able to begin to speak a little.</span> <span id="s245">And the children were nice, you know, you could play on the playground without talking.</span> <span id="s246">And then I picked up some words, and began to have some friends with them, especially that little girl who lived near the apartment.</span> <span id="s247">And she was in same class I was in, so we had friends in -- I had a friend in school and I had a friend at home besides my brother and my cousins.</span> <span id="s248">We were always close, my brother Max, Manny and Jackie.</span> <span id="s249">They -- they remained in Miami, I moved up here to Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Were you near a -- a city?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: We were in Havana.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Were there any other refugees in the school with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, there were three or four other children, who might have been -- I -- I think they were on the boat with us, on the ship.</span> <span id="s254">And they had the same problems I did trying to learn to understand what the teacher is saying because they spoke only in Spanish.</span> <span id="s255">And somehow we picked up the language, I think more from the children than from anything else.</span> <span id="s256">And then we were able to use our knowledge to get some of the work done, but never as good as the children who were born in Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: In what ways was your life in Cuba what you had expected it would be and what ways was it very different?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Well, they didn’t seem to have any winter, it was warm all the time, whereas in Germany, of course, it was a different kind of climate, we were cold in the winter and hot in the summer.</span> <span id="s259">And so we wore less clothing and Batista, who was the dictator at the time, he was -- I think he thought of the Jews as a middle class, because he didn’t give us any problems.</span> <span id="s260">If anything I think the Cuban government helped us get settled into the apartment.</span> <span id="s261">And there were some agencies that provided us with food at the beginning, until we got settled.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Aside from the refugees, people who perhaps came on your ship, were there other Jews around in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes, there were some Jews in Cuba.</span> <span id="s264">They were of European extraction, though.</span> <span id="s265">Some of them had come there earlier, 10 years earlier than we did and they had established themselves and were doing well economically, so that we did meet some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Was there a -- any kind of Jewish community in your -- in your area of Havana?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: There was a Jewish community, small Jewish community, but I don’t remember going to synagogue, so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s268">We may have and we may not, I just can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What Jewish traditions could you continue to observe in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, well my mother kept kosher, and we observed the Shabbas in -- in the apartment, in the home, so that I couldn’t go out to play on sat -- I could go out to play, but I couldn’t go to the movies or anything like that.</span> <span id="s271">So it was the food and observing the Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: What about holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: We celebrated them with my family that came over.</span> <span id="s274">And we lived together.</span> <span id="s275">There were several apartments in this complex and so we all lived near each other, because I would play in my apartment and then run over to my c -- c -- to Ceeta and Uncle Ben’s apartment and to Esther and Herschel’s apartment.</span> <span id="s276">So we were very close in that it seemed almost open air like.</span> <span id="s277">I think the doors were kept open most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Was your mother able to get kosher meat and other foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: As far as I know she was, so there must have been a kosher butcher shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: While you were in Cuba, were you aware of what was going on with the S.S. Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, we did not know about the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s282">I did not know about that until later on.</span> <span id="s283">Til I came to America and I -- til I got older.</span> <span id="s284">As far as I knew -- as far as I was concerned everybody who wanted to come could come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So you never met anybody who had been on the Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: We’re going to pause so I can change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: -- the S.S. Saint Louis, and I wanted to continue along that line.</span> <span id="s291">The other refugees that you met, were they people who had just been on your ship, or did you meet anybody who had come in any other way?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Some of them were people we had made friends with on our ship and there was one family we met who had come there in probably 1931 or even earlier, and he had a s -- he and his family had established themselves.</span> <span id="s293">And their children were born in Cuba, so even though -- they were from Vienna, but he was a man who knew early on things were not good.</span> <span id="s294">So it must have been like, maybe late 20’s.</span> <span id="s295">So we were friends with them.</span> <span id="s296">Other than that, I can’t remember who else we were friends with.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So all the refugees that you knew, you knew from the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s299">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Were you able to get any religious education in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No.</span> <span id="s302">I don’t know if we tried, but my mother knew it would be hard for me just to learn Spanish.</span> <span id="s303">And then, we were also trying to learn a little English.</span> <span id="s304">So she didn’t put me in Hebrew school at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: You mentioned several times that you were still getting letters from Europe.</span> <span id="s306">Can you be a little bit more specific and tell me what was in the letters that you were receiving while you -- if you can remember, while you were in Cuba [indecipherable] what you were hearing in those first months after [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes, life was very hard for my grandparents in Poland and my aunt.</span> <span id="s308">They were very close to each other and they took care of each other.</span> <span id="s309">My grandmother was always -- had always been sick and we were sending packages over to Poland and the censors would take out money and food so that finally when my grandparents got a package, it had been opened up and only small amount of what we sent was -- was there.</span> <span id="s310">They always talked about the fact that they weren’t hearing enough from my Uncle Beryl, who was established in Detroit, that he wasn’t writing enough, whereas my -- Bertha and Esther and Ceeta, my mother, my two aunts who were with us in Cuba wrote to Poland a lot and sent a lot of packages over there.</span> <span id="s311">And we heard from them in 1939, 1940, 1941.</span> <span id="s312">In 1942 they -- that stopped, we didn’t hear -- of course [indecipherable] already.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were there any additional attempts to get them out of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: My grandparents didn’t want to come to America.</span> <span id="s315">They were afraid there would be no synagogues.</span> <span id="s316">They thought they were too -- they were probably my age which -- the age I am now, and yet they thought they were too old to travel across the ocean.</span> <span id="s317">I don’t know why -- well, Aunt Ella felt a very si -- as all of the sisters did, a very strong connection to their parents and she stayed with them.</span> <span id="s318">So that was the reason, I think, that she didn’t come, cause she was devoted to her parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Where were you -- if you remember the details -- where were you when you realized that the war had begun and Germany had attacked Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I -- when I was in Cuba we heard that Hitler had gone into Poland, which was a great deal of discussion in my household about what would be happening to the parents since Hitler was marching into Poland.</span> <span id="s321">And we were very worried for them, concerned that they would lose their lives, which eventually they did, cause we never heard from them after 1942.</span> <span id="s322">So we were -- a lot of talk about what -- what could we do and it -- I don’t know, just seemed at that point we couldn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You heard about it in your home.</span> <span id="s324">Did you hear anything about the war in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No.</span> <span id="s326">Oh, we had a radio, so I heard a lot of things on the radio, we heard a lot of information on the radio, but I don’t remember discussing it in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Did your parents ever explain what was going on in Europe to you, or did you just hear them speaking with other adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Mostly it was what I overheard them talking about with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: You mentioned the letters that you were getting.</span> <span id="s330">Other than the letters, did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yes, when we -- of course, Esther knew, and Bertha, my mother, that when we were in Germany, that things were happening to Jewish people, Jewish people were being arrested, we saw that.</span> <span id="s332">My uncle was arrested, sent to a camp, and my, of course, the teacher left.</span> <span id="s333">So we knew things were happening then.</span> <span id="s334">We didn’t know the extent of it.</span> <span id="s335">We didn’t know about the millions of people who were going to get killed.</span> <span id="s336">We just knew that Jews were in trouble, and so we had to get out, even though it was a terrific decision on their part to leave the country that they had known and to move halfway around the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You also mentioned that you heard about the war on the radio.</span> <span id="s338">Do you happen to remember the radio reports and if they were objective, or if there was some kind of bias one way or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I don’t know, I just remember they saying that Hitler was marching into Poland and that things were terrible for the Jews and for the Polish people, because they were being, I believe, bombed by the planes.</span> <span id="s340">So that as far as I knew, it was an accurate account of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: At any time during your stay in Cuba, did you personally experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s343">No, no anti-Semitism towards me.</span> <span id="s344">I don’t want to jump ahead, but in Miami I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did anybody in Cuba ask you about your life in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, my -- the woman and the daughter who we befriended.</span> <span id="s347">They wanted to know about our life in Germany and we told them we had -- had -- had to leave because of Hitler, as a result of the plans to put Jews into camps.</span> <span id="s348">We knew that, we just didn’t know that they were going to be gassed.</span> <span id="s349">Like you know, you go to a camp, maybe you get out.</span> <span id="s350">There were people -- my uncle says that he was taken from -- well the night -- the morning of -- after Kristallnacht, he was taken on a train, he and three others in a cattle car and they -- they were going over rivers, so they thought they were going to be dumped in the water.</span> <span id="s351">Then they were released on land -- not released, but taken out of the cattle car, and they were on -- on safe ground, so they were happy just to be alive.</span> <span id="s352">They didn’t know if they would live through that experience of going -- then they were taken to a camp, and he had to stay there for awhile until my aunt -- Aunt Esther bribed the Gestapo to get him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Do you know what camp and do you know what the bribe was?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: The bribe was money, I don’t know the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: When you think back -- back about your time in Cuba, what are some of your happy memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, I remember walking by -- near Moro castle, which is near the waterfront.</span> <span id="s357">And there were parks there, we would go play in the park, my mother and my aunt -- aunts, both of them.</span> <span id="s358">The three women, who were sitting and studying English so that when they got to this country they would -- and they had studied English in Germany so they would be able to speak when they got here.</span> <span id="s359">And my father and my uncles, they went out to work, so we would see them in the evening.</span> <span id="s360">I remember being out of doors, playing around the palm trees.</span> <span id="s361">That was a happy time with my co -- mainly with my cousins and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Is there anything else that stands out in your mind about your -- your time in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, except that we were looking forward to leaving, even though it was a pleasant time in Cuba, we really were anxious to get to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Were you too, you also were anxious to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And altogether, how long were you in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: About a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And how did you manage to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, the quota for Jews coming into America, we were then included in that quota, I don’t remember what the quota was.</span> <span id="s370">And we came to Miami and Ceeta and Uncle Ben went to Detroit.</span> <span id="s371">I think we landed in -- in Miami by boat and we stayed in mi -- in the Miami area, northwest section of Miami and Ceeta and Uncle Ben took a train and went to Detroit because her -- their brother was in Detroit and had established himself in business, he ran a five and 10 cent store.</span> <span id="s372">So that -- and that was where their uncle was, the man who had provided us with the papers to come to America.</span> <span id="s373">If we couldn’t make a living, he was going to -- he was going to help us live.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you remember the trip from Cuba to Miami?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No.</span> <span id="s376">For some reason I can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s377">I just remember coming to Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Remember your first impressions of Miami?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: We got a house in the northwest section of Miami and my mother and father and myself and my brother, my aunt and my uncle and my cousins lived together in a house.</span> <span id="s380">And they were very busy going away to work, and nobody had time to cut the grass.</span> <span id="s381">There was an old car in the driveway, we played cops and robbers there.</span> <span id="s382">And it was a Christian area and the teachers were very religious, there was a lot of Jesus and Christmas songs and there was some anti-Semitism from the children towards me.</span> <span id="s383">Some -- one of the boys gave me sign of the finger cause I was Jew girl.</span> <span id="s384">And that was in Miami.</span> <span id="s385">We stayed there for awhile and then moved to Miami Beach, which was filled with Jewish people so we didn’t have that much anti-Semitism after I left Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: How long were you in Miami before you went to Miami Beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s388">We were probably in Miami for about two years.</span> <span id="s389">I remember they put me back in the first grade, even though I was at this time about nine, because that was the policy, that if you didn’t speak the language, they put you back.</span> <span id="s390">Finally my mother, who was quite retiring and shy, but she did go to school, she said, my daughter is nine years old, she really belongs in another grade.</span> <span id="s391">So they put me up to third grade, and then I progressed from there.</span> <span id="s392">Lived in Miami for two years, then I went to -- we moved to Miami Beach, lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s393">We lived in an apartment there.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Let’s stay in Miami just a little bit.</span> <span id="s395">You were already in this country when a lot of things had been changed in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Right.</span> <span id="s397">Well, I was here when Pearl Harbor, when they dropped -- when the Japanese dropped the bomb on Pearl Harbor, so we were glad then that Roosevelt had America go into the war with the allies.</span> <span id="s398">That was a big turning point for us, we felt that that was one way -- we even hoped that my grandparents and aunt would survive somehow, because now the Americans were going to help us defeat Hitler.</span> <span id="s399">So was a joyous occasion when we learned that America was going into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: After Pearl Harbor, did you experience any anti-foreign sentiment, or any increase in anti-Semitic feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh let’s see.</span> <span id="s402">That would still be in Miami and it was some anti-Semitism fr -- shown from the people, but there were organizations there also because they wanted to help us.</span> <span id="s403">My teacher asked me to come out into the hall and she said would I would want a Thanksgiving basket.</span> <span id="s404">So I went home and asked my mother and my mother said no, we didn’t need it, we had enough meat of our own.</span> <span id="s405">But they were looking to help.</span> <span id="s406">They knew we were refugees, obviously.</span> <span id="s407">So there were people in Miami who were trying to help us.</span> <span id="s408">But some of the children got -- were anti-Semitic and they got that from their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did any of the children ask you about your previous experiences in Cuba or Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: When you were in Miami, were you and your relatives the only Jews around?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s413">Somehow we got into a neighborhood that was the -- so it was just the four -- the four adults and the four children living together in the house and we were the only Jews in that area.</span> <span id="s414">It was northwest section of Miami which at the time was a Christian area.</span> <span id="s415">There were Jews living in Miami, but not the area where -- where we got the house, where we rented the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: While you’re in this rental house in Miami, what Jewish traditions did you still retain?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: We were able to keep up the tradition at home, as we had done in Cuba.</span> <span id="s418">We celebrated the holidays in the house.</span> <span id="s419">And since we had -- were fortunate enough to come out as a family -- we had the two families and always celebrated together.</span> <span id="s420">Mostly it was Passover.</span> <span id="s421">Hanukah was not such a big deal as it is now.</span> <span id="s422">I don’t remember going to synagogue in Miami.</span> <span id="s423">Probably didn’t start that til Miami Beach, which was a few years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Were there any specific problems other than the ones that you mentioned, you know, learning the language and you know, being put back in school?</span> <span id="s425">Did you have any other problems adjusting to life in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Well, I felt strange, different, because I was -- wasn’t speaking English the way the other boys and girls were speaking, so I tended to keep quiet until I was talked to, and then I would answer haltingly, because at that time I really wasn’t conversant in English, I was just learning a few words and phrases.</span> <span id="s427">So I felt s -- like a stranger in the Miami area.</span> <span id="s428">And that took probably the whole two years I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And how were the adults progressing with respect to making a living and getting used to the culture and language?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Interestingly enough my father and uncle went out and went to the wholesale houses, got some dry goods and started selling it from house to house.</span> <span id="s431">They even had opened up a store in -- not too far from the house.</span> <span id="s432">But that didn’t work out, they couldn’t make enough money on the store so they closed that.</span> <span id="s433">But they continued making a living going from house to house.</span> <span id="s434">And as I said my Granduncle Jassie had sent money in Cuba so that our income at that time was supplemented by him.</span> <span id="s435">… We didn’t suffer too much in Miami, I mean the -- we were able to -- to live from day to day until things got a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Tell me about the move from mia -- Miami to Miami Beach and how that affected your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Well we moved from the house to -- my father and my uncle didn’t get along too well living together.</span> <span id="s438">They had some pretty bad fights living close quarters like that with the family.</span> <span id="s439">Then we moved to Miami Beach and we each lived in separate apartments in separate apartment houses and that worked out.</span> <span id="s440">And there again my father and my uncle did the same thing, they went out to -- well, they had connections already in the wholesale houses, bought -- then they bought a car, each of them had a car so they could drive around the greater Miami area, cause they went back to business in Miami, just a ride across the causeway.</span> <span id="s441">And I started going to school in South Beach elementary school and things got easier for me because I had learned the language.</span> <span id="s442">There was no anti-Semitism in Miami Beach because a lot of the people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s443">And there we did join a synagogue, Beth Jacob synagogue and I went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s444">And there we were able to live the Orthodox life that we had in Marktberg, Germany.</span> <span id="s445">Going to synagogue on Saturday and my brother even led the children’s service.</span> <span id="s446">He had learned the Hebrew well enough that he could do that.</span> <span id="s447">And we made friends in school, and the school was close -- the South Beach elementary school, the school was close enough to the apartment, we would just walk back and forth and see our friends in school and then play with them after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: With the move, and now living in a community where there were more Jews, did any of these children ask you about your experiences in Germany or in Cuba?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, the children didn’t.</span> <span id="s450">The teachers did.</span> <span id="s451">They were interested in what I had experienced.</span> <span id="s452">And so I would tell them about it, but the children weren’t interested in my background.</span> <span id="s453">And at that time I was able to communicate with them so that I wasn’t -- I must have still spoken with an accent, but it didn’t seem to affect the relationship I had with them, we were just friends.</span> <span id="s454">And they accepted me as I was.</span> <span id="s455">And then we were all Jewish, so that helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What did the teachers ask you, and what did you answer them?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Why -- well, they knew why I left Germany, how it was over in Germany, and I told them about Kristallnacht and having to leave Germany, having to leave my grandparents and they were very interested in that part of my life.</span> <span id="s458">Later on [indecipherable] when I was in eighth grade I helped my parents -- I knew the language by then so well that I helped my parents study for the citizenship, and -- I went over the questions with them, which was hard for my father.</span> <span id="s459">My mother could do it.</span> <span id="s460">Questions, you know, about American history.</span> <span id="s461">But then, of course, I was learning -- at that point I was learning about American history, and one of the teachers even asked me to write a report on my experiences.</span> <span id="s462">So I did, and I read it to the class, and then on the intercom.</span> <span id="s463">An-And that way the children knew, because they wanted them to know what was going on over in Europe.</span> <span id="s464">But the children themselves weren’t that concerned about it.</span> <span id="s465">They were interested in surviving themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: After you read your paper, did -- nobody asked you anything?</span> <span id="s467">None of the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes, of course, after I read the paper on the intercom people came up to me and said, how long have you been here and what was it like.</span> <span id="s469">So then they did show interest.</span> <span id="s470">But the first step was the teacher asking me to write about it, to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: At the time you were writing and reading your work, what was going on in the world at that point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Let’s see [indecipherable] the year.</span> <span id="s473">I think by then the war had ended, so that I was reliving some of the history that people had gone through that these children and -- and these teachers didn’t have -- really weren't involved in very much.</span> <span id="s474">I mean, luckily they were able to go on with their own life.</span> <span id="s475">Course there were young men who were dying over there, but most of the people just went on with their life in -- in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s476">There was no big concern except war bonds and some rationing, things like that were going on.</span> <span id="s477">And in Miami Beach the soldiers were being trained for the American army, so we would hear them marching through the streets of Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s478">That was during the war.</span> <span id="s479">So I must have written the composition towards the end of the war, 1945.</span> <span id="s480">And we did invite soldiers over to have Passover with us.</span> <span id="s481">So we were able to do that, to share whatever we -- my father made, with other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: During the war years, how closely did you follow the news of what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Again, it was through the radio.</span> <span id="s484">We would sit -- all of us would sit around the radio and listen, especially when President Roosevelt talked, so that we could hear his fireside chats, and he would tell us about what was happening in the war.</span> <span id="s485">And the radio -- and the news, we would listen to the news, we were very much concerned about what was happening in Europe, how Hitler was going through the European countries.</span> <span id="s486">We were very upset and concerned about that.</span> <span id="s487">All through the ray -- mostly through the radio, I don’t even remember the newspaper so much, just listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s488">That was our connection with the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you ever hear any anti-Semitic statements on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: After you moved to Miami, did you have any contact with any other refugees in Miami or Miami Beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: I -- no.</span> <span id="s493">There were -- no, the friend al -- I don’t know if we made any friends in Miami those two years.</span> <span id="s494">It was all business and going to school.</span> <span id="s495">In Miami Beach then we made friends with people who had lived in Miami Beach.</span> <span id="s496">They were not refugees, they were Americans, people who come -- lived in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Was there anything about the way the Americans were responding to the war that surprised you?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: It was surprising that people here could go on so easily with their life when there was so much destruction going on over there, going on with their lives here.</span> <span id="s499">But then in a way so did we.</span> <span id="s500">We were lucky and we started living.</span> <span id="s501">The only connection we had was the letters to Poland and back.</span> <span id="s502">That’s what made us aware of how terrible things had progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you remember any of the details of those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: They were always happy to hear that we were doing well in America.</span> <span id="s505">Didn’t hear much from Uncle Beryl and der -- my mother’s brother was Jassie, Uncle Jassie, didn’t hear much from him.</span> <span id="s506">They -- we wrote that things were hard here to get started.</span> <span id="s507">They wrote back that everybody in America from Europe gets started as a shoeshine boy but then works themselves up into big business, so that it would -- since we had to travel halfway around the world they said that we could -- that they figured we would do alright and we’re just lucky to be here.</span> <span id="s508">And they were getting along okay, day to day.</span> <span id="s509">Not enough food.</span> <span id="s510">If somebody left a little bit of food over they told them, of course, as we did over here, eat it up because -- well there you didn't know if you were going to get any more food because things were being -- w-were really tough in Poland.</span> <span id="s511">So they wrote about their hardships and they were always happy to hear from us, about the progress we were making.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you get the sense from those letters that they were holding back and not telling you everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s514">Because they were kind of -- somewhat happy that w -- they were getting along day to day, and I suppose not to worry us, not to worry my mother and my aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What else stands out in your mind about those years when you were in the United States and the United States was at war with Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: We were so worried about what was happening to the people in Poland.</span> <span id="s517">We never really knew after 1942, so that was a constant worry about what was happening to the parents, what was happening to my aunt.</span> <span id="s518">And that was a lot of the things that we were talking about around the table, concern for the relatives who had -- couldn’t get out, or had decided not to get out and then at this point couldn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Where were you when you found out the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: I was in Miami Beach and just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s521">And at that point then we started contacting the Red Cross, but they never could find out what happened to my parents -- my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Were you at home when you heard about the end of the war, or were you at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I believe I was at home.</span> <span id="s524">We were jumping for joy.</span> <span id="s525">I remember hopping up and down, saying it’s ov -- finally over.</span> <span id="s526">And my mother and -- my father wasn’t home -- my mother and my brother and I were hugging and kissing and happy that it was finally over, hopefully that we could be -- find some of those relatives who had left but who had not left with us, but we could never do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: When did you begin to realize the full extent of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: It was after the war that we started realizing that so many people had died in the ovens that we were just astounded.</span> <span id="s529">I mean, we thought perhaps they’d be arrested and kept for a few years, but never that they -- anybody was put into the ovens and killed like that.</span> <span id="s530">So it was about 1946 - 1947 that we began to realize the extent of what had been happening over there and how fortunate we had been to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And how did you learn about all the -- the deaths over in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: When we contacted the American Red Cross and as far as I know they never could trace what happened to my family, so we just assumed that they died.</span> <span id="s533">We don’t know exactly how.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Do you remember how the American media reported the news of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: They -- they talked on the radio about Jews having been killed.</span> <span id="s536">I don’t remember that I -- I knew any numbers, like what you heard later on about six million Jews.</span> <span id="s537">I just knew that a lot of Jews were being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: We’re going to pause so I can change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Ruth Alper.</span> <span id="s541">This is tape two, side A. And we were talking about how you came to realize the full extent of the genocide, and I’d like to continue with that.</span> <span id="s542">I had asked you how the news was being relayed to the American population.</span> <span id="s543">I’d like you to continue to speak about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: All right, we heard a lot of it on the radio and we did go to the movies and we would see the newsreels and see what had happened and it was horrifying to see the actual pictures of the cons -- concentration camp people who had been just down to a shell of a person.</span> <span id="s545">So that at that point after the war, we realized more how horrible and how horrific the whole thing had become.</span> <span id="s546">And we never did find out what happened to my grandparents and my Aunt Ella.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How did the American population sitting next to you watching the newsreel, how did they react to this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: They were also horrified when they saw what had happened.</span> <span id="s549">They were just -- it was unbelievable, the slaughter and the inhumanity that had occurred.</span> <span id="s550">So a lot of the people that we were friends with -- and they were Jewish, but they had been American Jews so they didn’t have to go through what we went through, but they just thought it was the worst thing that they had ever seen in their whole life and they’ll probably never see anything so horrendous again.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you ever get a sense from the non-Jewish American population how they were reacting to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: They were -- they were also horrified, but it hadn’t affected them as badly because many of our Jewish friends had family who had gone through some of these times, so they were more inclined to feel the horror that had occurred, whereas some of our American friend who were not Jewish heard about it, but it wasn’t as hurtful as it was to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Did any of your loved ones or former neighbors or friends, any of them survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Well, the friends that we saw in Belgium, who left the Oronoco in Belgium, we never heard from them again, so as far as we know they were sent back to Germany and died there.</span> <span id="s555">I don’t know of any survivors after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yes, I felt that it was important for those Nazis who had incurred this wrath on us that they should be punished for what they had done.</span> <span id="s558">So that I felt the Nuremberg trials were justified and I felt that they were something that brought it home more to Americans than we had known before.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Did you feel there was justice at Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Did you follow the debate on the partition of Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">We were very anxious that those Jewish people who were trying to get into Palestine were having problems on the ships, so that we could identify with that because we had been on a ship also.</span> <span id="s564">Luckily we were able to get off the ship, but we were really concerned that those people who were leaving a Holocaust area would again meet such determination not to be able to come into a country where they might be able to have some freedom of expression and perhaps no anti-Semitism because it was ga -- we were hoping that it would become a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Have you ever considered moving, you or your parents, your family, ever considered moving to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, and we had my Uncle Ben’s family, who had go -- his brother had gone to Palestine early on, before Ben.</span> <span id="s567">Ben said he never considered going there because he had a -- he was a tailor and he was working in Germany, he didn’t see any reason to get out.</span> <span id="s568">That was in the early 1930’s, then later on when we all left, well that was -- he was imprisoned.</span> <span id="s569">There went the -- his income and whatever there ha -- whatever reason he had for staying in Germany was absolutely gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Do you remember the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s572">And I felt the Israelis were right to convict Eichmann of these terrible crimes that had been committed against humanity.</span> <span id="s573">I felt that he had gotten what he deserved, even though they were all saying they were just following orders, there is a time when people have to consider that they are murdering women and children and men who had no other reason for being killed except for the fact that they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Can you recall the reaction of some of the Americans around you to some of these events like the Nuremberg trials and [indecipherable] and then even the nur -- the Eichmann trial [indecipherable] in American media.</span> <span id="s575">If you -- if you could kind of tell me how it was presented and how it was received by the American public?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, the people that I knew felt that these trials were justified because they had also heard about the horrors that had gone on so that they felt that these trials were necessary, that the state Israel was necessary and they even felt that if it hadn’t been for the Holocaust there might not have been a state of Israel.</span> <span id="s577">But people were feeling so guilty about what had happened that it was time that the Jews were able to develop a homeland of their own so that if God forbid this ever happened again, perhaps then people would go to Israel to be somewhat safe.</span> <span id="s578">And the people that I knew felt that the Germans needed to be executed themselves as a result of what they had done during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: The Eichmann trial came in the early 60’s.</span> <span id="s580">Was there any sense that you could detect from Americans that perhaps the war is over [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I detected that with some of the -- th-they’re trying to get some Nazis who are living in Argentina and in South America.</span> <span id="s582">So I have ha -- I got that sense from some of the Americans that I knew that it was old history, these are old men, they shouldn’t be bothered any more.</span> <span id="s583">But we felt that it had to be because they had lived through that time and they knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s584">They all knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Tell me about the education that you were ultimately able to get in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well, I went to South Beach elementary school.</span> <span id="s587">Then Ivan Fisher Junior High and then my senior high school.</span> <span id="s588">Then I went to University of Miami where I met my husband, who was born in Manhattan, New York.</span> <span id="s589">And I got my Bachelor’s degree there.</span> <span id="s590">And we got married, lived in Miami for awhile, then my husband got a job in Towson, Maryland and taught at Towson University, which is a suburb of Baltimore, and I moved with him.</span> <span id="s591">I had taught in Miami, I taught elementary school in Miami.</span> <span id="s592">I took off for about seven years to raise my children til they went to second and third grade and then I went back to school, taught school in Baltimore, got a Master’s and credits beyond that.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Where did you get your Master’s degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Towson University.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I have two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s597">They’re both married and they have two children, boy and a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: What did you tell your children about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I told them that I had been in Germany, and my trip to Cuba.</span> <span id="s600">The one who is very interested in this now is Rebecca, the 11 year old granddaughter, who goes to Hebrew school in Potomac, Maryland and they’re doing a good job there about educating the children on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s601">So she -- and she interviewed me just two days ago, also had a list of questions for me.</span> <span id="s602">And then I gave her one of the sterling silver pieces of sterling that my mother had brought over so she could bring it to Hebrew school and share with the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: In what ways do you think your experiences in your childhood have affected the way that you raised your own children?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I wa -- well, on a personal point of view, my mother was ahead of her time in that she knew psychology before psychology was in -- she felt that positive reinforcement was very important in bringing up children.</span> <span id="s605">So my brother and I both feel confident about ourselves, and I tried to do that for my children.</span> <span id="s606">So that’s a personal point of view, that I brought them up in a positive way.</span> <span id="s607">They did know my history as they were growing up, I never hid that.</span> <span id="s608">I did feel that I didn’t suffer as much as my mother and my aunts, but I told them about what ha -- about my background.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, I have not done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Have you ever been interviewed before?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Why are you willing to do an interview now?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I was persuaded by Amy Rubin at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s615">I explained to her that I didn’t feel that I had suffered like other people.</span> <span id="s616">I wasn’t sure that my story was as important, and Amy Rubin said that that was -- it was a legitimate reason for being interviewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Do you belong to any survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Have you ever returned to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: I did return to Germany, but I didn’t go back to Marktberg.</span> <span id="s621">I went on a trip to s -- to hear opera and to see some of the other coun -- parts of the country.</span> <span id="s622">I did feel uncomfortable with people my age because I always wondered, what were you doing during the war, you know?</span> <span id="s623">Who was putting us to the prisons and the camps and all that horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: How did the Germans react to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I -- I didn’t tell them about my past, so as far as they were concerned, I was just a tourist.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: What have we not discussed in this interview that you would still like to -- to talk about with respect to your experiences as a result of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, the important thing was the trip over from Germany to Cuba, the fact that Aunt Ceeta lost her baby, never told her boys who were born in America that they had a brother.</span> <span id="s628">The fact that my mother never got over the fact that she had to say goodbye to her mother and father on the dock at Hamburg.</span> <span id="s629">She always had that in the back of her mind and as a result of that, she had some mental problems.</span> <span id="s630">Esther did not, her sister.</span> <span id="s631">I think it was as a result of that but maybe she would have had it anyway, but it -- you know, she was just devastated and felt guilty that she left, went on with her life and left her mother and father to die in Poland.</span> <span id="s632">And then my Aunt Ceeta we -- on her tape she said that she couldn't talk about it either, going over it, so she said, and we said -- and we parted, is what she said.</span> <span id="s633">So the loss of my grandparents and my aunt and uncle are the things that I feel the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Is there anything about you and your experience that your family and friends don’t know that you would perhaps like them to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: We, over the years have made many friends with people who are not Jewish, especially the professors at Towson University.</span> <span id="s636">There were only a few Jewish.</span> <span id="s637">So once I -- we became friends on an intellectual and a social basis, I would bring up the fact, number one, that I was Jewish, so that they could see that Jewish people are people of quality also, and then I would tell -- oh, I remember sitting -- I wou -- when I taught school at Franklin elementary school, which was in northern Baltimore county, sitting around the table and talking about my Aunt Ceeta losing the baby.</span> <span id="s638">And these were people who did not know too many Jewish people, there was an area at that time who didn’t have Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s639">And everybody around the faculty table just stopped and listened.</span> <span id="s640">And I felt I wanted them to know that was me, so they could have a little understanding of what some people had gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add before we conclude?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well now that we’ve done the interview I’m glad I was interviewed and I hope this helps to keep the history of the Holocaust alive so that it will never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Well, thank you for doing the interview today, and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ruth Alper.</span> <span id="s644">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">End of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Conclusion of Interview USHMM
