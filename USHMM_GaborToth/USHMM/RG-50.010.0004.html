<p><span id="s4">A: John Henry Baker, Jr.</span> <span id="s5">Q: And your address?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: 116 McIntyre's Drive, Savannah, Georgia.</span> <span id="s7">Q: And date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: July 10, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Your age at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s10">A: Approximately 23, 24 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Prospective profession at the beginning of the war?</span> <span id="s12">A: At the beginning of the war, I was a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Present occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Self-employed.</span> <span id="s15">A paint executive.</span> <span id="s16">Q: Military unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was with the 65th Division.</span> <span id="s18">I commanded Company B, 260th Infantry, Third Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Rank at the time of liberation?</span> <span id="s20">A: Captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And liberated which camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I went through several camps.</span> <span id="s23">Ohrdruf was one that I remember distinctly.</span> <span id="s24">And our unit, the 65th Division, 260th Infantry, ended up in linking up with the Russians in the vicinity of Linz, Austria, and Mauthausen was a very large camp at that particular place.</span> <span id="s25">We also went through some other camps that I frankly cannot remember the names of.</span> <span id="s26">In one of them many soldiers from the New Zealand and Australian troops who had been captured in Crete had been prisoners for some five years.</span> <span id="s27">This was not an extermination camp, but was a camp for prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s28">We were the first company to go through this particular camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How did you first hear about the camps, the first one that you went to?</span> <span id="s30">Did you have any prior knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I'll be very truthful with you.</span> <span id="s32">When you are commanding a rifle company, you've got a very small picture of the large scale.</span> <span id="s33">We usually are in very narrow zones, and we have little or no information of what we may expect in front of us other than the enemy.</span> <span id="s34">Several times we would approach these camps completely unbeknowing to us at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Is that the way that you first approached the first camp you went into?</span> <span id="s36">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Do you remember what the first camp that you went into was?</span> <span id="s38">What was the probable date of arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No.</span> <span id="s40">After 35 years, I haven't thought about these things, and it would be impossible for me to remember dates and places.</span> <span id="s41">At that time, you just tried to do a good job with what you had to do, protect your men, take your objective, and sort of live from day to day.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: As far as the different camps that you went to, can you give me as complete a description as possible?</span> <span id="s43">You mentioned some things before about the actual crematoriums you saw.</span> <span id="s44">Will you talk in as much detail as possible about thenumber of people that you think were there, the sights, the sounds, the smells.</span> <span id="s45">Tell us what you did once you walked in.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I think Ohrdruf was the worst camp that I saw at the time of liberating, and as I have shown you here, we have a few pictures that some of my men took at the time and gave me copies of at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s47">I think from those pictures you'll get a pretty good idea.</span> <span id="s48">Unfortunately, I have destroyed many of them, particularly those that were taken up very close to the bodies which show the expressions on the faces, because small children from time to time see them in my collection of pictures.</span> <span id="s49">I thought they were rather offensive and had destroyed those.</span> <span id="s50">But as you can see from these, there were very large pits.</span> <span id="s51">We show legs sticking out of the pits.</span> <span id="s52">The odor was very bad, and it was something that you didn't want to get too close to or spend much time around other than taking a picture or so.</span> <span id="s53">I think that you can also see from this picture that we have begun lining up the bodies to bury so many of these who had either been killed or had died of natural causes shortly before we arrived.</span> <span id="s54">And in this picture, there are some 100 bodies that we have lined up.</span> <span id="s55">Some are being covered up with cloth, and in this picture you can see the civilian population.</span> <span id="s56">I understand the civilian population claimed not to know anything about what was going on at that camp; yet, it was only a 1/4 or 1/2 mile away from the civilian population.</span> <span id="s57">They could see it, but they claimed that there was nothing wrong going on in there.</span> <span id="s58">So as you can see, the elederly men of the village had been brought up and they actually are digging the graves and are going to handle the bodies with their bare hands to impress upon them what had taken place.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did you get any actual tour of the camp by anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No, other than we were there shortly after the entrance to this camp, and when you are in the infantry, you expect to see these things from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Can you talk about specific buildings or places?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Let’s see if we can find a picture that will show you an outside picture of this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: [Flipping through pictures] This one right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: This one right here.</span> <span id="s65">This is from a distance of probably 200 yards from the exterior of the camp, to give you a brief overall picture of it.</span> <span id="s66">In these buildings, there would be bunks stacked two or three high, and we would find these people lying around, mostly skin and bones.</span> <span id="s67">You just couldn’t believe that they were still living.</span> <span id="s68">First thing you’d want to do was maybe try to help them, but they were too far gone.</span> <span id="s69">They are not paying much attention to us, because they don’t understand what is going on.</span> <span id="s70">They no doubt by this time have been mentally affected.</span> <span id="s71">If you gave them something to eat there probably would be a terrible reaction from them, because they hadn’t had anything to eat in so long.</span> <span id="s72">There was so little we could do for them when you first went into a camp of this nature.</span> <span id="s73">This is a problem for those who would have better knowledge of how to handle those still living.</span> <span id="s74">This is a problems for the medics that were following us.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did you see anything else other than the barracks?</span> <span id="s76">Any work camps?</span> <span id="s77">You have pictures of a gallows there.</span> <span id="s78">I am looking for general type of description.</span> <span id="s79">Did you see any actual crematoriums, physical things?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s81">I saw several crematoriums at one or two camps that I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">However, I don’t know how these people in these pictures that I am showing you here were exterminated, whether they were worked to death or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">From these pits and piles of ashes and bones and decayed flesh, I do not know the number that had been exterminated -- died or killed -- there.</span> <span id="s84">That would have to be determined by someone else who stayed around longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Remember, a front line troop only stays in an area a very short time.</span> <span id="s86">Sometimes we would pass on a camp in one day and keep moving.</span> <span id="s87">The operation -- cleaning up and helping those in it -- would come up by troops following.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So basically what you saw were the outer grounds with the pits, the barracks, and no other major buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: About how much time did you spend at this camp Ohrdruf?</span> <span id="s91">Say a day or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: A day or so, and usually we would just move on.</span> <span id="s93">Sometimes we would go in the afternoon and by early morning we had cleared the area and had gone on.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Were the gates actually open when you walked in?</span> <span id="s95">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Had there been any troops in front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span> <span id="s98">Most times on a camp like this, Jerry 1 knew when and where the American troops were.</span> <span id="s99">He knew approximately about what time we would reach the area, and I assure you that all those in charge of the compounds had changed clothes, gotten into the civilian population, or gotten away as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s100">I am told that these two people in this one picture here who had worked in the prison had put on civilian clothes, and some of the healthier ones who had been inmates wandering around town recognized them, and, as you see, both bodies were completely destroyed by these former inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you have any idea of how many people were at Ohrdruf when it was</span></p> <p><span id="s102">1Term for Germans liberated?</span> <span id="s103">Was there any estimate?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I have no idea, but from what I saw I wo uld think that there were probably 250 to 500.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Were they mainly men who were at the camp?</span> <span id="s106">The prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: .</span> <span id="s108">I saw only men at this particular camp.</span> <span id="s109">There could have been others, but I only saw men.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: You mentioned that some of them were lethargic and in the barracks.</span> <span id="s111">Were there other prisoners who were walking around?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What did they do when they saw the Americans coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Various reactions.</span> <span id="s115">Some absolutely no reaction, and some would be very jubilant.</span> <span id="s116">I don't think that they mentally could comprehend what was taking place at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And you said you were one of the first troops to walk into the compound?</span> <span id="s118">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: I think you had hinted at it before that you really had no specific orders concerning the treatment of these prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, it was unknown to us.</span> <span id="s121">As I say, we would take an area and all of a sudden discover maybe a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: What did you do ?</span> <span id="s123">What did you see any of the other men in your battalion doing for the prisoners?</span> <span id="s124">Did they try and give them some clothes or food?</span> <span id="s125">What was the company’s general reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I think the company's general reaction was this was in our zone.</span> <span id="s127">We were not particularly concerned about these people.</span> <span id="s128">Those troops following us -- the medics, the American government, and those knowledgeable -- would take care of that arrangement.</span> <span id="s129">And that's why we only stayed there a very short time, usually moved right on out.</span> <span id="s130">We were only concerned about the still active German soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did any of the men spend some time talking to the prisoners to find out how they had gotten there and what they had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span> <span id="s133">Remember, they didn’t speak the same language we did.</span> <span id="s134">That was one problem.</span> <span id="s135">So I had no personal conversations with inmates at these prisons.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: But somebody evidently stopped long enough to take these pictures?</span> <span id="s137">A: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s138">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q Are you saying that within the first day or two that it was liberated they did have civilians in the camp?</span> <span id="s140">Do you know who got the civilians there?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A No, that would be up to probably the troops following us.</span> <span id="s142">As I explained, the American government, the troops following us, would take care of that.</span> <span id="s143">We were only a front line infantry init.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: How did your fellow soldiers or superior officers treat the people?</span> <span id="s145">Was there a difference between the regular rank and file and the way that the officers reacted to the people in the camp that you could see?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No, I think that we were all Americans, and I think we all reacted the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Regardless of rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Was there an emotional reaction from a lot of the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: I think there was a very surprised element within most of the troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Could you elaborate?</span> <span id="s151">Were they were surprised that such a thing could happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: That's true.</span> <span id="s153">I think they were surprised to see that this had actually happened, and when you walk upon pits and piles of decayed flesh and bones and rubble and ashes, I think this surprised them more so than seeing these half-starved people.</span> <span id="s154">After all, a half-starved person probably could have been caused from just lack of food available, but I don't think that disturbed the troops as much as the bodies and the other debris in the area did.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did the condition that these people were in, the ones that you remember seeing alive in some of the barracks, make it hard for you to think of them as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A This was the latter part of the war, and remember that front line soldiers had become very toughened by that point, and we had seen many problems with human beings being destroyed.</span> <span id="s157">I think that one of the worst that I could witness would be an American soldier, so here we were seeing foreigners who didn't speak our language.</span> <span id="s158">I don't think that we were as disturbed as much as we probably were later after realizing what had happened.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't realize these things at the time.</span> <span id="s160">We were, as I say, front line troops, living from day to day, doing a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: In your mind, did you see a difference -- this is something that we have caught with some other interviews -- between being killed in combat and this?</span> <span id="s162">You mentioned the hardened troops theory, and granted a lot of these people were war-hardened soldiers, but it was different if you got shot by an enemy that you were shooting at compared to this.</span> <span id="s163">Do you remember thinking anything along those lines, either before or after during the experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A Oh very definitely.</span> <span id="s165">We naturally felt extremely sorry, but there was not much that we could do.</span> <span id="s166">We had to rely on people more knowledgeable than our front line troops to take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were there any guards there when you reached any of the camps?</span> <span id="s168">A No.</span> <span id="s169">Usually, at all of these camps, as I mentioned earlier....</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q; You are speaking of Ohrdruf and Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A; Yes.</span> <span id="s172">The guards would have an idea approximately how far the American troops were.</span> <span id="s173">They would have an idea of when those American troops may get there, and they made sure that they had disappeared in the meantime.</span> <span id="s174">In many cases the camps were wide open.</span> <span id="s175">The inmates were running wild.</span> <span id="s176">Not literally running, but walking and stumbling out, and maybe trying to get to the nearby village.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You had mentioned that while you were in charge of Dachau that you were in charge of the SS, and there were some things you did and did not want to say.</span> <span id="s178">Do you remember any specific orders concerning the treatment of the SS soldiers that you were in charge of?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A This was after the war.</span> <span id="s180">I was transferred some six weeks or possibly two months later to the 9th Infantry Division, and I was in command of Company B, the 47th Infantry.</span> <span id="s181">Our mission was to provide the security for the interior of Dachau prison, and in the interior there were many troops housed outside in the open and also in billets.</span> <span id="s182">But we had one particular section where we had some of the really bad boys in solitary confinement, possibly some of the former camp operators.</span> <span id="s183">And this was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s184">They were governed by the American government troops, and I merely pulled the guard protecting the unit, seeing that there were no escapees and things of that nature.</span> <span id="s185">I did not have direct control of those inmates, only from a security standpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Would you say that your superiors or fellow servicemen -- and this is in reference to your stint at Dachau -- were very resentful or hateful towards the SS you had within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A I think by that time things had begun to mellow and we were thinking more or less of a return to the States; after all, it had been victory in Europe for some six weeks to two months, and I don't think the troops had that in mind at all.</span> <span id="s188">The SS troops that were in the compound were very well controlled by their own superiors, their own officers, and they took care of themselves.</span> <span id="s189">We just made sure they didn’t escape until they were processed to be discharged or further processed.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: At some time you probably had to think about -- you called them "bad boys" -- what kind of people do this.</span> <span id="s191">How did you rationalize after seeing these camps and then being in charge of these prisoners about how such people could do things?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: That's something that’s a little bit of hindsight.</span> <span id="s193">Really, I frankly don't know how to answer that question for you.</span> <span id="s194">I really don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q Did it ever cross your mind about how another human being can develop the capacity to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I think later.</span> <span id="s197">Yes.</span> <span id="s198">Yes.</span> <span id="s199">Later.</span> <span id="s200">But immediately upon this, you are only concerned about the security of your own troops and still the German soldier.</span> <span id="s201">So these things didn't pass our minds at the immediate time.</span> <span id="s202">But, as time wore on, the next day, maybe the next week, even to today, you do think about that quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: You had related one incident that I would like you to go over a little bit now, if you can remember any more details, about some of the DP's2.</span> <span id="s204">We have a question here about violent incidents between the survivors and the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Was it at Ohrdruf or at Mathhausen that you remember these people going out to the town and finding...?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A I think it was practically every camp we went through.</span> <span id="s207">After our units broke</span></p> <p><span id="s208">2Displaced Persons through the Saar Valley, outside of Saarlanduten, [unintelligible] second night we had taken over a small town in the Saar basin.</span> <span id="s209">We got into it after dark, only secured the outer perimeter and probably the first row of houses, so we would have a place to get into for the night.</span> <span id="s210">By the next morning, Jerry had pulled out completely, and we were being told we were going into reserve and would not be pulling out of that town that day.</span> <span id="s211">So, as I started looking around the town for better billets for the company, we found that there was a coal mine in this town and that the commander of the coal mine had a very nice large home.</span> <span id="s212">That looked like a pretty good place to make my headquarters, and when I arrived there, I discovered that there were many displaced personnel.</span> <span id="s213">They had found the wine cellar in the basement and by that time many were drunk, disorderly.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: These were former inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: These were former inmates.</span> <span id="s216">They were primarily Poles in this particular time.</span> <span id="s217">And they had become very unruly at times, and yet those sober would be most cooperative and many followed along with our unit and we carried them along to do a lot of work for us.</span> <span id="s218">They traveled many miles after that working with us.</span> <span id="s219">But then, there were so many that became so disorderly after being freed.</span> <span id="s220">In many cases wherever they found a wine cellar or something of that nature, it was plain chaos and you quite often had some time in managing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: You mentioned that incident.</span> <span id="s222">Did that occur at that place you were staying at?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: At this particular mining town, after they had enough to drink and many of them were in the gutters, we had no more problems.</span> <span id="s224">By that time, we rounded them up and had them back under control.</span> <span id="s225">But now there were other towns, for instance Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s226">At Mathausen concentration camp there, they had slave labor there, and they had a very large number and Linz was declared an open city.</span> <span id="s227">We took Linz with no opposition.</span> <span id="s228">We had opposition not too many miles back down the road, but by the time we took Linz, here were these by the thousands out roaming.</span> <span id="s229">Att times they became very unruly and had to be handled very forcefully to get them back into the stockades or to where we could take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Other than this incident that you related about finding these two people who had tried to become civilians and killing them, do you remember any other specific instances of violence between survivors and guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, I think this was sort of customary anywhere, but this is the only one I have actually a picture of as proof.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: You have the picture of the German civilians there.</span> <span id="s233">Did they voluntarily come to look around the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A No, they did not by any means.</span> <span id="s235">They were very fearful.</span> <span id="s236">Just over that hill was bad news to them.</span> <span id="s237">Many were claiming they didn't know what was taking place in that camp and therefore the American troops made these civilians view it, to witness it.</span> <span id="s238">At that time there were only small children and old men left around the countryside, and these elderly people were forced to come out and dig these graves.</span> <span id="s239">As you can see, that's not soft ground there.</span> <span id="s240">There's a lot of rock in there.</span> <span id="s241">I imagine it took them each a day to dig a grave there.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: How did they react?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Very quiet, would not talk.</span> <span id="s244">The German was very tight-mouthed at that time, and they were very disciplined people.</span> <span id="s245">And we didn’t see the waving of the flag and glad to see us around the towns that we did in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s246">We saw only the white flags out in the countryside and in some cities that I don’t think had camps of this nature around them.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: After seeing the camp and the civilians, did you feel they had any sort of responsibility in what went on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: You just had to think that they had to know something.</span> <span id="s249">They couldn’t have been within a quarter of a mile and not know what is going on inside.</span> <span id="s250">There was a nice open field in-between these civilian houses and the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s251">You just had to feel that they knew what was going on in there.</span> <span id="s252">But they all naturally denied it.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Was there a lot of tension as far as relieving the camps went or did you [treat it] as just another part of your duty?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I am sure that the troops following behind us did have tension of that nature, but I think that for the front line troops it was just a day’s work.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did anyone ask to be relieved of particular duty after seeing what went on at these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s257">I think our troops were too hardened by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">We had good soldiers at the latter stage of the war and they were well- hardened.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Did anyone have any particularly strong reactions to what they saw in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I think that possibly some did, and how to define which group I don’t know.</span> <span id="s261">But I do remember I did have some Jewish members in my command, and they felt a little stronger than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Do you think the chaplains had any more of a stronger role at this time upon discovering something like this in a combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I am sure they did, but I truthfully was not that close to the chaplains, and the chaplains were not close with us.</span> <span id="s264">Chaplains are usually a little behind a rifle company.</span> <span id="s265">They usually were taking care of the sick, the wounded, and things of that nature, and the chaplains would have been those that would have come up into the camps probably no doubt after we had first cleared them.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you tell anybody about the camps, and this means your immediate family or other soldiers that you happened to see?</span> <span id="s267">Did you relate the camp experiences to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: As you can see, there’s a note on the back of each one of these pictures.</span> <span id="s269">I either sent these pictures to my wife or my mother back in the States, so yes, it was free discussion, absolutely free discussion.</span> <span id="s270">In fact, usually at a bad camp the reserve units, the units that weren’t in the front line, would quite often, not be instructed to, but given the opportunity to take truck rides back to there to witness these camps.</span> <span id="s271">This took place.</span> <span id="s272">I think that the American government did want witnesses.</span> <span id="s273">Remember, this is about two days after a camp had been taken and you see the number of soldiers standing around.</span> <span id="s274">A lot of those have been brought up to witness this.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Why do you think the American government felt it important that they witness it?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Because we had heard about these things.</span> <span id="s277">Here was a unit that had gone 500 and some miles through Germany, the longest route of any other Division in Germany, and had some of these troops not actually seen these things they might have gone home and said, “ I didn’t see it,” and “Maybe it didn’t happen.”</span> <span id="s278">It just so happened that these camps weren’t in the sectors of some of the advancing units so I think it was a good idea if the unit was in reserve and could spare a few men and give them an opportunity to go back and see these things.</span> <span id="s279">And that’s what you are seeing in one or two of these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Are you willing to talk about it to prove to people that it did happen or just because you think it was important?</span> <span id="s281">A lot of people don’t grant these interviews right away.</span> <span id="s282">Is there any reason why you decided to, other than getting your record down for posterity?</span> <span id="s283">And was there a hidden motive as to why you think you ought to make people think that these things did happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I think that none of us like to talk about them.</span> <span id="s285">I never talk about them.</span> <span id="s286">I’ve talked about them not too often, and certainly not in many years, but any time I am asked a direct question, I try to give the truth and what I know.</span> <span id="s287">You have asked to interview me on this subject and I am going to tell you just like I saw it and what I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did you feel that it was important that your wife and your mother knew about these, and did you try to convey things to her about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A No, no, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s290">We had heard that these things had taken place.</span> <span id="s291">I believe in the things that I was told in the Service and this was just proof and I don't think that it was any great surprise to my family and certainly not to me.</span> <span id="s292">It just happened that some of these camps did fall in the path of our advancing unit that I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: When you use the phrase "we heard about these things," do you mean just German atrocities in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Just German atrocities in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you hear the word "camps" associated with these atrocities?</span> <span id="s296">Because you used “these things” I was just wondering what kind of rumors had filtered back through the lines before some of these camps were opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: We knew, naturally, they had a lot of prisoner of war camps.</span> <span id="s298">We knew that they were using a lot of slave labor.</span> <span id="s299">We knew that they had a lot of Poles, Russians, French, practically every nationality somewhere in Germany in camps, so there were so many.</span> <span id="s300">And Germany is not a very large country in mileage when you think of a [unintelligible] country, and therefore each village is another new surprise.</span> <span id="s301">Never knowing what we were going to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: But you had hints when you say "these things" that Germans were doing some very immoral things as far as the practicing...the war was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Did you watch the Holocaust TV show when it was on?</span> <span id="s305">A Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Were there any reactions to that that you tied into your camp experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A I thought that some of the scenery in the camps with the bunks were very correct.</span> <span id="s308">I thought it was very truthful what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q Do you think it is important that shows like this be shown, or perhaps that lessons about the Holocaust be taught in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A I think we are then getting involved in politics and things of that nature, and I really don't know.</span> <span id="s311">I think it should be part of history but I have no personal feelings on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Afterwards -- and I am just referring to specific experiences about the camp -- did you have any nagging afterthoughts or perhaps nightmares or restless nights just remembering what you had seen in the camps?</span> <span id="s313">I know that most men who go through combat are going to have to reckon with what they saw sometime later in their life.</span> <span id="s314">I was just wondering if there was anything from the camp that just haunted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A No, not to that degree.</span> <span id="s316">As I said earlier, the things that distressed me most was when I'd see American soldiers being destroyed, and particularly those in my own command.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: We have had some people who we interviewed who mentioned that.</span> <span id="s318">Did you consider yourself a religious person at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s320">Yes.</span> <span id="s321">Very strongly.</span> <span id="s322">I was an Episcopalian.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did the camp experience make you question God or have any more thoughts about how can these beings that we place so much trust in let something like this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, these kind of things in combat didn't cross your mind.</span> <span id="s325">You were too busy thinking about other things.</span> <span id="s326">You are thinking about your troops.</span> <span id="s327">You are thinking about the enemy.</span> <span id="s328">This had already happened, there was nothing we can do about that.</span> <span id="s329">But we still have that man in front of us, the Jerry that just pulled out of there.</span> <span id="s330">And that's who we are after.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did the religion have any effect on your attitudes towards forgiving the Nazis, or did you ever put that much thought into who to blame for something like this pit here?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A I think we only blame the higher echelons and those directly over the camps in situations like that.</span> <span id="s333">I can see, possibly, where a lower echelon, a worker or something, could be gradually dragged into it.</span> <span id="s334">But those in charge and those giving the orders and those overseeing are the bad guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did your experiences change any of your political views as far as maybe the Civil Rights movement or the Viet Nam War or even the establishment of the State of Israel in the Middle East?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A No.</span> <span id="s337">I didn't think from a political standpoint at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: I would gather from what you had said that you may not have thought this was primarily a Jewish persecution .</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: No.</span> <span id="s340">I don't think so, because in many of these camps there were not only Jewish people that I saw, but I saw Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs, Czechs, all</span></p> <p><span id="s341">denominations.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Did what you see at the camps and what you heard afterwards change your attitude about the Jewish people in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: None whatsoever, except the world has realized that they had a very misfortune in Germany and I think the world is very one-sided in that today.</span> <span id="s344">I think the German people today, from what I read in here -- I haven't been back since -- fully realize this now.</span> <span id="s345">And certainly the Germans that I have met since World War II coming out of Germany fully understand it, regret it, yet they were headed, you might say, by a fanatic group.</span> <span id="s346">That group, I hope, has been liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you feel a need to do anything today to make sure this never happens again?</span> <span id="s348">In education, religion, things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A That's pretty hard when you see the problems around the world even today in Iran, and it just depends upon which side you are on.</span> <span id="s350">It looks like we will never learn.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: There are a couple more things that I would like to discuss.</span> <span id="s353">We don’t need necessarily specific dates or names, but if you can remember anything concrete about the camps that you viewed.</span> <span id="s354">Usually it takes you a minute to think back about what you saw other than the barracks and the pits.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Anything of the general layout of Ohrdruf and Mauthausen, any little detail that you can remember helps us to complete a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I remember in the picture Holocaust the so-called “showers” which turned out to be gas chambers and those chambers that I saw were exactly as laid out in the movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Do you remember if this was Ohrdruf or Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I would say at Dachau.</span> <span id="s359">I did not get into that part of it at Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s360">I was only where the bodies were, in the billets where they were still sleeping and so forth.</span> <span id="s361">I was too busy to be looking up every little detail.</span> <span id="s362">That was very immaterial, if it wasn’t being used at the time.</span> <span id="s363">I think one of the things, though, that stuck out in my mind was pictures that I saw when I took over command of the unit, the interior guard at the Dachau prison.</span> <span id="s364">Our billets were formerly SS troop quarters, and on the walls were big, slick photographs.</span> <span id="s365">They had a pair of ice tongs that we usually used to pick up 100 or 200 pound blocks of ice with, and there would be a picture of the Germans moving these bodies around with these ice picks and stacking them, before the camp was liberated.</span> <span id="s366">They probably had the picks through the head and they’d be dragging bodies around and stacking them up.</span> <span id="s367">That picture stuck in my memory for a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What else did you see at Dachau?</span> <span id="s369">Were there still any remains of the prisoners by the time you had gotten there?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: If they were, they were getting back to health.</span> <span id="s371">They were outside the compound.</span> <span id="s372">They were sort of displaced persons.</span> <span id="s373">We called them that on the exterior, and they seemed to be getting along all right.</span> <span id="s374">No doubt they were being fed by the American troops, and the ones that I saw were still being rather useful to us.</span> <span id="s375">They knew their way around, they knew what had happened, and they were quite useful for us.</span> <span id="s376">They were actually doing a little work and helping around.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did you ever talk to any of the SS that you were in control of at Dachau?</span> <span id="s378">A: No, no, I never talked to any of the SS.</span> <span id="s379">I never interviewed SS in combat, and I was up against them several times.</span> <span id="s380">I took them prisoners too.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: As far as the actual liberation process at either of the camps, I need a little more specifics in the reaction of the people of the camp who were still walking around.</span> <span id="s382">Did people try and communicate with them?</span> <span id="s383">Did they try and give them stuff or did you ignore them and take a look around?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A I think we would naturally have to ignore them at the time; we can't go in shaking hands, it's not that type of operation whatsoever.</span> <span id="s385">We would take a camp to make sure there were no Germans still in there.</span> <span id="s386">Not knowing what's in there, we’ve got to look.</span> <span id="s387">We’ve got to search it out, and we've got to secure it, and we've got to move on to set up our defenses if not still on the attack Q But, evidently somebody was there lo ng enough to take these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A Yes, these were taken a few days later, and these were taken by some members of my command who merely gave me the pictures.</span> <span id="s389">I frankly have never taken a picture of my own by myself, but I was there; I was a witness.</span> <span id="s390">In fact, here is a picture right here of Dr. Schley.3</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Oh, in that picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A Yes, that's him from the rear.</span> <span id="s393">I think you see a Red Cross on his helmet.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Were these taken on the day that you said you were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: This man here was a soldier of mine, and these are authentic pictures, no doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Would you say at the time these pictures were taken that you were within the camp area?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I was within the sight of the picture.</span> <span id="s399">We weren't taking pictures of each other.</span> <span id="s400">We were taking pictures of conditions.</span> <span id="s401">This is what I have here.</span> <span id="s402">These are not pictures of each other.</span> <span id="s403">Yes, I was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Do you think the reason these people took pictures is because people 3Another liberator interviewed by The Witness to the Holocaust Project wouldn't believe them when you came back to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: That's a pretty gruesome sight here.</span> <span id="s406">I think that anyone who would have a camera would certainly use it at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Just to record it for history.</span> <span id="s408">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: There was also something else that you had mentioned that really didn’t affect you at the time, but it wasn't until afterwards.</span> <span id="s410">If you can expand a little bit on that about how things maybe sunk in a little more after you realized....</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A I think you realize later, after time goes on, particularly the next day, the next week, if you had time then to think.</span> <span id="s412">During combat you don't have much time to think about what you just saw.</span> <span id="s413">You better be thinking about what is going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: But you do think that at sometime it did start to sink in about the whole process of the Germans’ inhumanity to man on this type of level?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A I think that as far as I am concerned, we merely witnessed what we had heard, and what we expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s417">As far as that goes, I don't have many more questions.</span> <span id="s418">The only other thing I would be interested in is with regard to Dachau.</span> <span id="s419">Will you just go over that again.</span> <span id="s420">You were just in charge of guarding prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I was in charge of the interior security in Dachau prison.</span> <span id="s422">This was a very large compound, so there were other troops around the exterior, but my men were all inside the prison, controlling the security of the solitary confinement section and other sections within the interior of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did you have any problems with the SS that you were guarding?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s425">Remember, at the time the SS -- in fact, the entire German nation -- were so thoroughly beat that there was no opposition.</span> <span id="s426">There was nothing but cooperation at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did any of them try and commit suicide that you know of?</span> <span id="s428">A: The soldiers themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q The SS.</span> <span id="s430">Yes.</span> <span id="s431">Or the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A I am sure there were suicides.</span> <span id="s433">I don't recall any in my direct view, but I understand there were some suicides.</span> <span id="s434">I had heard that the mayor of Ohrdruf was forced to go down and look into this camp and these are the pictures that we have here.</span> <span id="s435">I have heard, and it was very authentic, that when he returned from the camp, he committed suicide when he went home.</span> <span id="s436">I don't know whether that was an admission that he knew about the camp or that he was really so shocked at what he had seen at the camp, since he was mayor of the town it was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: How long were you with the interior guard of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I was there for about three weeks, then I volunteered for the invasion of Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Is there anything else that you can remember from your experiences that you would just like to add or to put down any comments?</span> <span id="s440">Any other things that happened along the way that you would just like to discuss?</span> <span id="s441">You can take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Elizabeth, after 35, 36 years, and this is something that you put out of your mind, it is pretty hard to think back and to be able to remember certain things.</span> <span id="s443">It is most difficult.</span> <span id="s444">I think, though, from what I can remember of this particular time is spelled out right here in these pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: I think that will just about do it then.</span></p></body></html>
