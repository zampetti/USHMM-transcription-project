9th of December, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And how old were your parents?</span> <span id="s25">When were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father was born in March, 1898, and my mother in February, 1899.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: How many brothers and sisters do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I have one sister, Helen, and she was born in January, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What was it like in France, probably you were going to school, before Hitler and the army of Germany came into France, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: It was a very easy life, and I just started school in 1939, just before the war came the Germans came into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What was the religious background of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My father was Protestant, and my mother was very Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: When did they become Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My father started in 1925.</span> <span id="s35">One of the first books, the Heart of God, I don't remember, but by that book he became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: And what about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: She fought against the truth very long, and in 1929 she became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, four years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Well, what was it that appealed to them, since they came from a Protestant and Catholic background, why would they want to change their religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father, because the Protestants, they had the Bible but no explanation, they just had a Bible and he wanted to know what was in it and what it meant.</span> <span id="s40">And my mother, by the way of life of my father and his faithfulness meant that she got interested too.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did your parents understand that if Hitler would have come into France that it could create problems for them because of their religious position in connection with the</span></p> <p><span id="s42">war?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes, they knew it because Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted since 1933 in Germany.</span> <span id="s44">And we lived in the eastern part of France, close to the German parts and sometimes German parts came over in France to take Watch Towers and publications.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So then you were aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Oh, yes, we knew it, and we had the _______ in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s47">In Germany it was the title I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Then your folks were instrumental in helping to get some of the publications of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: To Germany, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: How were they able to do that, do you remember?</span> <span id="s51">You were very, very young, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I was very young.</span> <span id="s53">The sisters came and they put the Watch Towers on them so when they found them it could go through.</span> <span id="s54">They even had sometimes an assembly and met, so the Germans came over and met, and they had a one-day assembly.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What was the purpose of those one-day assemblies?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Just to give them instructions and have an assembly.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s58">How many people were in the congregation that you were within the eastern part of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: About 25 when war came.</span> <span id="s60">Twenty-five, thirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And how did your family prepare you and your sister in case something might happen?</span> <span id="s62">Or didn't you think anything was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, we were prepared.</span> <span id="s64">We were prepared.</span> <span id="s65">My sister, she was quite a few years older than I, so she was an adult person?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, but I had to take spanking at school for not saluting the flag and saying Heil Hitler, so my parents prepared me in giving instructions what Jehovah wants one of his witnesses, to be neutral.</span> <span id="s68">And they taught me they taught me to have confidence in Jehovah whatever might happen, because sometimes I came from school and the SS had taken my mother from home to put them to question, so when I came home there was nobody at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s70">Well, for a moment let's just go back to the time when you first started school if you can remember, it's many years ago of course, before the German armies came into France.</span> <span id="s71">What was it like in school, do you remember, about the idea they had to</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: They have to salute the flag, to say Heil Hitler, and sing the hymn.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: The national anthem?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes, with having the hand, the right arm out.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Well, why wouldn't Jehovah's Witnesses Heil Hitler and salute the flag?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: They couldn't do it because they were neutral and on account of in the book of Acts, Chapter 4, Verse 12, it is said that the head, no, not the head, how do you say it</span></p> <p><span id="s77">in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: The leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Don't have an English Bible.</span> <span id="s80">I don't know how to say it in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Well, that's okay.</span> <span id="s82">Why don't you just give us the gist?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Well, it is written that the…it's one word I need.</span> <span id="s84">Could we come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yes, if you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">(Recess)</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s88">Now that we have that word, go ahead, would you like to begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, because it says there, that salvation only comes by Christ and not by human, so we couldn't actually get salvation to Hitler, and say Heil to Hitler, which means salvation to Hitler, so we couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So then your parents prepared you for this ahead of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, every day before I left home to go to school my mother prayed with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: That must have been a very hard time for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, it had to be.</span> <span id="s94">But we were confident in Jehovah, which my parents showed me to have all the time and every time before I should answer when they asked me, I was supposed to pray very fast so that my answer would be as Jehovah wanted, and to have the strength to be faithful.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s96">Do you remember what it was like as a very young girl, what it was like when the German armies came into France?</span> <span id="s97">What was everyone talking about, or were you too young to remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s99">They put down the stop (indicating) and looked behind because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s100">Everybody knew that when the Germans came it was terrible for France.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s102">Now, what began to happen to you and your family after the German armies came in?</span> <span id="s103">What happened to your mother, your father, your sister and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: My father was supposed to go in the aperitif army, the army where that was civilian, to help out when there was the bombs come in so.</span> <span id="s105">My mother was supposed with my sister to sew the soldiers' vests.</span> <span id="s106">And I was at school.</span> <span id="s107">So my father refused, my mother refused, my sister refused, and I refused to work with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s109">So did that bring real pressure on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And the whole congregation that you…</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: And the whole congregation, because my father was…congregation ________ by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So he was the one in charge of the congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s116">How was he able to help the others in the congregation?</span> <span id="s117">What did he do to help them to prepare for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Well, he make many home visits and help them, explain them, and very often we had studies at home.</span> <span id="s119">So I was playing outside and watching if the SS came.</span> <span id="s120">So when I saw somebody who was like an SS, I called my mother and they put away the Watch Tower and drank coffee, so there was nothing wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Very good.</span> <span id="s122">What was the year that the Nazi, or the German armies, I should say, came into France?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: 1940.</span> <span id="s124">When the month of May…</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So that was after they attacked Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes, afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So after they attacked Holland, you knew it was just a matter of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: …that they were coming down?</span> <span id="s130">Okay.</span> <span id="s131">Now, your parents and your older sister refused to engage in any type of activity for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: …because of your position of neutrality?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What began to happen from that point onward?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, from time to time they came, the SS, at home and searched everywhere for publications, for pictures, if we had some pictures, some address of one of our parts, they picked them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So they knew you were Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, we were very known as Jehovah's Witnesses all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s140">Everybody knew that.</span> <span id="s141">So there was no hiding that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No, no, none at all.</span> <span id="s143">They knew it.</span> <span id="s144">So sometimes they went to the work of my father and picked him up and two or three hours later they let him go.</span> <span id="s145">Sometimes they took my mother, or my sister, for interrogation to arrest them and they let them go.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What type of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: He was a machinist where…There were many industries in the eastern part of France.</span> <span id="s148">He was machinist.</span> <span id="s149">Well, he know machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: And what was the town that you were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: He worked in Chambie.</span> <span id="s152">Beetenhoven they called it in Germany.</span> <span id="s153">Now they call it in France Chambee.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Is that part of the Alsace?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Lorraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Now they call it the Lorraine area.</span> <span id="s157">I see.</span> <span id="s158">Did the people there after the Germans came in, did the people there put pressure on you and your family also because they were pro German?</span> <span id="s159">Did they put pressure on your folks or did they try to help Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It was half and half.</span> <span id="s161">Some helped Jehovah's Witnesses, those who were for the French, and others put pressure on us because they were pro German.</span> <span id="s162">So we had some who helped.</span> <span id="s163">The lady who lived under us, she helped us.</span> <span id="s164">When she saw somebody who looked like SS or something like that, she knocked so we put away Watch Tower or something.</span> <span id="s165">She helped very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Now, maybe you can tell us what happened to your father now.</span> <span id="s167">He was picked up, released, picked up, released for interrogation, and then what finally happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, in January '43, they picked us up altogether, all four together.</span> <span id="s169">At January 28 at half past three in the morning, they came and picked us up, all four.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Half past three in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: In the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You remember it.</span> <span id="s175">Were you very startled, were you surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, we were not surprised, because we expected this.</span> <span id="s177">They picked us up so very often for interrogation, and said they would put us in the camps if we don't stop being Witnesses, or meeting, so we expected.</span> <span id="s178">We were not surprised at all.</span> <span id="s179">Every evening we said we are together today, where we would be tomorrow?</span> <span id="s180">Will we be together?</span> <span id="s181">How will it come, if they would pick us one after the other or…</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s183">Well, that's interesting.</span> <span id="s184">Then from 1940 to '43, they didn't put you in prison.</span> <span id="s185">How were you able to carry on your Bible educational work that your Jehovah's</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Witnesses engaged in?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Everything was underground, so the meetings were underground, and the preaching was underground.</span> <span id="s188">We had to be very careful to whom we spoke and what we said and had nothing at all, no picture, no photo, no Watch Tower, nothing, so when they came there was nothing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So then your father, was he able to do any of the translating or passing on the information?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: He passed the Watch Towers.</span> <span id="s191">He covered a lot from one congregation to the other, to take the Watch Towers and print it to others.</span> <span id="s192">And we were all busy, not I was too busy, but the publishers were busy writing, copying the Watch Towers by hand, a few pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: So then in January of '43 they came to your house at three o'clock in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes, half past.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Half past three, you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Now, what would happen from that point on?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: So they put us in the train, and they put us three days later, we were three days in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Who were you with in the train?</span> <span id="s200">Who were you with in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, people from around.</span> <span id="s202">Just one family was Jehovah's Witnesses, even not the whole family, just the father was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s203">He became one in 1941, but his wife and his ten children were not Jehovah's Witnesses, but they picked them up as Jehovah's Witnesses, and the lady came out as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s205">Interesting.</span> <span id="s206">Okay.</span> <span id="s207">Then you were on a train together.</span> <span id="s208">What type of a train was it?</span> <span id="s209">Were you standing, or were you sitting?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Some wagons were for sitting and some was standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Was it very crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: It was crowded.</span> <span id="s213">Forty about in one wagon they were standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s215">And who were some of the other people that were on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: They all were Communists or it was political prisoners they pick up.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Then you were taken to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: We were taken to Kornowiec.</span> <span id="s219">It's near Katowice.</span> <span id="s220">Now it's Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: That far?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: That far.</span> <span id="s223">That's why it was three days long, the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did they serve you food and things to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes, sometimes they gave food.</span> <span id="s226">Once or twice a day we got some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: As a young girl at that time, could you describe what was going through your mind?</span> <span id="s228">How did your mother feel and your father, and even for yourself though, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: It was very terrible for them, because a child doesn't know why one is hungry.</span> <span id="s230">I told my mother, “Mother, I am hungry.”</span> <span id="s231">But she had nothing to give to me, so for her it was worse than for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: She was concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes, she had nothing to give to her child, and I didn't realize this and I hurt her.</span> <span id="s234">So, well, I was waiting what will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You had no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And how about your father, how did he feel?</span> <span id="s238">Do you know what he said to you on that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: He always told us to be faithful, whatever we had to do, should be faithful to Jehovah.</span> <span id="s240">And if one of us would die, we expect a resurrection.</span> <span id="s241">If we couldn't meet again in this system, then we would meet again in the new system.</span> <span id="s242">He had a very, very strong faith, my father was confident in Jehovah for his faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So what do you mean by the new system?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, in the new world we are praying for that God's kingdom would come on earth, and that His will would be done on earth, so it's just a new system.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s246">Now, it took you three days.</span> <span id="s247">What happened when you arrived at your destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, they put us in the Camp Kotlow.</span> <span id="s249">And it was a camp, it wasn't very hard not in the kind of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s250">It was just deportation camp.</span> <span id="s251">It was not as bad as concentration camp.</span> <span id="s252">It was to change our mind, to make of us Germans, with German idea.</span> <span id="s253">Well, two months later they give to my parents the paper to sign that we wouldn't be Jehovah's Witnesses anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: And my father refused.</span> <span id="s256">So they said you will never more get back to France.</span> <span id="s257">We were condemned to stay in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Well, during that two-month period, what did your father and your mother do, and yourself, did they assign you some type of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes, they had to work.</span> <span id="s260">I don't know exactly what they did, but they had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And how about the young children, your sister and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: My sister, she always worked with my mother, they never got apart, because she was an age to work.</span> <span id="s263">They were always together.</span> <span id="s264">I had to work to make to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You had to sew?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: And they had you sewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Yes, or taking care of the vegetables, preparing the food.</span> <span id="s271">Since we were Jehovah's Witnesses, the SS had confidence in us and they sent me sometimes out to do some</span></p> <p><span id="s272">shopping for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Oh, is that right?</span> <span id="s274">So you worked in your homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, in the camps, but they sent me out to do the shopping for them, go to buy them the bread and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did you have on your ordinary clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you have on the purple triangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: You didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did you see the mistreatment of any of the other prisoners in that camp?</span> <span id="s283">Or what type of other prisoners were in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: They all were political prisoners, because they had no German minds, because some of the kin out of Larraine was with Germany as one country, so the young men were supposed to do German military service, and they didn't want to do it, so they went to France.</span> <span id="s285">And the parents that stayed there, they picked them up and many of those who were with us in the camps were parents of sons who didn't want to go in German military.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s287">All right.</span> <span id="s288">Now, you were in that particular site camp.</span> <span id="s289">Were there other Jehovah's Witnesses in the same camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Just one family.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Just the one family?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: One family.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Were you able to get together at all for your Bible reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes, we got together with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Were you able to get any information inside that camp, your Bible publications?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, we just had the Bible.</span> <span id="s297">We just had one Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: They permitted you to have a Bible?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes, one Bible, so with one Bible we had to discuss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Was it in French or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: German, because my parents only spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Oh, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes, because the eastern part of France, they went to school before 1918 when Alsace became France.</span> <span id="s304">It was Germany before 1918 so they spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: That was part of the Versailles Treaty that went back over to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So they spoke mainly German then?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did they speak any French at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s311">Very little.</span> <span id="s312">They say some words, but they spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were your father and your mother and your sister, or even yourself, were you able to carry on your Bible educational work inside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Well, we talked to the other prisoners, but they were mainly busy getting to eat, getting some food and getting out of the camp.</span> <span id="s315">They weren't interested in the Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Now, as a young person at nine years of age, there you were peeling potatoes and going to the store.</span> <span id="s317">What was going through your mind?</span> <span id="s318">Did you think you'd ever get out of</span></p> <p><span id="s319">that place?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No, at the beginning we didn't expect to get out.</span> <span id="s321">We thought, because the Germans was going on, and we expected that at the end of the war maybe it will be Armageddon, but later we got the Watch Tower, well, some sheets of the Watch Tower, and it was explained that after the war there will be great work to be done in preaching, and it wouldn't be Armageddon at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s322">So we expected to come out.</span> <span id="s323">And then we knew that the Germans were losing the war, so we waited to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How did you find out that the Germans were beginning to lose the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, there was some prisoners who made the radio and they could listen and they told us what was going on outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Now, was your father, your mother and your sister ever mistreated by any of the SS guards or soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: My sister and my mother, they had very hard work to do, _________ work, and it was very hard for them, and it was very cold there in Poland.</span> <span id="s332">My father was sometimes mistreated because I refused to say Heil Hitler, and they always telling him that he was forbidding me to say Heil Hitler, and this was not true.</span> <span id="s333">He gave me the reason why I was supposed not to say Heil Hitler, but it was a thing between Jehovah and me, not between my father and Jehovah and me.</span> <span id="s334">It was my own decision not to say Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s335">It wasn't his decision.</span> <span id="s336">So the Germans couldn't believe that a little girl, nine, ten years, has a personal decision not to say Heil Hitler on account of her faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: So then they would persecute your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: My father because they were telling him that he convince me.</span> <span id="s339">It was not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So he gave you the reasons, you understood them?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And you made up your own mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: He always said if they beat you up and you say Heil Hitler, you still are my girl, doesn't change anything between you and me, it change something between you and Jehovah.</span> <span id="s344">So if you say or not say, it's between you and Jehovah.</span> <span id="s345">So it was my own decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s347">Was it hard for you to stand up to those men and not say Heil Hitler?</span> <span id="s348">Was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Well, I was very shy when I was young, and so it was difficult, but I always prayed Jehovah before answering so I could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: It was said that some of the German soldiers would sometimes try to take advantage of the female prisoners.</span> <span id="s351">Did you ever hear of that happening in the camp you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: In the camps we were, no.</span> <span id="s353">I know it happened in some camps but not in the one we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: But some terrible things went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, but mainly in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s356">Not the deportation camps where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What type of food did your family get when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: The food was very bad.</span> <span id="s359">We had the peeling from the potatoes, not the potatoes.</span> <span id="s360">The peeling.</span> <span id="s361">And it was poor.</span> <span id="s362">There was no meat, no vegetables, and they cooked, they boiled the bones of horses and the water they gave, the boiling water, they put it for our food.</span> <span id="s363">Very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Were you always hungry as a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Always.</span> <span id="s366">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And then what did they give you to drink other than soup?</span> <span id="s368">Was there coffee every morning or tea?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, there was something like coffee, but very bad coffee.</span> <span id="s370">It wasn't good coffee.</span> <span id="s371">Hot water.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Now, what were the living conditions like in the camp that you were in?</span> <span id="s373">Were you in your own room as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: No.</span> <span id="s375">It was different at camps, and the most of them you were two there was a bed below and a bed on the top, and there were about fifty, sixty persons sleeping in the</span></p> <p><span id="s376">same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s378">So you slept very close together?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What type of heat did you have in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did they keep…By the way, before we go on to that, did they have all the females together and all the men someplace else or did they have the families together?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: The had the families together.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Was that the same way with other families too?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yes, there was families, one after the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: So all the families were very close?</span> <span id="s387">All right.</span> <span id="s388">And what type of heating system did they have there in Poland in those barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: There were what you call it?</span> <span id="s390">Coal and wood…</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Just one stove?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s393">One stove for whole room.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: For the whole room?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Who was able to be the closest to the stove where the heat was?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Those who arrived the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So you had some sense of seniority; the oldest ones or the first ones there…</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: The first ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And who was put in charge of the

them?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Always German.</span> <span id="s410">We were always with German.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And what type of clothing did you have, just…</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: What we had when we came from home.</span> <span id="s413">We kept that.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So you kept that clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did you have an overcoat as well to keep warm?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yes, because we were picked up in January, so we were already clothed.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did you see any of the people there being persecuted other than being in prison and having hard work to do; did you see any of them being beaten, being tortured, or did you hear…</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Tortured, no.</span> <span id="s420">There were some who were beaten up, because they were not neutral, you know, they sang the Marseillaise.</span> <span id="s421">When they met SS, they sang the patriotic songs, so they were picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Do you remember as a young girl since they were German, did they celebrate the Christmas holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes, Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Now, Jehovah Witnesses don't…</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s426">We had no…we didn't teach the Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So you didn't celebrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: What did you think of these people who claimed to be Christians celebrating the birth of Christ, yet they were treating other people the way that they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Well, their whole way of acting showed that they were not Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: But yet they celebrated the birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes, but their life was no Christian life.</span> <span id="s433">So it was very hypocritical.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Hypocritical?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Were there any clergymen in the camp that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, no clergy.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: No type of Catholic or protestant clergymen at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A:

train.</span> <span id="s443">So in the beginning you didn't think you were going to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, no, and they told us since we refuse to sign no more to be Jehovah's Witnesses, they told us you never more come out of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did they ever threaten your family, your father and your mother and your older sister that they were going to, say, Auschwitz or any of the other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: They told my father that he would go to Auschwitz because it was the closest where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s448">Did your parents ever experience any health problems or yourself because of the lack of proper food and type of conditions you were under?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Since we came back from deportation, I have been all the time to take care of the health.</span> <span id="s450">I have a very poor health.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: What type of health problems, if I may ask, do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: The bones, because of nutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: The bones mainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How about other prisoners, did you see other prisoners having health problems there because of the lack of proper food, nutrition?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes, many have very poor health.</span> <span id="s457">But the difference is, they were very disappointed because they were deported on account of politics, so afterward they were disappointed because things were not going better than before the deportation, so they say they suffered in vain, but we suffered for being faithful to Jehovah, so even if we had some problems with the health afterwards, we never regretted to be in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s459">As the war started to come to an end, which armies were getting close?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, the Germans put us out of the camps in Schleching where we were, and we had to walk 249 kilometers by foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What was that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Because where we were, there was the Russian soldiers came and Germans wanted to empty the camps, so they put us out and put us in the western part of Germany.</span> <span id="s463">So it was American soldiers that liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s465">Now, you had to walk that distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: And how were you able ｩｩ How were you and the other prisoners able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s469">And those who couldn't walk, they just left them and killed them on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So they shot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: So we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And you were able to help each other as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Now, what was going through your mind at that time since you were walking to the western part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Well, we knew that freedom was close and so we were glad to be free again and to get to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So then who finally then who did you come in contact with, which of the armies?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: USA Army, Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: And which army was it?</span> <span id="s481">Do you remember which battalion or which division?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, no, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And how did they treat you folks when they…</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: They were very kind because by that time we were the only Witnesses.</span> <span id="s485">All others were war prisoners and political prisoners, so they put us together and put us in the train.</span> <span id="s486">It was on April 20 they came to deliver us, and on May 5 we were back home.</span> <span id="s487">So it went very fast.</span> <span id="s488">They put us together and on the train and home.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did the American soldiers ask you why you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, they were not interested.</span> <span id="s491">They put everything together, everybody together to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s493">But they knew that all of you had been prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did they catch the German soldiers that were seeing to it that you were transported?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: The German soldiers were all gone.</span> <span id="s497">There were no SS anymore in the camps.</span> <span id="s498">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s499">We were free because the Germans were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: So they all took off?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: At what time did they all take off?</span> <span id="s503">No doubt they had to run away or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: It was Steinfeld.</span> <span id="s505">I don't remember exactly when it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: How did your family…Did you wake up one day and they were all gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, no, they came at half past two in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s508">We were in the mine, where you put out the…</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Coal?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Coal, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s511">We were there because the shots…</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Oh, the armies were shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Uh-huh, so we went there to keep safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s515">With who, was it just your family or was it all the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: All the prisoners were there, and some knew what was going on and at half past two the American soldiers came and we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did the American soldiers at first think that maybe you were part of the enemy?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, they knew there was a camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: They realized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Had your father and your mother and the other prisoners, had they lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes, everybody was very slim.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: So the American soldiers knew that you weren't soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, we were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: If you were soldiers you were very thin?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s528">So then when you arrived home, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: We were very, very happy to be all four together, that none was dead, and none made the compromise.</span> <span id="s530">All four were faithful to Jehovah up to the end.</span> <span id="s531">We had nothing more material.</span> <span id="s532">Even to the clothes we had, they didn't belong to us, it was the neighbor who gave it to us, because what we had was very dirty and we had to burn this up.</span> <span id="s533">So the neighbor gave us some clothes, borrowed the clothes, and we had nothing more.</span> <span id="s534">And my mother said to my sister and myself always remember that day, we have nothing, even not the clothes we have belong to us, but we are back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: How about your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well, we had no home anymore because the Germans gave…to the neighbor everything that belonged to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: All your furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s539">And somebody else was in our apartment.</span> <span id="s540">So one of the neighbors gave us a home and we stayed there, and day after day somebody came, we have your bed and pulled us the</span></p> <p><span id="s541">bed and table.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So little by little they started…</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: But the thing, when we came home we had nothing more, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So little by little the neighbors began to bring back…</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Well, that was nice of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes, very nice.</span> <span id="s550">We didn't get all things back, but much.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So then your father went back to work doing some type of…</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Well, we had some time to take care of the health, to eat and all that, and sometime, about two months later my father started to work, working where he was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What did they think about you and your family?</span> <span id="s554">What did other people think since you were picked up for your faith, your beliefs, taken to a camp and came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Well, they were…how would you say it in English?</span> <span id="s556">They appreciated that we came back.</span> <span id="s557">And one man who worked with my father before we were in the camp, after watching was interested in the truth and he became one of Jehovah's Witnesses because it impressed him that my father and his family went to the camps and came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Very good.</span> <span id="s559">Now, what happened to you after the war then, did you go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And then what did you do with your life afterwards then?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Well, I wanted to pioneer, so my father didn't want to let me go when…I wanted to go at fourteen years and he said, "You are too young, you have to learn first a job."</span> <span id="s563">So I had to learn to sew.</span> <span id="s564">And at seventeen then I began pioneering.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What do you mean by pioneering?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Serving God as a minister, missionary, and teaching the people the Bible, the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: And teaching them what is the hope for mankind, God's new world where there will be no war any more, and where all the bad will be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Now, I understand you went to a school.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s571">In 1953 I went to theist school and there I got the touch for being a missionary, and then I was sent to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So then you were sent to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So you thought you might be going to Africa
