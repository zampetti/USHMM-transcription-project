RAAB AND ESTHER RAAB</span></p> <p><span id="s12">June 6, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s13">YL: I studied here in Yeshiva Torah Vodaas and I have semicha.</span> <span id="s14">I was born, in 1928, near Chust, Hungary.</span> <span id="s15">During the war I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s16">I came to America in 1949 with the Marine Marlin.</span> <span id="s17">My uncle gave me an affidavit.</span> <span id="s18">.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">IR: I'm born, in 1918, near Chelm, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">WH: Tell me a little about yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">ER: I am one of the few people to escape from Sobibor.</span> <span id="s22">My story is in a movie called, Escape from Sobibor.</span> <span id="s23">I was born in Chelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">WH: And what year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">ER: Everything you wanna know?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WH: You don't have to give me the exact year.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">ER: 1922</span></p> <p><span id="s28">WH: How many people escaped from Sobibor?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">ER: Maybe 300, but after the war there were maybe only 40 left.</span> <span id="s30">And today, I think, only 18 people are left.</span> <span id="s31">You know Professor Hilberg's book?</span> <span id="s32">In the U.S. only 3 or 4 survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">ER: I told him I don't agree with what you wrote.</span> <span id="s35">It's misleading.</span> <span id="s36">You got all the information from the Germans.</span> <span id="s37">And he said: "You're from Sobibor?"</span> <span id="s38">And I said: "Yes."</span> <span id="s39">And he said: "You're a rare bird.</span> <span id="s40">But I'm very tired and I can't talk to you now.</span> <span id="s41">I have to go to sleep.”</span> <span id="s42">And that was the last I ever heard from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: Was there something different about the Sobibor survivors from, say, the Auschwitz or Buchenwald survivors, of whom there were many more?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">ER: Yes, because all the other camps had slave labor and extermination sections.</span> <span id="s45">Sobibor was just a death camp.</span> <span id="s46">I was there over nine months until I escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">WH: How did you get to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">ER: By plane because I was pregnant, on the Flying Tiger Line.</span> <span id="s49">It was a very difficult flight because we flew from Germany to France and then, for some reason, they couldn't continue, and they didn't feed us.</span> <span id="s50">We had some money but we were afraid to take it out because there were Ukrainians and God knows what on the plane.</span> <span id="s51">We stayed there two days and two nights before we continued to Newfoundland.</span> <span id="s52">There was a big flood in New York and we couldn't land there.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: You must have been exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">ER: Listen, After you've lived through Sobibor, nothing is really so terrible.</span> <span id="s55">We came at night.</span> <span id="s56">It was in 1950.</span> <span id="s57">It was kind of sad because everybody had someone waiting for us and we had no one who greeted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: Has this feeling of "nothing is so terrible" stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">ER: I feel I'm a very strong person and I never get too emotional.</span> <span id="s60">I think what has helped me is that I never feel sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s61">I feel very fortunate and I never let myself forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: You have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">ER: Two sons and seven grandchildren and this is my biggest revenge on the Nazis.</span> <span id="s64">One lives in Dallas, the other in Cherry Hill.</span> <span id="s65">One has a consulting firm and the other was an accountant and is now in business.</span> <span id="s66">They both married Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: Would you say the children of survivors in Vineland had a high intermarriage rate?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">ER: I would say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: Was there snobbery here towards you when you first came to Vineland?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">ER: I don't think so, but I think we felt different.</span> <span id="s71">We didn't know the language.</span> <span id="s72">We still had that fear in ourselves.</span> <span id="s73">It took me a long time before I stopped looking behind my back to see who was walking there.</span> <span id="s74">We felt others looked down on us, that they thought: “You refugees, you wanna be equal?</span> <span id="s75">You have to wait your turn."</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: How did you come to Vineland?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">YL: My sister lived here and told me about the farm.</span> <span id="s78">So I came here and I had been trained as a shochet.</span> <span id="s79">So that's what I did and that's how this plant, that I'm a partner in, developed (Vineland Kosher Meats.)</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: And how did you decide to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">ER: Friends told us about it.</span> <span id="s82">One followed the other.</span> <span id="s83">It sounded right.</span> <span id="s84">You could make a living and didn't have to know the language.</span> <span id="s85">With the chickens you could talk any language.</span> <span id="s86">My husband vaccinated chickens and we had the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">WH: Did you go to New York to relax?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">ER: We used to go to see a show but mostly we had parties here, and there was a river in Norma and we used to go there for picnics with the children.</span> <span id="s89">It was a better life than in New York.</span> <span id="s90">If one didn't have time, the other helped out and watched the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: Where were you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">IR: I was working in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: Why didn't you leave the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">IR: I figured I had the farm and we had a small child; I might well stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: What did you think of The Golden Egg?</span> <span id="s96">He complained that the survivors went bankrupt.</span> <span id="s97">I know a lot of honest people who went broke.</span> <span id="s98">They couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s99">Lerman wanted the honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">ER: Miles wanted to be above everybody.</span> <span id="s101">So how do you do it?</span> <span id="s102">You put everybody down.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">IR: He started mingling with the Americans and he got a lot of help from them.</span> <span id="s104">But he does a lot of good things for Jewish causes even if he did wrong things.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">ER: I'll explain you Miles Lerman.</span> <span id="s106">He is power hungry.</span> <span id="s107">He needed me many times in order to push himself forward.</span> <span id="s108">He made a gathering of all the liberators.</span> <span id="s109">So he came to me because he needed someone who was in an uprising.</span> <span id="s110">So I went and it was very nice.</span> <span id="s111">But he rubs me the wrong way all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: What do you think of all these survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">ER: I think it's too much money wasted.</span> <span id="s114">We don't need museums.</span> <span id="s115">And we don't need museums dedicated to Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s116">Not one Gentile adult or child was killed in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s117">Why should we make everything together?</span> <span id="s118">We should only give to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s119">They should give all the money to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">IR: Look at Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s121">When he saw what was going on with the museum, he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">ER: Why should there be a hall for Helena Rubinstein?</span> <span id="s123">Why shouldn't it be for somebody who fought back and who died, not for the survivors who offer a lot of money to have their pictures put in?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">WH: How come survivors play cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">IR: We don't have the same interests as Americans.</span> <span id="s126">Americans go to a baseball game, they go to a bar.</span> <span id="s127">We're not interested in this.</span> <span id="s128">We didn't play cards in Europe.</span> <span id="s129">Americans talk about cars, about baseball.</span> <span id="s130">They tell a story about a rabbi who saw people fighting over a ball and he said: "What are they fighting for ?</span> <span id="s131">I have a ball in my house and I'll give it to them."</span> <span id="s132">At the beach in Norma, the women talked ---- it was too expensive to talk on the phone ---- and the men played cards.</span> <span id="s133">Even the goyim called it the Jewish River.</span> <span id="s134">They sold ice cream there, people also played chess by the water.</span> <span id="s135">We stopped going there in the sixties.</span> <span id="s136">The heyday of the community was from 1947 to about 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0062 PAGE
