survivors and those who fled Germany and Austria during the thirties together with members of the 522 Battalion who witnessed Dachau would discuss their experiences on Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s16">He also said 50 hours of videotapes were made.</span> <span id="s17">We have 5 people who lived in Germany and Austria either before, during or after Crystal Night and they will share their experiences with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">What were your first recollections of the Holocaust the the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">I would say 1937 because there was a Nazi Party in Austria.</span> <span id="s20">There were 15 or 16 different parties and the Nazi Party was one of Them.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">It was a small party.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">I was born in Berlin in 1930.</span> <span id="s23">I was a small boy during the period you are taking about.</span> <span id="s24">I was the only Jewish student in my school.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">The Germans beat me up and chased me.</span> <span id="s26">When I lived in Louisiana I was part of segregation from another view.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">I lived in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s28">On April 1, 1932, there was a boycott against Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s29">We never discussed anything in the house, we took long walks when we wanted to discuss anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">In 1929 there was a parade of storm troopers in our small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">One of my high school teachers was in storm trooper uniform</span></p> <p><span id="s32">marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">In 1933 I worked in Berlin.</span> <span id="s34">There was a torchlight parade in Under Der Linden where 100,000 storm troopers marched singing.</span> <span id="s35">I knew at that time my world was over.</span> <span id="s36">I was working in a business organization.</span> <span id="s37">Any firm employing Jews could not do business with the city of Berlin.</span> <span id="s38">I was dismissed and worked in my father's business and then I emigrated.</span> <span id="s39">It was not clear at that time how and where I would live.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Why didn't you get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">The Nazis were very clever.</span> <span id="s42">If you had $5,000 you could come to this country or if you could get someone to sign that they would</span></p> <p><span id="s43">vouch for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">We had well off relatives but they were not interested.</span> <span id="s45">A converted Christian Professor of Princeton who was a distant relative signed for us.</span> <span id="s46">We could not do it without the help of gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">You had to have the money or have relatives who would vouch for</span></p> <p><span id="s48">you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">We had relatives who helped us.</span> <span id="s50">If you had a business that employed 120 employees you could not leave until you found employees to take your place and that took time.</span> <span id="s51">It took years and we could not get</span></p> <p><span id="s52">our visas renewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A friend in Spain came across some Jews at a cure in 1932 and told them to leave for Czwechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s54">These people did not believe anything would happen and thought they would be safe and we know what their fate was.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">I lived in Austria in 1938.</span> <span id="s56">We lived in our apartment for 17 years They chased us out of our apartment and took all our belongings and put us up in a small cellar some distance away.</span> <span id="s57">My grandmother had an apartment and we moved in with her.</span> <span id="s58">On Crystal Night the Nazis went looking for my father and the landlord told him where he was and they took him to the police.</span> <span id="s59">Meanwhile they came to our apartment and took me with them to the police.</span> <span id="s60">They took us in trucks past the burning synagogue.</span> <span id="s61">The Austrian storm troopers were replaced and when we got to the police station after interragation they released me because I was a 17 year old student.</span> <span id="s62">The rest of them ended up in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s63">On Dec. 28, 1938 I went to Cologne where we tried to cross the border illegaly.</span> <span id="s64">The Belgians let us stay there but after a while the Belgians interned us as we had German passports.</span> <span id="s65">Finally at the end of 1940- my American visa was issued.</span> <span id="s66">I went to Antwerp, Paris and went in a French Line to New York.</span> <span id="s67">I arrived April 4, 1940, a month later the Germans were in Belgium.</span> <span id="s68">My parents had gone to Norway.</span> <span id="s69">My brother was in London and made it to America and the whole family was reunited.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">We left Berlin illegally, my mother, sister, grandmother and mother.</span> <span id="s71">The last group the Nazis bothered were Jewish veterand of WW1.</span> <span id="s72">My father came to America to look for work.</span> <span id="s73">John Hopkins gave him a job.</span> <span id="s74">He returned to Sudetenland and we all left August 31.</span> <span id="s75">I was 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">In Austria in 1938 German Jews had been living under Hitler.</span> <span id="s77">When Hitler marched in we were told "get the children out."</span> <span id="s78">My family wrote to relatives in America and theyt sent me to cousins in America.</span> <span id="s79">There was the quota system and of course you needed to have money and someone to vouch for you.</span> <span id="s80">People could go to Cuba if someone put up a bond.</span> <span id="s81">By the time they got someone to put up the bond, they could not get out and so I live in guilt of being a</span></p> <p><span id="s82">survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Do you have any thoughts about what the American Jewish Community and American Gentile community could learn from this experience so that it will not happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">My emphasize would be to be aware of what is happening.</span> <span id="s85">Jews should be ready to help South Africans as well as our own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Not enough American Jews were interested in helping us.</span> <span id="s87">Their help could have been more.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">We have to be alert as to what is going on.</span> <span id="s89">If we feel our country is doing wrong we must speak out.</span> <span id="s90">Our country right or wrong is evil.</span> <span id="s91">Fight injustice wherever you find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">I learned one lesson.</span> <span id="s93">Polish Jews were sent back to Germany.</span> <span id="s94">I did not know what had happened.</span> <span id="s95">The Polish Jews had been rounded up and taken out of their beds into cattlecars and brought to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Living in Frankfurt I had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s97">We should be alert and help before it takes that dimension.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">The rabbi dedicated the memorial to the 6 million.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">.</span> <span id="s100">END.</span></p></body></html>
