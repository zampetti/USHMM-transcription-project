2009</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Vera Glasberg, conducted today by Judy Cohen, on January 7th, 2009, in the home of Mrs. Glasberg in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s12">I thought that we could start by just telling us something about your early childhood, where you were born, where you grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Well, I was born in Riga, which at the time of my birth, which is 1912, was still Russia.</span> <span id="s14">It is today an independent country, Latvia.</span> <span id="s15">I don’t remember Riga at all because my parents moved to Kiev, which then was also Russia, became later Ukraine, when I was about one year old.</span> <span id="s16">Av – we’ll th – Kiev I remember very well.</span> <span id="s17">We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a – a – a sizable apartment.</span> <span id="s18">When – in 1917, when the revolution broke out, and the – the communists were – how should I say – assigning free rooms and apartments to their members, my parents decided to rent their apartment themselves.</span> <span id="s19">And there was an Italian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl – her little daughter was my playmate.</span> <span id="s20">And I have very good seven years from that time.</span> <span id="s21">The theater gave sometimes operas for children, like Sad Sultan, or The Cock Door, and The Golden Cockerel.</span> <span id="s22">And through this, the mother of my little friend Annata(ph), we sometimes got seats to go and see these operas.</span> <span id="s23">In addition, she was getting ballet dances – lessons, and so I got them myself also; my parents thought it would be a good idea.</span> <span id="s24">It was a wonderful time for me as a child.</span> <span id="s25">For my parents it was much more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds.</span> <span id="s26">My father was arrested once for no reason except that he was a capitalist.</span> <span id="s27">And fortunately he was released twice when he was arrested.</span> <span id="s28">But in the meantime, there was, for instance, no water.</span> <span id="s29">And my mother had sometimes to go in the middle of the night when it was announced that there was some water somewhere in another quarter.</span> <span id="s30">And she would carry – come home carrying two pails of water for – for food and for washing.</span> <span id="s31">I was not aware of all these hardships.</span> <span id="s32">But after he – my father was released for the second time from prison, he said, no more, I want out.</span> <span id="s33">I won’t stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So tell us something about the experiences that – where you left, why you left, how you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, that’s where he got a – and a – kind of a – edificial assignment to go for a job which was a – a fake job, to Riga for two years.</span> <span id="s36">That’s why he was – we were able to leave the country legally.</span> <span id="s37">He could take his family, and take belongings necessary for a two year stay.</span> <span id="s38">However, the trip was most unusual.</span> <span id="s39">We were traveling in a train with cattle cars.</span> <span id="s40">We were sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s41">We were part of a group of, if I recall, three or four families, which little – we all had little stoves, kerosene little stoves.</span> <span id="s42">The train would stop every once in awhile in the middle of the field that – that was – that – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Okay, let’s continue.</span> <span id="s44">So, tell me about the car, the rail car that you went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: The rail car was a cattle car, there were no seats.</span> <span id="s46">We were sitting on the floor, on hay, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s47">And it was very primitive.</span> <span id="s48">The tri – the trip must have taken at least a week, if not more.</span> <span id="s49">And it would stop – the train would stop in the middle of the field, and we were all – were sucha – su – you know, supposed to get out to refresh ourselves with the snow, it was in winter, in January.</span> <span id="s50">We had little kerosene stoves.</span> <span id="s51">We made water out of the snow for tea.</span> <span id="s52">Everybody had, apparently, food with us.</span> <span id="s53">I don’t have any recollection of being – of famine.</span> <span id="s54">But it was extremely primitive and I thought it the most exciting adventure you can think of.</span> <span id="s55">So, all my recollections of that time, which for – for adults were very taxing, for me were great fun.</span> <span id="s56">In Riga we had family.</span> <span id="s57">My mother – my mother’s uncle was a psychiatrist who had a mental institution, which was the institution of the city.</span> <span id="s58">And – but we were not permitted – I mean, we – I speak of me as a child – to even go near it.</span> <span id="s59">The house where the family lived was in a big – how should I say it – estate, completely separated, and that was where the family lived.</span> <span id="s60">Couldn’t see it at the institution, even though the – the windows.</span> <span id="s61">And then again, there was one of the women who was helping in the household, had a daughter Ludiczka(ph).</span> <span id="s62">And Ludiczka(ph) was my playmate, again I had one friend, I never missed friends.</span> <span id="s63">So, I had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s64">We stayed there until spring, and after – after that, my – my uncle on my father’s side, had in Finland – also, he was a wealthy man, had a big estate in Finland, and the whole family of the Hessens(ph), which is my maiden name, were reunited there on the – on the farm.</span> <span id="s65">There there were chickens and two horses.</span> <span id="s66">I was sometimes permitted to go on the chariot with the – with the horseman to bring somebody to the train station through the woods.</span> <span id="s67">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s68">There was a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my playmate, and we went fishing in the lake and canoeing, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: But, I understand you didn’t stay there that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, it – we were invited, we were the guests for the summertime.</span> <span id="s71">And then my father went to Danzig where the same brother had the insurance company of the fleet on the Volga.</span> <span id="s72">You see the – it was the – well, see family and my father directed the office in Danzig.</span> <span id="s73">My mother and I went – stayed in Berlin, because first we – the whole family went to Berlin and my father left.</span> <span id="s74">And my mother and I stayed.</span> <span id="s75">We had rented a room in the apartment of a theater critic.</span> <span id="s76">And he always – his wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first shows in the theaters in Berlin, which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full swing.</span> <span id="s77">And I was attended – was in – registered for the first time in my life to a school, because until then I was home tutored, both in Russia and in – in Riga, always I had home tutors.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So tell me, what was it like as a young girl, as a refugee?</span> <span id="s79">By then you had lived, actually in four different countries for varying lengths of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: How did you adapt to all these changing circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Until then it was no problem.</span> <span id="s83">It was always something exciting, new and wonderful.</span> <span id="s84">For the first deception for me was when we left Berlin and joined my father in dan – in Sopot, which is a little town, a sea resort actually, attendant to Danzig.</span> <span id="s85">It is the distance like from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s86">It is just attendant, but it is on the North Sea and a – a sea resort by the next – Poland, which is practically next door.</span> <span id="s87">So, during the summer season it was invaded by the Polish [indecipherable] community which came to play in the cansino(ph) and so forth.</span> <span id="s88">But I went to a German lycée, which was a good school, but I hated it, because after the Russian school, which was on a very high level, the faculty was the cream cup of faculty from Russia, émigrés from Russia, whereas here there were – how should I define it?</span> <span id="s89">Only women, only old spinsters, anti-Semitic, unfriendly.</span> <span id="s90">Very resenting the – the – the additions that came, and made probably their job difficult, because my German was practically nil.</span> <span id="s91">And my marks at the beginning were awful.</span> <span id="s92">I didn’t learn German grammar, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s93">I had to write a composition, it was full of mistakes.</span> <span id="s94">It took me time.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So was there – was their attitude to you more disdainful because you were a immigrant who didn’t know German, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: – or do you think it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: They went a –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: – you mentioned the anti-Semitism, h-how –</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: That they were to begin with.</span> <span id="s101">That – because to there at that time already many refugees from Russia who got kind of squeezed in there.</span> <span id="s102">And they were – they didn’t like – it was a different culture.</span> <span id="s103">They were very narrow-minded, they were very – you know, like little towns.</span> <span id="s104">Whereas Russia, from Russia people came from Saint Petersburg, from Kiev, from Moscow.</span> <span id="s105">It was a different type of families.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And how did you respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, you know, at that age, you just suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: What can you do, you don’t have to revolt.</span> <span id="s110">However, you know, there too we had nice times.</span> <span id="s111">I made friends with – with these people from Russia, of course.</span> <span id="s112">And we went in – for instance once, to make an experience, and to write a note in several languages, which we got together, and put the – the note, with my address because th – I had invented that, so ha-happens, in a bottle.</span> <span id="s113">We sealed it and we threw the bottle into the sea, and later completely forgot about it, even though a few months later we got a real – an answer from somebo – students in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: What language did they write back in?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: They wrote in – I – if I remember correctly, in German.</span> <span id="s116">Broken German.</span> <span id="s117">And they offered to correspond before we get together, but our parents, our common parents said to us, it’s na – not a good idea, because they were students already, 19 years old, we were 12.</span> <span id="s118">So – so it was not the thing to do.</span> <span id="s119">And we obeyed.</span> <span id="s120">There was no revolt.</span> <span id="s121">Parents said, that was it.</span> <span id="s122">But it – it was a nice – it was a nice time.</span> <span id="s123">I had man – lifelong friends from that time.</span> <span id="s124">We had competitions who would be the fi – the first one would g – win who will go and take the first cold swim in the spring, and without interruption until the fall.</span> <span id="s125">You see, children’s play, it was a good time.</span> <span id="s126">And yeah, I lived there for – yeah, I would say for almost five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: At the time you left, if someone was to ask how you identified yourself, did you still think of yourself as a Russian émigré, or were you thinking –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s129">Although, at – by that time – by that time we were no longer officially Russians, because we never got back, as it was understood.</span> <span id="s130">So we loos – lost the citizenship.</span> <span id="s131">We were at that point citizens of no country.</span> <span id="s132">We didn’t belong, we had no protection from any country.</span> <span id="s133">And a member of the then League of Nations, by the name of Nansen(ph) has created for people like my family, a special document which was called the Nansen(ph) passport, which was not – didn’t look like a passport of a regular country, which was a sheet of paper with some name, date of birth, indication – all the information that the passport has.</span> <span id="s134">But that was our passport, and forever gave us trouble, because usually the people at the casa – the borders had never seen such documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Do you remember what stage your family got these?</span> <span id="s136">When they were living in Sopot already, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s138">When we had to leave, you know, to – to cross a border.</span> <span id="s139">For instance, once or twice my mother and I from Berlin came to the summer for to visit my father in da – in Sopot.</span> <span id="s140">The Poland refused to even accept this document as a doc – official document.</span> <span id="s141">So the car in which we were traveling was sealed, buco – because – in order to get from [dog barking] Berlin to Sopot, we had to cross two borders, you know, to enter the Poland, and exit to the Poland.</span> <span id="s142">God forbid we should get out, you see.</span> <span id="s143">Sealed car.</span> <span id="s144">Christina?</span> <span id="s145">[indecipherable] my thoughts.</span> <span id="s146">Q: Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yeah, I was telling you that we were – we had to go through Poland in sealed cars.</span> <span id="s148">And wherever later we moved from Sopot finally, the – the – the [indecipherable] the Volga, I don’t – I cannot tell you what exactly happened, either the office closed or my father had no other possibilities.</span> <span id="s149">He was offered a job in Brussels, in Belgium.</span> <span id="s150">A job which – my father had two doctorates, he was an engineer from Belgium and he had a doctorate of mathematics from Saint Petersburg, with a gold medal.</span> <span id="s151">But he accepted the job to sell off used cars in – in Belgium, just to show you that permutation saved their lives.</span> <span id="s152">They never complained, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And how old were you when you made the move to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, I was elated pa – by that time I was 17.</span> <span id="s155">And to – leaving this Sopot, this small town and go to Brussels, the capital of Belgium in the west, it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s156">I was 17, but I still had to switch school because I didn't finish the lycée.</span> <span id="s157">I had two – the aptitude to make [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s158">I had to have the pre – untaprima(ph) and dobaprima(ph).</span> <span id="s159">And each time I had to change languages; from Russian first to German; from German then to French.</span> <span id="s160">The French that I have learned in school was nothing.</span> <span id="s161">So – well, we arrived in Belgium, and what can I say?</span> <span id="s162">Very soon after my father arrived there, maybe a year, the – the – the garage with the used car collapsed.</span> <span id="s163">Well, by that time, when I finished the lycée, which corresponds years – to two years of college, the [indecipherable] is bachot, French bachot you know what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: It is a different organization of schools.</span> <span id="s166">I knew that I had to help the – with – the family with finances.</span> <span id="s167">So I registered in a business school and I decided I’m going to continue my education at this first opportunity, and did it throughout my life.</span> <span id="s168">I went to business school for six months.</span> <span id="s169">By that time it was summer, and one luxury that my mother permitted herself, was to once a year to go to Riga to visit her mother.</span> <span id="s170">So while she was away, it so happened that the t-touring club of Belgium, which is like the ma – automobile association here, was looking for somebody for a member of their staff.</span> <span id="s171">And they usually request that somebo – to send them somebody the business school where – that I was attending.</span> <span id="s172">And before I even had finished it, the director of the school picked me to ask me if I was interested.</span> <span id="s173">Was I interested?</span> <span id="s174">Of course.</span> <span id="s175">So I have – was very proud that I got the job before my mother came home.</span> <span id="s176">So that was my lengthy period in Brussels, until May 10th, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: That means before then though, that while you were living in Brussels corresponded to the time that Hitler had come into power in Germany, and later on the invasion of Poland, before that the annexation of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Were these events that you were following at all?</span> <span id="s180">Did you ever think that it would reach western Europe, or was it far distant news?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, you – it – it was – it was – how should I say?</span> <span id="s182">Nobody could imagine what could d – that something of that caliber could ever happen to begin with.</span> <span id="s183">On the other hand, I must also confess, to my shame, that at that time I was a very – how should I say – carefree, cheerful, a little bit superficial girl who loved dancing, who loved friendships, excursions.</span> <span id="s184">Politics were not my strength.</span> <span id="s185">My husband, if I had met him that – that area, we would have never seen each other again, because he was very much involved in politics.</span> <span id="s186">He was active in the labor Zionist movement, very active.</span> <span id="s187">So, it is funny, we lived in the same town for 10 years, both of us, had many common friends, and never met.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: So let’s then move to the day, May 10th, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What are your recollections of that day, and what was the response of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: That day – that day was a sunny, beautiful morning and we r – I remember waking up and couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s192">I thought that it was a thunderstorm.</span> <span id="s193">And the – how is possible, the skis – sky is blue.</span> <span id="s194">And all these explosions, c-could it be a thunderstorm?</span> <span id="s195">So, it’s – it was very strange.</span> <span id="s196">But then of course, word came out immediately.</span> <span id="s197">I went to work, everybody went to work, and for us, very soon people started – as soon as people understood that it is the Germans who are invading, those who had cars and funds, started moving, moving south.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And did your family leave immediately, or did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: – debate at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Not at all because we had no means – the little means that we had, it is only very recently before the invasion that we moved to our own apartment, we used to have rented rooms before, at our house.</span> <span id="s202">My parents lived in the attic and I lived in the little – small, little attendant room downstairs, it was very – really, it was my mother who managed everything remarkably well.</span> <span id="s203">They shared the kitchen, we shared the bathroom.</span> <span id="s204">It was very, very difficult life for them, and again, not very much for me.</span> <span id="s205">For me it was all a very easy going – so, what I was going to say that the big expense that we have made the – before May 10th, maybe before the one May fifth, is to buy a – I cannot say a refrigerator because it was not electric.</span> <span id="s206">It was a cold box, you know, with pieces of ice.</span> <span id="s207">And here if the war breaks out, the day when that ice thing was delivered.</span> <span id="s208">So – but, I must say that the president of the touring club, who was an unusual person, told me, because one, I was a fit – I think I was the only Jewish person in the staff – don’t stay.</span> <span id="s209">Whether you have means or not, take what you can carry and leave.</span> <span id="s210">Take the first train and go south.</span> <span id="s211">Go to Paris and see what you can do later.</span> <span id="s212">And what he said was – was very meaningful to my parents, too.</span> <span id="s213">So, after two or three days, that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did you have any trouble leaving Belgium at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes, because after – when we were almost at the French border, there was a bombardment at night, and they broke the rails, the train couldn’t continue.</span> <span id="s216">It so happened the train had stopped at the station, so we left the – the one or two suitcases that we had at the station, and continued on foot, going south.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Were you carrying any luggage with you at all?</span> <span id="s218">Just –</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: A handbag, just a handbag.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Clothes on your back?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah, clothes on the back and the little te – suitcase.</span> <span id="s222">Strangely enough – fate is strange – we met good friends of ours, and the wife of – it was actually a friend of my husband, but I knew her vaguely, too.</span> <span id="s223">She had the French passport, she was of French origin, and there was a train forming, but only for French citizens.</span> <span id="s224">So here she was, Mimi was her name, Mimi was running to the train and waving her passport.</span> <span id="s225">Her husband and the three of us, my parents and I after her, and then nobody checked the documents or tickets, nothing.</span> <span id="s226">In the car – again a cattle car.</span> <span id="s227">Again that’s everything closed, totally dark.</span> <span id="s228">Was crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And then where did the train take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: The train took us to Paris, and there we were welcomed by the Red Cross with coffee, the Germans will never get here, you’re welcome, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s231">So there we separated from our friends, and we ha – we had family, my father had family in Paris.</span> <span id="s232">So – but of course, we couldn’t stay there, we stayed overnight, but they couldn’t put up three people.</span> <span id="s233">And that was announced that people who can support themselves can take a train that will be forming the next day.</span> <span id="s234">One will be going to Toulouse, and the other to Bordeaux, south.</span> <span id="s235">By mere chance, we chose Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Tell me about Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Toulouse.</span> <span id="s238">It is called la ville de violette.</span> <span id="s239">The violet city.</span> <span id="s240">It is charming, but actually, it is an industrial city.</span> <span id="s241">The – there is a – an enormous factory for airplanes.</span> <span id="s242">This enormous new airplane, this monster is being built there, is being finished there.</span> <span id="s243">But it has a certain charm, and some cultural life, certain interesting things that we couldn’t think about that very much.</span> <span id="s244">And we met some friends from – from Brussels.</span> <span id="s245">Nobody wa – knew where to go, nobody had means to go to a hotel.</span> <span id="s246">We bought a paper and saw that there was a house for rent, an empty house for rent, and we decided to – to get – to pull together and rent this house and live there as a community.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Who are these friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: These friends were two Russian families.</span> <span id="s249">One [indecipherable] I mean, the – the adults of that family are already gone, but the s – one of the sons of our friends, who was 14 year olds when I got married finally, in this house, visits me here now.</span> <span id="s250">He is an 80 year old friend, and I have known him, of course, forever.</span> <span id="s251">And another family.</span> <span id="s252">So – and we – it was well organized.</span> <span id="s253">We made a whole government there, there was a so-called president.</span> <span id="s254">My father was the minister of agriculture, because it was a little garden that we planted vegetables.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And what a – who were the other ministers, what were the other jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: There was a foreign minister, was running every day to all the consulates to find out where you can leave again, because at that time that part of France was not occupied, was free.</span> <span id="s257">But you never know.</span> <span id="s258">And it was later.</span> <span id="s259">Then there was a minister of the interior, that was my mother, who was in charge of the household.</span> <span id="s260">She int – the – the mother of this young man I just described and [indecipherable] minister interior, then – then there was the young generation, the supplies, because we had to run around and find supplies, as I told you.</span> <span id="s261">There was no butter, there was no milk, there was – as time progressed, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And I understand it wasn’t just the three families, that other people came as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s264">Word came around that there is such a community that exists and there were forever people appearing at the door.</span> <span id="s265">Some people some people knew, and some people who didn’t know anybody, we just heard about it.</span> <span id="s266">And there were always a meal, and there were always a shelter overnight.</span> <span id="s267">Some stayed for one night, some stayed for a week.</span> <span id="s268">Some stayed when they had further visas, some others not.</span> <span id="s269">It was amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: How did you make the rations last for so many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Well, as I say, everybody contributed, energy, effort, and knowl – not everybody did everything.</span> <span id="s272">Everybody had their decided needs.</span> <span id="s273">I-I had a friend, this young man André would lend me his bicycle, and we would go to the country and buy some eggs here, and a little, I don’t know, cream there, or crème fraîche, or something like that.</span> <span id="s274">And the younger ones, after dinner did the dishes.</span> <span id="s275">The low – the ladies – the mothers were cooking, and the younger generation did the dishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And did the Vichy government interfere at all, or did –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, there were – there were, as I say, there were – they didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s278">There was – after all, we were contributing in a way to the – to the life of the city by buying, and behaving, and it was paying the rent and so forth.</span> <span id="s279">So – and then people, by and by, began to leave.</span> <span id="s280">And that’s how very good friends of ours who came – who came to – to – to say goodbye, brang s – brought some [indecipherable] just said, we’re going to go to a house, there were go – a house of nice peoples, come along.</span> <span id="s281">But that particular time I didn’t pay much attention to Sam, because the president of the touring club of Belgium also arrived in the [indecipherable] because he was looking for his son who was a colonel in the Belgian Army.</span> <span id="s282">And he had learned that in Montpelier, which is halfway between Toulouse and Marseilles, there were lists of Belgian officers.</span> <span id="s283">And he asked me to come along with him.</span> <span id="s284">He – I think my parents would have let me only with Colonel Mitey(ph) to – to leave Toulouse by train, but he had the diplomatic passport, and then my [indecipherable] passport picture is – was [indecipherable] that I was secretary of so and so.</span> <span id="s285">So I could always travel with him without effort, without difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: But then I understand that you met Sam again shortly afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Why don’t you talk – tell that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well, I was running somewhere and I met Sam in the street, and we stopped and chatted for a minute.</span> <span id="s290">And he asked me if I happened to be free the next day, that he is going to visit some friends, and they’re going to make music to play, and he was going to sing.</span> <span id="s291">And to me it sounded as if he asked me to – I don’t know, to fly to Mars, because everybody asking only in which consulate that you go.</span> <span id="s292">And so that was nice.</span> <span id="s293">And then he told me about the plans to organize this farm, this kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Tell me about the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well, the farm, he got funds from the labor Zionists to rent a – all this was his idea, he rented an old castle, was rather dilapidated.</span> <span id="s296">But it was beautiful, it was a castle, really, and surrounding grounds with woods and plains.</span> <span id="s297">And enough funds to have some cattle, goats and cows, and a horse, and what else?</span> <span id="s298">Chickens galore and turkey, you name it.</span> <span id="s299">And mostly his idea was just because the soldiers that I told you were gone, people who had no means of support and were – I mean, they were not mishandled in any way, but they were not free, in Gurs.</span> <span id="s300">You know what Gurs is.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: They came to work on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: How did he get them out of Gurs and to the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Because he announced in Gurs that there are – there are jobs needed on – on – in Gaillard.</span> <span id="s305">That there is a means – there is – they planted – I don’t – I don’t remember what they planted.</span> <span id="s306">I was only paperwork worker.</span> <span id="s307">I occasionally visited there after that, of course, but that was at – about 20 miles from – from Toulouse, not far.</span> <span id="s308">And – and so it was to everybody’s satisfaction that Sam was terrific, he always knew how to – people are tired, worked very hard, there was not much food.</span> <span id="s309">But still, they – they knew it’s a matter of life and death, literally, because you know, you never know what happens tomorrow.</span> <span id="s310">In fact, it did happen finally, they were occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Did you keep up with the people, the other ones on the farm?</span> <span id="s312">Do you know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: After we left?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s315">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah, they became a center of resistance, yeah.</span> <span id="s317">They were – they were – they were – they were good people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: And I – do you remember anything more about – were they refugees, were they from – mostly German Jews, or [indecipherable] Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No, they were not – there were some German, there were some Polish.</span> <span id="s320">There were some that were still from Belgium also.</span> <span id="s321">There were not so many.</span> <span id="s322">There would be – I would guess that there was maybe 25 - 30 people, not more.</span> <span id="s323">Some of them Sam knew personally, Sam, he was – he was reading the references and so he wanted – he wanted a homogenous group and not quarrels and you know – and it worked.</span> <span id="s324">It really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: What type of activities did people do when they weren’t busy planting the crops?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: What they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Yeah, for relaxation.</span> <span id="s328">Did they have –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: They were collapsing to sleep, I assure you.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: They didn’t know – there was no television, and there was no – but, you see, I remember one evening at – that sticks always in my memory.</span> <span id="s332">The winter was approaching and needed wood for – for heating and for cooking and for ever, and it was low.</span> <span id="s333">It had to be done, there was no time during the day, and after dinner everybody was tired.</span> <span id="s334">So Sam, already at the dinnertime, he began saying – hello Becca.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">R: Hi Nana.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: This is my granddaughter Rebecca.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">R: Hi, nice to meet you.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: You don’t mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: So, he said, look, it’s nice evening, let’s go out, make a tour and sing.</span> <span id="s343">Take a long some – how do you call it, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Axes?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Axes.</span> <span id="s346">We went out singing, and on the way with axes, came back with tons of wood, and everybody was a good mood, exhausted and tired, still did.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: What type of paperwork were you doing?</span> <span id="s348">Was this accounting, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Well, at the beginning we needed a lot of permissions forms and all that.</span> <span id="s350">And once the farm was organized, there was no need for it, you see.</span> <span id="s351">So it was – it was – it was functioning very well.</span> <span id="s352">And if occasionally there was a need for a letter that was – he became friends with the mayor – who married us, by the way – the mayor of that little village, was called Grenard(ph).</span> <span id="s353">And he – at that time there was no – no gas, and nobody had a car except the – the personalities.</span> <span id="s354">So the mayor rent us his car to drive from Deymarie(ph) to the Chateau de Gaillard.</span> <span id="s355">And my parents and the witnesses followed all in a horse pulled cart – cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So let’s step back a bit, the wedding, when did Sam propose, how – and tell me about the wedding day.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, I came to visit Sam in Gaillard for – over the new year.</span> <span id="s358">And that’s when he gave me the ring that had belonged to his mother, because nobody bought any gowns or rings or any things of that sort.</span> <span id="s359">And that ring has an interesting story.</span> <span id="s360">Much, much later, when this young lady was getting married, I decided to give her the ring of my husband’s mother.</span> <span id="s361">And to my horror, I had been away, it had been stolen.</span> <span id="s362">I had a break-in in my house.</span> <span id="s363">But we worked it out anyway, there was another ring.</span> <span id="s364">So – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So, was –</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I went – I went to Gaillard over – yeah, overnight, and you see, later the ladies told me – the ladies of [indecipherable] told me they [indecipherable] and to the big fancy hall in the gi – in the castle, which had been the bull hall, because it had tapestries, they were moth-eaten, but they were beautiful tapestries.</span> <span id="s367">He went in there, he said, that’s where I’m going to get married.</span> <span id="s368">I didn’t even know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So, it was a time of rationing, of shortages, but you still had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I have only good remembrance of that time.</span> <span id="s371">I really have nothing sad, where it was so difficult for most people, and I must say [music playing] there goes my phone.</span> <span id="s372">Becca, do you – can you give it to me.</span> <span id="s373">Excuse –</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: We’ll cut – pause.</span> <span id="s375">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: – occasionally, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s378">So you were telling a little bit about the wedding day.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: So, the f – we had two wedding days.</span> <span id="s380">The first was a civil wedding in this village of Grenard(ph).</span> <span id="s381">As I said, the mayor married us, and he – heh-heh – that is very French, he said, in our country, the one who married has the first kiss.</span> <span id="s382">So he embraced me.</span> <span id="s383">And, as I say, he lent us his motorcar.</span> <span id="s384">We were like princes of – Sam and I. And my parents and my witnesses followed in a horse drawn – how do you call it, the place when you put in hay?</span> <span id="s385">They were sitting – it was not for people, they didn’t need that for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: A wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Wagon, yeah.</span> <span id="s388">Anyway, we arrived in – and then there was a festive reception in Gaillard, and we had chickens and the ducks and the goats, little goats, all that mixing with the people in the reception.</span> <span id="s389">It was most unusual.</span> <span id="s390">And then, the next day we had a re – a religious wedding from a rabbi who came to the house to be [indecipherable] and married us there.</span> <span id="s391">And I think in the book there is a photograph of it, where all the people who at that time were in the [indecipherable] many more came.</span> <span id="s392">And they made it wonderful, and for those times, that was a dinner, that was a feast.</span> <span id="s393">So – and yeah, now, the only thing was, I had no clothes.</span> <span id="s394">The wedding was in the same suit that I wore coming from Brussels.</span> <span id="s395">On the road, in the trains, everywhere.</span> <span id="s396">But for the wedding at home, I had to wear something a little more presentable, but I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s397">So a friend of mine happened to pass by, and we had similar figures, she lent me a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I understand that once you got married, you weren't – you were still separated for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah, yeah, because since we were going to leave the following – and – and very soon, I wanted to stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s400">And Sam returned to the farm.</span> <span id="s401">So we saw each other for weekends here and there, but I didn’t want to go and live on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: So tell me, you were talking about you were going to be leaving.</span> <span id="s403">How did you get a visa to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: He had a visa to get out when I met him, from Rabbi stat – Stephen Weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Had he ever met Rabbi Weiss before?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I don’t know, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s407">But he knew of Sam because he worked very – was very active in the labor Zionist organization in Belgium.</span> <span id="s408">So Sam had this visa – he, as a matter of fact, had already used the entrance to Palestine, but he had given it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s409">My children ask me sometimes, why didn’t he go to Palestine, why did he go to the United States?</span> <span id="s410">I cannot answer that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s411">He probably had reasons for it.</span> <span id="s412">One though that comes to my mind is that his parents were alive.</span> <span id="s413">His father, rather.</span> <span id="s414">His mother was already gone.</span> <span id="s415">And he was – he was – he needed support, financial support, and that, of course, was not possible from Palestine, because people went there to dig roads, and to build.</span> <span id="s416">And Sam wanted to get a job and su-support his father, and that’s what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So you had the visa, was –</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: – there a time expiration on it, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, that was the interesting thing.</span> <span id="s421">We both went to Marseille from the honeymoon, to extend the visa for two.</span> <span id="s422">And the American consul asked us, do you want a tourist visa or an immigration visa?</span> <span id="s423">Who cares?</span> <span id="s424">You know, is that we’ll come back to Europe anyway after the war is over tomorrow afternoon.</span> <span id="s425">Whatever you give us, we’ll be grateful.</span> <span id="s426">And this man did something that I much later understood.</span> <span id="s427">He was forbidden to give out immigration visas, and he did, he gave us one.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Do you know who signed for your visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I never knew, f – and you know, I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s430">I wish that it – because I understand that some of them were – there were several consuls who were doing it, and they were demoted.</span> <span id="s431">And somebody told me even that one of them a stamp was done in his honor, because he really was deported or fired altogether because he helped so many Jews to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Can you describe what the scene was like at the American consulate in Marseille?</span> <span id="s433">I se – were there crowds of people [indecipherable] you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: – walked in, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s437">No crowds, no.</span> <span id="s438">Be right there [indecipherable] no, because people were dying to get a visa, but you could only get one if you had the permission to get out of France, and proof that you have visas to get through the countries you have to get – to get there.</span> <span id="s439">Which on the other one – on the other hand, were difficult to get without the v – end visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So how did you get your transit visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Well, you see, some – some people got stuck on the way, like for instance in Cuba.</span> <span id="s442">We know a friend who s – well, got stuck in Cuba.</span> <span id="s443">Couldn’t – had to wait – waiting for the American visa.</span> <span id="s444">We had no problem once we had to prove that the emergency visa was official.</span> <span id="s445">We got – we went through Spain and Portugal and took a boat to Lisbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So describe what the process was like leaving France, going through Spain, any difficulties you encountered?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: We sure did, we sure did.</span> <span id="s448">Well, we left – we left early August, I think.</span> <span id="s449">It was – it was very difficult for me to leave, although the arrangement was that Sam and I would go – we had no money, practically no money, and the trip was paid by the HIAS [indecipherable] I don’t know, he said [indecipherable] HIAS would takes care, but it was paid for us.</span> <span id="s450">And we would get organized and a year later my parents were to join us in the States.</span> <span id="s451">We left in ’41, in August ’41, they were to come in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did your parents have visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No.</span> <span id="s454">But once we were there, there was, you know, we were in the States, there should be no problem in finding, you know, for parents to join, close relatives that would have been no more.</span> <span id="s455">And that’s what happened, eventually.</span> <span id="s456">I went to Washington for an affidavit, got it right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So describe crossing the border into Spain –</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Well, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: – crossing the border into Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: We left by train.</span> <span id="s461">There were friends on the way, in the mountains, near Po(ph), which is near the Spanish border.</span> <span id="s462">We had some friends who came out to see the train pass and wave to us.</span> <span id="s463">They couldn’t see us, of course, but we saw them.</span> <span id="s464">On the train we met a Spaniard, a charming fellow.</span> <span id="s465">We are going to spend a night in Madrid.</span> <span id="s466">When he heard that we were s-stopping – he was coming back after the tour or army, he said, I’m going to show you Madrid, and took us – he went home, took a shower and s – kissed his wife and came out again, met us at the hotel and took us around in Madrid.</span> <span id="s467">It was really very nice, yeah.</span> <span id="s468">So – but the – the – the – the real event was at the border between Spain and Lisbon, because that was actually for the first time entering the freedom, because Lisbon, Portugal was a neutral country.</span> <span id="s469">Spain was still fascist, it was still allied of Germany, but Portugal was free.</span> <span id="s470">So, this is the last border, entrance into freedom.</span> <span id="s471">They took our luggage, and made us open the luggage and took our passports.</span> <span id="s472">The train is about to leave in two minutes, everything is ready, we were going to have some sandwich and relax.</span> <span id="s473">Enters the official and says, lady, off the train.</span> <span id="s474">What?</span> <span id="s475">My husband can continue, but I have to get off.</span> <span id="s476">So Sam told me it makes no sense for us both to stick here.</span> <span id="s477">I will go, and there’s only one train a day –</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And when was your ship leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: The next day.</span> <span id="s480">The next day.</span> <span id="s481">And one train a day.</span> <span id="s482">That he told me, call the [indecipherable] immediately, call the police, call whoever you can do, you will come tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Why did they take you off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: They took me off the train because as Sam’s wife, I was listed as a Polish citizen, and I had the Nansen(ph) pass that they never seen in their life.</span> <span id="s485">Something was not right, and during wartime, you don’t play.</span> <span id="s486">And there was no time to make decisions or make calls.</span> <span id="s487">So here was the train leaving with my newly wedded husband, and the ship leaving the next day.</span> <span id="s488">I didn’t – I don’t remember crying, but I must have been because later I realized that my cheeks were wet.</span> <span id="s489">And the same official came and said, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s490">Let him go.</span> <span id="s491">You’ll get married, you’ll stay here.</span> <span id="s492">He was actually very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So how did you straighten it all out?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I did call the [indecipherable] and they – and when Sam arrived they straightened it out, the matter of – of the papers.</span> <span id="s495">And I took the next train, Sam met me at the station.</span> <span id="s496">We took a taxi, which was a luxury, but I needed inoculation for smallpox.</span> <span id="s497">And we literally got to the boat 50 minutes before they put up – pulled up the planks, yeah.</span> <span id="s498">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: I understand that they – once you were on the ship though, you had some better luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: On the ship we had better luck.</span> <span id="s501">I see you remember and you know.</span> <span id="s502">Yes, it was amazing.</span> <span id="s503">The – the leader of the [indecipherable] group to – which had paid our passage, Sam introduced him to me.</span> <span id="s504">And he came back and asked me if I knew how to type.</span> <span id="s505">Well, I was deep in thoughts about leaving my parents and the whole country and the continent of Europe, and that was very advantageous because they doubled – that would double our fortune; 25 dollars in those years was like 250 now.</span> <span id="s506">And – and we were to eat in first class.</span> <span id="s507">And I, without my husband, would share the – a stateroom with another lady, and he was in the hold, where we were supposed to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: That’s not in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: He didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s510">So that’s what happened, tha-that was fun too, because they were very nice Portuguese officers, nice, friendly, handsome.</span> <span id="s511">And I was working three hours a day, and people on – on – on the ship saw that I was member of the staff.</span> <span id="s512">So that was great fun.</span> <span id="s513">And we arrived in Staten Island on September 2nd, 1940, Labor Day.</span> <span id="s514">And the ship stood in the – in the harbor, they didn’t take us on board because it was Labor Day.</span> <span id="s515">And you see those lights of Manhattan, it was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s516">So it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: So yes – so, well the time you were in New York during the war, were you able to correspond with your parents at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes, because my mother was working for the Swiss Red Cross, we were able to correspond through the Red Cross [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Through the whole war, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No, the beginning.</span> <span id="s521">I would say maybe for – for half of the time, if at all.</span> <span id="s522">Maybe five, six months.</span> <span id="s523">But they were saying months, years, couple of years.</span> <span id="s524">About half of the time we were separated was – was actually fifti – yeah, five years.</span> <span id="s525">My parents arrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: How did you discover they were still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: That was interesting.</span> <span id="s528">My mother met in the street an American soldier, and asked him to send me a note from them by – how is it called, the American special way for the soldiers?</span> <span id="s529">Do you know what that i –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: [indecipherable] mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: To mail APO.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yeah, APO mail.</span> <span id="s534">So I got one day a letter from the soldier, with regards from my parents.</span> <span id="s535">Was fantastic, because th-the – the regular mail didn’t work yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Did your parents share much about how they survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: You know, it’s strange.</span> <span id="s538">They never liked to talk about it.</span> <span id="s539">All I know, that they went underground.</span> <span id="s540">All I know that they had false papers.</span> <span id="s541">All I know that they were at the beginning hidden by a family where I had the – the gall to tutor a woman in English, who kind of took a liking to me and with my imperfect knowledge, she said it was useful for her.</span> <span id="s542">So I was tutoring some people who were – wanted to come to the States.</span> <span id="s543">And she helped out.</span> <span id="s544">I don’t know much, but they survived.</span> <span id="s545">You know, there were many French heroes who hid Jews.</span> <span id="s546">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Now, I know that you and Sam, once you got the States during those, you know, four years when it was still war.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Both of you, in different ways, were working to get visas for people who were still over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Can you talk about that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: No – yeah.</span> <span id="s553">Sam did it personally because h-he – he – during his work still in Brussel had many contacts here and there.</span> <span id="s554">And then there were the strangest coincidences.</span> <span id="s555">One day – we lived then at the corner of Broadway and 110th Street, he came down into the subway and saw a man who was visibly just arrived, who was kind of looking around a little bit lost.</span> <span id="s556">And he came up to him, he could see that he was a Jew who arrived recently.</span> <span id="s557">You know, there are certain signs you recognize.</span> <span id="s558">He came up and asked him in Yiddish whether he could help him.</span> <span id="s559">Oh yes, said, I need to go to Times Square, I don’t know which train to take.</span> <span id="s560">And Sam said, well, I’m going in the same direction, I’ll – I’ll help you to get there.</span> <span id="s561">So they take the train together, then Sam asked him, where are – when did you arrive?</span> <span id="s562">I arrived yesterday.</span> <span id="s563">Where do you come from?</span> <span id="s564">I come from Toulouse.</span> <span id="s565">Really?</span> <span id="s566">So, can I help you in any way?</span> <span id="s567">He said, well, [indecipherable] There is a man I have to look up first.</span> <span id="s568">His name is Samuel Glasberg.</span> <span id="s569">Could you believe it?</span> <span id="s570">In New York, in the subway of New York, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: A fantastic story.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah, it is a fantastic story.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And you were also working though for [indecipherable] recipes?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, I – yeah.</span> <span id="s575">You see, there – I mentioned before about the man who got stuck in Cuba, who had been for a few days, for a few va – months, a member of our [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s576">I never met his wife, but the very evening when we arrived in New York and went to the family where I told you the young man who comes still, who is now 80 years old, he got stuck in Cuba.</span> <span id="s577">His wife, I don’t know by what means, you know, the information gets around fast.</span> <span id="s578">The very same evening, she called me at the house where were – landed.</span> <span id="s579">And said, Vera, we never met.</span> <span id="s580">But I know that you arrived, and I know you.</span> <span id="s581">I’m working for a amer – for a Russian lawyer, who heads an American affidavit committee for people for Russian refugees – not refugees, for Russian – how should I say it, call it?</span> <span id="s582">Intellectuals who are stuck, who have no families, and need to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s583">She didn’t ask me if I was interested, she told me, tomorrow I come to meet you, I’m going introduce you to this man, and you are taking over my job, because I need to go to Cuba, to my husband.</span> <span id="s584">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s585">The next day I had the job.</span> <span id="s586">My job consisted in visiting wealthy American families, rec – explaining to them that their responsibility was only to sign the forms, that they are going to guarantee the finances of the family.</span> <span id="s587">They – and the promise, honest promise of the committee that it will never have to do it actually, that it is just a formality.</span> <span id="s588">And fill out the forms for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Do you know how many families they succeeded in getting out of Europe that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Oh, many, many.</span> <span id="s591">I worked there for a couple of years, many.</span> <span id="s592">Yes, I cannot give you the number really, but many.</span> <span id="s593">I would say in the dozens, yeah.</span> <span id="s594">Yes, people were – were very – there were people who were – you know, th-the – maybe not now, or maybe some other later, didn’t work.</span> <span id="s595">But most people, when they heard that it is a beautiful [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s596">It was not I who was the – it is my boss, of course, who was the man of standing, whose word guaranteed, you know, he – he was a – a – Alexis(ph) Goldenweiser(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s597">He was a Russian lawyer, a man of very high standing.</span> <span id="s598">And it was wonderful to work for him, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: How long did that job last?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Until my daughter was born.</span> <span id="s601">Yeah, and even after she was born, we were n – living not far from each other, I would go and pick up work and I had a – a typewriter at home, and continued working.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So they were able to get people out throughout the whole war?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I – I would say so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: It – before we end – at what point, once you’re living in the United States, did the full horrors of what was going on in Europe become apparent?</span> <span id="s605">You left France before the Germans took over at Vichy.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Correct, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: So, when did the information come to you?</span> <span id="s608">Do you remember that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: I must say that the – the beginning of it, I – I was unable to believe it, like everybody else.</span> <span id="s610">It was so atrocious and so unthinkable.</span> <span id="s611">How can you believe these things?</span> <span id="s612">One thought it is – it is, you know, that people were going mad, and – but when, I cannot describe it.</span> <span id="s613">Like everybody else.</span> <span id="s614">It was horrible to – to – to even think.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: And Sam, was he able to correspond with his father at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Unfortunately, very soon he – he was not hearing from him any more.</span> <span id="s617">He didn’t want to leave Poland, couldn’t.</span> <span id="s618">His mother was no longer alive, and he was a very good son.</span> <span id="s619">But it became impossible to correspond, yeah.</span> <span id="s620">And there again, you see, it’s only then for me it became interesting to learn more about Judaism, about – we discussed many things before we got married, and it was, by the way, it was understood that the Jewish education was in Sam’s hands.</span> <span id="s621">And what can I say?</span> <span id="s622">It’s – it was a – again, a period in a different way, which was so happy in my life.</span> <span id="s623">My – my husband, who was wonderful.</span> <span id="s624">My children who were my – my greatest wish to have.</span> <span id="s625">And the difficulties didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s626">The – the – the baby difficults.</span> <span id="s627">We didn’t even have a phone in the house.</span> <span id="s628">When I needed a doctor I had to go nine floors down and send call from the general phone, but he never could call me back if he was busy.</span> <span id="s629">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s630">I had to wash the diapers by my – by hands and dry them on the roof.</span> <span id="s631">Didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s632">It was wonderful, wonderful time.</span> <span id="s633">And then they ad – ha – on the other hand, also I was – there was a time when I didn’t know whether my parents are dead or alive.</span> <span id="s634">Imagine the joy to know that they are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Before we conclude things, why don’t you just describe the day your parents arrived in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Oh, I must say, my mother arrived, she – when she arrived – when they arrived, she was 56 years old, still a young woman.</span> <span id="s637">To me she looked an elderly lady.</span> <span id="s638">She was well dressed, she had – yeah, I must tell you that before coming to the United States, my parents returned to Belgium to say farewell.</span> <span id="s639">And that was the president of the touring club who kept some precious pieces that they brought out of Russia, in his house, and another friend of mine.</span> <span id="s640">And so they wanted to bring it with them for my household.</span> <span id="s641">And now I have given all these beautiful pieces to my children, to Vic, and now my daughter who was here took the last, that I gave her a beautiful silver tray.</span> <span id="s642">And I think that my mother, all this she carried, although I don’t know how she managed to bring it out, and my father.</span> <span id="s643">So, to me she seemed an elderly – my goodness, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s644">That is the age [indecipherable] older than my daughter.</span> <span id="s645">So, I never thought that I will live that long, of course.</span> <span id="s646">And – but she looked wonderful and we were, of course, very moved.</span> <span id="s647">And, I must say, from one day to another, you know, we became a family of six.</span> <span id="s648">I had to go to – back to work.</span> <span id="s649">My mother took over the household, the two children.</span> <span id="s650">It is amazing.</span> <span id="s651">When I think back now, I don’t know how she did it.</span> <span id="s652">She handled everything with again, with grace.</span> <span id="s653">Never complained, never.</span> <span id="s654">And neither did my father.</span> <span id="s655">They did what they could, the best they could, somehow succeeded and never complained.</span> <span id="s656">That’s one thing I learned from them, not to complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: That’s a wonderful lesson in life</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And I think with that, this will conclude our interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Vera Glasberg, and I want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Conclusion of
