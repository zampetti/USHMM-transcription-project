Before you go any further, let me ask you a couple questions.</span> <span id="s36">When in _____________ you were all given gas masks and taught about the civil preparedness, what was this for?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A.</span> <span id="s38">At that time, in everybody's mind was one thing that remembering that the Germans in first World War used gas and everybody assumed that should an air attack materialize, the enemy will revert to gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.</span> <span id="s40">So there was already an awareness or concern about what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s42">Now, looking in retrospect, it's easy to be a Monday morning quarterback, but in those days I didn't know about it, but Germany threatened that if Czechoslovakia doesn't surrender they simply will come with airplanes and bomb Czechoslovakia and everybody assumed that these would be gas attacks.</span> <span id="s43">For reasons obvious today but not known at that time, many people especially Jewish population of the Czech part of the republic, the majority of Jews spoke German where the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, there the Jews spoke Hungarian and Europe being a relatively small continent, the radio at that time was the main media of communication.</span> <span id="s44">Many people who wanted to know what goes on in the world listened to foreign broadcast.</span> <span id="s45">It was very easy and very simple to catch radio from Berlin or Vienna and get their point of view across.</span> <span id="s46">Because the Czech newspapers unfortunately always tried to minimize the threat that is actually hanging over the country and one act of appeasement took place after another.</span> <span id="s47">The Czech government always hoped that this action will finally satisfy the German demands and that nothing more serious will come out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q. Do you remember your family listening to the radio or your parents talking about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A. No.</span> <span id="s50">My parents didn't speak in front of the children about these things.</span> <span id="s51">That was the custom of those days that you send the children to bed before you started speaking of serious events.</span> <span id="s52">Something else comes back to my mind that friends of my parents, many of them started to disappear.</span> <span id="s53">Later on, when I began to ask what happened to such and such, I was told that they left Czechoslovakia and settled in foreign countries.</span> <span id="s54">Namely, I think that there were people who saw what was coming and took steps while time was still available.</span> <span id="s55">I remember specifically two families that immigrated to Palestine.</span> <span id="s56">At that time the state of Israel didn't exist.</span> <span id="s57">They immigrated to Palestine.</span> <span id="s58">A couple of people emigrated to England.</span> <span id="s59">Some of them went to Egypt.</span> <span id="s60">Now, why some people were guessing correctly, I don't know.</span> <span id="s61">My father, unfortunately was not one of those that guessed correctly.</span> <span id="s62">He always thought that whatever exists is only a temporary situation and it will pass away, and therefore, we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q. Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A. No.</span> <span id="s65">That is another interesting situation.</span> <span id="s66">The Czech intelligencia if I may call it that way, was not religious, including the Jews.</span> <span id="s67">It used to be said that the higher education you will obtain, the less religious you are.</span> <span id="s68">And my father, being a medical doctor, under Austro-Hungarian monarchy you first had to be a medical doctor before you were permitted to specialize in dentistry.</span> <span id="s69">So, we were not religious.</span> <span id="s70">When we did move away from _______________ to ________________, we used to attend a synagogue but attendance usually was not done for religious purposes.</span> <span id="s71">It was more done for social gathering.</span> <span id="s72">That's where you met your friends and your acquaintances.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q.</span> <span id="s74">Did you mix with Christian kids?</span> <span id="s75">Did you parents have Christian friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A. I do not remember specifically Christian friends, except we did have a maid and my father had an apprentice who learned the technical side of dentistry.</span> <span id="s77">Otherwise, I do not remember coming into contact with Christians.</span> <span id="s78">However, you know, I was six or seven years of age and religion in those days didn't mean anything at all to me.</span> <span id="s79">I used to go part time to school, but whether my fellow students were Jewish or Christians, I simply don't know, but I don't think I would have cared.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q.</span> <span id="s81">You don't remember other kids coming up to you and calling you a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A. No, no in those days prior to the war, no.</span> <span id="s83">Simply I think I was too well shielded because of the frequent illnesses.</span> <span id="s84">The ear infections, having a maid who took me to park for a walk.</span> <span id="s85">I do not remember, with exception of one of my father's friends who had a daughter my age.</span> <span id="s86">Occasionally she and I met and we played together, but otherwise I don't remember in those days having any friends.</span> <span id="s87">But, you know that was probably childhood stuff, typical childhood for those days.</span> <span id="s88">I do not think Judaism had much to do with it.</span> <span id="s89">It was probably more because of my frequent ear infections that influenced that kind of sheltered life than having grown up in a middle class family.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q.</span> <span id="s91">You moved to ________________ in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A.</span> <span id="s93">That must have been in 1939, I think.</span> <span id="s94">The move itself I do not remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q. Do you think this was before the Germans annexed the Czech republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A. I honestly do not know.</span> <span id="s97">That seems to me, but that is looking in retrospect, I think the Germans annexed Czechoslovakia March 15, 1938, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q. 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A. Okay, '39, but whether we moved before or after, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s100">My next memory of ________________ is I remember sitting in either the first or second grade elementary school and going there for maybe a half of year when all of a sudden I had to stop going.</span> <span id="s101">I was then told that as a Jew no longer can I attend this school.</span> <span id="s102">How soon thereafter the belt started tightening up, I cannot give you in terms of dates.</span> <span id="s103">I only remember more or less events.</span> <span id="s104">All of a sudden it usually I was told either by my father or by my mother that for example I cannot go through certain streets with the exception of between the hours of three and five in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s105">Many stores in ______________ suddenly had a sign to Jews entry is forbidden.</span> <span id="s106">Other stores permitted visit from Jews between the hours of three and five.</span> <span id="s107">I knew I cannot leave the boundaries of the town.</span> <span id="s108">I knew I cannot go to a movie or a soccer game or to a public place.</span> <span id="s109">I can not go to a municipal swimming pool.</span> <span id="s110">I cannot go skiing because that would mean to go out of town.</span> <span id="s111">There was a whole host of things which were forbidden.</span> <span id="s112">Then as a next step I remember each Jew had to wear a star of David.</span> <span id="s113">A yellow star that had to be affixed over one's heart.</span> <span id="s114">That star always had to be made visible.</span> <span id="s115">You were not permitted to cover it up with anything.</span> <span id="s116">Jews were given special i.d. cards which had to be produced whenever policeman stopped you and asked for it.</span> <span id="s117">Because even in the Czech republic, every citizen of Czechoslovakia has an i.d. card but Jews had a special i.d. card.</span> <span id="s118">Not having an i.d. card was punishable under any Czech law.</span> <span id="s119">Jews were issued ration cards which were much smaller than those of the Christian population.</span> <span id="s120">Events took place and I don't know in what order exactly it followed.</span> <span id="s121">We were, by we I mean Jews were requested or ordered to surrender cameras, radios.</span> <span id="s122">We had to surrender any passports if you had any.</span> <span id="s123">We had to dismount any brass objects from the apartment.</span> <span id="s124">Jews were not permitted to have any pets.</span> <span id="s125">The explanation for that was that the pets were slaughtered by Germans and that grease or fat was used to lubricate machinery.</span> <span id="s126">All the towns, including _____________, lost their church bells.</span> <span id="s127">The paradox is that thanks to German occupation, Czechoslovakia acquired electricity of 220 volts instead of 110 which they used to have under the old republic.</span> <span id="s128">The reason for it is that the 110 volts were sent via copper wires and copper offers low resistance to electricity, but copper was needed very badly by the nazi machinery and all the wiring, copper wiring was replaced by lower conductivity wires which provided greater resistance to electric current, so therefore, they had to raise the voltage from 110 to 220.</span> <span id="s129">How beneficial it is, I don't know, but that was one benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q.</span> <span id="s131">What did a boy of eight years old, seven years old, do you remember how you felt about all of these restrictions?</span> <span id="s132">Did it make sense to you?</span> <span id="s133">Did it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A. I'm not quite certain whether it did bother me or not, because you have to keep in mind one that, that European societies especially those who used to be under Austria-Hungarian monarchy are very obedient people.</span> <span id="s135">They have much greater respect, always had much greater respect for authority than here, in a free society.</span> <span id="s136">In the old republic everybody had in his possession hundreds of documents.</span> <span id="s137">It was a society obsessed with documents.</span> <span id="s138">It's difficult to explain the futility of these documents because it's so laughable, but the bureaucracy was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s139">Therefore, when an order came, even if a foolish one, nobody asked whether it makes sense or not.</span> <span id="s140">The only unpleasant situations began to develop, but again, gradually, where came an order that Jews are forbidden to communicate with non Jews.</span> <span id="s141">That started to create problems.</span> <span id="s142">Now, I do not know what the Christian boys were told by their parents, but I do remember that when I walked through certain streets that boys my age and older ones, ganged up on me and used to beat me up and calling me not only Jew, that would have been too simple, but they were infected by their parents.</span> <span id="s143">At that time, they used to call Jew, Christ killer, and by beating me up they believed that they are revenging the crucification of Christ that somehow I am responsible for it.</span> <span id="s144">That is one part of it which I never could have reconciled in my mind.</span> <span id="s145">How am I, if it is true that the Jews sold out Christ and crucified him, what part did I play in it, or my parents.</span> <span id="s146">Why am I being punished for something 1,945 years later.</span> <span id="s147">When I came to my parents with these questions, there were no answers.</span> <span id="s148">Simply, I do remember that certain things I asked once and then I did not get satisfactory answer or answer that I could have at that age comprehend, I didn't pursue it anymore.</span> <span id="s149">Because usually my parents' answer was when you are older you will understand better.</span> <span id="s150">Now you are still too young to understand.</span> <span id="s151">That is what I reconciled myself with.</span> <span id="s152">Perhaps when I will be older I will understand, so therefore, I didn't pursue many of these open questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q.</span> <span id="s154">When you said that you generally accepted whatever rules were established because that was the way life was, still maybe I would question why these rules only applied to Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A. Again, I do not have a clear cut answer because I'm not quite certain that at that age I was concerned with us Jews.</span> <span id="s156">I think I was more concerned with myself, why I cannot do something.</span> <span id="s157">I'm not quite certain I understood that there are others in town that suffer with the same restriction.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q. Right, but what I'm suggesting is you couldn't do something but the boy next door could.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A. Yes, I was told simply because he was a Christian and that was the rule.</span> <span id="s160">I didn't ask why he and I not.</span> <span id="s161">I was told because you are Jewish and the rules said you as a Jew could not do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q.</span> <span id="s163">At the time of all of these restrictions were you still able to go to the synagogue like you had been doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A.</span> <span id="s165">That comes the next step.</span> <span id="s166">Again, I do not know if it was 1941, certain things started to develop slowly.</span> <span id="s167">First of all, _________________ was a town which had a large Jewish section.</span> <span id="s168">It was called _______________, Jewish town.</span> <span id="s169">All of a sudden, I began to realize that that part of _________________, the population of that part, begins to increase in size.</span> <span id="s170">Namely, because I as a Jew was not permitted to associate with Christians, I used to go every day to the Jewish part of the town to play with boys my age.</span> <span id="s171">Not all the streets were closed to Jews or entry permitted from three to five, only the main streets.</span> <span id="s172">If I went in circles, I was always able to reach the Jewish part of town and play with the Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s173">That part of the town, the population began to swell.</span> <span id="s174">Everyday there were more and more people in that part of town.</span> <span id="s175">I was delighted because there were more boys to play with.</span> <span id="s176">It never occurred to me to ask why does the population of that part of town keep increasing.</span> <span id="s177">It simply didn't signal anything unique.</span> <span id="s178">The house which we occupied which we owned, also got additional tenants, so that finally we were squeezed into one room.</span> <span id="s179">We shared the house with people from other towns throughout the region who all were sent to _______________ to the Jewish, and slowly it became a ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">Now, I do not remember any specific events except that Germans did not have any military contingent in _______________- that resided there.</span> <span id="s181">The nearest gestapo contingent was in ________________, which was a larger town that ________________.</span> <span id="s182">The Czech police played some ambivalent role in the whole situation.</span> <span id="s183">Some Czech policemen remained faithful to the fact that they were policemen and not nazis.</span> <span id="s184">Others saw an opportunity to enrich themselves and joined the side of the Germans against the Jews.</span> <span id="s185">So, it depended on your sin and who actually accused you of it whether you went free or not.</span> <span id="s186">The Gestapo came many a times and arrested people without any specific reason.</span> <span id="s187">Usually see bits of news you learned through the grapevine that such and such was taken away yesterday by the gestapo.</span> <span id="s188">Usually you never saw that person again or that family again.</span> <span id="s189">So, the Jewish part of town began really to explode in seams from influx of people, of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q. Your house was not in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A.</span> <span id="s192">Our house was just on the border of the Jewish part of the town but not in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q. So, when you wanted to go there to play with boys your age, did you feel safe?</span> <span id="s194">Did you parents show any concern about you wandering around?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A. No, not as long as they knew I was in that part of town.</span> <span id="s196">The only worry was that every Jew had to be off the street at 8:00 and if you were caught after 8:00 that was reason to be deported.</span> <span id="s197">But as long as I was home before 8:00 there was no particular worry.</span> <span id="s198">At least my parents never indicated to me that they were worried what I'm doing all day.</span> <span id="s199">They knew where I was.</span> <span id="s200">The only problem was not to commit some mischief, for example, not to go fishing.</span> <span id="s201">_____________ had a very pleasant river, plenty of fish, and that again was taboo.</span> <span id="s202">So, it was a tense situation, but I think that at that age, maybe you are looking at these things as more of an adventure rather than sensing the danger in it.</span> <span id="s203">Because after all, don't forget that the Germans atrocities that they committed, were all committed elsewhere until you actually got there, you didn't have the slightest knowledge of what is happening.</span> <span id="s204">We didn't have radio.</span> <span id="s205">The news came only through grapevine.</span> <span id="s206">The news was sanitized.</span> <span id="s207">In those early days of the second world war, things went extremely well for the Germans.</span> <span id="s208">They conquered France without too many problems.</span> <span id="s209">They conquered Poland.</span> <span id="s210">They were very close deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s211">The news that people were listening to, let's say the broadcasts from London or from Moscow were not very encouraging in those days.</span> <span id="s212">I may add one additional thing that in those days every radio throughout _______________ or even under the Czech republic was registered in the post office.</span> <span id="s213">You had to renew your radio license every year by buying a stamp.</span> <span id="s214">So, that the authorities knew of every radio, who owns it, and where it is.</span> <span id="s215">One of the first things the Germans did when they occupied Czechoslovakia they removed the tubes from the radio.</span> <span id="s216">In those days they had huge vacuum tubes that enable you to listen to London or Moscow.</span> <span id="s217">That means short waves or long waves.</span> <span id="s218">We are not talking about am or fm.</span> <span id="s219">In those days, they had different waves in Europe, so you were left with a radio that was only able to let you listen to Central Europe radio stations, and Central Europe in those days almost completely occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s220">So, you always heard one and the same newscast and the Germans were singing praises to the victorious armies.</span> <span id="s221">So, situation did not look very rosy at all.</span> <span id="s222">As a matter of fact, one sort of a habit we used to have is we used to have a map of Europe and we used to tuck pins which town was conquered by the Germans so we had more or less create a picture how far the German armies had advanced.</span> <span id="s223">Then you had another problem, you did not know exactly what was propaganda and what is reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q.</span> <span id="s225">How much of what you're talking about were you aware of or did you even think about at that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A. Well, again, as I said at that age you look upon any military as something that you want to become part of when you grow up and ________________ being a small town, occasionally a military convoy passed through and I remember I don't know exactly why one day came and contingent of German soldiers that were outfitted in African clothes they were the Africa corp that fought under ______________, and strangely enough shortly thereafter after that contingent passed through town, the whole ____________________ block was required to surrender leather made luggage, pieces of luggage and leather made goods.</span> <span id="s227">We were told that that is needed to manufacture for the Africa corp shoes.</span> <span id="s228">They need a lot of shoes.</span> <span id="s229">We were then asking well what suppose the rest of the population to do?</span> <span id="s230">For example, if your shoe soles were worn out.</span> <span id="s231">So, then somebody introduced old tires from cars and used that rubber for shoe soles.</span> <span id="s232">As the next item, old tires had to be surrendered.</span> <span id="s233">People who used to have bicycles became very inventive.</span> <span id="s234">After surrendering the tires from the bicycles they mounted on a wire in very close proximity to each other, corks from bottles and ride the bicycle on corks.</span> <span id="s235">Gasoline was unobtainable because private cars were either confiscated or not permitted to be driven at all, and the buses were converted I do not know exactly how it worked mechanically but each bus had a boiler mounted on the side and I think it was propelled by steam.</span> <span id="s236">You had to create steam pressure in the boiler and then you were able to ride in it.</span> <span id="s237">Of course when the pressure went down, everybody had to go out.</span> <span id="s238">If the bus driver had some wood with him, then he again fired up the boiler.</span> <span id="s239">If not everybody had to go and gather pieces of wood and again simulate the steam pressure of the boiler before the bus was able to continue.</span> <span id="s240">These are some memories and bits and pieces that you heard through the grapevine about economic conditions and situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q.</span> <span id="s242">You weren't riding on the busses?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A. Later on I had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s244">Later on in the war I had the opportunity to ride on one of those busses and experience it first hand, but that was after we fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q. So, were you and your family ever forced to live within this ________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A. No.</span> <span id="s247">I do not think that because it was so close to the ______________ that we were actually in a way considered part of it.</span> <span id="s248">Maybe geographically not, but the distance was maybe a hundred yards to the _______________.</span> <span id="s249">The only difference being was that the ________________ at some point it had about four entries to it and there were guards posted there, and I think a gate was erected and anybody that went in or out had to show his i.d. card, but because we were outside of it, we didn't have to do so.</span> <span id="s250">So, if that is considered some privilege, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q.</span> <span id="s252">Who were the guards, do you know?</span> <span id="s253">Were they Jewish guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A. Yes, they were Jewish guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q. So, did your general living conditions become more difficult in terms of was your father still able to practice dentistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A. No, no, father didn't practice.</span> <span id="s257">I think that we lived from our savings.</span> <span id="s258">The food rations well, if you saw that, they were minuscule.</span> <span id="s259">Even that which you obtained on the ration cards had a very dubious quality.</span> <span id="s260">For example, I do remember that we got periodically a cube of honey and I don't know why I still remember it, I was told that the honey was made from coal.</span> <span id="s261">I do not know chemistry.</span> <span id="s262">I heard it was made from coal.</span> <span id="s263">I do not know whether you have seen a book of coupons, but every week we were entitled to something.</span> <span id="s264">Let's say one week you were scheduled to obtain marmalade.</span> <span id="s265">Glass was not available, so you went to a grocery store and they put a piece of wax paper and weighed in to it marmalade.</span> <span id="s266">By the time you came home, not much was left.</span> <span id="s267">It all seeped out.</span> <span id="s268">Potatoes I think were our main staple.</span> <span id="s269">Bread which we got, was black in color.</span> <span id="s270">As a matter of fact, somebody made for me a friend a chess set from that black bread because that bread if you didn't consume it within a few hours, was hard like rock.</span> <span id="s271">I don't know what that bread was made of.</span> <span id="s272">One by product of the economic shortage was that the black market flourished in an unbelievable fashion.</span> <span id="s273">Unfortunately in every time of adversity, black market flourishes and many people enrich themselves by being black marketeers.</span> <span id="s274">There was black market for gasoline.</span> <span id="s275">There was black market for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s276">Again, cigarettes were not available for Jews.</span> <span id="s277">I and a friend of mine became a little inventive.</span> <span id="s278">We wanted to make some extra money.</span> <span id="s279">In as much as cigarettes to Jews, however, what was available were filters, cigarette filters, and we used to buy in a store a hundred empty cigarette filters and used to utilize dried leaves and stuff that instead of tobacco and we were selling it.</span> <span id="s280">So, we made a little bit extra money by selling these awful smelling and tasting cigarettes.</span> <span id="s281">We were very inventive for example I remember my father used to have a fishing rod so we mounted on the tip of the fishing rod a sack made of linen and we used to extend that fishing rod to a garden which my neighbor grew apples and we used to steal apples from his trees with a fishing rod.</span> <span id="s282">There are childhood memories and it's interesting that poverty and hunger and need can be stimulate within you creativity and inventiveness and I think that's what made it in a way fun for us kids at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q. Your father, he was not working any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A. No, he was not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q. So, how did your parents spend their time?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A. I think that the Jewish men of the _____________ of the Jewish section used to spend most of their day playing cards and exchanging stories and trying to outguess the political situation and trying to guess when the war will end.</span> <span id="s287">That was the main occupation.</span> <span id="s288">That situation sort of a limbo if you will I think lasted for about a year, year and a half.</span> <span id="s289">Then the situation began to change very, very rapidly and very dramatically.</span> <span id="s290">By that I mean the order came that in alphabetical order by the last name each Jew has to come to local high school a register.</span> <span id="s291">There you obtained a number, a registration number which gain didn't mean very much to me.</span> <span id="s292">With the registration number, you were given a list and that list stated that the registration number will be your personal i.d. from here on and you should prepare for the relocation to the east.</span> <span id="s293">In order to provide supplies for the relocation you were permitted to take with you no more than 50 kilograms per person, 50 kilograms being about 80 pounds and it specified exactly what you were not permitted to take with you.</span> <span id="s294">It left the relocation date open, but you should slowly get ready for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q.</span> <span id="s296">What were you not allowed to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A. Well, again the Germans itemized the list for forbidden items that they took away from you a long time ago, but they wanted to make sure that somehow you didn't forget to surrender these articles.</span> <span id="s298">You were not permitted to take any gold, any jewels, radios, cameras, items which nobody had anymore anyhow.</span> <span id="s299">Now, a strange game started to develop.</span> <span id="s300">Everybody through grapevines started asking well what do we take with us.</span> <span id="s301">East, we are going east.</span> <span id="s302">Nobody knew just how far or where to or what time of year would it be.</span> <span id="s303">Do we take winter articles.</span> <span id="s304">Do we take food with us.</span> <span id="s305">What exactly do we take.</span> <span id="s306">There the grapevine started working.</span> <span id="s307">We still didn't know where we would go, but everybody was advised to take food.</span> <span id="s308">Now, with the ration coupons again the question was well what food do we take, how much.</span> <span id="s309">After all, the food is of so dubious quality it might spoil.</span> <span id="s310">I do remember that my mother used to prepare huge cubes of yeast.</span> <span id="s311">I never tried to analyze why yeast but maybe it has some unique nutritional value.</span> <span id="s312">We used to accumulate cubes with honey.</span> <span id="s313">I do remember that we purchased cubes of toothpaste and open the cubes in the back and stuffed into the toothpaste gold coins which we still had because nobody surrendered everything.</span> <span id="s314">So, in that way, we started preparing for a journey that we didn't know when would take place or where to.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q. Let me ask you a couple questions and then we'll change tapes.</span> <span id="s316">Approximately what time period are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A.</span> <span id="s318">That was about '41 or '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q.</span> <span id="s320">When you got this information about going to the high school and getting a number and what you would take, did this come through some sort of Jewish representatives of the community or how did you get this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A.</span> <span id="s322">In retrospect in general I can make that statement.</span> <span id="s323">Everything that the community, that the authorities wanted the community to know, usually came via two systems of media.</span> <span id="s324">One was through loudspeakers which I think the Germans had mounted almost on every corner of the main street.</span> <span id="s325">Then number two they had public bill boards on which they posted the huge placards and always writing and adding to whom it concerns and not reading the placards, advertisement was no excuse for not obeying the law was again punishable because every citizen was forced to listen to the loudspeakers or read it on the public bulletin boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q. So, when we stopped we were talking about the registration and relocation.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A. Now, at home we did all sorts of exercise.</span> <span id="s330">The problem was that in as much as the leather luggage was taken away, we had paper type of luggage and the problem was how many pounds the paper luggage can handle.</span> <span id="s331">Then the question was do we carry it in two pieces of luggage or do we take a sack or where do we put what.</span> <span id="s332">But, I have to deviate a little bit from that to tell you a very important side of the story, namely now comes seeing my grandfather.</span> <span id="s333">My grandfather was a medical doctor who at that time was living on the Slovak side of the border.</span> <span id="s334">Before the war, he used to be a medical doctor in a glass factory that was situated exactly in the middle of the international border between Czech lands and Slovak lands.</span> <span id="s335">The factory was a glass kind of factory owned by Germans.</span> <span id="s336">When Hitler came to town, the Germans sold the factory and fled to Germany, and when that happened, my grandfather lost the place as a physician for the glass blowers and moved from that village to a town on the Slovak side called ________________ where he opened a private practice.</span> <span id="s337">All the glass blowers that used to live in the village of whom he took care remained his patient and used to come visit him for consultations to _______________.</span> <span id="s338">When the _____________ emerged the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia became independent and became a puppet state under a president who was a priest.</span> <span id="s339">______________ was his name.</span> <span id="s340">He was a catholic priest.</span> <span id="s341">The Slovaks traditionally didn't like very much the union with the Czechs.</span> <span id="s342">The Czechs probably didn't like the Slovaks much either.</span> <span id="s343">They viewed the Slovaks like a bride who didn't bring into the marriage a dowry large enough, and therefore, the marriage was a very uneasy one.</span> <span id="s344">Furthermore, the Slovaks were always fiercely nationalists and the Slovak population was very clearly divided between the catholic population and the Lutheran population.</span> <span id="s345">So, Slovaks had a very small minority of gypsies but they didn't amount to much.</span> <span id="s346">But whenever later on we wanted to know whether a person is reliable sufficiently we always ask as a first question whether he's a catholic or whether he's a Lutheran but that came a little bit later.</span> <span id="s347">However, the Slovak part of the land was not occupied initially by Germans and the economy in Slovakia was flourishing.</span> <span id="s348">It was extremely good going as compared to the _____________ side of the country.</span> <span id="s349">My grandfather was always able to smuggle goods, food stuff, to us.</span> <span id="s350">Namely, the international board of _____________ in Slovakia who went exactly through the middle of the village and the population from one country worked in the second country so that the German guards after a while already knew the people by sight and didn't ask anymore for i.d. cards and as long as you were dressed according to the local customs and habits and didn't behave in any conspicuous fashions the Germans usually didn't bother to stop you for an i.d. card.</span> <span id="s351">At least not during the regular day hours.</span> <span id="s352">They let the people cross the borders without any problems.</span> <span id="s353">And consequently, many of these farmers used to come to ______________, which was not very far away from the border and brought us messages from Grandfather and brought smuggled food stuff.</span> <span id="s354">So, we were always a little bit better off than the other people who didn't have any contacts.</span> <span id="s355">The messages that my grandfather sent us usually were written on a piece of linen and sewed in a lining of a coat so that even if the Germans frisk you they wouldn't feel paper.</span> <span id="s356">My grandfather had his sources of information because the Slovaks were able to listen to radios easier in a freer form than we and he knew about these transports and where they are going.</span> <span id="s357">So, he kept warning us, alerting us, but at that time he did not indicate anything about being in a position to help us.</span> <span id="s358">So, after registration about a couple weeks later, suddenly again on these billboards came an announcement that registration numbers of between these and these numbers should report to the local railroad station on such and such date.</span> <span id="s359">Luckily enough, one farmer came on that day and brought us food stuff from our grandfather and on his way back to Slovakia we gave him a message that we have been scheduled for transport two weeks from today and this is goodbye.</span> <span id="s360">The farmer as we know today, succeeded and gave that message to our grandfather.</span> <span id="s361">About three or four days before we were to appear at the railroad station I was playing with the boys in the ______________ as usually.</span> <span id="s362">Suddenly my sister came to fetch me and said quietly, go quickly to grandma, my grandmother from my father's side, the grandfather that was living in Slovakia was from my mother's side.</span> <span id="s363">This grandmother was from my father's side.</span> <span id="s364">She lived in the _______________, go say goodbye to her and I will take you immediately home.</span> <span id="s365">Don't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s366">So, I went to grandma and said goodbye to her.</span> <span id="s367">She apparently knew already and she started to cry.</span> <span id="s368">I didn't understand the reason for her crying, I said bye grandma and I left with my sister.</span> <span id="s369">That was late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s370">When I came home, there I realized the flurry of activity.</span> <span id="s371">My mother was taking all sorts of clothes and bringing it to neighbors who lived across from our house.</span> <span id="s372">I remember the neighbor being a tailor and my mother always brought it over and came back empty handed and took another load and brought it again to the neighbors.</span> <span id="s373">I asked my mother what's going on.</span> <span id="s374">She said don't ask any questions, just get dressed very warmly.</span> <span id="s375">Take two layers of clothes and don't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s376">I didn't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s377">It was winter.</span> <span id="s378">I think it must have been Christmas day, probably 1942, 1943 Christmas.</span> <span id="s379">At about 8:00 my father, my mother, and my sister and myself gathered.</span> <span id="s380">We shut off the lights which was sort of a useless exercise anyhow because I should mention that in those days all the windows had to have heavy curtains because of air attacks.</span> <span id="s381">We waited and suddenly at about 8:00 in the evening somebody knocked on the door and we saw a stranger that told us are you ready and mother and father said yes and we left the house.</span> <span id="s382">We followed the stranger.</span> <span id="s383">We walked through the town which was already dark and heavy snow.</span> <span id="s384">We knew that we are out after 8:00 if we got caught that would be the end of it, but nobody paid too much attention to us.</span> <span id="s385">Because we are not situated geographically in the _____________, that was in our favor.</span> <span id="s386">So, we in that evening we already broke all the rules and we broke through the edge of the town, where that gentleman had a car, a taxi.</span> <span id="s387">He motioned us to enter the taxi and he drove us away from ___________________.</span> <span id="s388">Well, we left ____________________ and at the edge of the town was a taxi waiting and the gentleman pointed that we should enter the taxi.</span> <span id="s389">So, my sister, my mother my father and myself entered the taxi and the taxi car started slowly, slowly edging away from _____________.</span> <span id="s390">I do not remember how long we traveled in the taxi but it must have been a couple of hours because visibility was miserable.</span> <span id="s391">It was snowing very heavily and he was driving very slowly.</span> <span id="s392">After several hours we arrived at our destination.</span> <span id="s393">At that time I didn't know where we were but the taxi driver again said we should exit the taxi.</span> <span id="s394">He stopped, we should exit the taxi and outside was waiting for us a gentleman who took us to his farm.</span> <span id="s395">We walked for about a hundred yards and we entered his farm.</span> <span id="s396">The taxi driver said goodbye to us and he continued in his journey.</span> <span id="s397">I didn't know where he came from or where he was going to.</span> <span id="s398">In the farmer's house we caught our breath, we got something to eat, and I was told that we will have to wait.</span> <span id="s399">I was not told why or for how long.</span> <span id="s400">After waiting for quite a while the farmer came back in dressed in a heavy coat and boots and said okay let's go.</span> <span id="s401">I didn't know where to, but as a good boy I didn't ask many questions and all four of us left the farmhouse led by the farmer.</span> <span id="s402">The farmer walked with us on the main road for about half a mile and then he left the main road and started walking towards the forest.</span> <span id="s403">We walked in heavy, heavy snow for about half a mile in the direction of the forest and when we entered the forest, we kept walking.</span> <span id="s404">I do remember the snow was coming down very, very heavily.</span> <span id="s405">I think at some point I lost even my shoes but we kept walking.</span> <span id="s406">I do remember as we were walking suddenly I saw a window from which light was shining.</span> <span id="s407">I heard some dogs barking and I heard singing and my father and the farmer indicated with their finger to keep quiet and to keep walking.</span> <span id="s408">After an additional half an hour or hour of walk we came again to a farmer's house where they already were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s409">We were totally lost, and we were led to an attic in which there was some hay and some straw and we laid and rested for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s410">Only then I was told that we crossed the international border from _______________ to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s411">We are now in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s412">In that attic grandfather and grandmother were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s413">We rested for a couple more hours and the farmer took us again to the main highway on the Slovak side of the border where there was a sled waiting for us drawn by horses.</span> <span id="s414">They took us deeper into Slovak territory to a farm house where we entered a barn and we were hiding there.</span> <span id="s415">Now, from events that later on took place, I understood that my grandfather and grandmother were afraid that once our escape will be made known the Germans will of course very easily figure out that we must have fled to Slovakia and in all likelihood will notify the Slovak authorities to arrest us.</span> <span id="s416">So, from that point on, we stayed in hiding until the end of the war, with grandfather and grandmother.</span> <span id="s417">For some period of time there was six of us, but at some point my sister separated from us because she was able to learn the Slovak language and being a woman it was virtually impossible to prove that she was Jewish for obvious reasons and she lived out the rest of the war in Brataslava which was the capital of Slovak Republic working under an assumed name and forged papers and she worked as a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q.</span> <span id="s419">A couple things, when you went by that house and your father told you to be quiet, who were those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A.</span> <span id="s421">That was a guard house, the nazi German guard house that during the day the soldiers were staffing the border crossing.</span> <span id="s422">Like majority of international borders you have that wooden bar that is down and the soldiers check your i.d.s but during the night when everybody is home and it being Christmas there was no traffic there.</span> <span id="s423">The soldiers instead of being outside freezing they went to the guard house to celebrate Christmas.</span> <span id="s424">Because after all, they were also away from their families and being in a warm cozy house, they were celebrating Christmas and singing.</span> <span id="s425">In all likelihood they had some alcoholic beverages too.</span> <span id="s426">That's how our journey into hiding began.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q. Wasn't there some fear of reprisal from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A. Yes, that was the reason why our grandparents left their home of the Slovak side and joined us in hiding because of the fear that the nazis, the Slovak nazis will put two and two together that we must have obtained help from the Slovak side and the logic would have pointed towards our grandparents that they must have engineered our escape.</span> <span id="s429">The assumption was a correct one because the neighbors of our grandparents later on told us that not long after the grandparents had left, the Slovak fascists came to the house to look for them.</span> <span id="s430">These are the distances are very minuscule and one telephone call arranges many, many things, especially when the caller is a gestapo high official so that we had a window of about two days because we fled about three days before the transport should have departed.</span> <span id="s431">Therefore we had some window in which to breath a little bit more freely, but once everybody reported to the railroad station they discovered very quickly that we are missing and they started very seriously looking for us.</span> <span id="s432">From that point on, we never stayed very long in any one place of hiding.</span> <span id="s433">Because of my grandfather's collections of a medical doctor, many farmers owed their lives to him.</span> <span id="s434">Many of them were helping us very willingly.</span> <span id="s435">There were a few who did it purely for monetary reasons and to those we had to pay very heavily.</span> <span id="s436">But the majority of them did it as gratitude to grandfather.</span> <span id="s437">The problems were why we couldn't stay in any place too long, the reasons were very obvious.</span> <span id="s438">Number one, in those parts of the country people know one another.</span> <span id="s439">The grocer knows that when a farmer comes to buy his supply he used to buy for years and years the same amount of supplies.</span> <span id="s440">Suddenly he buys three times as much.</span> <span id="s441">So, it raises suspicion.</span> <span id="s442">Why do you suddenly need so much food.</span> <span id="s443">Problem number two, visibility.</span> <span id="s444">You always had to stay away from windows because someone may see you through the window.</span> <span id="s445">People know one another to such an extent that they know exactly in which room you are eating, your stove.</span> <span id="s446">Suddenly through a chimney that was not used for years, smoke comes out.</span> <span id="s447">So, these were all signs that some unusual activity is taking place in the house and therefore to lower the level of suspicion we had to be continuously on the move.</span> <span id="s448">Furthermore, the Germans from _____________ issued a large monetary reward for our capture and that was very tempting to some farmers who always lived on the edge of poverty.</span> <span id="s449">Simply, we had to go from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q.</span> <span id="s451">As a boy, was this difficult or was it an adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A.</span> <span id="s453">That already began to be difficult.</span> <span id="s454">I stopped seeing it as an adventure.</span> <span id="s455">Why was it difficult?</span> <span id="s456">Number one because I was a growing boy.</span> <span id="s457">My movement was very restricted because we had to stay in one room or always be on a lookout how we exit the room and where to.</span> <span id="s458">My movement was restricted and number two whenever we moved from one hiding place to another we did it in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s459">I never knew how long we would stay in a certain place, how far away we would move and whether we would be for the next month living in an attic or a cellar.</span> <span id="s460">That at that point became very, very irritating.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q.</span> <span id="s462">Did you know most of the people who hid you?</span> <span id="s463">Or did your grandfather know who they were beforehand?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A.</span> <span id="s465">In most cases he knew who these people were, in most cases.</span> <span id="s466">In several cases the relatives of those whom he knew but for almost all the time he knew the collections, how it all went.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q. Do you maybe want to go back and get specific.</span> <span id="s468">Tell me about these places and describe what they were for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A.</span> <span id="s470">That part of Slovakia I do not believe has any thing compatible that I can relate to in the United States.</span> <span id="s471">That part in those days Slovakia had isolated farms.</span> <span id="s472">They were about two or three miles apart from each other.</span> <span id="s473">You could have seen from one farm to the other providing the weather was good, providing the terrain permitted you to do so.</span> <span id="s474">The farmers, during the summer months were farming.</span> <span id="s475">They had a cow or two.</span> <span id="s476">They had some pigs, they had some chickens.</span> <span id="s477">They had some small fields where they raised various things.</span> <span id="s478">During the winter, they used to supplement their income by tending the forests.</span> <span id="s479">They were also lumberjacks.</span> <span id="s480">Some of them during the long winter months supplemented their income by producing toys from wood or women were gathering feathers.</span> <span id="s481">In those days, most of these farms did not have electricity.</span> <span id="s482">All of it was done by kerosene lamp so that the life was very, very slow, but it was sort of a friendly relation because they all depended on one another.</span> <span id="s483">Most of the farmers knew that if they got caught, they would be shot.</span> <span id="s484">You were in no position to hide Jews and go to the police station and say hey I'm hiding Jews and want my reward.</span> <span id="s485">It did not work that way.</span> <span id="s486">If you wanted your reward you had to say that farmer over there is hiding Jews or partisans.</span> <span id="s487">Then you may have gotten your reward.</span> <span id="s488">If the Germans didn't feel like giving it to you, they may have accused you of being a collaborator and shot you together with that farmer who was hiding those Jews or partisans.</span> <span id="s489">With the Germans or Slovak fascist who learned all the tricks of the game from the nazis, you never knew where you were standing.</span> <span id="s490">You would never be able to outguess them.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q.</span> <span id="s492">Did they have a large presence in the area?</span> <span id="s493">Were they always around?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A.</span> <span id="s495">We did discover an interesting phenomenon.</span> <span id="s496">The closer the farm was situated to a forest, the more often the Germans seemed to make their presence known.</span> <span id="s497">Namely, there were German units mixed with the Slovak fascists units who periodically conducted raids into the forest not so much with trying to find Jews but trying to find partisans.</span> <span id="s498">In one of such raids, we were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q. That's a little bit later is it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A. Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q. I'd like to get back to a certain chronology, if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s502">The first place -- the second place you went after you came into Slovakia, you were in a barn or an attic with your grandparents.</span> <span id="s503">Exactly where was that and how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A.</span> <span id="s505">How long I do not know myself.</span> <span id="s506">I only know that we never stayed in any one place longer than a few weeks, maybe a month and it would be futile to try to look upon a map and find the way we progressed because number one depending on the political situation, some farmers may have indicated willingness to provide shelter for us and a day later change their minds.</span> <span id="s507">Some farmers had various excuses.</span> <span id="s508">Yes, we would hide you but we have small children who go to school and they may say something.</span> <span id="s509">It took lots and lots of cooperation to find somebody who was willing to hide five or six people.</span> <span id="s510">As I said before some places we stayed longer, some places we stayed a short time.</span> <span id="s511">I remember one farmer had a pregnant wife so all of a sudden she started in birth.</span> <span id="s512">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s513">Although my father was a doctor, my grandfather was a doctor, but we didn't know ahead of time what complications may emerge and she may be forced to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s514">So, that we continuously moved from one place to another.</span> <span id="s515">Some were better, others were worse but basically the pattern stayed the same.</span> <span id="s516">Avoid windows.</span> <span id="s517">Always ask if everything is clear if you want to go out, and when we did go out, it was usually during the night, complete darkness.</span> <span id="s518">We usually went out just to take a breath of fresh air and maybe walk a little bit, otherwise we were continuously most of the time in darkness and if we were in an attic the farmer usually erected a false wall between the house and the stacks of hay and we were separated by bales of hay.</span> <span id="s519">Because again, it was assumed that if a German patrol will come and search the house, maybe they do not realize that the space in the attic does not conform to the length of the house.</span> <span id="s520">But of course, looking at it later on when such raids were made, those units that were trained in finding partisans or Jews knew all the tricks of the game.</span> <span id="s521">They were not even afraid to set the house on fire if they had suspicions that somebody was there and they could not find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q.</span> <span id="s523">Did that ever happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A. No, that did not happen to us, with exception as I said before that on one occasion we did get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q.</span> <span id="s526">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A.</span> <span id="s528">That was again, it happened because of a unit mixed Germans and Slovaks were searching for partisans, and I do not remember whether they came to the farm on their way back but I think that they must have come to the farm before their raid actually started and their destination was the forest, but they came to the farm to get some drink of water and they searched the house for partisans and they stumbled upon us.</span> <span id="s529">So, the commandant of the unit had a dilemma.</span> <span id="s530">In all likelihood six Jews, he did not want to abort his raid and bring six Jews with him to the barracks and show this as a product of a days work so he decided to continue his raid of the partisans and made us swear that next day we will voluntarily appear in his barracks.</span> <span id="s531">To emphasize, to stress the point that he means business, he ordered one of the soldiers to rape my mother.</span> <span id="s532">Her father, her husband and her son had to watch it.</span> <span id="s533">At that point we knew what was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s534">After the unit left, we fled the farm.</span> <span id="s535">It was in deep snow in winter and these units never ventured very deeply into the forest.</span> <span id="s536">They were afraid of the partisans.</span> <span id="s537">They usually went into the forest about a hundred yards and started widely shooting into the forest hoping that they will hit someone and some occasions they hit someone, but once they heard a human voice they entered the forest and dragged the partisans out.</span> <span id="s538">We knew they went in a different direction and we fled into the forest away from the farmer's house.</span> <span id="s539">The farmer sent after us a couple of his friends who inside the forest dug out for us a bunker in the ground in which we went in hiding.</span> <span id="s540">About two days later another farmer whom we did not know came to visit us and brought food supplies and told us that the unit returned two days later to the farmer's house and burned the house to the ground and shot the farmer and all of his family for harboring us.</span> <span id="s541">We spent from that point on time in that bunker underground.</span> <span id="s542">You know when I'm talking about forests, these were very, very deep forests.</span> <span id="s543">The _______________ forest stretch for miles and miles.</span> <span id="s544">There is no end to them.</span> <span id="s545">We got a small stove and during the night we kept warm by feeding the forest with dried wood because dried wood does not emit any smoke.</span> <span id="s546">We were heating only during the night.</span> <span id="s547">One time the sense that some German patrols didn't pass too far away from our bunker and when the farmers came next time, we dug out another bunker and we moved away from the old place to a new bunker.</span> <span id="s548">There was another horrible story.</span> <span id="s549">We discovered that not far away, by not far away I don't mean a hundred miles, I mean several miles from us, there were a couple other bunkers and the young men kept visiting the other bunker and while he was on his way to visit the other bunker the German patrol discovered this bunker in which his parents were hiding.</span> <span id="s550">They shot them.</span> <span id="s551">He visited his friends in the other bunker who were alive.</span> <span id="s552">He left them, after a half an hour went back to his own bunker.</span> <span id="s553">He found his parents shot.</span> <span id="s554">He returned back to his friends' bunker who in the mean time was discovered by the Germans and found them shot too.</span> <span id="s555">He was simply saved by the fact that he was on a trip between the two bunkers and the German patrol never stumbled upon him.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q.</span> <span id="s557">How did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A. Later on when he found his parents and his friends dead, he came to us and told us about it.</span> <span id="s559">We were a few times visited by injured partisans because of two doctors.</span> <span id="s560">They sought us out on several occasions.</span> <span id="s561">My father and my grandfather removed the bullets of the wounded ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q.</span> <span id="s563">So there was some sort of communication information being passed between all of you in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A. Well, very careful, very limited, but there was some communication, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q. Were there a lot of other refugees in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A. No, very, very few.</span> <span id="s567">After the war, a long time after the war has ended I found out I was already in Israel I found out that one family was hiding not far away from us and the German patrol was shooting into the forest and the father was hit by a bullet and he screamed the Germans came and dragged the whole family and sent them to a concentration camp, but they survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q. Was the fear constant?</span> <span id="s569">Were you always very guarded about your movements?</span> <span id="s570">Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A. Well, in the forest time lost its meaning because what you were mostly observant you were worried about the weather.</span> <span id="s572">When it didn't snow, the forest was beautiful.</span> <span id="s573">The snow was clean, the trees were beautiful.</span> <span id="s574">The problem began when it rained because we lived in a bunker that was covered by tar paper.</span> <span id="s575">It did not keep the rain completely away, so we were continuously freezing, always cold.</span> <span id="s576">Cold and hungry because the provisions that we received didn't have many vitamins.</span> <span id="s577">For example, each scratch, the smallest scratch caused infection.</span> <span id="s578">So, you were always suffering from something.</span> <span id="s579">The life was simply I think the time lost its meaning.</span> <span id="s580">The only joy was when a farmer came to bring some provisions and telling you the latest news from the front.</span> <span id="s581">And logic kept telling us that when the Germans began to retreat they started slowly, slowly losing interest in catching Jews.</span> <span id="s582">Then apparently they reached a point in their philosophy that they considered the _____________and Slovakia to be free of Jews.</span> <span id="s583">So, they began to venture less and less frequently on these raids.</span> <span id="s584">The danger of course remained constantly that somebody will sell you out for the reward.</span> <span id="s585">That held true until the very end.</span> <span id="s586">That never ceased.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q.</span> <span id="s588">This area that you were in, can you just for the record, name a few of the nearby villages?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A. I don't know if it's going to exist because as I said before I think, many of these villages were consolidated.</span> <span id="s590">Some of them even changed their names but we are talking in the vicinity of ________________.</span> <span id="s591">The villages of _____________, ____________, _________________, ________________, otherwise all under normal conditions beautiful villages.</span> <span id="s592">Very, very friendly people under normal conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q.</span> <span id="s594">How would you spend an average day, if there was such a thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A. Doing absolutely nothing but sleeping.</span> <span id="s596">Sleeping, sleeping and sleeping and trying to save strength.</span> <span id="s597">Maybe once a day leaving the bunker for maybe half an hour and trying to gather twigs fallen from trees so that we will be kept warm during the night.</span> <span id="s598">But otherwise, doing absolutely nothing, not even talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q. Was that your primary responsibility, bringing in the firewood?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A. Yes, that was my responsibility because I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q.</span> <span id="s602">Did you have any contingency plans when you were in a place?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A. Yes, and that would have been something I definitely would have forgotten to tell you had you not asked.</span> <span id="s604">I did realize on several occasions that my grandfather had five or six buttons in his pocket and I was told they contain poison, which he would have given to each one of us to drink had he sensed that we were caught.</span> <span id="s605">That was the only contingency plan that we had.</span> <span id="s606">Luckily enough, we never had to make use of it, and that one time that we did get caught, it came so quickly that he was unable to distribute it anyhow, but that was because we were caught in a farm house where the dogs were already barking giving us warning.</span> <span id="s607">We saw already that human approaching from a distance.</span> <span id="s608">In the forest, I don't know -- I cannot describe to you a scenario how we would have gotten caught, whether the Germans would have had dogs with them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s609">But that I asked once Grandfather years after the war what was in those bottles and he told me, poison.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q.</span> <span id="s611">You did not know at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A.</span> <span id="s613">At the time I did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q. Now, was there ever a point when you were separated from the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A. Yes, I had a __________ where at some point my grandfather made some arrangement for me to attend alone by myself for one an half years a school in a very distant small village under an assumed name and under an assumed religion.</span> <span id="s616">But after about a year and a half living in that village, the residents began to ask my identity.</span> <span id="s617">Some of them started to suspect that I am Jewish and one old lady asked me I should show her my penis, whether I am circumcised or not.</span> <span id="s618">So, when that came, the people who were hiding me said you have to go back to your grandparents and join your parents to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q.</span> <span id="s620">Why had your family decided to send you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A. Mainly because of the schooling because I had attended regular school.</span> <span id="s622">That was the only year that I had school out of the nine grades required by Czech law, I had three years all together, and that was one of the three.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q. And they decided that even in this extraordinary times, you should go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A. Yes, because again it was already when Slovakia was considered to be free of Jews so they thought that there will be no suspicion.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q.</span> <span id="s626">Who was the family that did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A.</span> <span id="s628">That was a Lutheran minister and unfortunately he was imprisoned under the communists and died in jail for Lutheran religious activities against the communist state.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q. And your grandfather knew him?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A. Yes, he knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q. I'm going to ask you more about that, but why don't we change types.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A.</span> <span id="s635">The life in that village was very, very pleasant change.</span> <span id="s636">It was a very picturesque village.</span> <span id="s637">The Lutheran minister was a bachelor.</span> <span id="s638">He owned I think it probably came with the territory, he had a little farm.</span> <span id="s639">There was a cow, and he raised angora rabbits.</span> <span id="s640">Each winter the rabbits had to be clipped and he had a sister also an old spinster who was living with him who kept house, and she was processing the wool from the rabbits, so there was a lot of spinning going on and combing the wool and knitting and again that village was without electricity so women used to go from one household to the other and block feathers, and all sorts of stories were told by blocking the feathers.</span> <span id="s641">The village had a post office which had a telephone.</span> <span id="s642">It was the only telephone in the whole village.</span> <span id="s643">Later on by pure accident I found that the minister had a car which was hidden in a barn under a stack of hay and that explained to me the occasional noise of an engine.</span> <span id="s644">Namely, what was he doing?</span> <span id="s645">He was recharging the battery by the engine and he used the battery for listening to a short wave radio.</span> <span id="s646">I caught him once listening to London and Moscow and he knew the latest news about movement on the fronts.</span> <span id="s647">There was only one impediment in the otherwise beautiful setting.</span> <span id="s648">That with him was living a young school teacher who was teaching in a neighboring village and he pretended to be a great enticement who always voiced his suspicion.</span> <span id="s649">Many, many years later I found out that he did it purposely to keep them on their toes.</span> <span id="s650">To keep me always alert.</span> <span id="s651">But otherwise, life in the village was very, very pleasant, very serene because the village was in a valley, mountains surrounded it.</span> <span id="s652">_______________ was about two hours away by bus that used to depart from the village very early in the morning and used to come back late afternoon and usually the villages took a ride once a week to the nearest town when they had to buy something not obtainable in the village store.</span> <span id="s653">On one such occasion I took a ride to the town and strangely enough the town had a catholic church which the president of Slovakia at that time, ________________ was his name, was a priest of, and he used to conduct every Sunday services in that church.</span> <span id="s654">_____________ was the name of the town and on one such occasion, I went to the town and saw him giving this service in a catholic church.</span> <span id="s655">So, when the people of the village began to ask my religion, apparently the Lutheran minister got in contact with my grandparents and I was shipped back to the bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q.</span> <span id="s657">While you were in this village, did you have false papers, did you try to pass as a Christian boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s659">One of my grandfather's friends used to be a school teacher who issued in my name a false school certificate under an assumed name.</span> <span id="s660">I was named ____________ of Lutheran religion.</span> <span id="s661">To cover up my inadequate Slovak language, it was stated in the certificate that I came from a town called _____________ which was exactly on the border of the Czech and Slovak lands where they spoke a very mixed Czech Slovak language, the same that I was talking.</span> <span id="s662">But that persistent woman who wanted to know if I was really Lutheran, that certificate didn't mean much.</span> <span id="s663">She still wanted me to put my pants down.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q. Now, did you learn prayers, did you go to church?</span> <span id="s665">What sorts of things did you have to do to pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A. Okay.</span> <span id="s667">To pass, that village was so small that it had a school with only one classroom.</span> <span id="s668">The teacher always divided the blackboard into various segments and while he lectured to one grade he gave assignment, written assignment to another grade.</span> <span id="s669">In the morning before we started the school we Lutherans had to get up and had to pray with our hands hanging loose by our sides.</span> <span id="s670">The catholics used to pray crossing their hands in this fashion.</span> <span id="s671">And they used to cross themselves where we Lutherans did not.</span> <span id="s672">Because I was living with a Lutheran minister I accompanied him every Sunday to the church in which in conducted the services and I had two tasks in the church.</span> <span id="s673">I was helping an older guy to ring the bells to call in worshipers to services.</span> <span id="s674">That was a great, great challenge, because I was very small and I think there were three bells.</span> <span id="s675">I was never able to master my bell to fall into step with the other two bells the other guy was pulling on because the rope of my bell when it went up, always took me along with it.</span> <span id="s676">I was not heavy enough to bring the rope down again, so I was jumping from one side to another.</span> <span id="s677">Then, because the village didn't have electricity, but the church had an organ, our school master played the organ, but somebody had to keep pumping the organ.</span> <span id="s678">So, again I took place among the other volunteers to pump the organ.</span> <span id="s679">And again, I was very small and light in weight to pump the organ so that the sound of it did not diminish.</span> <span id="s680">So, these were some of the challenges I was faced with.</span> <span id="s681">Also, on one or two occasions, the farm help took me to pasture to guard the cows and once or twice the cow escaped from me and I had great difficulty finding the cow while he was taking a nap I had to gather the cow.</span> <span id="s682">But all in all, I think that one year that I was in that village was probably the most pleasant time during all those years of war that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q. Even though you were separated from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A. Even though I was separated from my parents and my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q.</span> <span id="s686">Did you have to memorize prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A.</span> <span id="s688">There was always only one prayer in the morning which I still think I vaguely remember something like "Dear Father, give us our daily bread and forgive all our sins, like we forgive our sinners," something of that nature.</span> <span id="s689">It was not very long.</span> <span id="s690">Something came back to me, while I went to school in the ____________ in the first grade for the short time I was permitted to attend we were learning to recite the alphabet and at that time the Czech alphabet has h and after h comes a combination of C and H which is pronounced ________ and when we came to that it was pronounced _______ _________.</span> <span id="s691">In as much as the president of the ____________ was a fellow named _______ _________, we had to stand up for that split of a second when we recited the alphabet.</span> <span id="s692">But going back to Slovakia, the prayer was always one in the same.</span> <span id="s693">For appearances sake, I also went to Sunday school where we learned the theory of Lutheran religion.</span> <span id="s694">Inasmuch as I never was deeply involved in Jewish religion, it was quite pleasant, relaxing to learn about Lutheran religion.</span> <span id="s695">There was not a trace of animosity in it.</span> <span id="s696">The religion was not used in that particular village to antagonize anyone.</span> <span id="s697">It was just there to serve the people and to unite them under the umbrella of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q. Was there anything particularly striking about the sermon that Father ___________gave when you had gone to that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A. No, because number one it was a very large church.</span> <span id="s700">The church was a catholic church.</span> <span id="s701">It had very good attendance.</span> <span id="s702">I suspect that had Father ____________ not been a fascist, probably fewer people would have attended his services.</span> <span id="s703">The only striking thing about it was the church was very well guarded by armed tanks while he was giving the service.</span> <span id="s704">But when he came out, he looked very benign, very meek kind of fellow that probably wouldn't be able to kill even a fly.</span> <span id="s705">I do not believe that he made any everlasting impression on anybody.</span> <span id="s706">He of course was a hypocrite of first grade and as far as I know, he was the only priest that ever ended up on the end of a rope.</span> <span id="s707">After the war he was hung, which he deserved.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q.</span> <span id="s709">You didn't feel particularly strange or uncomfortable being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A. No, it was something new, something never experienced before.</span> <span id="s711">It was curiosity that probably drove me there more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q. So, you went back to the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q. Can you just -- you told me a little bit about your life during that time, but what physically was this place like because you were there quite a while it seems on and off in this bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A.</span> <span id="s716">It was a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s717">In one corner a small stove and the long side a platform made of logs from fallen trees and on top of the logs was straw covered with a blanket and you have to visualize, we were -- our feet were facing each other.</span> <span id="s718">On one side grandmother with grandfather and on the other side my father, my mother and myself and we were touching with feet our grandparents.</span> <span id="s719">The bunker had a couple steps, I don't remember, three or four, and there was a make believe sort of a door that was blocking it so that it was always semi-dark in the bunker.</span> <span id="s720">When somebody had to go out, he had to go a couple yards from the bunker and relieve himself.</span> <span id="s721">So, before we went out, we always checked the weather and we tried to go out when it was either snowing or raining so to hide.</span> <span id="s722">There were wild, wild animals in the forest.</span> <span id="s723">We got a couple visits from deer.</span> <span id="s724">I think on one occasion I encountered a wild boar, but I think the boar was more afraid of me than I was of him, because he ran away but scared me.</span> <span id="s725">On one occasion I remember that it was snowing heavily and the farmer was unable to reach us with supplies.</span> <span id="s726">We were already starved almost close to death.</span> <span id="s727">My parents sent me to find out why the farmer wasn't coming.</span> <span id="s728">So in the deep snow I was walking to the farmer's house, and I came upon a clearance in the forest, and as I came upon the clearance I heard the sound of airplanes.</span> <span id="s729">All of a sudden it stopped snowing.</span> <span id="s730">The clouds parted and brilliant sun was shining and I looked up skyward and I saw allied airplanes either going on a raid or coming back from a raid because the airplanes were glistening in the sun leaving a vapor trail and throwing small cuttings of aluminum foil.</span> <span id="s731">Allied planes always threw it to confuse German radar.</span> <span id="s732">But all of a sudden I heard a terrible noise and in the distance I saw a cow.</span> <span id="s733">I don't know, the cow was not attended.</span> <span id="s734">Some farmer may have let her to feed herself, and then I heard a tremendous explosion.</span> <span id="s735">What has happened?</span> <span id="s736">One of the airplanes, an empty gas tank and that gas tank hit the cow and killed her on the spot.</span> <span id="s737">That didn't happen very far away from me.</span> <span id="s738">I could have been killed instead of the cow.</span> <span id="s739">I reached the farmer and the farmer explained that not only heavy snow but also illness of his wife prevented us from supplying us, but he gave us some food supplies and he accompanied back to the bunker and brought us some supplies of food so we were saved once again from starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q.</span> <span id="s741">What kind of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A.</span> <span id="s743">We were talking about bread, potatoes, bacon, but all that had to eat very slowly and with great restrain because when you are not having food regularly over eating can kill you.</span> <span id="s744">Cheese, milk and he even brought us some bandages and that was one time when really we were in danger of starving to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q.</span> <span id="s746">When you saw the allied planes, did that give you hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A. No.</span> <span id="s748">Number one the planes were very, very high.</span> <span id="s749">Then, I was not quiet certain whether they are allied planes or not.</span> <span id="s750">One plane made me to believe that it was not German because of its configuration, and I think many, many later I looked it up and I think it was a P-38 airplane that has a duel fuselage and that was a fighter which usually accommodated fuel for the bombers as an escort.</span> <span id="s751">At that time it was always our wishful thinking why can't they land and take us on board, but that was wishful thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q.</span> <span id="s753">When you were wishing did you think that you would get through this, that it would all be over with soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A. Well, at that time, when we saw the allied airplanes we began to sense that the end cannot be far away because the airplanes flew unopposed from the Germans.</span> <span id="s755">I had never experienced any bombing raids, but it seemed to me that when Germany is not opposing the allied planes that in all likelihood they don't have enough planes to do anything about it to begin with.</span> <span id="s756">So, we thought that the end cannot be too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q.</span> <span id="s758">What other difficulties, or what were the greatest difficulties you had in hiding?</span> <span id="s759">Anything that you haven't mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A. Only the constant fear of getting caught.</span> <span id="s761">The constant fear of getting caught.</span> <span id="s762">That was the main, main issue item on our minds.</span> <span id="s763">When finally the war ends, that was the second item.</span> <span id="s764">Additional difficulty, not knowing whether the information we get is truthful.</span> <span id="s765">What does it mean.</span> <span id="s766">The people who were listening to the news kept always telling us which town fell into either Russian hands or allied hands, so we were always trying to figure out how many miles left before they reached us.</span> <span id="s767">Then came the disappointing news that the Germans counterattacked and reconquered the town that they had lost a week earlier.</span> <span id="s768">Or the news came that either the Russians or the allies suddenly stopped, stalled, not advancing fast enough.</span> <span id="s769">Then the question on our minds was what will the Germans do when once they begin to retreat.</span> <span id="s770">Will they scorch everything while retreating.</span> <span id="s771">What route will they take when they do retreat.</span> <span id="s772">Many, many thing, the majority of them I probably forgot already but these are some of the points that come to my mind today.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q.</span> <span id="s774">Did you know anything about the camps at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q.</span> <span id="s777">Did you know anything about the Slovak National uprising in the summer of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s779">Yes, we knew about that because when the uprising failed the partisans who participated dispersed through the mountains and some small units from it came to us with their injured.</span> <span id="s780">I should perhaps mention that my father voluntarily worked for one year in a Slovak concentration camp as a dental doctor.</span> <span id="s781">I never found out how it came all about.</span> <span id="s782">Somebody arranged for him to work as a dentist.</span> <span id="s783">The name of the camp was Wilno.</span> <span id="s784">It is on the Slovak map of camps.</span> <span id="s785">He must have made arrangement with the commandant of the camp that he will voluntarily work there for one year and that at the end of the year he was let go.</span> <span id="s786">He was not part of the prisons that inhabited the camp, but I was never able to find out all the details about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q. So, at that time he was not living with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A.</span> <span id="s789">At that time he was not with us in hiding.</span> <span id="s790">He joined us when the year expired, and strangely enough, I do not know whether the Germans knew about it, because they never made claim upon him.</span> <span id="s791">But again, from what I understand, the Germans lost interest in us not long after we disappeared because they had other worries than one Jewish family.</span> <span id="s792">Furthermore, there is an interesting point which probably very few people know or are aware of.</span> <span id="s793">The Germans shipped from Slovakia the Jews to concentration camps but the Slovaks had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s794">The Germans didn't do it for the Slovaks free of charge.</span> <span id="s795">So, therefore, the Slovaks on one hand yes, we want to get rid of the Jews but on the other hand we don't have money to pay you Germans for the shipments of Jews.</span> <span id="s796">I have some place at home a balance sheet of how much each Jew cost the Slovak government in money for his shipment to Auschwitz or wherever he went.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q. Was there a sense of isolation?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A. Yes, that was -- we felt very, very badly, the loneliness, the isolation from the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s799">Always the shining star was that one day the war will end and things will be back to normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q. Do you have clear memories of any of your rescuers, any of the farmers that helped you or housed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A. Only of one, because simply I have his photo at home.</span> <span id="s802">My sister sent it to me.</span> <span id="s803">He was probably the most decent fellow under the sun.</span> <span id="s804">His name was ______________, very simple farmer.</span> <span id="s805">I'm not certain he knew how to read or write.</span> <span id="s806">He had a very, very small farm, but you have to look with a magnifying glass to find a more decent person than he and his wife were.</span> <span id="s807">That was a couple who practiced everything that was written in the Bible from A-Z, everything.</span> <span id="s808">At that time, he was already in his sixties.</span> <span id="s809">He died a natural death.</span> <span id="s810">That unfortunately, when the war ended and I left for my trip to Israel.</span> <span id="s811">I left in 1949.</span> <span id="s812">I came back the first time for a visit in 1965.</span> <span id="s813">Most of the people who helped us during the war were dead already.</span> <span id="s814">Additionally those people who helped Jews during the second world war were not looked upon very favorably by the communist government for reasons that I don't quite understand but that's how things took turn later on after the war had ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q.</span> <span id="s816">How were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A. Oh, about a week before we actually were liberated the farmer came very excited that the Russian front is very nearby and we actually heard artillery nearby and he said that it's a question of days or weeks before the whole front will collapse.</span> <span id="s818">Two days later he came and said yes, I think it's safe for you to leave the bunker and you can join me and we will go to my farm and we went straight to the attic, because we were not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s819">I remember that wall of the attic that did not contain the hay had breaks in the wooden panels and I was looking outside and I saw soldiers fleeing, German soldiers fleeing.</span> <span id="s820">While running they took off their jackets, their trousers.</span> <span id="s821">Many times running only in their underwear, and then suddenly there was silence.</span> <span id="s822">The farmer came up and said it's all over, you can come down.</span> <span id="s823">We came down we stayed for another day or two.</span> <span id="s824">I think that was the first time I took a bath.</span> <span id="s825">So did my parents after many years.</span> <span id="s826">My father shaved for the first time.</span> <span id="s827">We threw away our clothes and got new ones and we went to the closest town which was already liberated.</span> <span id="s828">But the town was not liberated by the Russians, it was liberated by Rumanian units because about a year before the second world war ended the Rumanians switched sides and joined the Russians.</span> <span id="s829">My parents deposited me in an orphanage home run by catholic nuns while they went to _____________ to see what happened to our house and grandparents went back to _______________ to see what happened to their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q. Do you remember the date of your liberation and the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A.</span> <span id="s832">The name of the town was ______________.</span> <span id="s833">It must have been in May of '45.</span> <span id="s834">I stayed in that orphanage for about two or three days until my parents came back to fetch me and took me back to _______________.</span> <span id="s835">We got the house back and they arranged for me private lessons with a school teacher because it was hoped and assumed that in September I would start a regular school year.</span> <span id="s836">So, I spent the whole summer trying to catch up what I missed for the past five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q.</span> <span id="s838">You were just given the house back?</span> <span id="s839">It was that easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A. Well, it was not easy.</span> <span id="s841">We had to sue, but the police evicted the people who were in the house and said that should they win the case they will be permitted to reenter the house, but in the mean time we have the first right to our own house.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q.</span> <span id="s843">When you returned was there a general feeling of welcome?</span> <span id="s844">How did the local people accept you?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A. Well, the neighbors where my mother hid so many of our possessions claimed that nothing of it survived, that the Russians stole everything from them, which generally the population claimed whenever Jewish property was given to them for safe keeping, they claimed that the Russians took it.</span> <span id="s846">The Russians were thieves, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s847">When they saw an opportunity to steal something they did it.</span> <span id="s848">But they didn't do it wholesale, they did it sporadically here and there.</span> <span id="s849">In Germany they did it wholesale, but in Czechoslovakia they didn't do it on a whole sale scale.</span> <span id="s850">So, it was an excuse and many Christians enriched themselves with Jewish property.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q.</span> <span id="s852">In general how did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A.</span> <span id="s854">Many people came an openly apologized for not having talked to us during the war when the law said that Christians cannot speak to Jews and Jews cannot speak to Christians.</span> <span id="s855">Many store owners who had these signs, Jews not welcome, didn't know what to say so it was a very sort of an ambivalent situation.</span> <span id="s856">There were some Christians who openly said we are very sorry that Hitler didn't kill all of you.</span> <span id="s857">It is difficult to generalize.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q.</span> <span id="s859">What did it feel like going back to this atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A. I think that our initial feelings were okay.</span> <span id="s861">Nobody now shoots at us.</span> <span id="s862">We can eat.</span> <span id="s863">We can sleep in our own beds.</span> <span id="s864">We can start living or go back to normal life.</span> <span id="s865">I think it was a tremendous sense of relief.</span> <span id="s866">I do not believe that anyone that survived this holocaust had any desire for revenge at least not from those people who survived the war in the form in which we survived it.</span> <span id="s867">Now, I cannot speak on behalf of those in a concentration camp, but we had personal beef against that unit that participated in raping my mother.</span> <span id="s868">We went to the trial and were called as witnesses against the Slovak members of that unit.</span> <span id="s869">The German soldiers, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s870">They went back to Germany, but the Slovaks were caught, because they participated in other atrocities, and each member of the Slovak party got the rope.</span> <span id="s871">That was some satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q. Any uneasiness when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A. Well, uneasiness we did not know exactly how the future will evolve.</span> <span id="s874">There were of course trials.</span> <span id="s875">There were many Czechs who occupied high positions in the nazi government, but to what extent they influenced actually our departure of the transports, it was hard to ascertain.</span> <span id="s876">Because the atrocities were usually committed by the small guys, the big guys up in the hierarchy, they just signed the documents giving the order, but the actual killing was committed by the little guys with the rifles, the bayonets.</span> <span id="s877">So, you are wondering how do you divide the guilt.</span> <span id="s878">Is that guy with the pen guiltier than the guy with bayonet.</span> <span id="s879">I don't know, I'm not God.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q. So, did you continue on?</span> <span id="s881">Did you go to school in the fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s883">I went to school.</span> <span id="s884">My father got replacement for his dental practice but in a different town.</span> <span id="s885">We sold the house in ______________ and we moved to a different town where my father opened a dental practice.</span> <span id="s886">I kept going to school.</span> <span id="s887">I finished the required number of years of schooling by the Czech law, but then another disaster struck.</span> <span id="s888">The communists came, 1948.</span> <span id="s889">Somewhere and that now comes history into play, Truman Churchill and Stalin divided Europe and decided that Czechoslovakia will be under the Soviets influence, and the Czech government agreed.</span> <span id="s890">There again were traders that sold out the democratic government, the communist government, which was in exile.</span> <span id="s891">There were two Czech governments in exile.</span> <span id="s892">One in London, which came back and was governing until 1948 and there was a lessor government in Moscow that also came back and was undermining the democratic government and succeeded overthrowing the democracy in 1948 and took away its power and came to existence as the communist government of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s893">We Jews who survived always thought about the Soviet and Russian pogroms under the Czars and we were afraid once Russian come to Czechoslovakia once again the anti-semitism for which the Poles and the Soviets are so very well known that there will be another Holocaust.</span> <span id="s894">So, the majority of Jews, I among them, emigrated to Israel which in 1948, in May became a nation.</span> <span id="s895">My parents never accompanied me to Israel because the Czech government, again even under the communist realized that too many doctors are leaving and they considered doctors to be of great importance to the national economy and my father was caught in it and not permitted to accompany me to Israel, and I never saw my parents again.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q.</span> <span id="s897">They lived out their life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A. My mother committed suicide in 1953 and my father died of natural death in 1962 or 1963.</span> <span id="s899">I came for my first visit in 1965 back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s900">I left Israel in 1959 and came to the U.S. so in 1965 I finally had enough money to afford a trip back to Czechoslovakia, but by then my father was dead already.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q. I know that this is a difficult thing to speculate on, but do you think that your mother's death was very much affected by these war time experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A. No doubt about it.</span> <span id="s903">No doubt.</span> <span id="s904">As a matter of fact I have proof and I'm in the middle of a fight with the Czech government about it.</span> <span id="s905">We were helped during our hiding years by two Czech fellows.</span> <span id="s906">These two fellows after liberation of Czechoslovakia joined an organization called American Czechoslovakia Friendship Club.</span> <span id="s907">When the communists took over Czechoslovakia, they became possession of membership lists of this club and they arrested all the members on the list.</span> <span id="s908">These two fellows, somebody alerted them to the fact that they will be arrested and because we lived not too far away from the Austrian border, they came to us trying to cash on their favor they did for us and my mother tried to arrange for the two of them an escape to Austria.</span> <span id="s909">Somebody revealed that plan to communist police and they arrested my mother.</span> <span id="s910">And they tortured her.</span> <span id="s911">So, under nazis she was raped and under communists she was tortured.</span> <span id="s912">On one occasion while at the police station, she jumped from a window and committed suicide.</span> <span id="s913">I have her death certificate issued by the Czech government but they are not willing to admit that she committed suicide because of the torture by the communist police.</span> <span id="s914">That I cannot forgive them.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q.</span> <span id="s916">This must have been hard on your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A. Yes, but I was never able to talk to him about it because when I came he was already dead some two or three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q.</span> <span id="s919">You weren't able to correspond with him while you were in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A. Yes, we did but you have to understand that correspondence was censored.</span> <span id="s921">You never knew what to write whether that which you are writing will not be detrimental to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q. Now, the grandparents, you left behind, did you ever see them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A.</span> <span id="s924">You mean my grandfather and grandmother who were with us in bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A. Oh, my grandmother, she went with a transport and I do not know exactly whether she died in ____________ or in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s927">That transport, the _______________ had 900 people went with the transport.</span> <span id="s928">I think 26 came back.</span> <span id="s929">There were in Czechoslovakia I think about 270,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s930">After those that came back and went to Israel, Czechoslovakia was left with about 12,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q.</span> <span id="s932">What happened to your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A. My sister survived the war under the false papers.</span> <span id="s934">She came back.</span> <span id="s935">She joined us, but she never from that point on, was living as part of the family.</span> <span id="s936">I think the years that she was living under the false papers as a secretary gave her a feeling of independence and after a few weeks of living with us, she left and lived always in different towns completely independent.</span> <span id="s937">She worked as a secretary.</span> <span id="s938">She had great aptitude for foreign languages.</span> <span id="s939">I think she also for a time a teacher in a _________ school of languages.</span> <span id="s940">She knew extremely well German.</span> <span id="s941">Later on she got married and had children of her own.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q.</span> <span id="s943">As a Christian or a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A.</span> <span id="s945">She married a Christian and I think that she raised her daughters without any religious affiliation.</span> <span id="s946">She still lives in ________________.</span> <span id="s947">One of her daughters unfortunately was killed in a freak accident.</span> <span id="s948">She was a school teacher.</span> <span id="s949">The other daughter lives I think at the present time in the capital of the Czech republic in Prague and I think she works in a hotel as a receptionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q.</span> <span id="s951">How difficult was it for you to rebuild your life in Israel and in the United States?</span> <span id="s952">Was it easy to sort of start all over on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A. Well, I think that each country provided me with different challenges.</span> <span id="s954">I don't think you can put them under one umbrella.</span> <span id="s955">The Israeli experience I think was the harder one of the two because I was much younger.</span> <span id="s956">I was only 17 when I came to Israel.</span> <span id="s957">About a half a year after coming to Israel, I was already in the Israeli military.</span> <span id="s958">It was a newly established state which still had many, many problems with their neighbors.</span> <span id="s959">First of all, in Israel, I was completely on my own.</span> <span id="s960">There is absolutely no resemblance of the Hebrew language to the Czech language, so the Israeli experience was much harder than the American experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q. Were you lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A.</span> <span id="s963">In Israel?</span> <span id="s964">Very lonely.</span> <span id="s965">Very lonely, because in Israel, unfortunately we were always told of the harrows under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s966">The Israeli government was hoping to keep all the emigrants there by reminding them that only in unity is there strength.</span> <span id="s967">And that is one of the reasons why I never liked Israel because I always felt that the wound of the holocaust will never heal if you will be continuously reminded of it every day and every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q.</span> <span id="s971">You stayed in Israel until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A. 1959.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q.</span> <span id="s974">Why did you decide to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A. Well, those relatives that I had in Israel they were number one, very distant relatives.</span> <span id="s976">They all had families of their own.</span> <span id="s977">Israel was a new country which at that time was in a constant danger from its neighbors.</span> <span id="s978">Israel every day another group of emigrants came to Israel.</span> <span id="s979">There was a great deal of unemployment and I was there as a seventeen year old boy when I came.</span> <span id="s980">I was barely 20 when I exited the Israeli army, when I was discharged from the military obligation.</span> <span id="s981">I didn't have any schooling.</span> <span id="s982">I didn't have any skill and under conditions that existed at that time in Israel and my non existing support from relatives I was unable to learn any skill.</span> <span id="s983">Furthermore, the Israeli economy was very hard to figure out.</span> <span id="s984">You never knew what would be worthwhile studying or learning because of the influx of immigrants.</span> <span id="s985">Furthermore, the political line that Israel in those days pursued didn't give me any hope that one day there will be peace with the neighboring countries.</span> <span id="s986">Additionally, every year I was at least two or three times called to serve in the military reserves.</span> <span id="s987">Inflation was tremendous.</span> <span id="s988">I was always on the edge of subsistence and I didn't see any future for myself in Israel.</span> <span id="s989">So, I contacted my grandfather who saved us from the holocaust and he once again put his machinery into work.</span> <span id="s990">Alerted the Israeli relatives who were dispersed through the war, whether one of them could help.</span> <span id="s991">For a long time I was led to believe that it will be my uncle who will be in the best position to help me.</span> <span id="s992">My father's brother who did not participate in the holocaust.</span> <span id="s993">My father's brother was a very wealthy textile merchant in Czechoslovakia who used to travel every year for his vacation to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s994">When the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia he was in Switzerland, so he never came back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s995">He lost most of his fortune, because the nazis confiscated and closed all the Jewish accounts, but he was still left with a comfortable amount of money in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s996">But the Swiss made clear to him that he cannot remain and he purchased from someone an entrance visa to Canada.</span> <span id="s997">While on boat to Canada it was discovered that the Canadian visa was forgery and instead of landing in Canada he ended in the U.S.</span> <span id="s998">That is also something that he never wanted to reveal to me how he did it.</span> <span id="s999">But, elaborating on something which I did not cover earlier, there were people who already with the rise of Hitler sensed that the catastrophe facing Europe and left Europe in time.</span> <span id="s1000">There were others who waited until the last minute and who in one way or another succeeded leaving Europe.</span> <span id="s1001">I have relatives who for example found a safe haven in Shanghai having been occupied by Japanese.</span> <span id="s1002">But the Japanese by far didn't match the brutality of the Germans visa vie the Jews, and the emigrated after the war to Australia.</span> <span id="s1003">My uncle emigrated to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1004">Other distant relatives emigrated to Palatine.</span> <span id="s1005">So, my grandfather manufactured for me exit from Israel either to Australia or to the United States, but my uncle, for reasons of his own, never sent me the required documents.</span> <span id="s1006">Those day, there was a crucial document for coming to U.S. called Affidavit of Support.</span> <span id="s1007">That I finally obtained from much more distant relatives in the United States and I was able to come in 1959 after having to wait five years for the entrance to come.</span> <span id="s1008">The United States had a quota system.</span> <span id="s1009">I don't know whether they still have it, and Czechoslovakia having been a very small country has a very small quota system, so the wait was very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q.</span> <span id="s1011">When you first got there, what were your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A. Number one, because I came from Israel that despite its small size, Israel is a democracy, many tourists from United States are visiting Israel, so I was very, very informed as to what I can expect to find in the U.S.</span> <span id="s1013">Once I was able to overcome the disappointment that it was not my uncle who sent me the Affidavit, I was able to take off almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1014">I landed in New York.</span> <span id="s1015">I was living in a rooming house.</span> <span id="s1016">I found employment as a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s1017">I started going to night school.</span> <span id="s1018">I was finally able to finish evening high school.</span> <span id="s1019">I enrolled in a college.</span> <span id="s1020">I paid for it from my own pocket.</span> <span id="s1021">I finished that in ten years.</span> <span id="s1022">I joined the U.S. Secret Service, which paid for my master's degree.</span> <span id="s1023">After I got my B.S. I went back to Czechoslovakia and married my sweetheart and brought her over here.</span> <span id="s1024">I was fine once I came to the U.S.</span> <span id="s1025">When compared to Israel or Czechoslovakia it was a cinch.</span> <span id="s1026">The labor, the investment was visible immediately here in the U.S. if you are willing to work, there is no limit how high you can go.</span> <span id="s1027">Absolutely no impediment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q.</span> <span id="s1029">You were pretty resilient?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A. I think the nazis had something to do with that.</span> <span id="s1031">I think that I personally find in U.S. everything I was seeking.</span> <span id="s1032">Let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s1033">It's a love and hate relationship.</span> <span id="s1034">It depends on what you read in the newspapers, how many murders we have.</span> <span id="s1035">There are many aspects of life in the U.S. that are not very nice, but when you put everything on a scale, I think that there is no other country that comes even close to the United States in its opportunities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q.</span> <span id="s1037">What did all the experience -- did it impact your sense of being Jewish or sense of being religious at all, or the fact that you were hidden by Christians make you think differently about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A.</span> <span id="s1039">You know something, people always ask me do you think Judaism is a religion or is it a race.</span> <span id="s1040">I'm not certain.</span> <span id="s1041">It depends where, when and under what conditions.</span> <span id="s1042">The Germans considered it a race.</span> <span id="s1043">In Israel I think it's considered a nationality because you would be surprised when I came to Israel how very, very few Jews ever attended synagogue.</span> <span id="s1044">The feeling there in those days was that now that I am among my own people, why should I go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s1045">The children in Israeli schools learned about the old testament, not from a religious point of view but from a historical point of view because it's Jewish history.</span> <span id="s1046">Yes, I think that the feeling of Judaism which I have has been instilled on me by wearing the Jewish yellow star.</span> <span id="s1047">By the years of reading the signs, Jews, to entry is forbidden.</span> <span id="s1048">By being called Christ killer, these are the things that make me aware of my Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q. Stigmatized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A. Stigmatized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q. Do you feel any of the positive or spiritual aspects of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A. No.</span> <span id="s1053">I still keep looking over my shoulders and try to remain inconspicuous as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q.</span> <span id="s1055">So that's an obvious statement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A. Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1057">You know, occasionally I do meet people who went through the same thing that I did, but those people who experienced it at a later stage in their lives, it seems to me were able to better cope with it than I.</span> <span id="s1058">It didn't seem to have left such an everlasting impression.</span> <span id="s1059">At least the first part of their lives was normal.</span> <span id="s1060">In the middle of it they had a break, a bad break, but because they were older when it happened to them, maybe they were able to figure it out in a more sensible form than I was.</span> <span id="s1061">I experienced that it became part of my growing up, part of my childhood and definitely the nazi era has changed my life from A to Z. I have no doubt that millions of other people have the same problem.</span> <span id="s1062">Many of us immigrants wouldn't be here in the United States had it not been for the holocaust.</span> <span id="s1063">I don't know whether the state of Israel would exist today had it not been for the holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q. Let me talk to you a little bit more about how it has this impact on you, how it has affected who you are today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A. Number one, if I can retrace my step and draw a line number one I would have had regular schooling that every child has.</span> <span id="s1066">I would have been able to judging by the fact that my father was a very well known dentist, I grew up in a middle class family, upper middle class family, I probably would have been in able to have a professional background in the Czech society.</span> <span id="s1067">Probably instead of going to night school I would have been going to a regular school, and I would have achieved self actualization stage at a much earlier age.</span> <span id="s1068">I would not have been forced to learn two foreign languages.</span> <span id="s1069">Had I learned foreign languages, it would have been because I wanted to learn them and not because I needed to make livelihood under their umbrella.</span> <span id="s1070">It's pure speculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q.</span> <span id="s1072">What about emotional or behavioral scars, have you thought about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1074">I do get very easily intimidated, very easily.</span> <span id="s1075">I always seem to be looking for excuses.</span> <span id="s1076">I'd rather switch than fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q. Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A. Because I'm afraid to confront an unpleasant situation head on.</span> <span id="s1079">I would never be able to occupy a position like Ralph Nadar.</span> <span id="s1080">He always confronts head on every situation.</span> <span id="s1081">I would make a very bad politician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q.</span> <span id="s1083">How do you think that seeing what your mother went through affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A. I cannot clarify it entirely because when I left Czechoslovakia it only began.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q. I'm talking about her attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A. Oh, you mean when she was raped.</span> <span id="s1087">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1088">I cannot isolate that instance and take it out from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1089">I don't know how I would feel had it not taken place.</span> <span id="s1090">I also cannot speculate that the raiding party caught us on the way back to the barracks rather than on their way out, and had they taken us with them.</span> <span id="s1091">There are many, many things left to speculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q. Are there certain other images that stick with you that you dream about at night that you have never lost sight of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1094">One image of that light coming from that guard house when we were crossing the border to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1095">The noise of the dogs barking and the singing of the German soldiers that keeps coming back and back and back again.</span> <span id="s1096">I don't know because it's relatively benign, but I still see that window.</span> <span id="s1097">They had electricity in that hut.</span> <span id="s1098">They didn't have any curtain.</span> <span id="s1099">The light must have been visible for miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q.</span> <span id="s1101">What do you think got you through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A. Luck and please don't ask me to define luck, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1103">If you want to be more realistic and not satisfy it with a phrase luck, I think that it was our grandfather who got us through it.</span> <span id="s1104">Without him, never.</span> <span id="s1105">We would have never been able to survive.</span> <span id="s1106">But once that whole move was put into motion, the whole thing was luck nothing more and nothing less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q. Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A. Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q. Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A. My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A. (Viewing pictures) Now, you are seeing a star which every Jew throughout ________________ had to wear over his heart.</span> <span id="s1112">It was against laws to have it obscured in any fashion and the problem was that it had to be sewn on.</span> <span id="s1113">You could not use any temporary attachment of the star to your jacket or to your shirt.</span> <span id="s1114">You were responsible always for having the star visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q.</span> <span id="s1116">How did it make you feel wearing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A. Well, have you read Harthorwn's Scarlet Letter?</span> <span id="s1118">Like you are branded like cattle.</span> <span id="s1119">What you see here are two passports of my now deceased relatives who exited Austria in 1939.</span> <span id="s1120">At that time Austria was already under German occupation and it was considered part of Germany and as you can see the German passports were especially stamped with the letter J to alert the examiner of this passport that this holder is Jew.</span> <span id="s1121">Women had inserted after their first name, middle name Sarah, to fortify the fact that she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s1122">As you can see, the photos all are stamped by Nazi stamp with the usual swastika and obtaining such a passport in 1939 was extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s1123">There are many phases to these which are somewhat obscure because in some cases the Germans permitted Jews to exit Europe but later they stopped it completely.</span> <span id="s1124">What divided that line of thinking is not even very clear to historians and there are still many debates about it.</span> <span id="s1125">Here you see a photo of me with my mother and father and it was taken in 1933 in ________________.</span> <span id="s1126">At that time still unoccupied Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1127">Here you see on this photo my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1128">The photo was taken in ________________, here I am probably four years of age.</span> <span id="s1129">This is my grandfather's dog.</span> <span id="s1130">I remember his name was ______________ and I am also with my sister.</span> <span id="s1131">In all likelihood we are there on vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q. And this is the grandfather who saved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A. Yes, who saved our lives, yes.</span> <span id="s1134">This picture shows me in the Israeli military and was taken in all likelihood in 1951.</span> <span id="s1135">That of course was taken in ____________ Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
